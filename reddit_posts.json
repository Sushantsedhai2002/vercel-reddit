            "body": "Let’s imagine a scenario: RSP becomes the largest party — but without a majority. NC becomes the second largest. UML becomes the third largest. To form a government, RSP approaches Nepali Congress for support. Congress responds: “We are the second largest party. If you can’t form the government, we are next in line. Until then, we’ll sit in opposition. Last time the first and second largest parties teamed up and created chaos. We won’t repeat that.” So RSP goes to UML. UML says: “You spent the entire campaign attacking us and calling us corrupt and outdated. Not interested.” Now RSP is left negotiating with smaller parties. Prachanda says he’ll support — but only if he gets the level of power he demands. A fragile coalition is formed. A few months pass. Instability begins. Internal bargaining. Public frustration grows. Meanwhile, NC projects itself as the mature, stable alternative — the party that can “sabailai samhalera lana sakne.” UML and smaller parties decide to back NC instead. A new coalition forms. NC leads the government. RSP — despite being the largest party — ends up in opposition. We’ve already seen that being the largest party doesn’t guarantee government formation. NC didn’t get to govern last time despite being first. Coalition arithmetic matters more than moral victory. Now consider another scenario: NC becomes the largest party. RSP becomes second. First and third — plus smaller parties — form the government. RSP again remains in opposition. Either way, unless RSP bags an outright majority, it will struggle to form a stable government if it continues a hostile, arrogant campaign strategy that alienates potential allies. In coalition politics, numbers matter — but relationships matter more. Lesson? Either secure a clear majority… Or stay politically polite. Because in the end, in a parliamentary system, cooperation often beats confrontation. Via KMAG",

            "comments": "It’s the people my friend. A big part of Nepal’s cricket craze comes from long exposure to Indian cricket — generations grew up watching it, so the fan culture was already there. Over time Nepal started getting international opportunities, and players like Paras Khadka gave the team identity and belief.  Then domestic leagues, better infrastructure, and more organized promotion by CAN helped cricket reach everyday people. Combine national pride with passionate fans, and it snowballed into the crazy support you see today. Football is still huge, but cricket built its own momentum step by step.|||It is cuz  of  Indians  influence .   many people watch ipl ,world cup live here .  that's it.  |||Paras Khadka was big big name back in 2010s. Those who knew absolutely nothing about cricket even used to know the name of Paras Khadka. |||It is same as theater economy in Nepal.  India covers entertainment and sports.|||We watch cricket for the love of the game and honestly, it's the only positive thing in our country at this moment. We are not big on celebrity worshipping.|||In early days ,Kings from nepal used to visit places around the world(ofc india too). Since ,Britishers were everywhere in the world ,the kings loved their sport and started playing after returning in nepal .So ,it was then played by the high class people only.  Since then ,the game was popularized and played around the country by common people as well  The main catalyst would be the participation of nepal in 2014 wc and winning over afghanistan.  Since,internet wasn't common back then and not everyone had the access to TVs ,people used to gather in huge numbers in a field where match screening was done .(You can search for them)  Since then ,there have been multiple ups and downs in Nepali cricket Until Paras Khakda,one of the key players of 2014 match was assigned a key role in cricket association of nepal .Since then introduction of NPL was a absolute gamechanger for us pulling a massive crowd every match.  Hope it helped.  |||Patriotism or I feel so proud watching my country play in the international platform representing our country idk|||2014 world cup effect I think|||Both football and cricket were popular in Nepal. With relatively more success and recognition in cricket at international stage, we got more involved in cricket. We might not have internationally recognized players in the past but we had some idols like Mehboob Alam, Shakti Gauchan, Paras Khadka who were big names nationally, Paras Khadka  and there is Sandeep Lamichhane who received relative global success which attracted many more youth to cricket.|||We WIN.  That is why. It gives people something to enjoy. Of course there is an effort from previous players and influence from Indian cricket. But, at the end of the day we WIN games.   I bet there are lots of football fans, I was surprised how many people support a team in La Liga or the Premier League. But those people rarely watch any Nepali football games because we don't win.|||Because its the only thing that gives happiness and sense of patriotism to us Nepalese people.|||it is because of passion in both players and the supporters. so many of the previous generation players are in the cricket field. eg. paras khadka is the secretary of the CAN, binod das is the cricket manager, shakti gauchan is one of the former player who is grooming young cricketers in his locality, former players are busy in running cricket academies or coaching in the academies, and the list goes on. yes, many former players have went abroad to look for better future but they are also supporting nepal cricket whenever possible (co-owning various franchise leagues, arranging minor leagues in different parts of the globe).  football is really popular in nepal same like it is in all around the world. only issue with football nowadays is that it is runned and administered by very corrupted officials. they have no interest in developing and decentralizing football. their sole focus is gaining socio-financial benefits while being in the ANFA. i am very hopeful if we get football version of paras khadka in anfa, things will get better sooner than later.  |||Cricket was not that much popular back then it was after Nepal qualified to t20 world cup in 2014  it became mainstream.|||If the game had happened in Delhi, you’d have seen real number of Nepali people attending, Mumbai is just tad difficult to get to from Nepal.|||nepali team win games. qualify for tournaments unlike other sports. sandeep playing in ipl. a competent board plus npl.|||I started watching cricket cause of my brothers and wonder the same|||In late 80s and early 90s, at least in Kathmandu, cricket was not very popular. It was football and you would see that play out in Tundikhel, 365 days a year.  After Ganesh Thapa took the helm of the ANFA, football started going downhill despite $$$$ budget thanks to the systemic corruption, giagantic $$$$ embezzlement, dadagiri/ gundagardi and match fixing.  The increasing popularily of cricket coincides  with the gradual demise of Nepali football.  So the star player in my book is Ganesh Thapa!|||Basically first most of our Neighbours play it so we came to know about it and start playing it, second we started playing better, third T20 and IPL happened.|||Sandeep lamichhane k hora, he was globally recognised 23yo age ma record Banako haina ra tesle?|||[deleted]",

            "body": "I’m 24M and I’ve had a stammer since I was a kid. I don’t usually talk about it much, but honestly it’s affected me more than I like to admit.  It’s not just getting stuck on words. It’s the anxiety before speaking. The overthinking simple sentences. The way my heart starts racing if I have to introduce myself or speak in a group. Sometimes people finish my sentences, sometimes they look awkward, and I just wish I could disappear in that moment.  Over time it’s really hit my confidence. I avoid certain situations. I stay quiet even when I have something to say. It makes me feel socially awkward even when I know I’m not.  I did try speech therapy once at TU Teaching Hospital. But I wasn’t consistent, and going there regularly was kind of a hassle. Eventually I stopped. I still think about what would’ve happened if I had stuck with it.  Now I’m at a point where I’m tired of letting this control me. For adults who’ve dealt with stammering, did speech therapy actually help? Or was it something else? I’d really appreciate hearing real experiences.  I just want to know if it actually gets better.",

Buff Momo and if you want to get more locality varies by location like Taash in Chitwan,  Newari dish with their own mini variation based on which galli you are in.  3. Any Indian food that foreigners in western world consume in Nepali restaurants that’s also available in Indian resturant. A true Nepali restaurant should confuse western or foreigner by having by Indian and Chinese look alike but Nepali variation too not just Chinese like or Indian likes our ancestor incorporated best of both worlds 🥰.  Btw while we use spice we don’t use food as a vehicle to eat spice. Its usage is minimal and we rely on hot oil and sauted garlic, ginger and onion for the flavor depth and add timur in certain food. Our chutney just use salt and lime and let tomatoes, Chillies, and other ingredients shine . Same with veggies. Our lentils are think not overly Thick and barely use spices but is finished with Cumin seed and Feneugreek seed “jhanne” in hot mustard oil at the last minute. Just use ai if you need help with translation.|||1.Dal bhat tarkari. ( thats lentil soup, rice and vegetable that could be potato, bottle gourd, cauliflower.). Eaten twice a day. 7 days a week. Occasionally meat ( chicken, mutton) with gravy maybe twice a week replacing tarkari. They could be adding achar and ghee sometime.  2. Momo. Its dumpling but Nepalese have made momo their own. This is usully ordered outside at eateries big and small.  3. Roti and Tandoori Curries. People may substitute roti for rice occasionally. Masal curries like butter chicken or tandoori masal curries are borrowed from India. Again this is usually odered at restaurant visits.  https://preview.redd.it/guyx0hbjmyig1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bea6558aae150eef5f55e42fab53dffd79efcaf  Dal bhat tarkari. Twice a day. 365 days|||Common and most loved is rice. What you eat with rice differs among culture and places. Some common food items that people eat with rice are chicken curry, any seasonal vegetable, salad (we call achaar), green leafy vegetable like spinach, and lentils. Potatoes are very common in cold places like the mountains. It's also eaten with rice by frying in small pieces.|||1. Dal, bhat, tarkari with achar, and masu is the most eaten food in Nepal. Every Nepali family, rich or poor, eats it daily for breakfast and lunch. Dal means soup of lentils, bhat is rice, achar is pickle, tarkari is vegetables, and masu is meat. There’s even a saying: “Dal bhat power, 24 hour.\"   2. Momo is another famous food, traditional Nepali dumplings, usually filled with buffalo meat or chicken.   3. I don't think there is any but some foreigners may think Nepalese eat yak meat daily because yaks are found in Nepal, but in reality, yak meat is rare and not part of everyday Nepali food.",

            "comments": "Lots of things:  1. People of Nepal were tired of old political parties, people needed something new, something to cling on to. That something became balen.  2. Though Capital City factor plays a part but Balens action before and after becoming Mayor has been pretty against the political structure created by old parties. Think about it: He cleared foothpaths, he livestreamed meetings, he cleared encroached buildings and lands and a lot of activities were done that were against other political parties. That got attention.  3. Now people think that when he has a power like PM, his past action will definitely extrapolate and do positive in the country.  4. Youth like them= youth are active on social media = a lot of sharing = heightened popularity  ( Election is a game of marketing, do not be afraid when one party does it better than others. Election has always been an art of selling the representative to the people and RSP seems to be doing it better than oldies.)|||Balen and Victor(admin of RONB) are besties  Balen(with aid from alottt of people) successfully projected himself as an anti establishment figure   Tei ho main reason for his rapid rise  (Also add  the \"pro madesh\" rhetoric)|||I think this shows that for many Nepalis especially youths Balen has become a symbol of hope and that he can do good things for Nepal if he became PM.. many people see him as non corrupt (which I believe he is) and he has tried to do things in KMC despite being just a independent Mayor.   Downside of course is that Nepal's problems are too complex to be solved by just one person and it can't be solved quickly and Balen needs to tell this to his followers or they will get disappointed very quickly.|||Media narrative and Balen's personal branding.   His association with a popular channel like RONB has helped tremendously in gaining this popularity. Balen himself engages a lot with his bold status, which shows his anger towards the existing parties. Young generation associates his boldness with a hope for change and totally opposite to the current system. Balen jasto (positive) engagement kosaiko chaina aile social media ma. Comments padhera nai thaha huncha.|||In simple: tired and frustrated from old political parties|||In a democratic country, when the people we choose and trust undermine our right to life and freedom of speech, causing disruption and unsatisfaction in every level of our lives and behaving as if they’ve done nothing wrong, people seek a new solution.  It wasn’t Balen who asked people to follow him but the old parties who failed to convince and gain their trust.  Without their failure, Balen, Harkha, Durga Parai, Ashika Tamang and others would never have risen to power.  The old parties created this situation, not Balen himself or any content creators.|||Same thing that was with Prachanda in 2064, With KP Oli in 2074 and Balen shah 2082.|||The current state of our country has left the public with almost no faith in the establishment. We are tired of the 'old guard' making the same empty promises they've failed to keep for decades. At this point trusting them is like waiting for a miracle that never comes. Balen has emerged as a symbol of hope not just because of who he is but because he represents our collective refusal to let the same people fail us again. He is the only one offering a different path and for many of us trusting him is the only choice we have left. It’s not just about Balen anymore it’s about the people's survival. We’ve seen the same leaders promise development for years with nothing to show for it. Continuing to vote for them is a lost cause. Balen stands out because he actually represents change, and in a landscape of failed politics he is the only one the public feels is worth the trust.|||rap, geet gaune haru popular nai hunchan ni...world stage mani testai cha.......balen lai aele chunab ma aaune kunai hatar teyena.....mauka ma chauka haana aako ho....aru ke hoina.....mayor ko karyakaaal nasaki mero jastai aru ko vote ko apaman ho tyo....thulo thulo kura garera....kaam garna deeyen falano diskano banyo basyo.....la alele ta antarim sarkar cha ta kaaaammmm  taaaa masttaa garna dintyoooo taaaa ...kinnaa  chunaab ma homeyeko..power satha ko loov nabaye?????   ....power paincha vanera aako ho nothing else,      aele balen le rsp ya rabi lai matra samartan garya bayeni ...oli lai harauna sakihaltyo.....ani afno karyakal ma baru naya party ya purai agenda , vision like yo yo  garchau hoina ....kasari kun way ma kati smaya m,a garxau vanera purai 5 yeasr ko blue print with proper team ko planning garera arko chunab ma aako baye huntyo.......  tara satha power ko looov ta ho.....mauka ma chauka hanya ho....manche haru lai ni ....oko geet gaune rap hanne le ta oli lai kya bandecha .....kasto khatra banera .......barkar 16, 18 kateka haru pani tesai ramai halchan ...yesto kura ma.....ani ye dekera craze ho ...ani chunab parachr ma niskeko ho RSP ko ni kasai baal chaina balen lai sida kura ho.......pm vann paincha banera matra aako ho jasle prasta parcha ki....ek no ko power ko loov bako manxe ho balen...|||Once upon a time in Ukraine....|||First of all  He was a independent candidate who everyone underestimated but he was able to win hearts of people in a smaller time and he won the mayor race   It was like balen vs all the big political parties of course he will get the media coverage lol  People who thought now there's no hope when balen came he was like the light of hope   He's educated he's smarts he doesn't give fake promises he did his job sincerely while being a mayor even when the higher-ups tried to pull him down   Also he's a singer|||Dumb question.

If this idea is weak, I’d rather know early.**  **APP LINK:** [https://expo.dev/accounts/bibekjoshi01/projects/udharo/builds/677cc274-6ad9-4728-9835-890f41bd3881](https://expo.dev/accounts/bibekjoshi01/projects/udharo/builds/677cc274-6ad9-4728-9835-890f41bd3881)  In Nepal, many small grocery shops (kirana pasal) still write customer credit in a notebook. Customers take items and pay later. Everything is manual. Sometimes pages get lost, totals are wrong, and shopkeepers forget who owes how much.  I noticed a few problems:  * Internet is not reliable everywhere * Many shopkeepers are not comfortable with English apps * Most apps are too complex or require constant internet (Like Karobar very good but high learning curve) * Nepali calendar (Bikram Sambat) is important but not supported in most apps  So I built:  * Offline-first app (works without internet) * Nepali language support * Nepali date (BS calendar) * Very simple UI * Easy setup, no complicated onboarding  Now I’m confused about a few things and I need honest feedback:  1. Is offline-first still important in 2026, or am I overthinking this? 2. Do small shopkeepers actually need an app, or is notebook still “good enough”? 3. Should I add features like WhatsApp reminders to customers or will be not good in society like ours? 4. Is this a real business opportunity or just a small tool? 5. If you were building this, what would you change?  Thanks.  **Marketing Website:** [https://udharo.vercel.app/](https://udharo.vercel.app/)",

I currently use Excel to maintain customer ledgers. An app would help by saving time especially for searching records and automatically summing credits and payments. these totals should update instantly when new data is entered.  3. WhatsApp reminders to customers are not practical, a reminder to me, the seller, would be far more useful.  4. right now, this app isn’t a big business opportunity. It would become valuable if it could help manage working capital better, reduce the risk of cash shortages, and give real time visibility into outstanding credits  5. payment are done through bank transfer , i would add a space to input transaction reference number.   there is app  khatabook, i think you should check it first.

For that budget even if you do get a 4k TV it will either be too small to actually benefit from the 4K resolution or will come with a basic feature set unlike top tier TV brands.   The cheapest you can get is maybe a CG TV for around that price.

To none of my surprise, getting paid well in this field is already tough. Specially in Nepal since systems dherai nai chaina and bhako ni testo profitable hune kura bhayena.  I was not ready for DevOps.  And I was not going to work with 24x7 availability. Where I would have to go and fix RAM of a client at 12:00 AM even if I was going to be paid humongously. I am ready to work on night shift but it should be a dedicated shift. Not expected availability 24x7 with remuneration only paid for time you work and not for the time you had to stay alert.   Age function was growing with an order of factorial. Salary function was growing at a constant rate. Stress and family pressure was increasing with an exponential order.   The salary when I left my job was 25,000 after 2 years (Salary incremented at 1.5 year to 25,000).  I tried to do the \"so-called\"  \"sacred advice of reddit\" \"hop jobs\". But everywhere I went, I saw darkness. Most roles were a trade off that I was not willing to trade off. i.e. either the pay, or the work life balance. What I really hated was even on workdays, you get paid for 8 hours of work, but you were expected to be standby available even after office hours. This was my experience in most enterprises of Nepal based on interview and work experience.  I accepted my fate and I decided aba Loksewa preparation garchu for Computer Engineer. Loksewa ma ta printer safa garne kam ho bhanchan, office time mai gardihalchu fatafat. Printer safa garna standby ta basna pardaina :D.

Server ko kam garna lai best yei ho as I expect ki government computer engineer ko mainly kam bhaneko server handle garne nai hola. Otherwise big data etc hola but definitely not software coding which is my anti-talent.  I am really happy in this journey. But big question is \"Can I crack it\"? While I started the preparation, I was really excited. But after 7.5 months and not yet finishing even half of the syllabus of NEA(my target) I am shattered into pieces.  The competition is high although serious people preparing for exam is pretty low. Last time in Nepal Engineering Council Computer engineering job vacancy exam, 75 applied and maybe 15 appeared for both first and second paper. But seat is limited to just 1. Which is a huge bottleneck.   Ufff..Fuuuuuh....Nepathyama lamo saas lidai OP.....   My doubts about cracking come from the fact that copy checking is very subjective issue except in MCQ. And MCQ in my target corporations is just 25% of total marks.",

I was once on 200/300mbps package myself but looking at how much I was paying vs how much usage I was getting for my money I decided to scale back to 75mbps. It worked equally well for my house of three floors, 2 families and maybe 10-12 devices in total, phones and laptops. Download speed was reduced yes but I wasn't affected all that much. I later upgraded to 100mbps because it was even cheaper than 75mbps and have been satisfied with is ever since. I don't have a mesh router nor the latest wifi technology. A simple main router on 2nd floor + a wifi repeater on 1st floor + an old wired Mi Router 3 on ground floor covers all of my house with enough speed working out just fine. And the best part is I pay less than 10000 per year for my unlimited, no FUP 100mbps up/down internet.    |||I think they charge extra for replacing router too.|||I strongly encourage to use your own router and not the ISP. If the ISP doesn't allow this, get a better ISP. |||WiFi 6 honestly wasn’t worth it for me. I upgraded as soon as they started marketing it, expecting noticeable improvements, but there’s barely any real difference in day-to-day usage.  I do have a WiFi 6 supported device, but it’s not even WiFi 6E, it’s just 802.11ax on the 5GHz band, not the newer 6GHz band. So the upgrade didn’t feel like a major leap.  I’m subscribed to the advertised 600 Mbps plan, but in reality, I haven’t seen any meaningful improvement in my workflow. I do a lot of uploading and downloading for work, and the difference has been minimal. It feels more like a pricing upgrade than a performance upgrade.  Even when I connect via Ethernet and test the speed, I usually get around 280–300 Mbps download and about 150 Mbps upload, nowhere near the advertised numbers.  I tried contacting customer support, but they mostly just restart the router and don’t really provide technical clarity.  So yeah, don’t just fall for the “600 Mbps” marketing without understanding what you’re actually getting.|||Not much, They are just selling new nokia routers since they got bored with beacon routers.|||Bring a wifi 6 wifi extender that works with Ethernet cable and use it for yourself.

Hope thye will change these corrupted system and parties and their members|||Yup. The main difference is if RSP doesn’t stand up to its promises after the elections we wont hesitate for even one second before going against RSP. Not the same with Congress supporters.|||**This is exactly the point.**  RSP represents a shift toward conscious voting supporters who back the agenda but remain detached enough to be critical. They aren't worshipping the party.  Congress represents traditional identity politics. The attachment runs so deep that leaving feels like a betrayal of self. Once you are that biased, your view becomes warped: you magnify every small flaw of the RSP simply because you cannot accept that an alternative exists.|||+1|||Being Sceptical of \"new\" forces is more important in my opinion, job selection ma ta test ra kati interview round clear garnu parxa vaane desh chalaune job ma chai hami kati unserious hau sabai candidates ko grilling hunu parxa.|||The Youths are behind Ghanti. But without clear vision it cant do anything. Balen is also not showing any accountability. He will not be accessable to people if he became PM.  The right person to lead is Kulman. He is a proven person.|||2 addition RSP supporters most of the youth have understood there won't be any radicalized change but will be gradual   And congress are proud that they brought democracy (which I disagree) and want to live off that merit|||Malai yo *insert your bias favourite* ko favor ma din rat jutney harulai sodhna man lageko kura...

Taxation kasto hunxa?|||just look [gangan](https://gangan.world/)|||hahahahahhahahaha, neither ghanti nor current NC are revolutionaries is any regard. both are just opportunistic, not saying that as bad as people assume, in politics you have to be opportunistic.  neither any of them caused the protest nor they are stakeholders of this, they both are just \"victors\" after the chaos due to lack of political leadership in the protest itself.  Ghanti and NC both are status quo, none are revolutionaries, just new vs old. Both will not go against the \"system\", check how both talk, even Balen is already glamorizing the current system, again not wrong but doesn't make them revolutionary. If you think, even 2/3 government of Balen will go after anyone important you are living in a delusion, same with Gagan, people naturally as Balen is new will have more hope on him. I have hope whoever takes the PM seat, they will execute for betterment of people, but going after old guards I don't see anyone doing.  Both have a vision of \"execution\" only, \"maile paye chai garchu\" mindset. You can clearly see this with \"pseudo\" directly elected PM (announcing it even before the election, there is no law to guarantee it, if any one Balen or Gagan loses, they lied,  they presented themselves as PMs and they cannot deliver now, so they ran on a lie). Logically there is a chance none of them can be PM from our current parliamentary system.  Both a execution happy, populist from two different one old rotten party, another yet to truly tested new party (well new as in comparison to congress). But none are revolutionaries. revolutionaries don't hide around they lead, they go for accountability and come forward, not hide behind vial of parliamentary politics, that's what politicians do. which i am totally fine with.  If Balen's RSP get 2/3rd then that's a mandate which is different, in this climate even 50%+1 is a mandate. but I am not seeing that happening.  Whoever wins, I respect the constitution, will support the incoming administration (well I work closely with government). I will totally respect the decision of the elections.|||There are two types of people :: 1st : J jasto cha tai chalna deu ki Gangan gara ki be part of it  and 2nd bhanya jo  jimma linchan tyo Badalna lai...|||Agree to disagree.

Assuming you are in +2 cause you posted here student ley Pani paisa chai Ka bata lerauney hora??🤷🤷|||Baal ho|||This reminded me of my first year of college. I had a girlfriend back then, shes my wife now and we’ve been happily married for 3 years. Back then I was really broke. No money at all, even had to return money to friends. Valentine’s week was coming and I was stressed because I couldn’t buy her any gift, not even a small chocolate. She was a little upset that night, but later she understood my situation and everything was fine again. She also once told me how her friends were getting chocolates from their boyfriends. I said “I’ll send you one tomorrow” even though I had no money. She said “it’s okay” and I thought she really meant okay… which was a big mistake 😅 Now life is better and I never miss a chance to surprise her on special days. So maybe your boyfriend is struggling right now like I was. Sometimes it’s not that he doesn’t care, he just doesn’t have money at the moment. And sometimes boys are just bad at understanding hints.

So, there was this Adhikari woman (i forgot her name) who is quite famous for these lil handwriting workshops around Nepal. I was in 5th grade when she came to our school for ts. It was for a few days and damn. I used to write in cursive, not pretty cursive but the progressive kinda yk.   It was a lot of pressure for 11 year old me😭 i practiced those stupid monocursive alphabets so much that I couldn't even write the small 's' differently for years. Like, i remember her teaching it like, sad smile, happy smile and connect or something like that. I was onto some running for validation type shii.   I quit that monocursive thing and embraced my cursive again tara this pretty wala. Some stupid old cougar who needed to have their eyes checked couldn't read tyasaile some events happened and i am stuck with my present handwriting. Aadha cursive, aadha mono ani hawa ma uddai.

Record anusar, statue was commissioned by Vishugupta of the gupta dynasty (son of the more famous Jisnugupta) tyeti bela Lichhavi dynasty was like a vassal state to the gupta dynasty. Ani bishnugupta Kathmandu airaney belama yo statue commission gareko. Made from nagdhunga (basal stone).  Yo statue chai harako thiyo (puriyeko) maybe due to lack of maintenance, earthquake who knows.   Malla raja ko palama euta kisan ley khanney belama bhettayo yo murti feri. Legend was that he hit the statue's toe and blood gushed out. Tyeti bela, for myriad of reason, it was named budhanilkantha. Probably because theological literacy wasn't high/ maybe the farmer was more of shiva bhakta. Maybe the coutnry was in the shiva bhakta phase as later royal families have been heavy shiva bhaktas.   Until later, when people recognized, ahh you bishnu ho siva hoina it's name was already 'sealed' as budhanilkantha, including the name for the area. Hence it's called budhanilkantha ani narayanthan.   |||Aww man I stole so much money  and fruits from this temple  When I was homeless.|||It is believed that a mirror image of Lord Shiva can be seen on the underside of the statue, which is surrounded by water from Gosainkunda (a lake created by Shiva).|||TLDR; Honestly, it’s Narayan (Vishnu), but you’d be surprised how often people get confused and wonder if it’s actually Buddha instead of Shiva.  From what I’ve read, the evidence leans much more toward it being a Narayana site. Budhanilakantha is one of only three Jalashayana Narayana (Vishnu sleeping on the cosmic waters) in Kathmandu Valley as far as I know. The other two are at Balaju (erected by the same patron king AFAIK)  and inside Hanuman Dhoka Palace, though that one was added much later by Pratap Malla.  Some old chronicles say that King Haridutta, around 350 A.D., built Budhanilakantha and also set up four other Narayana temples at the four corners of the Kathmandu Valley. That’s Changu, Bishankhu, Ichangu, and Shesh Narayan. Even today, people try to visit all four in one day, which is basically like doing a Narayan dham within valley. And very surprisingly, if you add Budhanilkantha (as fifth point) into the map it forms the legendary \"Khadga\" shape which is described to be the shape of ancient Kathmandu Town Planning. More so, these Narayana Shrines are located cardinally to each other which makes it much cooler (I cant infer much more from it than that lol). Here is the image for y'all to see: [https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0](https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0)  There’s also this story that King Haridutta saw Jalashayana Narayana in a dream, telling him to dig up the original image buried under the Rudramati riverbed. So he built a pond and installed the sculpture there, along with the four corner temples. This is confusing because , other historical analyses and inscriptions suggest the image was consecrated by ruler Visnugupta around 5th century A.D, much later than Haridutta.  The statue itself is amazing. It’s the largest stone sculpture in the Kathmandu Valley, carved from a single block of dark granite. Some stories say they dragged it across the Valley with forced labor, but some scholars argue the granite was actually nearby in the Shivapuri hills, which makes more sense (in some article by Sudarshan Raj  Tiwari, I am not sure). So I dont know which one is more valid, this or the claim mentioned by u/ZoWakaki above me.  Now, the most interesting part is that Buddhists also worship this image as Nilakantha Lokesvara, a form of Avalokitesvara. Avalokiteshvara is considered to be a form of Shiva in Buddhism or vise-a-versa, which can be one way where the Shiva/Vishnu connection in Budhanilkantha comes in place. In fact, if you look closely, you can almost see the Buddha’s forehead in the face of the sleeping Vishnu. Even the long ears of the statue are very reminiscent of Buddhist iconography we see around the valley.  As for the name Budhanilakantha, there’s a story about Shiva drinking poison during the Samudra Manthan. His throat was burning, so he struck the mountain with his trishul and created Gosaikunda Lake. The water from that lake is said to flow down to the pond at Budhanilakantha, and since Shiva’s called Nilakantha, that might be how the place got its name.

Honestly had Gagan not done his bisesh mahadivesh, the 3 parties already had plans to form a coalition and fight the election as one alliance. And it is his stance of not forming any coalition that we have such a strong competition now. But I’m not gonna lie, nothing is fundamentally going to change whoever comes to power. There doesn’t seem to be any proposal for institutional change in Nepal. RSP is basically running on “Out with the old and In with the new” but not new policies (case in point Balen’s Socialist tilt, his post about that cement factory etc).  It seems they just mean out with old people and in with the younger people. Gagan talks about institutional change, how he is going to be the Tony Blair of Nepal and bring about the “Third Way” and revise Nepal’s economy back to the 90’s era of liberalism. And that all sounds good but knowing Congress, a party that is so deeply entrenched in the status quo, I don’t buy it.

This election is the by-product of a major revolution which overthrew the government. The opposition has won every single election following revolutions - Jana Andolan I (Nepal Congress won the elections after the dissolution of Panchayat) - Jana Andolan II (CPN Maoist won the 2008 constituent assembly). RSP is the radical opposition as most of the influential figureheads of the revolution have now joined the party.  And you can clearly see the hype behind Balen and how RSP became a top 4 party in just 6 months of formation in the last election.   Oli might have won numerous elections in Jhapa-5, but I would put my money on Balen from a statistical perspective. Most importantly, he won with a 55.7% share in the 2022 elections.

I was hooked on it for two things. It had a monthly satirical column from Manoj Gajurel and childhood memoirs of Khagendra Sangraula. And their cover stories were also always interesting. On one issue, the cover story was a biography of \"Che Guevara\". I really liked him from then.   And when I was in college I used to dislike this one guy from our class. He low key used to irritate me. He was like ali dherai pose dekhauna parne, sir le padai rako bela taai na tui ko question sodhne, remarks dina parne. One day during a gap period we were talking with classmates and somehow the topic of Che Guevara came. Apparently he also admired Che Guevara. He told me about Che's book \"The motorcycle diaries\". He was also surprised that I knew about Che. From then on we got along quite well and became very good friends. He is one of my best friends now.   When I was 21 I got my first tattoo, this same photo of Che on my arm. When I turned 30, I did a world tour. I started in South America and spent 3 months there. And traveled further and made one circle around the world. If I hadn't read \"The motorcycle diaries\" then I wouldn't have got the inspiration to go to South America.  I think reading his biography had a really big impact on me. I like the guy a lot for what he fought for. He inspired me to make a courageous decision to travel around the world.

So I’ve been wondering:  * How did **“last”** end up meaning *“extremely”* or *“intensely”* in Nepali instead of *“final”*? * Why did Nepali pick up this English word when we already had intensifiers like **धेरै, एकदमै, निकै, अति**? * Is **“lastai”** more about borrowing *vibe / tone* rather than literal meaning? * Do other languages (especially multilingual or post-colonial ones) have words like this  ones that make zero etymological sense but still work perfectly in everyday speech? * And why do you think this kind of shift happened **specifically in Nepal**, and mostly in recent decades?

I look at those big houses inside the ring road and think — what did their ancestors do differently? How did they manage to secure land in the most valuable parts of Kathmandu? Today those properties are worth crores, and the people who own them seem to have such a huge head start in life. Was it political connections? Business foresight? Old money from Rana times? Just luck and timing when land was cheap? Or were they simply more ambitious and risk-taking than the average family? Meanwhile, many of us are just trying to survive — paying rent, sending money home, saving slowly, feeling like we’re always starting from zero. Sometimes it feels like no matter how hard we work, generational wealth is on a completely different level. I don’t hate anyone for it. I’m just genuinely curious — how does that level of wealth and power actually get built in Nepal? And realistically, is it even possible for someone without that background to catch up? Would love to hear different perspectives — especially from people who understand Kathmandu’s land history or come from families who’ve seen that change over generations.",

He also enabled and encouraged migrants from Gorkha to squat on some of our ancestral properties. This was also reversed by a successor.

Either your fore-fathers had to living in prime locations for a long time like newars were which were then passed on to the current gen of newars or your caste was favoured by the regime and given \"Birta\" which was then passed on to the current gen of brahmins or chettris. Dalits lag behind the higest - we can gueess why.   Birta lands were royal grants of revenue-free property to elites, temples, or officials, originating from Licchavi-era (c. 400-750 CE) land assignments to feudatories and Brahmins.   Another easy guess: whoevery has money buys prime properties regardless of caste.|||Wealth distribution is quite random, not everyone had a head start from family fortune, and not everyone started destitute. I have seen people living in Baluwatar in surprisingly low quality buildings and living standards. Conversely, I have seen others become wealthy in just a few years, one person in particular grew so rich from hydropower shares that had previously left him desperate because they hadn't yielded results for years. He overnight turned his hut like house to a palace like building in same place.  ​Many factors contribute to these different head starts. While \"money attracts money\", United States becoming wealthy wasn't just about the valuable land they acquired centuries ago, we have seen many historically valuable lands sitting in ruins even today. The primary drivers of the early US economy were linked to Europe's colonial past, which extracted, looted and exploited wealth from around the world, especially India and Africa. Those wealthy individuals brought that capital and their slaves on early ships to the USA.  ​Furthermore, those who work for others may never accumulate as much wealth as those who innovate. Many residents in Baluwatar and other posh areas of Kathmandu today are not just the \"old money\" elite, but innovators who started only a decade or two ago. It is hard to imagine how much wealth a seemingly small business can accumulate if it is in the right place at the right time.|||Aja ko sahar voli ko khandar ho sathi Kati sahar bane kati bigriyo What matters is are  you at right place ,at right time?|||Rana, Panchayat , tes pachi uni haru ka chamche haru..  jadiya local ko jagga haru waqil ra aru le khaideko pani xan.

In Nepal, Kathmandu traffic police already use ANPR for hit-and-runs, expandable to Pokhara for real-time alerts and fines targeting high-violation zones near tourist spots like Lakeside. Predictive models from vehicle trajectories can map hotspots, informing patrols or barriers during peak Indian tourist influx.  # Sanitation Monitoring  AI-powered video analytics on existing public cameras can detect public defecation or littering in real-time, classifying events by actor (pedestrian/vehicle) with models like MoViNet or deep learning for behavior recognition, capturing plates or faces for enforcement. Similar systems in India (e.g., Varanasi CCTV for litter) reduced complaints by 15%, adaptable to Pokhara's Lakeside where complaints about Indian tourists' littering and urination are common. Integrate with 311-style apps for citizen reports, using geospatial clustering to prioritize public toilet builds and attendants, as proven effective in San Francisco.  # Civic Sense Campaigns  Analyze geotagged social media (e.g., Instagram posts from Indian tourists) and complaint data with NLP and clustering to identify patterns in low civic behavior, informing targeted awareness via ads or signage in Hindi/English. Tourist flow analytics from mobility data can predict high-risk periods, optimizing signage and fines at hotspots, boosting compliance as seen in Nepal's open defecation campaigns. Dashboards for authorities track ROI, like violation reductions post-intervention.|||Make connections, try to get projects and contracts.

            "body": "i work for a Nepali pharmaceutical company. For the first time in Nepal, we’ve launched locally made medicines for asthma and COPD.  For context: respiratory drugs are the **3rd highest-selling therapeutic segment in Nepal**. Asthma and COPD inhalers alone account for **\\~NPR 2 Arabs  in annual sales**. Historically, about **80% of this market was controlled by one Indian company (Cipla)**, and the remaining 20% was split between a few Indian and Bangladeshi companies.  This is only our **second fiscal year**, and somehow we managed to capture **5–6% market share in the first year itself**. That’s something we’re genuinely proud of.  But here’s the part that’s breaking my motivation: **doctors’ demands**.  Almost every doctor asks for money or “support.” It’s the market norm. Almost every company pays. Prescriptions are openly transactional. Ethics are just buzzwords for conferences.  Our CEO started this respiratory segment after the **2015 blockade**, with the idea of making Nepal at least a little more **self-reliant** in this very technical and critical category. DPI inhalers are not easy to make—there’s a reason very few companies here even attempt it.  Meanwhile:  * Indian pharma companies are **billion-dollar giants** * They have **multiple segments**, massive margins * They get **government subsidies** * Their **cost of production is far lower** * **1% of India’s pharma capacity can supply all of Nepal**  Despite all this, we price our products **lower**, so Nepali patients can save **a few hundred rupees every month**.   We supply huge volumes through **tenders at prices even lower than our own selling price**.   Our margins are thin.      BUT.Doctors don’t give a single shee  about any of this.  I’m honestly not even against paying (keeping gifts aside) . I’ve constantly paid for Direct cash ,Expensive dinners, Lunch packages ,flight tickets , holiday trips  ,even internet bills and  asics shoes ffs.   But at least let it make sense.  If I’m giving someone **1lakh**, I expect **10 lakh** in return. That’s the unspoken thumb rule in this system. But some doctors don’t even do that. They use us as leverage to blackmail bigger Indian companies into paying them more.  I don’t expect patriotism.   I don’t expect ideology.  But if you’re taking money, **at least be loyal**.  There *are* a few genuinely humble and ethical doctors who support us, and I respect them deeply.Some are actually even giving us a good return for our investments. But the majority? They’re just abusing us and companies like ours in the process.  How is a domestic pharmaceutical industry supposed to survive like this?   How do you build anything sustainable when ethics are optional and corruption is normalised?  Just needed to get this off my chest.",

Digitisation is another way to go and RSP is talking about it and I think we should ask candidates about this too.

Over time Nepal started getting international opportunities, and players like Paras Khadka gave the team identity and belief.  Then domestic leagues, better infrastructure, and more organized promotion by CAN helped cricket reach everyday people. Combine national pride with passionate fans, and it snowballed into the crazy support you see today.

They use yak or beef too, so it's got a supportive flavor profile for that.  Ones that originated out of the valley use buff though. And they use spices because it absolutely rocks your tastebuds, and at times are delicious even without the chutney/jhol. Places like shandar/narayan dai momo taste great just on themselves easily.  There's no proving you wrong if it's your choice/tastes. But the purbeli type momo you described, I find really bland.|||I see you are man with fine palate.

I can understand bringing a surprise for children or parents, but the expectation of gifts for everyone is ridiculous.   I had a scenario a few years ago where my brother is from Nepal and my SIL is from India. Bro and SIL were living in Delhi. Parents would travel to the US regularly to see my family and often spend a day or two in Delhi on there way to the US to see family. Always bringing gifts, no matter how tedious or common the visits were. One time my wife was about to give birth, so they jumped on a flight to the US to be with us. The had a 3 hour layover in Delhi, so they grabbed lunch with brother and SIL before their flight to the US. (Remember this is last minute, trying to rush to the USA to help). They didn’t bring my sister in law a formal present (that had been married for 8years) at the quick meeting between flight.  My SIL went home and threw a big fit about her not getting a gift and how disrespectful they were. She locked herself in her room pretended to cry for days.   Am I crazy for thinking my SIL was rude. Or, were my in-laws out of line for not bringing a gift in an emergency situation?  Edit: SIL’a family is well off and she has always been “spoiled”  Edit: My in-laws feel extremely guilty 10 years later for not breaking aging a gift on an emergency trip.  Edit: Spoiled SIL wouldn’t speak to family for almost 2 years after this.  🤦🏻‍♂️|||Even if you can afford it, bringing gifts to 50+ people is excessive. Be selective.

My feed is suddenly filled with content from Nepali girls/women posting what I'd call softcore stuff – semi-nude poses, revealing outfits, a lot of emphasis on body exposure under the guise of \"art\" or empowerment. It's everywhere, from reels to stories.  I'm curious: Do these creators know that a big chunk of their male followers might be there primarily for the physical appeal rather than appreciating it as art or self-expression? Or is it all part of the algorithm game where engagement trumps intent?  Not judging anyone – people can post what they want, and followers can choose what to engage with. But as someone from Nepal seeing this shift, it makes me wonder about the cultural implications, the impact on perceptions of Nepali women, and whether Instagram's push for viral content is blurring lines between empowerment and objectification.  What are your thoughts? Have you noticed this trend? Creators here – what's your take on audience motivations? Let's keep it respectful and insightful.  Thanks",

There were multiple casualties in that incident including killing of a toddler. The killing of policemen there with such brutality was unimaginable.  Everyone was unequivocally against what happened, multiple charges were pressed and people have been convicted with serious consequences. All of us, agreed that a political movement somehow got violent and resulted in unimaginable tragedy. We all agreed they needed to be put to justice.  Chait 15 was not even a protest, it was supposed to be a public gathering, a power show of some kind. It was led by Durge \"Mahisasur\" Parsai. Most people here were against his movement, including the media. They stoned a building and burned it. A journalist tragically lost life and the government \"murdered\" somebody in the street. They vandalized Bhatbhoteni and incurred significant loss. We were vehemently against Durge for what happened. The voice against the government murder was \"muted\" and people tended to take side of government, because the protesters (by that time) had been rowdy. All of were unequivocally against Durge. Balen attributed Gynndra for moral responsibility for the protest and fined him.  Now the Bhadra 23 protest, all of us \"supported\" the protest against corruption. Khadge Oli probably thought he would do exactly same as the Chaitra 15 protest and underestimated the potest. It went violent after it broke the barricade. The government caused unimaginable tragedy. 19 protesters \"murdered\" withing few hours is unimaginable in a democracy. We again unequivocally held the government, Khadge Oli responsible for the murders.  What heppened next day is also unprecedented and unimaginable. I fear, if I say it was wrong, then I may be painted as taking the side of government and not of the protesters. Its a false dichotomy. But lets face it, what happened in 24th was wrong.  In all of these above, the people involved in either sides were Nepali. We are responsible for all of the above on either sides. Blaming one or the other, saying घुषपैठ or foreign forces, winning election and putting Bhauju behind bar is not going to fix it. There is only one way to fix it. Education.

            "body": "Sharing an update on NARADA, an intelligence platform I have been building that aggregates publicly available government data across Nepal into one analytical system. A lot has changed since my last post, so here is what is new.  \\*\\*Geospatial Damage Analysis:\\*\\*  The platform now runs spatial analysis using Sentinel-1 (SAR radar) and Sentinel-2 (optical) satellite imagery. It works by comparing pre-event and post-event radar reflections using pixel-wise t-tests to detect structural damage to buildings, even through cloud cover. The system classifies damage zones by severity (Critical, Severe, Moderate, Minor) with 95% confidence scores. This can be applied to natural disasters, civil unrest, or any event where infrastructure damage needs rapid assessment without people on the ground.  \\*\\*Corporate Intelligence:\\*\\*  Every registered company in Nepal (341,801 as of now) has been scraped from CAMIS (Company and Industry Registration System). Each company record includes registration date, type, district, and directors. To detect hidden links between companies, I extract phone numbers from registrations, hash them using HMAC-SHA256 for privacy, and then cluster matches. This found 6,388 phone clusters linking 14,613 companies, meaning thousands of seemingly separate companies share contact information.  Government contract data from 2020 to present has also been scraped. This gets cross-referenced with company records to flag anomalies like a single entity receiving disproportionate contract awards, or newly registered companies winning large tenders.  One concrete finding: a single phone number cluster linked to 51 companies, all registered as agricultural firms. The pattern is consistent with shell companies created to exploit agricultural tax exemptions.  \\*\\*Trade Intelligence\\*\\*  Customs import/export data (1.68 million rows, 6,073 HS codes) is processed to map trade flows by commodity, partner country, and customs office. The system calculates trade balances and can flag anomalies like unusual pricing, volume spikes, or routing patterns that are commonly associated with trade-based money laundering.  \\*\\*What is coming next\\*\\*  Director and shareholder data for public companies will be linked into the corporate graph soon, which will allow mapping of beneficial ownership networks across Nepal’s corporate landscape.  Important note: All data used in this project comes from publicly available government sources. No private data is accessed or stored. Phone numbers are hashed and never displayed in raw form.

Your math is spot on, paying $21,600/year (approx 30 Lakhs NPR) for standard time-tracking features is a massive leak in your OpEx.  Building this in-house is the correct move for a team of 300+, but you need the right architecture so you don't cripple your employees' computers.  **The Architecture I Recommend:**  * **Desktop Agent (The Tracker):** Built with **Tauri (Rust + JS)**. Unlike Electron apps which eat 200MB+ RAM, a Tauri app is tiny (<15MB) and uses negligible memory. It stays invisible until needed. * **Backend & Dashboard:** **Laravel + FilamentPHP**. This handles the multi-tenancy, employee management, and provides a clean admin panel for your screenshots and time logs. * **Storage: AWS S3 / Any s3 compatible provider of your choice:** critical when you are syncing thousands of screenshots daily.  **My Quote & Estimation:** We can build a production-ready version of \"Time Monitor\" (custom branded for you) for a **one-time fee**.  * **Development Cost:** **NPR 10 lakhs** (One-time). * **Timeline:** 4-6 Weeks (Dev + QA). * **Deliverables:** Windows/Mac/Linux agents + Web admin Dashboard + Source Code.  **Your New Recurring Costs (Infrastructure):** You move from paying $1,800/month to paying for raw server usage only:  * **VPS (Hetzner/DigitalOcean/Local provider in Nepal ( Datahub )):** \\~$30/month. * **Storage (Screenshots):** \\~$10-$20/month. * **Code Signing Cert (Required for Windows/Mac):** \\~$30/month (amortized). * **Total:** **\\~$80/month.** (You save \\~95% immediately).  **Why the quote range?** The complexity isn't in taking screenshots; it's in the edge cases. Handling offline syncing (when internet cuts out), idle time detection (keyboard/mouse hooks without false positives), and auto-updating 300 clients requires robust engineering, not just a script.  If you are serious about owning your infrastructure and cutting this cost permanently, let's chat.|||is it a time doctor ?|||I already have a laravel built project management with time tracking.

Definitely the worst experience ever.

I was once on 200/300mbps package myself but looking at how much I was paying vs how much usage I was getting for my money I decided to scale back to 75mbps. It worked equally well for my house of three floors, 2 families and maybe 10-12 devices in total, phones and laptops. Download speed was reduced yes but I wasn't affected all that much. I later upgraded to 100mbps because it was even cheaper than 75mbps and have been satisfied with is ever since. I don't have a mesh router nor the latest wifi technology. A simple main router on 2nd floor + a wifi repeater on 1st floor + an old wired Mi Router 3 on ground floor covers all of my house with enough speed working out just fine. And the best part is I pay less than 10000 per year for my unlimited, no FUP 100mbps up/down internet.    |||I think they charge extra for replacing router too.|||I strongly encourage to use your own router and not the ISP. If the ISP doesn't allow this, get a better ISP. |||WiFi 6 honestly wasn’t worth it for me. I upgraded as soon as they started marketing it, expecting noticeable improvements, but there’s barely any real difference in day-to-day usage.  I do have a WiFi 6 supported device, but it’s not even WiFi 6E, it’s just 802.11ax on the 5GHz band, not the newer 6GHz band. So the upgrade didn’t feel like a major leap.  I’m subscribed to the advertised 600 Mbps plan, but in reality, I haven’t seen any meaningful improvement in my workflow. I do a lot of uploading and downloading for work, and the difference has been minimal. It feels more like a pricing upgrade than a performance upgrade.  Even when I connect via Ethernet and test the speed, I usually get around 280–300 Mbps download and about 150 Mbps upload, nowhere near the advertised numbers.  I tried contacting customer support, but they mostly just restart the router and don’t really provide technical clarity.  So yeah, don’t just fall for the “600 Mbps” marketing without understanding what you’re actually getting.|||Not much, They are just selling new nokia routers since they got bored with beacon routers.|||Bring a wifi 6 wifi extender that works with Ethernet cable and use it for yourself.

I think the current strategy of building run off the river hydropower is good. It has less environmental impact compared to submerging thousands of villages and forcing them to move away (like the three gorges dam did) and we should start building solar power on an industrial scale and start attaching it to the grid as soon as possible so factories can run during the day for cheaper without cutting into the electricity we need to live our lives in the evening.   That being said, the biggest problems we have are not technical. It is more political and societal. We should not forget what started the Gen Z protests. The politicians who promise a \"quick fix\" to deep problems like monkeys destroying crops by saying something like we will export monkey meat are still running for office and are viable candidates.

Padhe lekheko anpad haru. Stephen Hawking ko contribution kati xa physics ma bujya xau? Like wtf is wrong with you guys?|||People usually miscalculate the complexity of human beings, even if those people are globe-renowned scientists or thinkers. We tend to reduce individuals into neat categories of \"good\" or \"bad,\" when in reality most human lives exist somewhere in a moral gray space.  The figures are indeed contributions to modern society, having shaped our understanding of the universe in the case of Stephen Hawking and the overwhelming propagation of personal computing that underpins everyday life, thanks to Bill Gates. Their contributions are objective in nature, measured, and historically significant.  The Epstein case has indeed cast a sinister shadow on the reputations and personal integrity of those associated with it. Any wrongdoing ought to be investigated, prosecuted, and judged on its merits. Accountability counts.  Yet, it is quite dangerous to erase or dismiss intellectual and scientific contributions on the basis of particular personal moral failures; by doing so, it is an effort to distort history. If we were to get rid of every successful idea that had come from flawed individuals, much of human progress would disappear along with those who themselves were flawed.  We can—and should—condemn bad behavior without discarding valuable, valid contributions to knowledge and society.  Scientists are more likely to value human progress, curiosity, and long-term thinking—but they are not immune to moral failure. Their work can be noble even when their personal lives are flawed. Judgment must be based on evidence, not archetypes.|||Not remove but edit by keeping his bad pedophilic side in the chapter.Let the readers decide what to think of him by reading his biography.|||He did biggest contribution for science.

However, his contributions to the physics community are unimaginable. As a physics student, I was inspired by his book A Brief History of Time. When it comes to moral responsibility, I believe we should take such matters seriously. However, removing his biography from textbooks is not justified. As far as I know, he was never convicted; he was only accused, largely based on a photograph. If we consider that he was a famous person known for his intellect, it is also possible that people simply wanted to take a picture with him. It could have been anything, but jumping to conclusions is not fair. The mindset of “guilty until proven innocent,” which is common in Nepali society, can seriously damage someone’s reputation, whether they are living or deceased. I also saw someone arguing that other scientists went to that island as well. Yes, that could be possible. They may have gone there for donations or funding. People should also understand how research and experiments work. Many scientists attend seminars, conferences, and even social events to secure funding from wealthy donors for their research projects. That is part of how scientific funding operates. It may sound unpleasant, but it is often the reality. However, concluding that they raped minors without concrete evidence is unreasonable. From my perspective, why don’t we conduct our own research before forming judgments? We know he was famous. We can consult medical professionals or simply search the internet regarding his medical condition after paralysis—you understand what I mean….|||Does his contribution to the science and the world will be false because his name was in epstein file?

However, we can efficiently manage traffic via road marking, effective communication and traffic lights rules and civic sense. Moreover, why train lines will not be appropriate because of highly fluctuating gradient slopes making us a need to cast high pillars to support along it, and casting pillars/column for support is expensive to construct on itself. Everyone has their own definition of development, but in my view development is not a big deal, the maintenance is. Do you ever think why our roads do not look like foreign countries, why our street looks sad? We do development like those of developed countries, the quality materials might be diff. But the quality we have is sufficient, the maintenance is the big deal.

A country like Nepal where millions struggle financially, if it was just collecting papers, chuck it in the bin and getting 15K I’m sure, no one would be washing dishes, working on the gravel mines, or brick factories.

Also, I don’t think Christianity or any religion teaches people to treat faith like marketing.... there are good teachings everywhere. Making fun of help like rice and clothes also feels unnecessary since it’s meant for people who actually need it. And isn’t Nepal secular? Groups like ISKCON openly distribute pamphlets and invite people to religious programs, so preaching itself might not be illegal, maybe forced conversion is the real issue.

            "heading": "Traveling in Nepal taught me more about men, boundaries, and quiet decency than I expected",
            "body": "I was traveling in Nepal this January, mostly to slow down, clear my head, and meet people without expectations. Somewhere along the way, I met an Indian guy fun, outgoing, easy to hang out with at first. We did activities together, explored places, laughed a lot. On the surface, it felt like a solid travel friendship.  But over time, small things started to bother me.  Almost every conversation somehow circled back to women. Not in a harmless, passing way but in a constant, exhausting way. Stories about who he’d slept with, who he wanted to sleep with, and how he planned to marry a Nepali girl someday. The irony was hard to miss: while talking about marriage, he was simultaneously “digging” into three or four different Nepali women, using each connection purely to meet his physical needs.  What really unsettled me was how he talked about women in public. While walking down the street, every passing woman became a comment “She’s looking,” “She has baggage,” “That one’s ready to get slammed.” Over and over again. Loud enough for me to hear, casual enough that he didn’t even see it as wrong.  I’m straight. I notice beauty. I appreciate attractive people like anyone else. But I’ve never felt the need to reduce strangers to comments or talk about them like they’re objects meant for consumption. There’s a line between noticing and disrespect, and he crossed it constantly.  Around the same time, I met a fellow traveler from the US. She was in Nepal to explore, just like me. We decided to visit the mountains together nothing dramatic, just two travelers sharing a plan. We rented a scooter and rode through some incredible places. On the way, I could sense she was hesitant, a little guarded. I didn’t push conversation, didn’t force comfort. I let the ride be what it was.  Once we reached our destination, everything changed.  We talked. For hours. Six or seven hours straight. About life, relationships, family, travel, fears, growth everything that came naturally. No agenda. Just two humans exchanging stories. After sunset, we headed to a homestay and booked a private room. She shared her location with her best friend, brother, and a few close friends back in the US. I spoke to them briefly too, just casually.  Around 11 PM, after more conversation, she went to sleep. I finished some work and slept as well.  The next morning, she told me she’d been freezing all night. I offered her my blanket. We sat wrapped in it for a couple of hours as the sun slowly came up. That’s when she said something that stuck with me.  She told me that in her last 5 years of traveling, this was the first time she’d ever shared a private room with a complete stranger and also the first time she’d felt completely safe doing so. She said most men would try to take advantage of a situation like that. She even compared it to men back home who she knew would “go down that path” without hesitation.  Honestly, it surprised me that this even needed to be said.  I had no intention zero of turning that situation into anything physical. Not because I’m “special” or morally superior, but because I genuinely don’t believe every interaction with the opposite gender needs to lead to sex. Especially not with someone you’ve just met. Physical needs don’t give anyone a free pass to cross boundaries.  I’ve always had female friends. I treat them the same way I treat anyone else. I don’t hit on them. I don’t test limits. I don’t see every connection as an opportunity.  I was in a relationship once six years long. It ended, after a lot of effort and learning. For the past year, I’ve been traveling, meeting people, rebuilding myself, enjoying the days as they come.  And being an Indian traveling in Nepal, I can’t ignore what I keep seeing.  A large number of Indian men here seem to be chasing only one thing massage spas, clubs, dance bars, random women, cheap validation. Commenting on strangers. Treating the country like a playground built for their desires.  I made a few Nepali friends too. They were amazing warm, genuine people. One Nepali friend took me on long bike rides through quiet roads and empty spaces. We spent whole days together smoking, riding, talking, wandering where there was no one around. At some point, she asked me honestly, “What’s your goal in Nepal? Most Indian guys come here only for girls. What about you?”  I laughed and said, “You’ve been with me day and night, to random places where there’s no one around and you’re still asking this?”  And that’s the part I don’t understand.  How some people try to pick up every woman they meet. How everything becomes about getting into someone’s pants for a night. And strangely enough how men like that still manage to find women too.  I’m not writing this to shame anyone. Just sharing an experience that made me think.  Traveling doesn’t just show you new places it shows you who you are when no one’s watching, and who others become when they think they’re entitled.  Adios amigos.  Just another story from the road.

Once back home, as he spent time in recovery, he decided to document online his near-death experience and post-protest life](https://nepalitimes.com/news/a-new-normal).  >Dhakal, 18, came home from college that day three months ago and then took the bus to Itahari to join some friends who were protesting in front of the sub-metropolitan city office. It was mid-afternoon, and the crowd was chanting anti-corruption slogans and holding up placards.  >Like most young Nepalis, Dhakal and his friends had been angered by videos on social media of the offspring of Nepal’s rich and powerful flaunting their lavish lifestyles.   >\"That was the trigger for me to join the protest, it opened my eyes to just how widespread nepotism and corruption was,\" Dhakal told Nepali Times.   >The police arrested a few students, angering the crowd even more. They massed at the gate of a nearby police station to demand their friends be released.    >Dhakal was standing across the street from the police station when the first shots rang out. The crowd scattered. As he ran for cover, there was a searing pain in his left jaw. Blood was streaming and it took some time for him to realise he had been shot.   >“I was bleeding profusely and couldn’t speak. My vision blurred, there was a ringing in my ears,” Dhakal recalls. “I collected myself and continued to run, fearing that I would be shot a second time.”  >Dhakal collapsed some distance away, and a fellow protestor took him to a nearby hospital, where doctors bandaged his jaw. He was referred to Birat Medical Teaching Hospital, where surgeons immediately performed an emergency operation.    >The bullet had torn through his left jaw, shattering the bone, teeth, and soft tissue. Blood had rushed into his throat, obstructing the airway so doctors first performed a tracheostomy, installing a tube in his throat to help him keep breathing. A week later, the doctors reconstructed his jaw with metallic plates, grafting skin from his chest and transplanting it to the lower left side of his face.   >Dhakal spent three weeks in hospital before being discharged. But the relief of being home was marred by disturbing thoughts. He says, “Just sitting there doing nothing began to take a toll on my mental health.”    >Since he was always interested in content creation and [producing short documentaries](https://www.youtube.com/@docsbyshantanu), he decided to document online his near-death experience and post-protest life.   >Shantanu Dhakal’s Instagram and TikTok [posts are simple, short videos](https://www.instagram.com/shantanu__dhakal/) every other day about his treatment process, dressing his wound and cleaning his tracheostomy tube, attending events with others injured during the protests, and scenes from everyday life in his family farm.   >The comment section has Nepalis and people from around the world reaching out to ask how he is doing and keeping his spirits up. Dhakal now has a caring social media community, and he uses the platforms to keep in touch with other injured protestors across the country.   >Life is returning to a new normal. This week, he returned to college to resume classes after more than two months and is making up for lost time. He has adjusted to speaking and eating with the tube, although the pain never quite goes away.   >“I can eat mostly fine, but it is still difficult to speak,” he says. Soon, he will go to hospital for his fortnightly follow-up, and doctors will determine when his tracheostomy tube can be removed.  >Like other young Nepalis, Dhakal is now even more politically engaged and actively reads the news of the interim government installed after the GenZ protests.   >With the 5 March elections only three months away, young Nepalis like Dhakal hope that the elections will throw out the old and bring in the new. He is among the more than 800,000 new voters who have registered.   >  [https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/live-ammunition-used-against-nepal-anti-graft-protesters-forensics-show-2025-09-26/](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/live-ammunition-used-against-nepal-anti-graft-protesters-forensics-show-2025-09-26/)  [How Nepalese police shot at protesters with ‘military-grade ammunition’](https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20250915-nepal-police-protests-violence-kathmandu)  >Our team spoke to an arms expert, who requested anonymity, and asked him to identify the weapon used here.

He added that this is a lethal munition. In his view, there is \"a serious risk of fragmentation in the victim’s body at distances of less than 100 to 200 metres.  >Using this ammunition to maintain public order will result in ‘disproportionate’ risk because this is military-grade ammunition.\"",

I would suggest mastering Trigonometry from Alevel ko book. That's the best resource because you won't need to remember most of the things just a few things.

For us however, this is our first horrible man made mass scale event.    for example my mother told these are the events she witnessed, heard about ( there was no internet and reporters were getting chhopped up so source is her words and the fear and disgust in her eyes when talking about it)   i, maobadi kidnapped her school science teacher and tied him to the ground and they started nailing him with large and small nails from the legs and hands, slowly and all over his whole body,   ii. they kidnapped a man form his house at night, made him collect firewood from the forest , they started a fire, like a campfire, beside the fire they asked the kidnapped man to dig up a hole, he did exactly what they said. and after all that in the morning they invited many people from the village including his family members, and they burried him alive with his head sticking out form the  ground so that he could hear and see what was happening and finally they covered his head with the burning coals .    these are just examples and your and my parents have seen/ heard about a lot of similar killings kidnapping , public beheading etc  From their point of view, The old parties have maintained peace, ended such horrible war so they have gained a lot of trust. The old parties have shown their strength, in ending rana rule to ending civil war to ending king's direct rule and our parents know what the political paties gave them the rights and freedom which they have now.    So They're willing to bet one more time that These parties can and will always uphold our sovereignty, freedom and country as a whole.  So it is our duty to make them trust the newer political parties,    it is our duty to make them understand that we will not let the sacrifices and changes made by the old political parties Go to ruin ( the rights and freedom given by the constitution).    It is our duty to make them understand that the the political parties which ended rana rule and the kings rule  are themselves becomming similar elites.    It is our duty to make them understand that the old parties are using similar dictatorial practices which our parent and grand parents fought and ended.  And this is not going to be fast and easy, this is a long process will take years and years.   If you cannot convince your family members think how difficult it  is going to make a stranger understand.  And one more question, why would they listen to you. You are so short sighted and narrow minded. you want people to do exactly what you want them to do just because you said it. You start name calling your family members when they questioned choice which you made for them. They gave their reasons why they're voting. And they are damn right on questioning balen. Why should they trust him, just because he and the media said it.  Isn't that we all be doing, questioning . and They are questioning, You failed to give them answers. Its all on you. Have you asked yourself why should i vote balen?? What answer did you get Try answering without using the words like \"purano party\" \"yemale\" etc. does your answer focus more on old parties or the plans and policies for the country. If it is the first choice you're the veda.  One more thing, it is very sad, but the number of people you've killed does not really seem to matter in national level politics. Prachanda has claimed responsibility for 5000 killings. He became PM multiple times. He has sent kids of 13 and 14 years to the front lines to be used as a cannon fodder.   In short, your parents have seen very brutal violence and They know how bad things will be if old parties get elected but They do not know anything about the newer one. ( might be better or might be wayyy bad.) so they're picking certainity instead of incertainity.     |||vote waste garxa euta generation   dukha paauxa arko generation|||Balen haryo bhane, it's not the end of the world.

Nepal's own USP.  Yet Nepal gets ~1 million tourists a year. Countries with far less diversity get 5–10x more. The problem isn’t that Nepal lacks attractions  The problem is that Nepal’s tourism often exists as: “Something travelers discover on their own”  Nepal isn’t just a trekking destination. It’s an: Adventure sports destination Slow travel destination Culture-plus-nature destination Year-round destination (if positioned properly)  I am personally planning to venture into Tourism.

Things like this, despite having high potential, gets overlooked because we are stuck.   Some group or business person might come up with a brilliant idea to boost tourism, then some other business group/person pays for riots against the idea and that business person, because they did not get to profit off of it. People are against development for their own selfish reasons. We can be optimistic but it will take decades for things to change.|||wow, investing in cycling trail seems like a great idea !|||Pros: 1. Friendly people 2. Amazing nature and geography 3. Decent food  Cons: 1. Awful international airport 2. Terrible roads 3. Eating local food and drinking local water will make travelers sick 4. Polluted, cramped, chaotic, dirty cities 5. Garbage everywhere 6. No direct flights to Europe, US, or Australia  Futute vision should be something like:  Travelers arrive at one of Nepal's many modern, spacious international airports, from where they'd take easy metro to the nearest cities, all of which provide an easy access to adventures that fill the entire spectrum of bare-bones to ultra luxury. Eating street food and drinking any water causes no stomach issues.  That's just my quick brainstorming.|||What Nepal needs is a good PR team too|||You are right mate.. but due to political instability and corruption makes country backwards..Nepal has big potential to get developed which lays between big giants neighbors.|||So true. I have so many friends abroad who've told me they want to do the ABC trek in the last year, but they've always changed their minds when they've seen what's been going on in the country. Truly sad.|||[removed]|||True we have a huge tourism potential and we could be a destination for adventure sports. Besides trekking (but it's amazing what Nepal offers) we can offer lots of stuff like you mentioned but what we lack is infrastructure. How do you get to the trail head to start your mountain biking? Yes we have roads but how reliable are them. We have seen the safety records. If a rider gets into an accident how fast can medics reach him or her. How are they transferred to the nearest hospital safely.  We could be a destination for high altitude training camps like in Kenya or Colorado or Arizona but again what can we offer besides altitude. We have trails but do we have tracks for the work out ? Do we have a combination of flat and hilly lands around that altitude because Nepal's altitude rises rapidly in a very short distance. I know about a high altitude training program in Jumla. Hope that is a success. Training camp would need a good infra as well like basic PT, Gym, Recovery stuff etc.  We have the potential but we need to harness it. Harness in a sustainable way because if we are to increase the number of tourist sustainability is important, safety records are important because the majority of tourists consider everything, risk vs reward. I hope you succeed in your future endeavors but I suggest you to travel abroad to check the Tourism Sector before you venture on yours. Nearest is Thailand , you could see how they have harnessed their tourism potential. Their service industry compared to any other country in the region is miles ahead. Infrastructure, hospitality, transport etc they have it covered.   It's just my observations as I have traveled across Asia, Americas, Europe  when I can and I always think what Nepal could be.|||Do the cluster analysis of whatever feasible in nepal.

But I just want to say that I love Nepal. My wife and I have spent several weeks there each year for the last three years. I'm just happy to be there whatever we are doing.  Incredible nature. Great vegetarian food. Lovely people. A deep spiritual vibe. A unique country. Amazing!|||Yea very high potential for top tourism.  besides the amazing nature, many people also speak English - which is an advantage compared to many Asian countries where majority of their populations can’t speak English.   But the infrastructure just isn’t there yet. Close neighbor who has done it well is Thailand - their tourism industry and volume are another level. Their roads, airports, hospitality, foods, entertainment, tourist police to ensure safety, etc. make it easy to attract tourists.|||Isn’t the lack of infrastructure in Nepal part of what makes it appealing? Difficulty getting to a destination creates meaning. When everything becomes easy, it turns into disposable content for a feed. You don’t get profound experiences, you get optimized tourism. Yes, infrastructure improves lives, and that matters. But if development is driven mainly by attention and clicks, we’re not building a future. We’re building a theme park.|||[removed]|||Tourism is never good for economic growth in Country, see Thailand as they grow at 2% every year despite having so Tourist for that they have literally convert the whole country into a PUB",

Record anusar, statue was commissioned by Vishugupta of the gupta dynasty (son of the more famous Jisnugupta) tyeti bela Lichhavi dynasty was like a vassal state to the gupta dynasty. Ani bishnugupta Kathmandu airaney belama yo statue commission gareko. Made from nagdhunga (basal stone).  Yo statue chai harako thiyo (puriyeko) maybe due to lack of maintenance, earthquake who knows.   Malla raja ko palama euta kisan ley khanney belama bhettayo yo murti feri. Legend was that he hit the statue's toe and blood gushed out. Tyeti bela, for myriad of reason, it was named budhanilkantha. Probably because theological literacy wasn't high/ maybe the farmer was more of shiva bhakta. Maybe the coutnry was in the shiva bhakta phase as later royal families have been heavy shiva bhaktas.   Until later, when people recognized, ahh you bishnu ho siva hoina it's name was already 'sealed' as budhanilkantha, including the name for the area. Hence it's called budhanilkantha ani narayanthan.   |||Aww man I stole so much money  and fruits from this temple  When I was homeless.|||It is believed that a mirror image of Lord Shiva can be seen on the underside of the statue, which is surrounded by water from Gosainkunda (a lake created by Shiva).|||TLDR; Honestly, it’s Narayan (Vishnu), but you’d be surprised how often people get confused and wonder if it’s actually Buddha instead of Shiva.  From what I’ve read, the evidence leans much more toward it being a Narayana site. Budhanilakantha is one of only three Jalashayana Narayana (Vishnu sleeping on the cosmic waters) in Kathmandu Valley as far as I know. The other two are at Balaju (erected by the same patron king AFAIK)  and inside Hanuman Dhoka Palace, though that one was added much later by Pratap Malla.  Some old chronicles say that King Haridutta, around 350 A.D., built Budhanilakantha and also set up four other Narayana temples at the four corners of the Kathmandu Valley. That’s Changu, Bishankhu, Ichangu, and Shesh Narayan. Even today, people try to visit all four in one day, which is basically like doing a Narayan dham within valley. And very surprisingly, if you add Budhanilkantha (as fifth point) into the map it forms the legendary \"Khadga\" shape which is described to be the shape of ancient Kathmandu Town Planning. More so, these Narayana Shrines are located cardinally to each other which makes it much cooler (I cant infer much more from it than that lol). Here is the image for y'all to see: [https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0](https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0)  There’s also this story that King Haridutta saw Jalashayana Narayana in a dream, telling him to dig up the original image buried under the Rudramati riverbed. So he built a pond and installed the sculpture there, along with the four corner temples. This is confusing because , other historical analyses and inscriptions suggest the image was consecrated by ruler Visnugupta around 5th century A.D, much later than Haridutta.  The statue itself is amazing. It’s the largest stone sculpture in the Kathmandu Valley, carved from a single block of dark granite. Some stories say they dragged it across the Valley with forced labor, but some scholars argue the granite was actually nearby in the Shivapuri hills, which makes more sense (in some article by Sudarshan Raj  Tiwari, I am not sure). So I dont know which one is more valid, this or the claim mentioned by u/ZoWakaki above me.  Now, the most interesting part is that Buddhists also worship this image as Nilakantha Lokesvara, a form of Avalokitesvara. Avalokiteshvara is considered to be a form of Shiva in Buddhism or vise-a-versa, which can be one way where the Shiva/Vishnu connection in Budhanilkantha comes in place. In fact, if you look closely, you can almost see the Buddha’s forehead in the face of the sleeping Vishnu. Even the long ears of the statue are very reminiscent of Buddhist iconography we see around the valley.  As for the name Budhanilakantha, there’s a story about Shiva drinking poison during the Samudra Manthan. His throat was burning, so he struck the mountain with his trishul and created Gosaikunda Lake. The water from that lake is said to flow down to the pond at Budhanilakantha, and since Shiva’s called Nilakantha, that might be how the place got its name.

            "comments": "Much of what we call national Nepal today was shaped by the effort of King Mahendra. Before his time, even school textbooks were in Hindi, children literally had to read “हमारा देशका नाम नेपाल है”. That alone shows how fragile our national identity once was.  Ask yourself, why can’t we clearly distinguish Amar Singh Thapa from Bhimsen Thapa? Because most of the portraits we rely on were painted by the same court artists during King Mahendra’s era. The same question applies to Divya Upadesh, where was it for all those years? Why did it suddenly surface and gain prominence later?  Maybe some things were rediscovered, maybe some were reconstructed, we may never know for sure. But what is certain is this, King Mahendra played a decisive role in nationalising Nepal’s identity, language, history, and sense of self. Fabricated or rediscovered, those efforts unified a fragmented country. And that, undeniably, was a great deed.|||Because this painting was made during the reign of King Mahendra to show brave king Prithvi Narayan Shah as there was no proper art of King Prithvi Narayan.|||Well that's art not history.|||Glad you are exploring this topic. Feels like you are also curious about history and socio-political anthropology.  Mahendra was driven by political consolidation and a single national narrative. His reign coincided with serious regional instability. To the north, Mao’s Cultural Revolution was unfolding in China. To the down   East Pakistan was breaking away to form Bangladesh. In that context, there was a real fear that Nepal’s sovereignty and internal cohesion could be threatened.  As a result, many reforms and symbols were manufactured or standardized during his tenure to construct a unified national identity. This included the bringing of civil service  (bureaucracy, police, army), the national anthem, the national dress (daura suruwal and dakha topi), the national curriculum (mahendra mala), and the formalization of historical narratives and political doctrine.  Much of what is presented as *Divya Upadesh* guidence book from Prithvi Narayan Shah was entirely manufactured and institutionalized during Mahendra’s rule. From the iconic image of Prithvi Narayan Shah, including his gestures of index finger pointing upward direction (we are one unity symbolism), facial features, dress, and artistic representations, to the moral and political messages attributed to him, these were part of a deliberate political project rather than an untouched historical inheritance.  It is also important to remember that during Prithvi Narayan Shah’s time, there was no modern India or China as nation-states. Phrases like “dui dhunga ko tarul” were reframed as geopolitical doctrine. The *Divya Upadesh* attributed to him was manufactured, published, and promoted during Mahendra’s tenure, much like the Mahendra mala national curriculum that emphasizes narratives such as the Nepal–Anglo war was fought bravely and Nepal being “second richest in water resources.” These were not neutral historical facts but components of a deliberate nation-building strategy.|||It’s kind of a propaganda painting. It’s not that uncommon in the world . Look at that Khukuri thing next to his throne. What even is that lol 😂? Even that pose was created for the purpose of propaganda. That one finger pointing upwards saying we are one ☝️. We don’t even know what he actually looked like. No description even exists. It was all created during Mahendra’s reign. Most people before probably didn’t even know who he was except for the people of Kirtipur who have had a grudge against him for a long time.|||The painting was commissioned by Kind Mahendra and was done by Amar Chitrakar in the 60s. I find this essay quite informative on the modern retelling of the Shah dynasty’s history.   https://www.tasveergharindia.net/essay/nepal-visual-prithvinarayan.html|||This makes sense because it is not a photo but a painting.|||yeslai art bhanxa|||The hand gesture showing unity is also made during mahendra period. Before this the painting or sketch was unidentifiable from malla kings.|||AI ho Ai .|||This painting was painted after 1962. There.|||Read somewhere, this painting was also interpretive, commissioned by Mahendra. That commission included ‘Dibya Upadesh’ as well. There was a discussion on Twitter some time ago and some one posted a Mithila style portait if PNS and said thats the only known portrait of him from his time.|||\"who rules the present, rules the past.\"|||Doesnt Prithvi Narayan Shah looks like Mahendra even though they are 7 generations apart. Maybe thats the answer.|||If u want to talk specifically about the falg. Hamro falg kinda of old and much of tantric symbol. It predates Prithivi himself. If u go some old tantric temple there are those flag . Prithivi was into tantra himself (people say he used it throughout the war) also remember that his and gorakhnath relationship. So yeah it is much older than we think|||Hamro नेपाली flag ko history is about 5000 yrs old , lumbini ma ni भेटेको हो archelogy ले  यो 2 ओटा traingle मात्र हैन एस्को dimenson हरु calculative हिसाब ले मिलाउन पर्छ other it dont wave, aerodynamics को कुरा नी आउँछ ,  Dont take it lightly guys , nepal बुझ्न अलिक गारो नै छ|||This was likely commissioned by the Eoyal family post 1962AD. The painting was done by Amar Chitrakar, here in Kathmandu. Noone actually knew how Prithivi Narayan Shah looked like, so it was an assumption. The unity finger was also kind of an assumption.|||Who gives a f()ck, the artist took creative freedom, jay nepal !!!   Nepal’s true identity is in the future, not the past. There is no need to turn history books.|||TIL|||The real PNS would look mixed just like NEWARS .|||They portray unification but inflict con moves to divide the citizens. Harka sampang has already talked about this but alas he is now showed as a divider mentalist.  Tsl tsk. Nepal.|||You got anything against the Nepalese flag?|||That hand gestures is added later too.

Try to see what kind of narrative UML is spreading.   The most likely candidate is Gagan. Old Congressis will vote for Gagan (2022's biggest party) and pull in the progressive vote also.|||A lot of assumptions but yeah I think the good thing after this Gen-z protests has been that the tauke haru are out or almost out of electoral politics. Deuba is gone, Prachanda went to the easiest constituency for Maobadi to win but even there he’s going up against the son of two Maobadi soldiers who lost their lives in the Maoist insurgency and KP Oli looks very likely to lose he is scrambling everywhere.   Honestly had Gagan not done his bisesh mahadivesh, the 3 parties already had plans to form a coalition and fight the election as one alliance. And it is his stance of not forming any coalition that we have such a strong competition now. But I’m not gonna lie, nothing is fundamentally going to change whoever comes to power. There doesn’t seem to be any proposal for institutional change in Nepal. RSP is basically running on “Out with the old and In with the new” but not new policies (case in point Balen’s Socialist tilt, his post about that cement factory etc).  It seems they just mean out with old people and in with the younger people. Gagan talks about institutional change, how he is going to be the Tony Blair of Nepal and bring about the “Third Way” and revise Nepal’s economy back to the 90’s era of liberalism. And that all sounds good but knowing Congress, a party that is so deeply entrenched in the status quo, I don’t buy it.

I support balen !|||I honestly don’t know if people in this thread don’t want Balen to win or are just grossly overestimating old parties. Or whether I am delusional.  This election is the by-product of a major revolution which overthrew the government. The opposition has won every single election following revolutions - Jana Andolan I (Nepal Congress won the elections after the dissolution of Panchayat) - Jana Andolan II (CPN Maoist won the 2008 constituent assembly). RSP is the radical opposition as most of the influential figureheads of the revolution have now joined the party.  And you can clearly see the hype behind Balen and how RSP became a top 4 party in just 6 months of formation in the last election.   Oli might have won numerous elections in Jhapa-5, but I would put my money on Balen from a statistical perspective. Most importantly, he won with a 55.7% share in the 2022 elections. Why do you think it’s so hard to topple him over? And with Balen out of all the people|||Oli is not going to get defeated that easily. I want Balen to win but truth is Jhapa ma he is strong.

            "body": "I and two of my friends (they both abroad now) had once planned to open a Chhyang Factory in Nepal.   Before anything, I did thorough research, budget allocation, finding international markets, our cultural ties to the drink, even learnt to craft it with help of my Newar Friend circle and their families. For the extension of the project I went to Ilam in search of world class millet and spices. Got few leads, came back bought equipments and started making it. Everything was precise, the ferns and ferments, batch tested almost died drinking the first batch, created and recreated again to make a perfect batch. I had documented every single activity.   Now just to be sure, I first went to IRO, the main office of revenue, Lazimpat to check if the laws of Nepal permits Chhyang; and the officials were quite helpful about it, they turned the pages, pointed out Chhyang as rice beer and mentioned it was taxed 10/- NPR per liter as per the laws of Nepal.   Quite hopeful, we set up a meeting with the director of DOI for the next day, stayed all night to give final touch to our documentations, confident that we will be able to establish one.   Next day, both technical and general directors were in the room during our appointment. We presented our plan, applications and the available resources we had for the establishment.   “Bhanne bittikai tesari paincha?” The first words from the reputed officials. It might not be simple but we had our budget, the land lease requirements, technical scheme, and everything intact.   Our point was, “Nepal ko identity drink Korea bata import huncha, with hefty taxes, but if we do it here instead, we would be able to minimize import, provide employment opportunities and possibly export it too!”  I know Korea has it there as their drink as Makgeolli, but merely importing it instead of making chhyang here makes no sense.   After long discussion, the directors came to the conclusion that we submit our proposal with all the schemes, technicalities and budget and then have a meeting with the industry board lead by then minster for Industry, Mahesh Basnet.  We shook our heads, submitted our file, told that we will be called someday for this matter, could be tomorrow or 10 years from now.   We almost gave up at that point. Now both my friends are abroad, promising to return back if they call, but no one calls.   I don’t expect them to call, but sometimes I go to various chatpate stalls just to check if I find the pages of our documentation wrapping those 20/- or 50/- ko chatpate.   TL;DR  1. Nepal imports korean makgeolli as Chhyang, full of preservatives to keep it alive for a ling time.   2. Thoroughly researched-made documentations, technical schemes, budget allocations for establishing Chhyang as a well-lived Nepali Drink.  3. Visited IRO, the main revenue office and got a green flag from them for the establishment.   4. DOI doesn’t give a f\\*ck, instead implied that this is not possible as their books doesn’t recognize Chhyang, so asked us to submit the proposal documents and their classic “pachi aaunu”.  5. Friends gave up moved abroad. I still check if I can find the pages of the proposal wrapped in Chatpates or Badams.",

Caste systems let the upper castes feel special about themselves without having to do one damn thing to earn it. You're special, just because of how you were born. Similar to how religious people feel great about praying for those in need - it does nothing to help the needy, takes zero effort, accomplishes nothing, and it yet makes the person who prays feel like they did something special.  To answer your question, I'd say maybe because a lot of us are simply not good people. Most of us are not good people to those we have been indoctrinated to think as \"others.\" Heck! Some of us are awful even to our children, parents, spouses, and friends.   The person who did this has no empathy, doesn't understand that there is nothing special about being born as an upper cast, but has been indoctrinated probably right from birth to look down on others and to feel superior to others.

Like wtf is wrong with you guys?|||People usually miscalculate the complexity of human beings, even if those people are globe-renowned scientists or thinkers. We tend to reduce individuals into neat categories of \"good\" or \"bad,\" when in reality most human lives exist somewhere in a moral gray space.  The figures are indeed contributions to modern society, having shaped our understanding of the universe in the case of Stephen Hawking and the overwhelming propagation of personal computing that underpins everyday life, thanks to Bill Gates. Their contributions are objective in nature, measured, and historically significant.  The Epstein case has indeed cast a sinister shadow on the reputations and personal integrity of those associated with it. Any wrongdoing ought to be investigated, prosecuted, and judged on its merits. Accountability counts.  Yet, it is quite dangerous to erase or dismiss intellectual and scientific contributions on the basis of particular personal moral failures; by doing so, it is an effort to distort history. If we were to get rid of every successful idea that had come from flawed individuals, much of human progress would disappear along with those who themselves were flawed.  We can—and should—condemn bad behavior without discarding valuable, valid contributions to knowledge and society.  Scientists are more likely to value human progress, curiosity, and long-term thinking—but they are not immune to moral failure. Their work can be noble even when their personal lives are flawed. Judgment must be based on evidence, not archetypes.|||Not remove but edit by keeping his bad pedophilic side in the chapter.Let the readers decide what to think of him by reading his biography.|||He did biggest contribution for science.

However, his contributions to the physics community are unimaginable. As a physics student, I was inspired by his book A Brief History of Time. When it comes to moral responsibility, I believe we should take such matters seriously. However, removing his biography from textbooks is not justified. As far as I know, he was never convicted; he was only accused, largely based on a photograph. If we consider that he was a famous person known for his intellect, it is also possible that people simply wanted to take a picture with him. It could have been anything, but jumping to conclusions is not fair. The mindset of “guilty until proven innocent,” which is common in Nepali society, can seriously damage someone’s reputation, whether they are living or deceased. I also saw someone arguing that other scientists went to that island as well. Yes, that could be possible. They may have gone there for donations or funding. People should also understand how research and experiments work. Many scientists attend seminars, conferences, and even social events to secure funding from wealthy donors for their research projects. That is part of how scientific funding operates. It may sound unpleasant, but it is often the reality. However, concluding that they raped minors without concrete evidence is unreasonable. From my perspective, why don’t we conduct our own research before forming judgments? We know he was famous. We can consult medical professionals or simply search the internet regarding his medical condition after paralysis—you understand what I mean….|||Does his contribution to the science and the world will be false because his name was in epstein file?  Naive People like you think the world exist in black and white?|||Those who're saying his professional works matter only, then ig Sanduk Ruit's biography was removed!

For us however, this is our first horrible man made mass scale event.    for example my mother told these are the events she witnessed, heard about ( there was no internet and reporters were getting chhopped up so source is her words and the fear and disgust in her eyes when talking about it)   i, maobadi kidnapped her school science teacher and tied him to the ground and they started nailing him with large and small nails from the legs and hands, slowly and all over his whole body,   ii. they kidnapped a man form his house at night, made him collect firewood from the forest , they started a fire, like a campfire, beside the fire they asked the kidnapped man to dig up a hole, he did exactly what they said. and after all that in the morning they invited many people from the village including his family members, and they burried him alive with his head sticking out form the  ground so that he could hear and see what was happening and finally they covered his head with the burning coals .    these are just examples and your and my parents have seen/ heard about a lot of similar killings kidnapping , public beheading etc  From their point of view, The old parties have maintained peace, ended such horrible war so they have gained a lot of trust. The old parties have shown their strength, in ending rana rule to ending civil war to ending king's direct rule and our parents know what the political paties gave them the rights and freedom which they have now.    So They're willing to bet one more time that These parties can and will always uphold our sovereignty, freedom and country as a whole.  So it is our duty to make them trust the newer political parties,    it is our duty to make them understand that we will not let the sacrifices and changes made by the old political parties Go to ruin ( the rights and freedom given by the constitution).    It is our duty to make them understand that the the political parties which ended rana rule and the kings rule  are themselves becomming similar elites.    It is our duty to make them understand that the old parties are using similar dictatorial practices which our parent and grand parents fought and ended.  And this is not going to be fast and easy, this is a long process will take years and years.   If you cannot convince your family members think how difficult it  is going to make a stranger understand.  And one more question, why would they listen to you. You are so short sighted and narrow minded. you want people to do exactly what you want them to do just because you said it. You start name calling your family members when they questioned choice which you made for them. They gave their reasons why they're voting. And they are damn right on questioning balen. Why should they trust him, just because he and the media said it.  Isn't that we all be doing, questioning . and They are questioning, You failed to give them answers. Its all on you. Have you asked yourself why should i vote balen?? What answer did you get Try answering without using the words like \"purano party\" \"yemale\" etc. does your answer focus more on old parties or the plans and policies for the country. If it is the first choice you're the veda.  One more thing, it is very sad, but the number of people you've killed does not really seem to matter in national level politics. Prachanda has claimed responsibility for 5000 killings. He became PM multiple times. He has sent kids of 13 and 14 years to the front lines to be used as a cannon fodder.   In short, your parents have seen very brutal violence and They know how bad things will be if old parties get elected but They do not know anything about the newer one. ( might be better or might be wayyy bad.) so they're picking certainity instead of incertainity.     |||vote waste garxa euta generation   dukha paauxa arko generation|||Balen haryo bhane, it's not the end of the world.

GenZ are immature in terms of voting cause we have probably voted once or this is the first time. We are new, expecting more. But our parents generation they already voted several times, they got Maoist, UML, Congress sabko sarkar whenever they needed. Everytime they had hope it got shattered.    It's not their problem, the problem is our country itself. We are landlocked, we can't manufacture anything at all. We have majority of human resources in another country. How can we expect our country to be developed?   With global power shifts too near, I'm afraid whichever party comes to power, if they can't be diplomatic it's gonna be more problematic.  Especially this issue comes in new parties as they have worse instrusive philosophy diplomatic policies.  Simply vanda jun jogi aayeni desh ma resources navako jadu tuna garera aaudaina.

There are a few who do but there’s always an exception.   Now many, including myself, do support some level of checks and restrictions on immigration. Those who didn’t get in take that as being opportunistic or slamming the door after I got in. Far from it.   What I don’t support is people coming through illegal means. What I don’t support is people cheating and providing 100% false representation while applying. Then once they get in, they try to game the system and just be a leech sucking in the benefits without contributing. They are making it harder for the legitimate immigrants and that’s exactly what we hate.  Now I don’t support the current position of not granting any immigration visa indefinitely to Nepal. But you know why this happened? Because almost 40% of Nepalis, about 70-80k take welfare benefits from the US government. You don’t need it if you are a contributing member of the society (except for in some disability/age related case).   There are people coming to US to get free medical treatment. One performer got the treatment and left the Us without paying the medical bills- that person is now banned from coming. Another famous pair got the DV and justified their entry by saying they get free medical for their kid (their case may be legit, but I am just giving an example of what people have been doing).   The administration is going to the other extreme to curb this- but some of it is because the past administration didn’t do anything to prevent it from happening.|||I seriously doubt the accuracy of this sentiment. Nepalis who have settled in America invariably work to bring other family members here. The effort is long and hard, and many are still in process, meaning that spouses, siblings, and others are now cut off from coming over. My brother in-law was able to finally secure his wife's visa a few weeks ago, after working on it for 2 years.  a few weeks later and she wouldn't get to come, so no, Nepali uncles and aunties aren't supportive, and there is no indication that most nepalis voted for trump.  The other thing to consider is the message behind the visa suspensions.  The trump administration is basically saying that immigrants who have come here have not improved conditions, but rather they have made it worse by taking advantage of government programs that they are not entitled to. In other words immigrants are lazy, and thieves. Not a lot to take pride in about that.|||Let me know what you are smoking..seems like good stuff.|||Just like the viral trend chori manchey ko khutta tanney chori manchey naai huncha.

They pay taxes since it's automatically deducted from the paycheck to a social security number that doesn't belong to them. If they try to use the services they're caught and deported  We're fighting back but our leaders are ineffective, the police are working with ICE and if we call in the military we're unsure of whose side they'll take.

Not everyone who votes Republican is \"hiding the ladder since they've made it\". That claim is lazy, false, and ignores basic economic reality.  Some of us vote based on numbers, not slogans. When you are paying over $100,000 a year in taxes (household)—income tax, state tax, property tax, sales tax—and you don’t see proportional benefits in return, fiscal policy starts to matter a lot. At that level, voting conservative isn’t ideological—it’s rational. Lower taxes, limited government, and accountability in spending simply align better with that reality.  Paying six figures into the system and being told you’re “privileged,” “selfish,” or morally inferior for questioning where that money goes is not persuasive—it’s alienating. Wanting to keep more of what you earn does not make you hateful. It makes you financially literate.  Many Republican voters reject racism and extremism outright. What they do reject is runaway taxation, bloated government, and being constantly generalized or morally lectured by people whose policies they fundamentally can’t relate to. The same way not all Democrats are extremists, not all Republicans are villains.  And yes—we are also tired of being lumped together with fringe elements just because we don’t align with extreme progressive ideology. Disagreeing with activist politics, identity absolutism, or ideological purity tests does not make someone anti-human. It means they prioritize practicality over performative outrage.  People vote based on lived experience. For households paying $100k+ in taxes every year, conservative policies often make more sense. That’s not hate. That’s math.",

Truly sad.|||[removed]|||True we have a huge tourism potential and we could be a destination for adventure sports. Besides trekking (but it's amazing what Nepal offers) we can offer lots of stuff like you mentioned but what we lack is infrastructure. How do you get to the trail head to start your mountain biking? Yes we have roads but how reliable are them. We have seen the safety records. If a rider gets into an accident how fast can medics reach him or her. How are they transferred to the nearest hospital safely.  We could be a destination for high altitude training camps like in Kenya or Colorado or Arizona but again what can we offer besides altitude. We have trails but do we have tracks for the work out ? Do we have a combination of flat and hilly lands around that altitude because Nepal's altitude rises rapidly in a very short distance. I know about a high altitude training program in Jumla. Hope that is a success. Training camp would need a good infra as well like basic PT, Gym, Recovery stuff etc.  We have the potential but we need to harness it. Harness in a sustainable way because if we are to increase the number of tourist sustainability is important, safety records are important because the majority of tourists consider everything, risk vs reward. I hope you succeed in your future endeavors but I suggest you to travel abroad to check the Tourism Sector before you venture on yours. Nearest is Thailand , you could see how they have harnessed their tourism potential. Their service industry compared to any other country in the region is miles ahead. Infrastructure, hospitality, transport etc they have it covered.

But the infrastructure just isn’t there yet. Close neighbor who has done it well is Thailand - their tourism industry and volume are another level. Their roads, airports, hospitality, foods, entertainment, tourist police to ensure safety, etc. make it easy to attract tourists.|||Isn’t the lack of infrastructure in Nepal part of what makes it appealing? Difficulty getting to a destination creates meaning. When everything becomes easy, it turns into disposable content for a feed. You don’t get profound experiences, you get optimized tourism.

Were those AI-generated, as your party president and many party leaders were claiming?  - You have raised the Sahakari Kanda involving Rabi Lamichhane, but when will you raise the same question about your own party member, Maya Rai, who was also a member of the same sahakari in Kathmandu (I’ve forgotten the name)? What about the Dhanraj Gurung sahakari case?  - You were part of the Government Efficiency team when the recent UML–Congress coalition government was formed. Will you question or take responsibility for the recent GenZ killings? Your party member Ramesh Lekhak was also the Home Minister at that time—have you questioned him about this?  - You have been a Member of Parliament four times, and during your tenure, the Congress has formed the government multiple times. Can you point to any concrete, policy-level achievements you delivered during your party’s time in government?  - What about Aftab Alam case during your party's government was he rightfully being prosecuted or your party's government have him impunity from jail, what about that case?",

Deuba, as an individual, may once have been a true leader—but over time, the gang culture around him is what turned everything rotten and made him look bhrasta.  From this point onward, Gagan is free.  Free from:  All blame linked to Arzu  All accusations about money in Deuba’s house  All baggage related to Bhutani saranarthi  All the kandas, Teramox, and backroom deals  All blame connected to Lekhaks and their networks  These were never Gagan’s sins to carry.  So why should he keep answering for other people’s cults? Why should a reformist voice be held hostage by the corruption, compromises, and power games of an old guard that refuses to let go?  If anyone needs to answer, it’s the system that protected those networks for decades—not the one who finally challenged them.  Gagan doesn’t need to answer anymore. The Mahadibesan already did.|||He can give you wai wai, not sure about answers.

Don't get me wrong there are shortcomings from him and nobody is perfect but most of the questions you raised here are poor attempt to make him look bad.  You have to realize that even though Gagan is a prominient member of Nepali Congress, he was never the executive. Every decision the party makes as a whole, the chairman (Deuba) has the supreme authority and he is little to no say in any of the decisions.  Even then, he has clearly spoken against all wrongdoings. And you say \"just speak\". But that's the problem of not being in executive power, he can only speak.  You trying to  make the money burnt in Deuba's house somehow a crime by Gagan Thapa clearly tells me that you are just trying to hate. Otherwise as everyone else has said, there is a special probe commission formed to specifically study the burnt money case and all we can do is wait for their report and the government will file the case if there is wrongdoing (which we all believe there is). And Gagan has clearly affirmed this, as any sane person would. You should read him and listen his many public interviews/videos and not just assume he didn't say anything.  He has clearly said multiple times that any and all involved in sahakari kanda should be investigated including naming people from his own party by name, again multiple times in multiple of his public appearences and writings, you should read/watch/listen those. The government should file cases. I don't understand how this would be his fault.  If you again watch his comments in good faith and listen to his parliament speeches, he as said multiple times that  the public is angry, they need delivery. He said he opposed the coalition and publicly opposed it multiple times. But he is not the executive, deuba is. When there is coaliation, he has the moral responsibility to make the government successful. He was indeed in the efficiency team and he said he tried is best to make the government successful because he knew people needed delivery even though he opposed the coalition. He publicly told long before the Gen-Z protest that he couldn't get the government to do what the efficiency team was supposed to do, and he left it. So I don't think that makes him culpable for the massacre during gen-z protest.  But still he has taken moral responsibility for what happened during the protest. He has apologized multiple times for any moral culpability he has. He said he immediately asked the party leadership to break coaliation in the first day of protest and asked Lekhak to resign. Lekhak did resign but the party didn't leave coalition because again Deuba is executive and makes the decision.  He has been parliament member four times. The first time and he failed to deliver the constitution as promised which he was elected for. The second tenure was again the CA election, which delivered the constitution and you can't deny he played crucial role in making the constitution, and he (among all others) delivered the constitution. The next term he went to the parliament again and became health minister and people say he delivered some reforms in health sector (again refer to public catalogues of his works during this tenure). And you have to grant that he has been constant voice in the parliament on various issues, which the MP is sent for. This last time was a short tenure, but as everyone he has played crucial role in voicing concerns in the parliament. Ironically he strongly demanded there be independent probe in sahakari case and there have been multiple arrests and cases filed against some major fraudsters. You should grant that this was successfull. But we can always demand more. I am not his prabakta but to me seems like he could have definitely done more here and I am sure he agrees.  Yeah what about the case? Alam was a proven convict. But congress did dirty by lobbying to release him. I haven't seen him support Alam's release. Again, I am not sure the details of his release but how is Gagan culpable for the crime Alam committed?  Again I am not his prabakta. I try to speak with reason. You could certainly question that he didn't do enough at policy level as MP to propose new laws and pass them. You could ask him that he could not do enough to break Deuba stronghold. But he precisely did that recently.  Now I am watching him closely, he is now in the position to deliver at least from his party level. Make him accountable ask him tough questions. But the aforementioned questions seemed more like an attempt to make him bad (except may be how many policy changed did he make in 1 1/2 tenure as MP except CA MP which they delivered constitution).

Record anusar, statue was commissioned by Vishugupta of the gupta dynasty (son of the more famous Jisnugupta) tyeti bela Lichhavi dynasty was like a vassal state to the gupta dynasty. Ani bishnugupta Kathmandu airaney belama yo statue commission gareko. Made from nagdhunga (basal stone).  Yo statue chai harako thiyo (puriyeko) maybe due to lack of maintenance, earthquake who knows.   Malla raja ko palama euta kisan ley khanney belama bhettayo yo murti feri. Legend was that he hit the statue's toe and blood gushed out. Tyeti bela, for myriad of reason, it was named budhanilkantha. Probably because theological literacy wasn't high/ maybe the farmer was more of shiva bhakta. Maybe the coutnry was in the shiva bhakta phase as later royal families have been heavy shiva bhaktas.   Until later, when people recognized, ahh you bishnu ho siva hoina it's name was already 'sealed' as budhanilkantha, including the name for the area. Hence it's called budhanilkantha ani narayanthan.   |||Aww man I stole so much money  and fruits from this temple  When I was homeless.|||It is believed that a mirror image of Lord Shiva can be seen on the underside of the statue, which is surrounded by water from Gosainkunda (a lake created by Shiva).|||TLDR; Honestly, it’s Narayan (Vishnu), but you’d be surprised how often people get confused and wonder if it’s actually Buddha instead of Shiva.  From what I’ve read, the evidence leans much more toward it being a Narayana site. Budhanilakantha is one of only three Jalashayana Narayana (Vishnu sleeping on the cosmic waters) in Kathmandu Valley as far as I know. The other two are at Balaju (erected by the same patron king AFAIK)  and inside Hanuman Dhoka Palace, though that one was added much later by Pratap Malla.  Some old chronicles say that King Haridutta, around 350 A.D., built Budhanilakantha and also set up four other Narayana temples at the four corners of the Kathmandu Valley. That’s Changu, Bishankhu, Ichangu, and Shesh Narayan. Even today, people try to visit all four in one day, which is basically like doing a Narayan dham within valley. And very surprisingly, if you add Budhanilkantha (as fifth point) into the map it forms the legendary \"Khadga\" shape which is described to be the shape of ancient Kathmandu Town Planning. More so, these Narayana Shrines are located cardinally to each other which makes it much cooler (I cant infer much more from it than that lol). Here is the image for y'all to see: [https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0](https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0)  There’s also this story that King Haridutta saw Jalashayana Narayana in a dream, telling him to dig up the original image buried under the Rudramati riverbed. So he built a pond and installed the sculpture there, along with the four corner temples. This is confusing because , other historical analyses and inscriptions suggest the image was consecrated by ruler Visnugupta around 5th century A.D, much later than Haridutta.  The statue itself is amazing. It’s the largest stone sculpture in the Kathmandu Valley, carved from a single block of dark granite. Some stories say they dragged it across the Valley with forced labor, but some scholars argue the granite was actually nearby in the Shivapuri hills, which makes more sense (in some article by Sudarshan Raj  Tiwari, I am not sure). So I dont know which one is more valid, this or the claim mentioned by u/ZoWakaki above me.  Now, the most interesting part is that Buddhists also worship this image as Nilakantha Lokesvara, a form of Avalokitesvara. Avalokiteshvara is considered to be a form of Shiva in Buddhism or vise-a-versa, which can be one way where the Shiva/Vishnu connection in Budhanilkantha comes in place. In fact, if you look closely, you can almost see the Buddha’s forehead in the face of the sleeping Vishnu. Even the long ears of the statue are very reminiscent of Buddhist iconography we see around the valley.  As for the name Budhanilakantha, there’s a story about Shiva drinking poison during the Samudra Manthan. His throat was burning, so he struck the mountain with his trishul and created Gosaikunda Lake. The water from that lake is said to flow down to the pond at Budhanilakantha, and since Shiva’s called Nilakantha, that might be how the place got its name.

            "body": "I was flying from Nepal to the USA with Turkish Airlines. I know the baggage allowance clearly: 23 + 23 kg checked, 12 kg carry-on. At home, my bags were 23 + 22 kg, and my carry-on was 20 kg.  At the check-in counter, the agent told me to move some items from my carry-on into one checked bag so I’d only have to pay excess for one bag. I did exactly that and reduced my carry-on to 12 kg.  Magically, after this:  •\tChecked bags became 32 kg and 25 kg    •\tCarry-on became 13 kg  Somehow, between weighing the bags at home, weighing them again at the counter, and then re-weighing them a third time, my bags gained weight out of nowhere.  I was exhausted and didn’t have the energy to argue, so they charged me for two excess bags — $80 each. No leeway, no consideration.  To make things worse, the agent openly suggested that if I paid cash and didn’t need a receipt, they could lower the price. At that point it was obvious they were trying to pocket the money. Absolutely shameless.  I paid by card, waited until they gave me a proper Turkish Airlines receipt, and made sure everything was legit.  If you’re flying Turkish Airlines out of Tribhuvan International Airport, I strongly suggest avoiding the chubby girl working at the Turkish Airlines check-in counter. She was incompetent from the start — struggling to even open the computer system and issue a boarding pass, while agents at nearby counters were processing passengers with ease.  Extremely bad service and blatant attempts at corruption. This kind of experience is one of the many reasons I seriously hesitate to visit Nepal anymore.",

Happened to me in airport outside nepal as well.  The main difference is that airport scales are \"trade-legal\" industrial devices required by law to be regularly calibrated for high precision, whereas home scales are consumer-grade gadgets that use cheaper sensors and are almost never recalibrated. Additionally, the environment distorts the numbers; weighing a bag on a soft home carpet or trying to balance a large suitcase on a small bathroom scale often creates a \"lighter\" reading than reality, unlike the airport's large, stable platforms embedded in hard concrete. Because of this, the airport scale is generally accurate, while your home scale is just an estimate that tends to drift.|||[removed]|||Are we allowed to video record our interactions there?

            "comments": "Much of what we call national Nepal today was shaped by the effort of King Mahendra. Before his time, even school textbooks were in Hindi, children literally had to read “हमारा देशका नाम नेपाल है”. That alone shows how fragile our national identity once was.  Ask yourself, why can’t we clearly distinguish Amar Singh Thapa from Bhimsen Thapa? Because most of the portraits we rely on were painted by the same court artists during King Mahendra’s era. The same question applies to Divya Upadesh, where was it for all those years? Why did it suddenly surface and gain prominence later?  Maybe some things were rediscovered, maybe some were reconstructed, we may never know for sure. But what is certain is this, King Mahendra played a decisive role in nationalising Nepal’s identity, language, history, and sense of self. Fabricated or rediscovered, those efforts unified a fragmented country. And that, undeniably, was a great deed.|||Because this painting was made during the reign of King Mahendra to show brave king Prithvi Narayan Shah as there was no proper art of King Prithvi Narayan.|||Well that's art not history.|||Glad you are exploring this topic. Feels like you are also curious about history and socio-political anthropology.  Mahendra was driven by political consolidation and a single national narrative. His reign coincided with serious regional instability. To the north, Mao’s Cultural Revolution was unfolding in China. To the down   East Pakistan was breaking away to form Bangladesh. In that context, there was a real fear that Nepal’s sovereignty and internal cohesion could be threatened.  As a result, many reforms and symbols were manufactured or standardized during his tenure to construct a unified national identity. This included the bringing of civil service  (bureaucracy, police, army), the national anthem, the national dress (daura suruwal and dakha topi), the national curriculum (mahendra mala), and the formalization of historical narratives and political doctrine.  Much of what is presented as *Divya Upadesh* guidence book from Prithvi Narayan Shah was entirely manufactured and institutionalized during Mahendra’s rule. From the iconic image of Prithvi Narayan Shah, including his gestures of index finger pointing upward direction (we are one unity symbolism), facial features, dress, and artistic representations, to the moral and political messages attributed to him, these were part of a deliberate political project rather than an untouched historical inheritance.  It is also important to remember that during Prithvi Narayan Shah’s time, there was no modern India or China as nation-states. Phrases like “dui dhunga ko tarul” were reframed as geopolitical doctrine. The *Divya Upadesh* attributed to him was manufactured, published, and promoted during Mahendra’s tenure, much like the Mahendra mala national curriculum that emphasizes narratives such as the Nepal–Anglo war was fought bravely and Nepal being “second richest in water resources.” These were not neutral historical facts but components of a deliberate nation-building strategy.|||It’s kind of a propaganda painting. It’s not that uncommon in the world . Look at that Khukuri thing next to his throne. What even is that lol 😂? Even that pose was created for the purpose of propaganda. That one finger pointing upwards saying we are one ☝️. We don’t even know what he actually looked like. No description even exists. It was all created during Mahendra’s reign. Most people before probably didn’t even know who he was except for the people of Kirtipur who have had a grudge against him for a long time.|||The painting was commissioned by Kind Mahendra and was done by Amar Chitrakar in the 60s.

Try to see what kind of narrative UML is spreading.   The most likely candidate is Gagan. Old Congressis will vote for Gagan (2022's biggest party) and pull in the progressive vote also.|||A lot of assumptions but yeah I think the good thing after this Gen-z protests has been that the tauke haru are out or almost out of electoral politics. Deuba is gone, Prachanda went to the easiest constituency for Maobadi to win but even there he’s going up against the son of two Maobadi soldiers who lost their lives in the Maoist insurgency and KP Oli looks very likely to lose he is scrambling everywhere.   Honestly had Gagan not done his bisesh mahadivesh, the 3 parties already had plans to form a coalition and fight the election as one alliance. And it is his stance of not forming any coalition that we have such a strong competition now. But I’m not gonna lie, nothing is fundamentally going to change whoever comes to power. There doesn’t seem to be any proposal for institutional change in Nepal. RSP is basically running on “Out with the old and In with the new” but not new policies (case in point Balen’s Socialist tilt, his post about that cement factory etc).  It seems they just mean out with old people and in with the younger people. Gagan talks about institutional change, how he is going to be the Tony Blair of Nepal and bring about the “Third Way” and revise Nepal’s economy back to the 90’s era of liberalism. And that all sounds good but knowing Congress, a party that is so deeply entrenched in the status quo, I don’t buy it.   Atleast we will get new faces in parliament, some people seem to be very funny so we will get new contents to laugh at.|||Balen is a wrong choice, mark my comment|||The way Gagan led this time is history, natra pheri Oli ra Deuba milera paila kai khel khelthe|||Just two different player to manipulate bheda public.|||Mark my words ,gagan will be pm after election.|||If gagan will be Pm then it is only possible from congress's alliance of rsp  So  Rsp won't be in opposition anyhow|||bro dont take oli lightly in jhapa he won there 5 time huu|||[removed]|||Balen might not win, jhapalis are not ready for change yet, sorry but the later is a fact !

This election is the by-product of a major revolution which overthrew the government. The opposition has won every single election following revolutions - Jana Andolan I (Nepal Congress won the elections after the dissolution of Panchayat) - Jana Andolan II (CPN Maoist won the 2008 constituent assembly). RSP is the radical opposition as most of the influential figureheads of the revolution have now joined the party.  And you can clearly see the hype behind Balen and how RSP became a top 4 party in just 6 months of formation in the last election.   Oli might have won numerous elections in Jhapa-5, but I would put my money on Balen from a statistical perspective. Most importantly, he won with a 55.7% share in the 2022 elections. Why do you think it’s so hard to topple him over? And with Balen out of all the people|||Oli is not going to get defeated that easily. I want Balen to win but truth is Jhapa ma he is strong.

There seems to be a sudden surge of tourists who come only to make content, create mess, and show no respect for the city. It doesn’t feel like tourism anymore it feels careless.On top of that, the local leadership has also disappointed me.

            "body": "I and two of my friends (they both abroad now) had once planned to open a Chhyang Factory in Nepal.   Before anything, I did thorough research, budget allocation, finding international markets, our cultural ties to the drink, even learnt to craft it with help of my Newar Friend circle and their families. For the extension of the project I went to Ilam in search of world class millet and spices. Got few leads, came back bought equipments and started making it. Everything was precise, the ferns and ferments, batch tested almost died drinking the first batch, created and recreated again to make a perfect batch. I had documented every single activity.   Now just to be sure, I first went to IRO, the main office of revenue, Lazimpat to check if the laws of Nepal permits Chhyang; and the officials were quite helpful about it, they turned the pages, pointed out Chhyang as rice beer and mentioned it was taxed 10/- NPR per liter as per the laws of Nepal.   Quite hopeful, we set up a meeting with the director of DOI for the next day, stayed all night to give final touch to our documentations, confident that we will be able to establish one.   Next day, both technical and general directors were in the room during our appointment. We presented our plan, applications and the available resources we had for the establishment.   “Bhanne bittikai tesari paincha?” The first words from the reputed officials. It might not be simple but we had our budget, the land lease requirements, technical scheme, and everything intact.   Our point was, “Nepal ko identity drink Korea bata import huncha, with hefty taxes, but if we do it here instead, we would be able to minimize import, provide employment opportunities and possibly export it too!”  I know Korea has it there as their drink as Makgeolli, but merely importing it instead of making chhyang here makes no sense.   After long discussion, the directors came to the conclusion that we submit our proposal with all the schemes, technicalities and budget and then have a meeting with the industry board lead by then minster for Industry, Mahesh Basnet.  We shook our heads, submitted our file, told that we will be called someday for this matter, could be tomorrow or 10 years from now.   We almost gave up at that point. Now both my friends are abroad, promising to return back if they call, but no one calls.   I don’t expect them to call, but sometimes I go to various chatpate stalls just to check if I find the pages of our documentation wrapping those 20/- or 50/- ko chatpate.   TL;DR  1. Nepal imports korean makgeolli as Chhyang, full of preservatives to keep it alive for a ling time.   2. Thoroughly researched-made documentations, technical schemes, budget allocations for establishing Chhyang as a well-lived Nepali Drink.  3. Visited IRO, the main revenue office and got a green flag from them for the establishment.   4. DOI doesn’t give a f\\*ck, instead implied that this is not possible as their books doesn’t recognize Chhyang, so asked us to submit the proposal documents and their classic “pachi aaunu”.  5. Friends gave up moved abroad. I still check if I can find the pages of the proposal wrapped in Chatpates or Badams.",

I know why he is liked by so many given how dysfunctional your political system as been lately, but Balen's performance during his stint wasn't that great either. Sadly, no culture of constructive criticism in Nepal.|||I am satisfied with his work because I know it’s not easy. The system itself is messed up, so obviously one person alone can’t fix everything on their own. There will be tons of hurdles, especially in the capital city of the country. Not just the capital, honestly, you can even say Kathmandu as Nepal itself, because it has become the center for everything. No matter what work you have, you somehow have to come to Kathmandu for it. So yeah, I understand his situation.  The one thing I really criticize him for is his lack of communication. That is something I am very disappointed about. During his entire campaign, he kept saying that he wouldn’t be like previous mayors and that he would stay in constant communication with the public. But after winning, he almost completely stopped connecting with people. There is no proper accountability, just one-sided Facebook status updates. This is the part where I am extremely disappointed in him and openly criticize him.  Other than that, I think he has actually shown that work can be done. He has also given inspiration to young people to enter politics.|||Done In some ways  . Even non Exciting programs .Some Jhara tareko type. Some Unfeasible .. some better options appear and done.

It didn’t took me long to understand that he was just overhyped.   After he joined RSP where each members are opportunistic and work in Nepal for western interests it’s clear that he is not good candidate for prime minister.  He was voted to serve as a mayor, He could have waited until next election but for him misusing people’s trust and make them go against government by burning the Nation was easiest way to experience power.

For \"Upper class,\" lower classes are the others. For Jews, Arabs are the others. For Shia, Sunnis are the others. For Nepalis, Indians are the others. So on and so forth...  Caste systems let the upper castes feel special about themselves without having to do one damn thing to earn it. You're special, just because of how you were born. Similar to how religious people feel great about praying for those in need - it does nothing to help the needy, takes zero effort, accomplishes nothing, and it yet makes the person who prays feel like they did something special.  To answer your question, I'd say maybe because a lot of us are simply not good people. Most of us are not good people to those we have been indoctrinated to think as \"others.\" Heck! Some of us are awful even to our children, parents, spouses, and friends.   The person who did this has no empathy, doesn't understand that there is nothing special about being born as an upper cast, but has been indoctrinated probably right from birth to look down on others and to feel superior to others.  I feel empathy with the person that they did this to.   Then they turn around and wonder why people are fleeing this great religion of theirs.|||i am from madhesi community and i also face racism  from childhood. i am now 20. but it still hurts. but i know there are only some handful of racist people and majority are better . and also i have more pahadi friends than madhesi friends. i am sad sometime but it's okay , nothing is perfect in this world.🤞|||Christian dharma ma parivartan gara daju!!

(Should I personally ask them to deduct 5% TDS?)  I also receive USD payments from an EU-based company. In that case, tax is deducted twice: first by the platform itself (approximately 3.5%), and then another 5% TDS is deducted here.

The annual limit is USD 500, but as far as I understand, this limit is only for payments/spending. Is it possible to increase this limit or ask the bank to keep incoming USD directly in that USD account instead of converting it to NPR?

Cant see both.|||if its real whatdo you do  ??? can you give some info or context|||I can see the angle of “look what you can get even from Nepal,” and yeah, that part can actually be motivating because a lot of people still assume they need to leave the country to reach certain compensation levels. But motivation usually comes from showing the path, not just the end result. A screenshot shows where you landed, not how you got there.  People here asked genuine questions about niche, stack, timeline, experience, etc because that’s the part that actually helps others move in that direction. That’s where the value would have been. Without that context, the post ends up reading more like a soft flex than mentorship. Nothing wrong with flexing, just don’t call it motivation if you’re not giving people anything they can learn from or replicate.  With 5+ years of experience you’ve seen enough of the field to know that the “how” matters more than the “what,” especially for people in Nepal who are trying to break into the global market. If the goal was to motivate, sharing the path would have done it way better than just the screenshot.|||Chyya kasto salty manche haru comments ma.

There aren’t many good options in my country to receive international payments, so I used Binance P2P to convert USDT to local currency and send it to my bank account. This money is my salary, not trading profits or third-party funds.  This morning my bank froze my account without warning. These were my hard-earned savings that I was slowly building to someday build a home, so this hit me really hard mentally.  Tomorrow I’m going to the bank in person, but I’m unsure:  What exactly should I say to them?  What should I not say?  What documents usually help in these cases?  Has anyone here gone through something similar and successfully unfrozen their account?  Is there a real risk of losing the money, or is this usually just a compliance review?  I’m not trying to avoid laws or do anything shady. I just didn’t have a better way to receive my income.  Any advice or shared experiences would really help right now. Thanks for reading.",

And now the new wave:   AI, ML, Deep Learning, GenAI, ChatGPT, LLMs, Prompt Engineering, LangChain, Vector Databases.      After all this…   You might get a job.   But there’s no guarantee you’ll survive in the long run.      AI is evolving faster than most people can upskill.   Tech stacks change. Roles disappear. Expectations keep increasing.      IT is no longer a “safe” career.   It’s a constant race with uncertainty.      This isn’t fear-mongering...it’s reality.   Students should seriously explore alternate paths where AI supports you, not replaces you.      Think long-term.   Don’t just follow the crowd.     Found on X",

            "comments": "This narrative of \"Software Engineering is done\" isn't new. This happens every time a revolutionary milestone in the technology space is achieved. Sure, it is not realistic to overlook the economy or the job scarcity that is so prevalant now, maybe for the longest time yet but it doesn't adjucate to the premise of Software Engineering isn't feasible as a career anymore, at least to the degree people are making it out to be. AI-driven development may very well be a 'bubble', and when it pops and the dust settles, the next big thing will provoke a similar reaction. While it is evident that people with years of experience are at a loss right now, and even more so for students trying to make it in tech, undergrads or young aspirants.  I believe it was never about how greatly any technology overshadows the current technology even if it transforms areas of it by overwhelming amounts but the ability to use it to your advantage. That is how you thrive here. You embrace, and not reject. AI cannot replace engineering but it does accelerate aspects of it that if you don't keep up, you get left behind. I mean, with AI-driven development so rampant right now, startups are at an all time high. People adapt and make it work. That mindset is obligatory now more than ever. Well, I could be speaking regardless of facts that I have yet to know, but I stand firmly on my grounds of not rejecting engineering as it has never been easier than now.|||I have 4 YOE. I don't expect to have a job in 2-3 years. I am not a people person. I don't know what else I can do besides this.

I don't know what career path i should choose|||I too have been overwhelmed by the amount of people following this IT trend blindly.  I don't know where I'll end up.|||I'm not sure why people are surprised. An industry can only take so many people before saturation, especially in face of disruption / paradigm shift as is the case now. As with any other field, you have to dedicate time and effort to be good and stay good. If you are a computer engineer worth your salt, you know it's a lot more about structured and critical thinking, problem solving skills and architecting solutions than coding in the field, and if you have the basics right, tech stack changing shouldn't scare you as much.  As with any other field, only the most committed, knowledgeable and competent people will remain in the industry and that should always be the case. The gold rush is over.|||Difficult times? Yes.  First time? No.   I really want to see what time has. Best wishes.  Best will have the best.|||Not only in Nepal. If you want to compete anywhere development is kind of fading out (especially if you are a fresher and just joining the market).

Tara as a student who has been studying ani working in Europe, I see we lag in the field of research ani the importance of it in the long run. Hamlai uni ma kaile pani research based vayera kaam garna sikayena, or maybe Malai Testo feel vayena. Tara the best way to develop skills nowadays is that you could be creating projects written on someone's research papers.   For example: Visual transformers haru ko progress sangai there have been numerous researches using ViTs in the field of Medicine, so if you want to work in the field of AI/ML kunai pani euta research linus, if they are using free dataset, use that ani replicate the process foe which you can use the same Language models to write code but it would be entirely different than all the projects your competitors have.   Similarly, development field ma pani tei hola, I am not into development more ajkal but things like using ORMs for databases is something I found ekdamai helpful. if you could find solutions to some genuine problems that the team might be facing you instantly will have their attention. Plus enjoy the grind. It'll be fruitful.|||The big picture is the barrier to entry has risen but all the things mentioned above are not required to get a entry role. You will be adding more skills as you go, as your project requires it.   Yes its a challenging job but so are other jobs. If you enjoy learning/working in this field then its good for you else people can and should look for other carrier option. Do what feels natural to you.   Regarding AI, its here to stay wear we like it ir not. We don't need to me AI/ML experts we just have to learn how to use it, or embrace it, and not reject it. Its on the hype but it will die down and come back to its default.|||Jack of all with understanding of Ai tools and how to implement wins. Be the jack of all. Don’t try to master one thing. That’s what I suggest.   Decent apps can be build in a day if you know the requirements, understand system design and  logic needed. You need to understand things like how apps are build, deployed etc.  At least in US, Ai replacing engineerings is not exactly false.   With Automated workflows and Ai agents, team needing 100 members could only need couple members. That does mean Ai replaced 98 people among 100. That’s how I see.",

I was working for one of the renowned company.. they made us use the cursor. They kept telling us to have 2x productivity.

Here we are now building smaller smaller project and sending it to the mass to get subscriptions as fast as possible.. and guess what we are using lovable to build the system.

This is already happening, and it will accelerate rapidly over the next 12–24 months as AI tools get mass-adopted inside companies.  That said, the outcome isn’t as simple as “developers are done.”  What’s actually happening is a restructuring of value.  As companies begin laying off junior and mid-level developers, they won’t eliminate development teams entirely. Instead, they’ll rely on fewer, highly reliable developers who can handle much more work with the help of AI. This creates a paradoxical situation: layoffs on one side, high demand on the other, but only for the right people.    If you come from a development background, the smartest move right now is simple:  * Become exceptional at using AI as a force multiplier. * Just knowing how to code won’t be enough anymore. That used to be the differentiator; now it’s table stakes.    **What matters now is:**  * Knowing how to think in systems * Translating vague requirements into clear specs * Using AI to generate, refactor, test, debug, and ship faster * Understanding architecture well enough to spot what AI gets wrong * Owning a specific niche deeply enough to solve high-value problems quickly    Companies won’t pay top dollar for someone who can “do everything moderately well.”  They will pay very well for someone who can fix a very specific, painful problem reliably.  And let’s be honest: saying “AI won’t replace humans” is already outdated. It has started replacing roles; not because AI is perfect, but because it’s good enough when paired with the right person.  If a non-technical person, like myself, someone who loves tech but never formally learned coding, can now build a full-fledged system using tools like ChatGPT and Replit, then the competitive bar has fundamentally shifted.  AI isn’t coming for jobs.   It’s coming for generic skill sets.    **So the choice is clear:**  * Either level up into a top-tier senior developer who designs systems, makes decisions, and leads execution * Or become a highly specialized mid-level developer with deep expertise in one niche and excellent AI leverage  Anything in between is the danger zone.  This isn’t a threat, it’s an opportunity.  But only for those who adapt early and intentionally.  Cheers!|||Lmao CRUD/landing page ta garihaalxa ni.

After +2, I applied to Canada and the USA for further studies, but my visa got rejected. Instead of wasting a year, I joined BBS , and now I’m in my 3rd year.  When the visa didn’t work out, I decided to take responsibility for my own future. I started learning about AI, automation, and new technologies. Over time, I picked up practical skills, experimented a lot, and eventually started freelancing. Right now, I work as an AI Developer on Upwork, and even in the early stage, I’m earning more than 1 lakh NPR per month.  I’m not an expert and I still have a lot to learn but I know my strengths. I’m good at managing things, people, sales, content, and marketing, and I can execute fast. I have learned most of this by consuming real-world information online and applying it through actual work.  I have big plans in the AI space, but I also know that building something great alone is very difficult. That’s why I am looking for a technical co-founder, someone strong on the engineering side so we can build, learn, and grow together.  The idea is to:  * Start very small and lean * No heavy investment * Focus on AI services / automation / agency-style work * Only basic costs like hosting or APIs * Aim to generate revenue within 2–3 months  I currently live with my parents in Butwal, but I want to move to Kathmandu, take a small flat, and fully focus on building. I also plan to start creating content alongside the business.  I’m looking for someone who:  * Is disciplined and focused * Serious about long-term growth * Not into unhealthy habits * Wants a simple lifestyle with deep work * Has strong technical skills or is deeply committed to developing them  Most importantly, I want a co-founder who understands that things won’t always work. There will be hard times, failures, and uncertainty. During those phases, we should push and motivate each other, stay consistent, and keep moving forward. Even if something fails, we should come out smarter, stronger, and more experienced than before.  We don’t need much money to start just enough for basic living expenses. I have savings that allow me to manage accommodation and food for a long time, and I strongly believe we can make this sustainable within a few months.  The goal is simple:   Live together. Build together. Learn together. Grow together.  If you’re technically strong, disciplined, and serious about building a real AI business from Nepal, let’s connect.",

This has now gotten out of hand, and this type of behavior will surely spread to other tourist areas, especially those closer to the border like Sauraha and others. I have seen these 'tourists' in Thars and other SUVs riding recklessly on our highways, mocking our rules and laws. In my local area in the Terai, there have been a couple of incidents where such SUVs have hit locals, including traffic police, and fled to India.  Let's continue to do what we can from our end - I have reported the videos and his channel, and let's keep reporting those videos wherever we find them, and from any other Indian 'YouTubers'. Influencers from Pokhara need to raise their voices collectively on other popular social media channels like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Local influencers need to unite and raise this issue from their platforms in their individual capacities. Otherwise, we might be just one incident away from breaking news.  I will share this thread with a popular Indian YouTube journalist-The Deshbhakt. I have been following him, and he has made videos on such stupidity by Indian tourists. I will leave his Instagram link here so that everyone with evidence can share information.

Padhe lekheko anpad haru. Stephen Hawking ko contribution kati xa physics ma bujya xau? Like wtf is wrong with you guys?|||People usually miscalculate the complexity of human beings, even if those people are globe-renowned scientists or thinkers. We tend to reduce individuals into neat categories of \"good\" or \"bad,\" when in reality most human lives exist somewhere in a moral gray space.  The figures are indeed contributions to modern society, having shaped our understanding of the universe in the case of Stephen Hawking and the overwhelming propagation of personal computing that underpins everyday life, thanks to Bill Gates. Their contributions are objective in nature, measured, and historically significant.  The Epstein case has indeed cast a sinister shadow on the reputations and personal integrity of those associated with it. Any wrongdoing ought to be investigated, prosecuted, and judged on its merits. Accountability counts.  Yet, it is quite dangerous to erase or dismiss intellectual and scientific contributions on the basis of particular personal moral failures; by doing so, it is an effort to distort history. If we were to get rid of every successful idea that had come from flawed individuals, much of human progress would disappear along with those who themselves were flawed.  We can—and should—condemn bad behavior without discarding valuable, valid contributions to knowledge and society.  Scientists are more likely to value human progress, curiosity, and long-term thinking—but they are not immune to moral failure. Their work can be noble even when their personal lives are flawed. Judgment must be based on evidence, not archetypes.|||Not remove but edit by keeping his bad pedophilic side in the chapter.Let the readers decide what to think of him by reading his biography.|||He did biggest contribution for science.

However, his contributions to the physics community are unimaginable. As a physics student, I was inspired by his book A Brief History of Time. When it comes to moral responsibility, I believe we should take such matters seriously. However, removing his biography from textbooks is not justified. As far as I know, he was never convicted; he was only accused, largely based on a photograph. If we consider that he was a famous person known for his intellect, it is also possible that people simply wanted to take a picture with him. It could have been anything, but jumping to conclusions is not fair. The mindset of “guilty until proven innocent,” which is common in Nepali society, can seriously damage someone’s reputation, whether they are living or deceased. I also saw someone arguing that other scientists went to that island as well. Yes, that could be possible. They may have gone there for donations or funding. People should also understand how research and experiments work. Many scientists attend seminars, conferences, and even social events to secure funding from wealthy donors for their research projects. That is part of how scientific funding operates. It may sound unpleasant, but it is often the reality. However, concluding that they raped minors without concrete evidence is unreasonable. From my perspective, why don’t we conduct our own research before forming judgments? We know he was famous. We can consult medical professionals or simply search the internet regarding his medical condition after paralysis—you understand what I mean….|||Does his contribution to the science and the world will be false because his name was in epstein file?  Naive People like you think the world exist in black and white?|||Those who're saying his professional works matter only, then ig Sanduk Ruit's biography was removed!

Communism is really stupid if you look back at humanity now.|||This should be categorised as fictional book|||some deep shit ! ... op is not asking for superficial answer|||Technically, yes, he wrote the manual. But, Marx was a man who saw a disease but prescribed a medicine that was more toxic than the sickness. He wanted to fix the world by changing who owns the \"stuff\" without changing the \"human being\" who uses the stuff.  ​When you try to enforce \"equality\" through a state, you don't get a paradise; you get a prison. This is why Marxism has failed wherever it was tried as a rigid political tool.  ​Why \"Harkabad\" is the Antidote TODAY:  ​The reason we look toward a philosophy like Harkabad (Prakriti, Samskriti, Pravidhi) instead of Marxism or Western Capitalism is because it addresses the foundation, not just the \"economics.\" Harka Smapang has time and again said it has nothing to do with his name. He is suggesting a solution that isn't a western copy but suitable to the soil we stand on.   ​Marxism says: \"Who owns the factory?\" ​Capitalism says: \"How much can the factory produce?\" ​Harkabad says: \"Do we even need the factory if it kills the river (Prakriti) and destroys the community's soul (Samskriti)?\"  If you ask me if we need \"Harkabad,\" I would say we need Consciousness.  ​Harka Sampang is essentially bringing consciousness to governance. When he goes out and carries stones with his own hands (Shramadaan), he is moving from the \"ugly\" socialism (taking from others) to the \"wonderful\" socialism (giving of oneself).  ​We don't need a \"Communist\" revolution where blood is spilled to change the law. We need a \"Harkabad\" style evolution where sweat is spilled to restore the land. ​You don't need a book from 19th-century Germany to tell you how to live. You just need to look at the earth beneath your feet and the people around you.",

The feeling of my heart having faster and my stomach twisting like an eel holding it's prey is not new to me but still it's not wholly mine.   The feeling of lying in the bed with inherent thoughts of disperse happiness and the want to be able to understand if that happiness is as true as it seems is not new and it's also not wholly mine   I look at all these motion picture hoping to find something. And what that might be is as ananomus to me as it is to you. I look at these things, listen as they talk, but the existence of this feeling of watching doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm lying on this virgin earth, unmolested and untouched, devoid of any feeling of any sort except for one; consciousness. The consciousness reigns supreme within and without all within the vicinity of my existence.  At this point, life as you call it feels not a moments passing by or time flowing like my thoughts.  My head feels particularly heavy, as if I'm thinking but a thought is yet to process. But how can this be? Without a thought, how can you think? How can one live, without knowing the value of death? But that's not right either. For one to know the value of death,.one must first know of its qualities, it's feature in all it's dimensions. The inherent idea of a thought being, and to think not sounds stupid as if not funny enough. But you can't overlook the idea behind such ponder.   I take very long breaths as I think. My heart beats loud enough for me to hear it. And all my bodily functions seems very much obvious to me. This isn't new but it's not wholly mine.   Ahh now my head hurts a little to. But this shall too pass.   Theres this lingering feeling of solitude that I feel very sensationally. For solitude has been my friend far longer then any. The silence that made me feel alone after some years felt not pleasing but good enough to make me feel a bit stingy if it got disturbed.  But now this solitude engulfs me, strangles me so that I choke these thoughts out of me which are yet to be. But it was this very solitude that made me form a thought but now it want it back. Like how death waits right Infront of you, lingers above you with it's hands around neck, and then takes you through the stairs of lifelessness while you climb oblivious. Similar is the solitude that I experience right now, but instead of lifelessness, I climb and climb but towards nothing, I climb and climb but climb on empty thoughts.   My agitated muscles ache in the silence of my breath while my breath gets shorter and heavier each micro instant.",
