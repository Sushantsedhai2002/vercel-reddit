I'm no expert but I  do come with a few facts . The actual knowledge I feel like I know it better than anyone here. Not bragging .  So take it as a means of education. I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it. Capitalism and communism don't antagonises each other. They coexist in a healthy modern economy.|||Ask a regular min wage worker in the US if capitalism is working for them. Then make a decision.|||I asked their page where in USA can I buy their products. They will update soon.

Aile pani its happening, rise of ai and robots, working class will get exploited soon. The transition will be dreadful. When robots and AIs will do most of the basic works people will either starve or live on a minimum wage, minimum wage ko path is possible only if elites see their positions being threatened by big uprisings.   Theodore kaczynski ko \"future of industrial society and its future\" padnu.   Then you'll begin to understand ki world could've taken a turn in any direction. Peace isn't hard. Few people wanting to horde all bananas to themselves make it difficult. Communism ko development-> slower (only in the beginning) but peaceful, people free to choose what they wanna work in (huge contributions dine scientists are still gonna be scientists, people making an impact on the humanity overall will still continue doing that), no exploitation of anybeing, people free to explore and just living in peace, how can anyone say this is bad.

And on social media, for example on Reddit, I'm just distracting myself by posting random things. When I post here and interact with you guys, that emptiness goes. I feel a little alive. But you know one thing, in this way, it will not work forever  I face difficulty with focus. I'm just running away from myself every single day. tbh, I didn't have any love issues or any kind of trauma but I'm just trying to figure things out. I've left my home from childhood for a few years to study. I didn't feel that much emotional connection with my family since childhood  I don't have any deep emotional connection with anyone. I don't share and there's no one. From all those years, everything is in my head. I'm just too tired of it, pretending that I'm all good  I don't know what this emptiness, loneliness is. I have goals and things to learn but I keep running away from all these. I'm wasting time. I'm destroying myself. But you know, deep down, I feel so hollow. I don't know what that thing is. It really hurts me every single day. I tried everything else to get rid of it but it just doesn't  I don't have any meaningful reln with anyone. I don't have friends as well. Not much human connection from long ago  I've never done any bad things to myself but these thoughts and stress are eating me  I'm telling this from my heart, I have no expectations or hope from anything or anyone except one. Do you know what? Sometimes I imagine some angel who'll save me. But deep down, I know I need to get rid of this myself but I think I just can't. And I dream of that angel to save me. I'm living in hope of that and in hope of goals and all  Other than that, I don't see anything. Trust me, I read, write and talk about self improvement, those positive things and those deep talks, but still, without curing my hollowness, I just don't feel alive  Without getting rid of it, I just don't know what I'll do  Man, I hate these feelings. I hate these emotions and numbness. I just don't want to be. I want to be unstoppable, but I just can't  I'm just losing hope in myself. And you know one thing, with this account and other one at first, I used to post exactly these loneliness posts, then slowly I started posting random things and by that, I got the chance to interact with you guys and those moments i felt alive  Sometimes I try to find out by sharing all this with Chatgpt and it says chronic loneliness, emotional burnout, emotional isolation, mild depression and all these. But you know one thing, I just don't like and want to accept that I have these issues. idk why  And the emptiness has been there for a long time. I kept pushing myself every day  Previously, I used to go outside alone to feel better. Sometimes I used to work out in my room and sometimes I took random shower. by doing these, it felt a little better but after all, it's all the same  I'm just tired of wearing a mask. I never thought I'd feel this emotionally empty. I just don't like to cry but time and situations made me like this and I hate that the most. I hate why I'm sharing and writing all this but I can't hide it anymore. I just want to get rid of this hollowness  And I'm pouring my heart and words just to feel better other than that, idk where else I can  I don't know. I just can't even explain the feeling to myself.

But for future-proofing this type of incident, I highly recommend a vehicle tracker. You gan get cheap ones from Daraz. If you get a Sinohero device, you don't have to pay the yearly subscription. It's free for life, will just cost you higher upfront (mine cost 8k). I recharged Rs.500 and it ran for 2 years. For advanced features(that require internet or calls), you will need to recharge often, maybe like 1500/year. But for basic tracking, Rs.500 will basically run the GPS until your validity expires, I think. You could even recharge lower - just upto the point where you maximize your validity.  Personal use ko lagi cost may be unjustified. I use it non-personal expenses. But as a personal expense pani it could be worth it, if 1 in a 1000 chance of running into a scenario like yours, where you need go prove your innocence with an alibi.",

            "body": "I was 6 years old when I was diagnosed with tonsillitis. They gave me antibiotics and painkillers.  Since then, I’ve had to spend around 4,000 to 5,000 rupees every single year on antibiotics and painkillers. I used to get tonsillitis every three months or so.  I started to believe it was genetic because I’d been on antibiotics and painkillers since childhood. So yeah, I pretty much grew up chewing antibiotics and painkillers like candy.  Then, in 2022, I got properly diagnosed in Kathmandu by an old doctor with a white beard. I went to him complaining about my throat it was swollen and had pus. I was already thinking, “Great, another 4 to 5 thousand rupees gone on antibiotics.”  But after examining me, he told me I had a type of chronic tonsil inflammation. Basically, I never actually had tonsillitis my tonsils were naturally large, and they just reacted whenever I caught a cold.  Here’s the crazy part: before meeting that doctor, I was once admitted to the emergency ward for tonsillitis. The doctor treating me was shocked when antibiotics and painkillers didn’t work at all. Even dental painkillers barely affect me now. I’ve built an extremely high resistance to both antibiotics and painkillers to the point where even after being on an IV antibiotic drip for three days, there was no improvement. The doctor eventually stopped the treatment, saying it wasn’t safe to continue.  Now, I usually have to warn doctors that I have a really high tolerance to antibiotics and painkillers. Most of their reactions are something like:  “Gather all the students, look this is an extreme case of tonsillitis.”  “Antibiotics should have worked… I don’t know why they’re not.”  So it's been almost 2 years I haven't used any antibiotics or pain killers because one day I might eat sick and will definitely die cause the medication didn't work on me . So I choose to suffer .",

            "comments": "Here's some wall of text. I am 40. I have been in the US since my 20s. Got diagnosed in my 30s. Growing up or even into my early 20s, I was not aware of something called ADHD. I was somehow really good in school, mind you without putting in any effort at all, which in a way prevented my parents from ever figuring out that something was wrong with their son, but deep down I was struggling, HARD. I developed so many coping mechanisms you won't believe - one I am really proud of is something I call my 'intelligent listening face', lol. Any time someone would talk to me, lecture me - my parents, teachers, anyone whose take I was not interested in at all - they got my intelligent-listening-face. They would think I was paying them full attention but fuck, my mind would be somewhere else. I seriously could not focus for more than 30 seconds, still cant, but at least I know how to manage my symptoms. I got into some bad habits, addictions, and what not but the world knew nothing about my problems, I got so good at masking them lol and lying. I would just lie without any reason. I have made so many mistakes, including losing the girl of my dreams, but I also have a memory of a fish, so I don't regret much. I breezed through my bachelors, completed my masters in the US, and even managed to get a really good job.  And that is when things started becoming a little more difficult for me. Turns out all the coping mechanisms I had developed back in my childhood and in Nepal, did not really help me when I started going up the corporate ladder. Unfinished projects and loose-ends in my private life were somehow fine, but not in the corporate world. Only then did I decide to talk about my problems with my doctor. One thing led to another, a series of behavioral and psychological tests and what not, and I was put on Adderall. The first day I took my medication, I cried, A. Lot. The world was so slow, so quiet, I could not believe it. The next few weeks were just amazing. I was so focused in everything I did. But I also did realize I had become somewhat robotic and zombie like. My ability to connect dots, which is the only skill I have to be honest, was gone. I persisted with my medication, but over time just felt like I was killing my true self. I talked to a behavioral-psychologist, an old white guy who was completely against the use of medications for treating ADHD. And he was the one who turned my life around, by helping me truly understand my condition and by making me accept who I really was. Thanks to him, and a few books, this is what I do today to stay focused, productive, while still enjoying whatever gift ADHD has given me.  1. I workout regularly - no excuses. This was obviously the hardest part. So many times, I would just say I am just going to take a break for a day - and then without me knowing that one day would turn into a week, a month, six months... but for the last year or so, I have been very consistent. There are still breaks but I don't ever let that break go more than two days. 2. More exercises - I do a quick aerobic exercise before any meeting, any event where I need to be focused. Few minutes of jumping-jacks, push-ups, jump-ropes, quick run, anything - gives me enough dopamine to stay focused for the next 30 or so minutes. 3. I don't use smartphones. Although I don't play games, can't focus on one activity for too long. Give me a smart-phone and I will spend hours going down some rabbit-hole in Reddit. Funnily enough, while I was back in Nepal I NEEDED a smart-phone to survive, not a problem in the US surprisingly. This rule helps me a lot. 4. And most importantly, I have got a really supportive wife, which I am really thankful for. Helps that she's a doctor and a very patient one at that. She fills all the gaps that I have in my weird, disorganized, life. I was very open about my problems and conditions when I was dating her - and she thinks she fell in love with me because of how funny I was (thanks to ADHD lol, I just cant take anything seriously). In a way, she has been the most important medication for me. What I am trying to say is, a supportive partner or a friend is very important.|||https://preview.redd.it/1ojxpol4hfzf1.png?width=226&format=png&auto=webp&s=986fedcca63ae9d39c8b9d4824d8f46fca092f4f  we will watch your career with great interest|||If you get some advice please tell me as well.|||Have you been diagnosed by a medical professional?|||1. I rarely stay productive, yet fulfilled with life. You will learn to accept this as you get older. 2. I focus on what interests me. I can’t focus if it doesn’t interest me. Trying to focus on something that you’re not interested is almost impossible for ADHD. 3. You get in legal trouble when you don’t control impulses. After getting in a huge mess like being taken to police station, you will learn how to control the process.  4. I only take a job when the money is worth it. The only reason I would stay on a job for more than one year would be great money. Money can motivate you to go to work. I won’t be homeless because I will go to work if I need to. I also take long breaks after leaving a job. I will stay jobless for 3 to 6 months after leaving a job to recharge my battery.  This is only possible if you earned great money and saved properly  5. I have very few friends who I connect with once in 1-2 months. Sometimes, I forget to reply to their messages for weeks . It does not hurt our relationship because we are adults and understand that we have our own lives. Sometimes my friends may forget to reply back to me for weeks as well, and I don’t mind either because they have a life as well.|||Umm, let’s see: No. 1: I don’t, and I can’t life is a struggle... No. 2: I can’t  that’s a struggle too. No. 3: Lots of coffee and tea. No. 4: I don’t get much support from my parents most of the time. I’ve walked out of multiple jobs; the longest I ever held was 4 months, and the shortest was 1 day. I’ve lost count of how many jobs I’ve had too many and too random. No. 5: By not having one, I guess. I have one friend, and I love her to death  she’s blind, listens to my random off-topic thoughts, and it’s easy to talk to her because I don’t have to maintain eye contact.|||I am a self diagnosed ADHD and my friends call me that too lol. To all your questions what I do is I try to self isolate. When I isolate myself most of the time goes in loneliness cause I know the problem I am going to create when I will be with the people for a longer time. So I try to isolate myself as much as possible.|||I take meds.",

I trusted him, thinking it was just a short-term thing and that I’d get my money back once the project started or wrapped up. Well… the project never even took off. Apparently, there were some internal disputes between the people involved, and it all just fell apart. Since then, I’ve been constantly following up with my friend about when they’re going to return the money, and every single time I get some excuse or a new date “next month,” “after this meeting,” “once we sort this out,” etc. Now it’s almost a year, and I still haven’t gotten a single rupee back. I’m honestly so done being polite about it. It’s not a small amount, and it’s starting to feel like I’m being taken for a fool.

For this the metropolitan should start sending the garbage truck twice a week. One day for picking up biodegradable waste and another for non-biodegradable waste. In this way people will be more encouraged to separate the waste.  The non-biodegradable waste can actually be recycled and used for energy generation.  Even if only one truck were to come we can separate the waste into two different bags in our own home. This can be really helpful for the workers too.

Socialism bhanchan , yo ta naam ko lagi nai thyo sadhai .|||Political ideoligy doesn't guide the politics of Nepal.  Those who think they know don't know and those who say they represent, they don't. The debate of communism-capitalism was long over. In terms of economics, capitalism achieves more.   Also, in terms of politics and administration,  democracy achieves more, specially in a diverse societies as ours to make everyone less unhappy. To make everyone happy is barely possible, so the target here is to please the majority.   What are we?  Not a capitalist country,  but a highly globalized mercantalist society.   Not a democratic either,  because political parties have inherited the 'monarch' like attributes leaving democracy very little space.   It amuses me when people say they are  free in a neo-mercantalist country like Nepal,  believing it to be a capitalist society. You are free only when you accept the system. Your voice are supressed if you are against the system or belong to the minority.   You may feel freedom when you're free to speak. Yes you are.  But the most honest and true narratives are always over-shadowed by multitude of fake and paid narratives,  designed to create chaos and room for power struggle. Politicians and statesman exploit this narrative-war for their greed.   You think you are free to consume but you are not.  You are free to consume only those that they sell or allow to sell. You are made to produce and distribute  their way, not your way, because you may not generate profit.   Communists are no better because they know only to fight for the resources, not to produce and distribute.   Congress and RSP are no good because they don't feel the need for radical improvement of the system.  Status--quo is okay for them.   Both advocates for socialism throuh PPP, and none envisions productive and  efficient bureaucracy, strict rule of law and moral society. They see free-market as the solution of all social problems.  They resort to print money supply rather to collect taxes for government spending.  They know they have their hands in people's pocket through interest rates and modern banking system. With taxpayers money same old names 'promote welfare' in the name of Socialism, and thula thula 'politicians',  'buerocrats',  'thekedar/byapari' are getting richer.   I am not a communist, just like you. If this is capitalism, I'd hate to be called a capitalist too.   You mentioned poverty somewhere. Isnt it a relative concept that if you dont earn sth dollar a day,  you're poor. But if you cand feed yourself,  clothe yourself and roof yourself, farming let's say,  are you really poor?  Because to me,  a poor is someone who is unable to meet his basic needs presently and is not much secure in future.   Inflation may eat away your wealth,  leaving you poor at any time in the future,  no matter how much money you hoard. You may have char aana ko sadhe dui tala ghar,  tara production ko lagi kei chhaina bhane you're always insecure about what your children will do. In cities,  they sell their labor for cash in order to buy tei dal,  bhat ra tarkari.   They say when you're rich,  they're free. Rich are free and poor are not,  is this democracy or capitalism you buy? Just because you're not a communist ?  You also say you're not a conservative, that makes you a radical. You're not a radical also.  What are you?  Seems like you're naming names. What ideology do they preach? Are they clear what they are? Do they walk the talk? Because an ideology is not what you think but what you do.|||Meanwhile, NeMaKiPa in Bhaktapur : \"Really?\". On a serious note, communist slogans and agendas have run their courses in Nepal and they should be abolished today. Poverty lai protect garera vote bank banaune ho Nepal ko communists haru. While I agree, communist parties were a voice of marginalized and rural communities in Nepal, they are no longer necessary and the society has to move forward. Aba ko challenge Nepal ma vaneko economic ra infrastructure growth ho. China realized a long while ago that Communism wouldn't take them forward and they abandoned Mao's philosophy. Nepal should do it too.|||Start chai kaile va theo ?|||these idiots are the farthest thing away from communism but it'd be great if they fucked off.

And I joined the call Hr was on time (well already a green flag for me ) and then another senior was also on the call.  After basic convo the senior dai asked me uestion about my project. Interesting was I didnt do project on React but they didnt care becayse they say that for joining that internship you need to have drive than just knowldege of 100+ languages.  And then he started to ask me question like Why this ? Did you think of another approach ? Why or Why not ?  Now as I was confident in my project I could answer them quite easily. Then they said I was  a candidate with high probability and I woukd get response no matter my outcome.  Tespaxi I mentioned whats hybrid ? Then they say as college ko timing haru milauna garo hunxa so we dont force candidate people to come on fix time and that was such a relief as mero college alli tadai parxa and exams haru ni sochna paryo.

I have been in this field for almost 2 years now. At first, I loved designing — as devs say, just drag and drop work, haha… but in reality, it’s not that simple, dev people.  Slowly, I am hating my job, only loving it when the salary credits in the account. Seriously, this is the only thing holding me to do this job. Every new day, you have to be creative and give new things to people, explain all the processes...  95% of my salary goes to my home, sometimes 100%. I never get the chance to spend for myself — that also makes me sick sometimes. But salary is not just the thing; I’m getting stuck. I slowly just don’t want to be here, but on the other side, I love this side. I don’t know what is happening to me.  In these 2 years, I haven’t taken any kind of break. You may think, what kind of break am I saying — a break like I want to go trekking or travel somewhere far from home and family. But whenever I plan this kind of stuff, problems occur. My family again asks me for money; I have to give it. I can’t say no to them; my family situation is bad.  The company has a strict policy — doesn’t give a single paid holiday in a month. The salary is nice here, but the working environment is bad, like really bad. If I take a single leave, the company will cut my salary. So I haven’t taken a single leave till now.  I am focusing only on money, not passion. I am confused — is this really my passion? I don’t even know what my passion is. Do I really love doing this thing, or is this just my profession — working 9–6 pm, getting paid, going home, eating, sleeping, and repeating?  Everyone says don’t just stick to a single skill, learn other things also — graphic, video editing stuff. In reality, I really don’t want to, but on the other side, I just think, why not? I can earn more. I can’t even quit or even continue it. Sometimes I feel like I am in a comfort zone, sometimes I feel like I am in a hurry for all this.  I usually don’t share my things with anyone, but now it’s getting worse, so I think I need help. I have 0 friends, 0 people to listen to me.",

Take a vacation and go back to work, and see if you still like it.  If not, move to another company or position.|||I'm also a graphic designer especially logo designer I can understand you I'm 21 with now almost 3 year of experience I can feel that pain but with the time I'm moving to software engineer|||You need to take a break, give yourself some time to recharge your batteries. save around 3 months worth of salary and take a long overdue holiday and yeah, the company and work conditions sounds harsh.  Find another place. Burning out when you are just 20 sounds horrible. Good luck and for your next job, negotiate better.",

I am not gonna call myself absolute atheist here but seriously the logic of religious people sometimes makes me wonder if they even think through what they are actually saying.  I am not gonna argue back and forth here,I just have one simple question that doesn’t let me really be religious at all,if god is all mighty and thing why do people suffer? Why are there 2 year old kids battling cancer? Why do some people get everything handed to them on silver spoon while rest of the people survive on scraps. If he is that powerful then he should be able to create a world where there is minimal suffering but if you look closely to what happens then it is hard to take it seriously whatever you guys say.  You could say it is a part of a bigger plan and all but we all get one life and what good reason could a mighty god have for people to go through eternal suffering?  Or might as well call him sadistic then.   God exist or not it is completely upto your own beliefs but if we are gonna argue about his existence then the onus is on religious people to prove his existence not us. If his existence was crystal clear then there would be more proofs than just some manmade religious scripts.|||If God were real, innocent kids wouldn’t be buried because grown men started wars.

They are free to align themselves with any belief they see fit, unless that belief or ideology does not harm others (such as fascism, nazism, and anything else harmful). BP Koirala famously was an atheist, amplified by his statement: \"I have not been to any temple praying the God to get something done. I have no faith in it because people who are in more need than me have reached there and trust the God more than me, yet they have not been obliged. If it is so why should I trust that my wish will be fulfilled?\" - and there can be inherent flaws in his worldview, but like him, everyone is entitled to what they want to believe.   And yeah, regarding the 2072 earthquake, there were atheists around - they didn't see fit to spread their beliefs in such a time of turmoil, where the nation required collective participation in rescue, service, and aid. There have been very influential philosophers, authors, scholars who were atheists - and it is not only exclusively a young people thing.|||Bhagwan vako vaye kina yeti manxe lai dukha dinthiye ?|||I think we should believe in God and not in religion ( you don't have to give a shi bout my opinion)|||What a load of crap this is.   \"Only a few in that age understand that neither the body nor the soul truly dies and only transmutes or transmigrate into another form or another being.\"  ani bujhera chai k thulo kura gareu ta?

The concept is just a way to justify the existence of pain in a God created world. Like it is done in all religion   Let me give you an example, It's like telling me that after I die I will be reincarnated as the son of a boy who lets say is 7 years old. Because he did good in his previous life, he will make a successful business and be rich and happy.   And since I have free will, if I do good in this life that business will continue to be good after my father transfers it to me in the future and if I do bad, I will fail in the business after I inherit it.  Also, human life is said to be very precious and comes very rarely in the cycle of Reincarnation. So, how is there so much Variation in the life of different humans. Many dogs in the world even live better lifes than many humans.|||Religion is cope, my guy. You couldn’t face the absurdity of life and its meaninglessness, so you had to find a community to believe in something with no basis whatsoever.   No religious text is different from a book of fiction. It’s just that a big group of people “believe” in it and that blind faith ultimately becomes your reality.   But as long as you’re a nice person and not an extremist, you do you. Oh, but if you’re an ISKCON person, you’re definitely a bad guy in my books particularly because Prabhupada was a sexist and racist guy.

It’s ingrained in us from childhood. But now that we’ve grown up, become more conscious, and stable in our beliefs, we can see things differently.  If there truly was a god, then no innocent lives would have been lost in the 2072 earthquake.   I believe religion was originally created to guide people, to maintain discipline and order when there were no proper laws or when society wasn’t yet civilized.   The fear of hell kept people from doing wrong, but over time, it became more of a business filled with toxicity and superstition.  Atheism isn’t about hating religion, it’s about choosing not to believe in it completely. What we oppose is not faith itself, but the chaos, manipulation, and blind superstition promoted by those who misuse religion for their own agendas.|||Oh hell nah , Energy exists , Not what we say one divine is watching us and monitoring human activities , Things which should have ended way earlier like in 18th or 17th century , People are still believing and living through it .

They outsource their jobs to poorer countries where people are happy to accept a meager $2800/month, whereas a domestic worker in the US would have to be paid at least double that. So the company saves 50% of their costs pretty much immediately. Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to. If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.

I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it. Capitalism and communism don't antagonises each other. They coexist in a healthy modern economy.|||Ask a regular min wage worker in the US if capitalism is working for them.

The only hope a small nation like ours has to develop is if ALL resources our country has (hydro, minerals, tourism) is exploited FULLY for OUR benefits. Only then will we actually develop. We need to fully control private businesses centrally, develop 5 year plans like China to take advantage of the global trade market and allow foreign companies to manufacture inside of Nepal.   Once they start production, we learn how to produce our own products by looking at how they produce and then we can upgrade from a resource exporting country to a manufacturing economy.

Open border, growing Indian GDP and our heavy reliance on Indian corridors for incoming and outgoing mostly incoming goods and energy makes it a sensible decision.

            "body": "TLDR: A Nepali student at Ole Miss asked JD Vance why legal immigration is being cut after leaders promoted the American dream to those who followed the rules. The exchange was calm factual and brave.  Video:   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WScSX1vyWI8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WScSX1vyWI8)  At the University of Mississippi a Nepali calmly and clearly questioned JD Vance during a Turning Point event. She asked why leaders who once promoted the American dream to legal immigrants now argue to shrink legal pathways and say we do not belong. Her poise facts and courage were inspiring.  For many of us this moment feels personal. Legal immigrants study work pay taxes and strengthen communities. When people in power target legal pathways it is fair and necessary to speak up with respect and clarity.  Gen Z in Nepal recently showed remarkable civic courage during protests against corruption. That same spirit peaceful principled and focused on justice belongs in every place. From Kathmandu to a college campus in Mississippi we Nepalis should raise our voices against injustice misinformation and the scapegoating of immigrants.  This moment matters because it centers fairness and the promises made to those who followed the rules. It highlights how rhetoric at political events touches real lives of people waiting in long lines for visas and green cards. It also connects to a wider wave of youth led civic action that insists on dignity and accountability.  Note:   She is Nepali, but most Indian media are portraying her as Indian. Did not expect anything less. 😅",

A very good, healthy, and respectful discussion nevertheless.|||As a student living in the United States, I can honestly tell you, \"Yes, the US sold us a dream, but most dont read the notes on the back page.\" Your experience in this nation is strongly correlated to which state you call home. The education system lives up to the expectation, if you choose to study. There is still an opportunity, if you choose to work hard.   There are a few extra hurdles along the way, which aren't permanent.|||I didn’t like it that she is holding US responsible for us coming here- you were the one who wanted us here and made us spend our money and time. Nobody from US came to me and asked me to come here, I did it because of that image I had of the US.   Other than that she was amazingly calm and quite reasonable in her questions.  Vance was refreshingly good in his answer, but he always has been good with words.|||Didn’t know she was a Nepali. I didn’t like some of the questions but otherwise she was very thoughtful and calm about it. Kudos.|||I'm going to be honest, watching her make assumptions about what US is and Isn't was very frustating. Noone in US sold her a dream, she came up with the idea of the dream herself, but the dream isn't guarenteed, especially if the native citizens are already strugging. Immigration is a hot topic right now, especially in US. Youth unemployment rates for US Citizens are already bad enough, why should the country then put the immigrants dream above their own native people?

But the us embassy in Nepal is just a embassy it's a whole f**ucking country that operates politically in Nepal. I was down voted by so called reddit heros.

Remember how sherey openly supported Ukraine after meeting with us and EU ambassador. The large number of missionaries completely backed us church ministers Mormons is something I knew from before do you have any doubt then please visit rural sindupalchowk kavre and there are tons of homestay where they stay and start promoting christanity.|||I am not a JD vance fan, nor I am right wing, but everything he has said here is valid. Just because we don’t like someone or don’t agree with something they say, they cant be wrong at all times.  The immigration is an issue in the US and is in all over the world. The system is talking about putting proper immigration law in place which is valid. It is not saying that we will give you student visa but won’t let you study. It may be saying that if you come as a Student, you shall remain a student and have to return after you complete your education. Now, this may not be ideal for an individual, but this cant be called, “You are selling us a dream and taking It away”.|||Who is this entitled NEPALI woman who interrogated the Vice President of the United States at a video recorded public event about his private life?",

            "body": "In the long course of history, nature’s most capable predator evolved not only in body, but in mind. With consciousness came conscience — yet we still ask: is that conscience innate, or carved into us by our surroundings? What is good, and what is bad? Is it truly universal, or only what our minds accept as moral, rational, or ethical? Perhaps “good” and “bad” are just perspectives formed by the finest instrument nature ever created: the human brain. From west to east, humans have vast differences. Was it evolution alone that shaped us into social beings, or the cultures we built around our fears, hopes, and beliefs? Culture — different everywhere — has long been our guide, telling us what is right and what is wrong. Alongside faith in deities, these traditions became the unwritten rules that shaped our conscience. But what have we carried from the past? Often not the reasons behind our rituals, only the instructions on how to perform them. Not the “why,” just the “how.” We repeat steps inherited from centuries ago, even when the world around us has changed. What we sow today determines tomorrow, yet what we need to do today may not be what was needed hundreds of years ago. We follow traditions hoping they will bring the same results they once did, without asking whether the original purpose still exists — or whether our actions need to evolve just as life evolves. Evolution hasn’t stopped, but sometimes we stop it from making sense. Out of fear of the unknown, fear of being separated from the group, we continue as we always have, even when our conscience whispers that understanding the reason is more important than repeating the act. We are social animals, yes — but we are also thinkers. And perhaps the real evolution lies in questioning what we follow, not abandoning it, but understanding it, and guiding it toward the world we live in today.",

From your iPhone / iPad:  Open Find My → Devices → tap your Mac.  Options: Play Sound, Directions (if location available), Mark as Lost (Lock), Erase This Device.   From any browser:  Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID → Find iPhone → select your Mac from All Devices and use the same options.   What each option does:  Play Sound — helps if it’s nearby.  Mark as Lost / Lock — remotely locks the Mac with a passcode and shows your message/phone number on screen. It also disables Apple Pay.  Erase Mac — wipes data. Use only if you’re sure you can’t get it back; after erasing you can no longer track it.   2) If Find My was not enabled  Tracking is much harder. Still:  Check your Google account (if Chrome was signed in) for recent device activity.  Check services you used (Dropbox, Microsoft, email) for recent logins — they sometimes reveal IP/location.  Look at any linked accounts for device lists under your Apple ID (appleid.apple.com → Devices) — it shows serial numbers and last seen info.   3) Gather identifying info (do this now)  Serial number of the Mac (found on original box/receipt, Apple invoice, or appleid.apple.com under your devices).

            "body": "I’ve been working as a developer for about a year now. I started at my current company as an intern, and honestly, I’ve learned so much here. I can handle almost all the frontend work on a project now, and even some backend. The company has been really good to me, and I’m truly grateful for the opportunities I’ve had.  When I joined, I got my first increment about four months after the internship, and another one around eleven months later. I’m happy about that, but lately, I’ve been feeling like my growth has slowed down. I’m not learning as much as I used to, and things are starting to feel a bit repetitive.  Recently, I received an offer from another company. The salary they’re offering is about the same as what I’m getting now, but they mentioned that they review performance regularly and adjust pay more frequently. I feel confident that I can perform well there.  To be honest, I’m also not totally satisfied with my current salary. I feel like in the new company, I’d have a better chance of getting raises faster based on performance.  The main reasons I’m considering the new opportunity are:  * Better growth and learning opportunities * Faster salary raises based on performance * I don’t want to stay stuck in one company for too long * I feel like, since I’m just starting out, I should explore more and get diverse experience instead of staying in one place for too long  At the same time, I can’t help but feel a bit guilty about leaving the company that helped me get this far. I’m also hesitant because I’m currently handling most of the work on one project that’s close to completion. However, I’m not sure when it will actually be done since new features keep getting added as requirements change.  It’s also a bit awkward to bring up the topic of leaving. Has anyone else gone through a similar situation? How did you decide?  Also, for those who’ve been in similar roles — what’s a reasonable salary range for a full-stack developer with about one year of experience?",

And I joined the call Hr was on time (well already a green flag for me ) and then another senior was also on the call.  After basic convo the senior dai asked me uestion about my project. Interesting was I didnt do project on React but they didnt care becayse they say that for joining that internship you need to have drive than just knowldege of 100+ languages.  And then he started to ask me question like Why this ? Did you think of another approach ? Why or Why not ?  Now as I was confident in my project I could answer them quite easily. Then they said I was  a candidate with high probability and I woukd get response no matter my outcome.  Tespaxi I mentioned whats hybrid ? Then they say as college ko timing haru milauna garo hunxa so we dont force candidate people to come on fix time and that was such a relief as mero college alli tadai parxa and exams haru ni sochna paryo.  And the final question I asked why its called bootcamp but not internship ans they say internship vanyp vane final year ko matra auxan but this is for anyone interested wether its just student who crossed 12 or passed masters. Interested jati plus who show initiative they plan to take those.  Dar laerathyo because I thought its was a perfect fit for me. And now sigh of relief I just got an email that I was selected.  Well I am sure yaa aru pani tannai talented manxe haru xan so dont think you wont get internship mero ni kunai katrai teyena and do apply who knows maybe you are my next colleuge whom I would work with.",

No, yet most nations frown or ban them from being raised for slaughter.  The same is true here. Cows are important part of their religious or cultural identity for most Nepalese people.

We are Hindu majority. Nepalese of all religion are already normalized to not consuming beef, this will start a conflict amongst our own majority. Us not consuming beef has kept Muslims and Christians in low numbers- they are major consumers of beef and send missionaries everywhere to increase their numbers. If there are two similarly sized groups with different people- that will create political conflict and add to our issues. We already see this play out in western countries- they have major political issues around Muslims and recently Indians (who they associate with Hinduism which they've already begun to hate in Canada, and if you a brown Nepali- you are Indian to them) Don't make moves that will drive your own group's numbers low. We have to keep the status quo in regards to issues like this.   Not eating cow has not created any issue that is worth our attention.

But the very reason eating beef is prohibited because it is against so called 'hindu' norms.  During the Rig Vedic period, beef was a diet. After the 'puran yug', so many new dieties were created like Narayan and Laxmi. And thus eating cows became a taboo.   But a law is a law. Laws need to change too as per the dynamics of society. If you don't change the law, people will always create chaos over such things.  Regarding this and other so called 'hindu' values, we khas people and Hindusized Kirati are far liberal. It is a very disturbing fact that even them people can't comprehend that 'Hindu'  values were imported from modern day North India.  'Hinduism' is not the de facto religion of Nepal, mainly the hilly and mountainous region. But in the Terai region that adjoins with Bihar and surrounding provinces, 'hindu' values are very deep rooted in their genes. It will be almost impossible to get them behave in different ways.  This issue is a serious one. Rai, Limbu and other Kirati tribes want to eat beef. It is not that they are not eating already. But they want it to be legal.  But the 'hindus' whose ancestry goes back to modern day North India and those khas people who think 'hinduism' was always their roots find it very hard to digest.   If you understand the root of the problem,  solution is easy.   If it was up to me, I would change the law leaving it to be individual or provincial freedom. Tolerance need to be practiced. No 'hindu' will be forced to eat beef or witness the killing or trade. But no non-hindu should be prohibited from eating it.  I'd advise my 'hindu' friend that they learn history beyond puran ages. And again, I request them to understand Nepal is not as very much 'hindu' as as India. Our ruling class adopted 'hinduism' so the common people were forced to follow 'hinduism'.  I also request them to understand that they do not always have the final or decisive say because we are not a Hindu kingdom anymore and there is no hindu king to enforce the law strictly.  Disowing those who raise question is very bad practice. They are as Nepali as anybody can be and in their mind they are fighting to preserve their long held values.|||Extremist area ma estai ho.

The breakup might not even be the real cause, but just a rumor people create to justify what they cannot understand.  In Nepal, mental health awareness is still so rare. People often fail to see that behind someone’s smile, there might be silent battles, unhealed wounds, and unseen pain.  Our parents believe that paying school fees, buying clothes, giving pocket money, and providing food and comfort is enough. Yet they forget the most precious thing: time, presence, and the warmth of genuine understanding.  So many children and young people hesitate to speak about their struggles, not because they don’t want to, but because they were never truly heard. And it’s not their parents’ fault entirely, because their own voices were once silenced, leaving them unsure how to listen with compassion.  As one philosopher said, “Suicide is not just an act of ending one’s life; it is a quiet murder committed by society, a society that failed to understand the weight an individual carried alone.”|||May she rest in peace, padhai future kei ko pressure thyo hola. muji auntieharu le chei manxe marda ni ke ke assume garnu parne.|||I hope you're fine. you must be very disturbed with the incident|||CEE Deko ta Haina ne hijo?|||Can u pls tell me which area?|||Rest in peace|||These gaule aunties just assume things and come to conclusion you should ignore them|||thats so sad man|||Now people will judge her, Lol.

Israel has been doing this for a long time — bombing cities, hospitals, and homes — killing thousands of innocent people, including children, all in the name of “wiping out Hamas.” But do you really believe that all the people in those hospitals and cities were Hamas members? No. Most of them were innocent civilians, families, and children.  I’m not supporting Hamas. I’m supporting the innocent people of Gaza who are suffering endlessly. Yes, we lost a brave soul, Bipin Joshi, because of Hamas — and that’s tragic. But at the same time, we must not ignore the pain of the people in Gaza who are losing their loved ones every single day due to Israel’s continuous bombings.

Over 90,000 lives have been lost most of them civilians also israel is stopping aid.  No one in their right mind can support Israel’s actions.

So the narrative usualy goes like \" hamas killed and hold people of isreal or other natioanlities hostages so all other non hamas palestine people are also accountable\" which doesnot hold true.   Non hamas palestine people are also victim to hamas actions and have share uncessarily shared blame and hate due to hamas.   Anti palestine uses this narrative effectively. And when palestine people are blamed for hamas action. They are forced by circumtasces to show support to hamas to save them from their predicament (isreal genocide)",

            "body": "My (ex) friend let's say “**Shakiraaaa**” was the one who actually did it.  She was 26, living alone in a tiny 1BHK in Baneshwor. The ceiling leaked, and her landlord would bang on the door every 1st of the month asking for 15k rent. Her salary was 22k after tax.  One month, her brother’s remittance from Qatar got delayed. Dashain expenses had already drained her savings, and the landlord threatened to change the lock.  Scrolling Instagram one night, she found a Dubai-based account DMing random Nepali girls:  >***“Clean feet, good arches, 500 AED per set.”***  That’s around 19,000 NPR for 10 photos. No face. No name. Just soles on a white bedsheet.  She laughed at first. Then opened eSewa and saw the balance: Rs. 1,500.  The next evening, she went to Bhatbhateni, bought a Rs. 400 white bedsheet, painted her nails red (the guy’s request), locked her door, and took 15 photos on burst mode. She sent the best 10 through Telegram.  Money transferred in 10–20 minutes. She paid her rent, bought groceries, and treated herself to a Rs. 300 coffee like nothing had happened.  We stopped being friends a month later, not because I judged her hustle, but because she started scaling it. She began coaching other 1-2 girls from of her friends circle and took a 20 percent cut as their manager. Last I heard, she had stopped doing it, got married, and moved out of Nepal.  The funniest part, she actually suggested I do a pedicure and make my feet look good like a girl because, apparently, my white feet would sell. I just laughed and stayed out of it. 😑🥲  But, the worst thing she did was turn survival into a startup for few months.  Okay, now I’m curious. What’s the wildest thing you’ve seen someone do for cash?",

There could be others, who scored 1000, 999 and 998 before you. So, competition is tough, repeating same thing multiple times doesn't mean, good score.

            "heading": "Time-Travelling to the 90s with Notepad 😭",
            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I’ve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don’t know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

I get 2 days off per week. Honestly, Nepal is the best place for me to live, as everything just feels cheap here. My monthly expenses don’t even hit 40k npr, since I live with my family, and I can save around 300k npr per month.  I have flexible work hours and can work from anywhere in Nepal. If you spend a bit of time gaining the right skills when you are a bachelor student, you can get a remote job super easily. There are hundreds of jobs waiting for you. Earning in $$$ feels like heaven.   My advice for young Nepalese on Reddit:  \\- Bachelor ma pick up a strong tech skill. You will never regret it later.  \\- Ani, If you are a tech student, don’t ignore coding, it opens a lot of doors later on.  **My role: Offensive Security Engineer, Certs I’ve earned: OSCP, OSWE, CREST (CPSA + CRT)**",

Remember to save for the winter, as winter will come eventually|||money wise this looks good, actually I used to think like you a few years ago. but you'll feel the pain of living in third world country whenever you face any problem, you have health issue, have to visit government office, order from abroad, invest your savings. many doctors in Nepal could not care less about patient and will frequently misdiagnose. My hajurbuwa died due to negligence and misdiagnosis here. My uncle was given the wrong combination of medicine that nearly cost him his life. Noone gives a sh\\*t here. you have to deal with outdated bureaucracy anytime you need any document or other government work done. government offices have still not digitized many of their records and you might end up finding out some day like me that your old document is now nowhere to be found. No convenient delivery and shopping. If you want to invest your earnings abroad, tough luck, only options are overpriced land and Nepse stocks. everyone trying to scam you.

They outsource their jobs to poorer countries where people are happy to accept a meager $2800/month, whereas a domestic worker in the US would have to be paid at least double that. So the company saves 50% of their costs pretty much immediately. Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to. If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.   I hope the US government puts into place policies that make outsourcing jobs much more expensive/restrictive than hiring domestic workers.|||What you planning to do with the money saved|||what do you recommend to get the skill on ?|||What courses/sites helped you the most in developing your skills?|||Daily work hour?|||is it that common to find a remote job that pays in dollars or is it very rare? just curious bcz planning to study cs|||Is it too little too late to start at final bachelors year.

I'm no expert but I  do come with a few facts . The actual knowledge I feel like I know it better than anyone here. Not bragging .  So take it as a means of education. I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it. Capitalism and communism don't antagonises each other. They coexist in a healthy modern economy.|||Ask a regular min wage worker in the US if capitalism is working for them.

From your iPhone / iPad:  Open Find My → Devices → tap your Mac.  Options: Play Sound, Directions (if location available), Mark as Lost (Lock), Erase This Device.   From any browser:  Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID → Find iPhone → select your Mac from All Devices and use the same options.   What each option does:  Play Sound — helps if it’s nearby.  Mark as Lost / Lock — remotely locks the Mac with a passcode and shows your message/phone number on screen. It also disables Apple Pay.  Erase Mac — wipes data. Use only if you’re sure you can’t get it back; after erasing you can no longer track it.   2) If Find My was not enabled  Tracking is much harder. Still:  Check your Google account (if Chrome was signed in) for recent device activity.  Check services you used (Dropbox, Microsoft, email) for recent logins — they sometimes reveal IP/location.  Look at any linked accounts for device lists under your Apple ID (appleid.apple.com → Devices) — it shows serial numbers and last seen info.   3) Gather identifying info (do this now)  Serial number of the Mac (found on original box/receipt, Apple invoice, or appleid.apple.com under your devices).

I used to work for a Nepali Marwari owner here in the US who had around 30 stores under one of the biggest wireless companies in the country. Dude was loaded the brand name itself brought in enough business to make him filthy rich.  But man, the micromanagement was on another level. He believed employees should always be under pressure. Two minutes late? You’d get sent home with 2–3 follow-up emails. He had cameras everywhere and watched every move if you touched your phone for even a second, you’d get an email warning.  We had to message the group chat every time we clocked in, went on break, and clocked out while doing same in an app. It was ridiculous. The managers around him were total yes-men with no real management skills or education, just doing whatever the boss said.  Most of us employees were Nepali, Indian, or other South Asians, and we just tolerated it. But eventually, they started pulling the same nonsense with the white employees constant monitoring, weird punishments, and micromanaging everything. Those folks didn’t stay quiet.  When they complained, he retaliated by transferring them to faraway locations (which, by the way, is illegal in the US I didn’t even know that back then). They ended up suing the company.  After months of legal battles, the owner lost big time. He had to settle for almost $1 million, and worst of all, he lost his business licenses. Now, he can’t make any major business decisions without approval from the state attorney.

Tech adaptations are wide and quick, but regulation and accountability are close to non-existent. There is also a steep decline in the quality and camaraderie of the developer community.   Ultimately, the possibility and goal of earning well compared to other professions is and has been the motivation for lots of young graduates getting into software/product development/design. With the field now getting more complex and overwhelming to start as a beginner, and the unstable tech-job market, it puts more pressure on newcomers to integrate.  For these kinds of companies (mostly newly started, providing services as consultants for foreign companies), there's a low probability of growing to the scale of other established tech companies in Nepal. But I'm not trying to undermine and paint a negative image here. Rather, it can be the best opportunity and environment for a motivated individual to learn and grow together with team members.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So, here are a couple of points I'd like to suggest to newcomers/students getting into this profession:  * **GROWTH**: Always keep your individual growth as the main motivator. Keep it as a core \"essence\" of being a developer. Comparing yourself with your own past self will help you a lot in the long run. Secondly, a good payslip is always great to have as a +motivator. * **Incremental & Iterative**: Anything you'll learn or want to improve upon will take time. You'll need to make mistakes/errors, analyse why and how they occurred, and do it again with the correction. * **EMPATHY**: It's what most people lack in every field, and I like to believe that people can change. An empathetic co-worker makes the working environment more pleasant just by being in the office. They will see their team members as a collaborator in their work rather than their 'juniors' or just 'people who work under their command'.  If the 'co-worker' or 'supervisor', who'll be involved with your onboarding/daily tasks, lacks any understanding of these aspects, then I believe they're not quite fit for a LEADERSHIP role, despite their years of experience and how much BETTER of a developer they are.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|||[deleted]|||\\#CompanyProfiling   noted!|||This is exactly what happens abroad lol.",

First of all, India has a 1bn population. Given the hostility between the US and china, most of the big tech have their satellite offices in India, and that gets so much of techs from India. Because, people see scope in tech, many Indians go for BTech, CS.  But - how much of tech innovation do you see from India vs China or the US?  There was a time once when you could hire 5 people in India with a budget for 1 in the US. Now that is slowly going away, so many of the tech companies are now expanding in Africa and Latin America.|||Lol I work with Indians in a US company, don't get me wrong there are a lot of quality indians software engineers but this premise about Indians being the only one who are crazy tech talented is a joke, if that was the case we'd see some innovative indian tech company comparable to the ones from China/US.|||'America Kya keheta tha' ?|||Bill Gates also said he would rather hire lazy people to his company because they would find an easier way to do difficult task.|||I once interned at one of the FAANG (now MAANG) companies, and from my experience, I can say without a doubt that Indians play a massive role in the top American tech firms. They’ve become an inseparable part of the U.S. IT industry a huge portion of the real engineering work is done by them. These companies rely heavily on Indian talent, and because of that, Indian Americans have grown to become quite influential, even in U.S. politics. It’s no surprise that they’re now the highest-earning ethnic group in the entire country.  I remember one senior engineer I worked with a German once told me, *“Indian Americans are the 21st-century Jews of America.”* That line stuck with me.  But it does make you wonder if Indians are so talented, why isn’t India as developed as the U.S.? The main issue is the lack of a strong support system and consistent government backing for innovation and startups. For a long time, India didn’t create the right environment to make full use of its skilled people.  Now, about whether India is catching up to China in tech not quite yet. Chinese engineers are incredibly skilled, and China still has a big edge in infrastructure, funding, and startup ecosystems. Right now, India sits at number three, behind the U.S. and China, in the global tech scene. But give it another 20–25 years, and India could very well take the second spot, right after China.  That said, India’s future looks bright. The liberalization policies and the country’s strong emphasis on education have built a solid foundation. Institutions like the IITs, AIIMS, and IIMs have produced some of the best minds in engineering, medicine, and business. These people are driving not just India’s growth but also global innovation. With an open economy, a thriving startup culture, and millions of ambitious young people, India is steadily moving toward becoming one of the leading technology and economic powers of the world behind China.|||Is there another Microsoft in China though?|||India chai haina China le chai banauxa arko MS    They are good at creating and that works too   India on other hand will send huge skilled resources tara banauna chai sakdaina hai   India ko IT market thulo xa    ani China ko le ta duniya nai chalya xa hai   reminded of some so called nepali techfluencers haru    Nepal lai IT hub banayera tech revolution lyaune    some dude from NASIT (shitty association of IT comanies of Nepal)|||Well Indians are great at tech that's a fact we can't deny that.

You will find Nepali, Iranian, Indian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, and others working in the US.  From my experience, I can tell you that the Chinese are the most competent ones. My advisor is Chinese, and she is so demanding and well-versed that I can't explain. Indians don't even come close to their skills and competence. So, to answer no, they aren't.|||“People believe anything when it’s put between quotation marks.”   — *Abraham Linkon*|||India's vaunted software industry has outsourced the least technologically demanding and most labor-intensive parts of the European and American software industries. The reality is that India lacks internet giants, nor does it have widely used software applications. Even the major software applications developed domestically are from the US. While you could argue that Indians participated in the development of these applications, it's still not Indian software. This isn't entirely bad, however. The internet industry is dominated by only two major players: the US and China. Even Europe and Japan have seen their internet industries and talent drained by the US. For example, in the electric vehicle industry, Chinese electric vehicle companies are internet giants, while German electric vehicle companies are industrial giants. Germany's lack of internet talent forces it to partner with Chinese companies for technology, whereas 30 years ago, China partnered with German automakers due to a lack of technology. Before his death, Henry Kissinger expressed concern about Europe's extreme lack of long-term strategic planning. Many Europeans still fail to grasp this reality, their thinking still mired in outdated Cold War thinking, which sees a Soviet Union as the scapegoat for all their mistakes. India and many other countries haven't fared any better than Europe.|||Bro been working with Indians for last 2 years. 90% of them are \"Kaam chorr\".|||1. Indians are indeed good at replicating pre-existing products. 2. With a population of 1.4 Billion - India has the market  for growth not just for tech companies but any international company looking to increase their revenues (CAGR and what not). 3. Microsoft's subscription model doesn't really suit the South Asian population.  But having said all this, Bill probably said it as a joke (if he indeed said it).

Also, Nepal actually has more women than men, so statistically it’s not a supply issue, even without arranged marriages, people will still get married because, well, people are gonna to get married.|||Our society is weird on relationships and all. I agree with this.  Wanna hear something more controversial? If we are deconstructing societal values around marriage then women will have it harder than men because society today places implicit \"value\" in women. I know it sounds like red pill bs, but women can use (arranged) marriage for upwards mobility, men can't.  The solution to that is workplace equality, but that's easier said than done. But a lot of women don't even want that. So arranged marriage is a compromise between women who don't wanna get involved in the workforce and the men OP described. Op is unaware of the kind of women who agree to arranged marriage, so they think getting rid of arranged marriage will disproportionately affect men.|||https://preview.redd.it/ay5l0evksfxf1.jpeg?width=498&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12290f0b4e385e82f1aa9d2858ce84863c93fa42  Gender war here we go again|||Remove the concept of Nepali women marrying NRN and green card holders, and you’ll see how easily Nepali women will settle for the same type of men that this post is describing.|||Can't relate.

People need to understand that when two people live together, both need to compromise a bit. What they compromise on and how much depends on their partners.  This post is extremely one sided and not representative of reality because love marriages are almost as common as arranged marriage. Some communities have more, others less.   Also, if arranged marriages are removed from societies, women would need to get married to someone who's not yet settled in life. If not, they'd have to marry someone who's much older or wait till they're in their late 20s - mid 30s.

To further clarify:   Upper echelon men and women mostly date at their level of wealth, attractiveness and power.  Average men and women will date on their level as well but an average women has higher chance of dating upper echelon of men and women in comparison to average men.   Lower echelon men and women also date each other most of the time but lower echelon women also have higher chance of dating average men and women in comparison to lower echelon men.

Also, if men don't get married, women automatically don't get married too.|||This is why I believe in dowry concept it might sound rude but this is what it is. Since, most of the people have their past life and multiple relationships even before marriage these days. And that relation sometimes seems so so deeply rooted that it becomes difficult to forget. Some are involved in extramarital affairs as well. Then there's bitterness in the present married life and relations with family of husband. Now assume if her husband was single till the marriage for a perfect wife but what he got? Nothing but mental tension afterwards.   The psychological impact a normal people can't even bear. And sometimes girls even planned to marry a rich guy just for money and then divorce and get alimony which she'll spend with her lover. Sometimes, she even plans to kill her husband to get out of that thing. This is freaking crazy how people are thinking this way. I'm not justifying that she's the only culprit here but also her ex cum present hidden lover is equally involved.   Now in this situation it's better to live unmarried or take a grand amount as collateral if you are doing an arranged marriage. So that it will be easier for alimony.   You might call me bias but the thing is different. If we alternate the situation like a groom will have to leave his home and settle with bride forever, and if alimony should be paid by the bride after getting divorced, yeah a groom should have to give dowry as the collateral.   Fun fact: Love marriages crash faster than arranged ones. It’s like 1 v 1 versus many v many, so too many players in the latter provide team support 😅 during clashes.

Nowadays, marriage is about partnership, trust, companionship, love and respect.

When you cut off the expectations, you feel more happier and contained with yourself. You begin to prioritize, be selfish and learn more about people. I have the same situation. Accept that I left home 2 years back. First year was really difficult. This year also, I shifted in a new city. My aunty just bought me dry ass cookies and call it a day. I begin to hide my birthday and treat myself biryani,  ice cream and stuff. And why just birthday? I try to make my every moment special. I try to treat myself the most special person in this world. And people are getting attracted to me these days. But I don't care at all. I am just focused on my goals. People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within. And people don't understand that simple thing.🤣🤣🤣|||Yesterday it was mine birthday too but same situation.|||Happy belated birthdayyyyy|||mero nii birthday aaudai xaa wish gara la mallai on  November 4 nai birse bro . anyways dhillo bhaye Pani wish gare haii Happy birthday dai/dd|||Happy Belated Birthday <3|||Meroni thyo hijo.

The same customer who had to defend consumerim and capitalism and privat business ownership while you were hiding behind lawyers and Facebook posts?  Let’s be real, you’re not being defamed, you’re just being remembered and reminded of your past Carbon emission and GHGs you have ever emitted.   You’re not being bullied, you’re being held accountable and pay fair share.  And that “Shame on you, GreenPeace” line? Cute.   Because honestly, the only person who needs to feel shame here is you for buying leaders and avoiding taxes.   You lost your respect, your reputation, and your credibility, and instead of owning up, you’re out here trying to sound deep on Facebook and social medai. Bro, that’s not redemption. That’s delusion. Customer are always right. This earth belong to us the whole world not for one corporation to benefit at the expense of other.   So stop acting like the world owes you sympathy and our tax credit.   You’re not the victim, you’re the reason this whole mess even exists. aka climate change.|||Jindagi ma fasle accusation chahi kosailai nalagos bhagwan, not talking about sandip , ekchoti testo case lagyo bhane nagareko bhayeni dukha paine chai raicha!

I agree that we have seen many rich and high power people get away with any crime. But let me remind you some cases : Maina Sunuwar, Rabi Lammichanne and other where everyone praised the court and claimed justice stood.Even you might know many of the cases  What I find uncomfortably troubling is that  People have been shifting their narrative about the court in whatever comforts them. Literally what Rabi did : When big politicians got GUITY from the court he said \"adalat le vaneko namanne?\"  When it was his turn he said every court is corrupt trying to get away. We are facing a same scenario here. Firstly the case was approached from a minor consent. And as far i believe the age couldn't be proven to be under 18. So this might have been a consensual sex.|||Maile timilai euta kunai case lagaidiye vane timi criminal vayou?

The day that couple spent the night together, next day aayera afnai room mate sanga ekdum excited bhayera Kura gareko cha. A few weeks later gayera case haleko cha. Usko roommate ko statement sunnu paila.   First ma statutory rape bhanyo, which was a massive one. Tyo case ho Bhane Sandeep should rot in jail. Tara that wasn’t the case, ani age ta 18 above cha raicha Bhanera tha paye pachi case chai rape ko ma change bhayo. Tyo pani when you go through the whole thing, it is pretty easy to make it out that the girl was trying to mint money out of Sandeep. It was a honey trap Bhanera ta sabai lai tha cha.   I don’t know Sandeep personally and don’t care if he’s arrogant or k k. It doesn’t matter. Because that’s not why he’s defamed.   Aba you’ll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re. Harek din naya bayaan and naya kahaani. Kt party ko main intention nai was to get as much of compensation as possible rather than punishing Sandeep.   And brought shame to our cricketing fraternity rey? Yo statement batai it’s easy to assume ki yo post garne eauta kti ho, ki jindagi ma lukera basne kta ho or Bharkhar ko fucche ho.  Even Cristiano Ronaldo was accused of rape numerous times. Eauta case ta it’s ekdummai severe. That girl immediately told her friends and filed lawsuit walla. Sandeep ko ta proper honeytrap thyo, Ronaldo had an actual case against him. But bail payo, where he still continued with his career. Unlike Sandeep, Ronaldo continued with his career. Pachi final verdict afnai favor ma payo.   So did he bring shame to Portugal? To Real Madrid? (at the time of the case) Ani Sandeep le chai kasari?   You put yourself in his shoes. You go out on a date with someone. Everything seems perfect, you guys kiss hug and spend an amazing time together. Belka you guys stay out ani make out. Bholi you drop her home. Then you go out for your work, ani bahira huda nai after a few weeks you find out that girl has filed a complaint for rape against you. What would you do?

We are Hindu majority. Nepalese of all religion are already normalized to not consuming beef, this will start a conflict amongst our own majority. Us not consuming beef has kept Muslims and Christians in low numbers- they are major consumers of beef and send missionaries everywhere to increase their numbers. If there are two similarly sized groups with different people- that will create political conflict and add to our issues. We already see this play out in western countries- they have major political issues around Muslims and recently Indians (who they associate with Hinduism which they've already begun to hate in Canada, and if you a brown Nepali- you are Indian to them) Don't make moves that will drive your own group's numbers low. We have to keep the status quo in regards to issues like this.   Not eating cow has not created any issue that is worth our attention. Focus on tackling actual issues like further eradicating this baun, chettri nonsense which is the bane of Hinduism- we can and are doing it while keeping our culture, traditions and identity.|||just say chamal ko bora ta paako this , visa ni paaulas ni and move on|||So much for a secular nation|||lets eat beef guys",

If you ask anybody who’s moved from outside Kathmandu (especially rural areas) to Kathmandu, they will let you tell almost a similar version to what you said.|||So basically it's the same as in homecountry. I don't understand why people think life is only hard abroad. Bro you choose you choose to go abroad. So earn your choice and yes survival is hard everywhere.|||As an older Canadian brother -  I have housed 3 Nepali guys.   Each one of them tried to scam, trick, avoid and lie their way through various things.    I made connections with each and everyone of them and helped them establish understanding that things do not get handed to them.   The concept to the OP post is not far off. Get up, have a goal and be driven. However, do not lie, cheat, steal or ask for money. If you are kind - you will see kindness shown back.   Of the 3 boys - one is getting deported. IRCC is the least of your worries. Its the boarder patrol services you should be concerned about if you try anything illegal - even a small one once to a kind Canadain.   Im glad I didnt turn my back but im also glad that somes awareness is bringing to light.    P.s. Don't pretend to be gay either - thats fraudulent and also solictitaion of sex and goes against your agreement with going abroad. Be careful fellas.   also - why only is this post geared to boys ?

You can also just aim for a comfortable life. If everyone is striving to dominate instead of collaborate, imagine how awful the world would be.   Be mentally tough re lol. Like mental toughness is something one can just learn. It comes with experience, dealing with hardships. It's not something you can just build at home. \"Read and learn every single day\" LOL.   Even in Nepal bills and rent don't wait. People don't feel sorry for you anywhere, even more so in Nepal where you are actually expected to spend so much on relatives and friends.   It's just a different country. Yes, it will be hard but it isn't a warzone.|||Boys and girls, Work hard and enjoy your life too while doing that.

People romanticize going abroad, but they don’t realize it’s a full reset! Your last name, your family status, your struggles back home, none of it matters. What counts is how disciplined and valuable you are in that new system.  I’d add, learn to manage your emotions too. It’s not just physical or financial survival — it’s mental. You’ll feel lonely, rejected, homesick, but those who turn that into fuel grow faster than anyone else. Also, you don’t have to be the smartest person, but be reliable. The world respects consistency.|||J pani overdramatic banauna parni hau Nepali harulai..

            "body": "I always thought my life was done for. I was a bad son and a bad brother. I let my family down so many times that they eventually kicked me out. Fair enough, I couldn’t offer them anything except shame and duniya ko tana. I’ve heard things like “Yesto xora janmaunu vanda na janmekai thik hunthyo”. Those words used to hurt me a lot, but still I couldn’t change.  I’ve done many wrong things in life which i regrets . Been to jail a few times, have criminal charges, got rusticated from college because of fights, couldn’t complete my bachelor. Friends betrayed me too they were only there when they could use me. As time passed, I got more depressed. Most of the time, only suicidal thoughts used to come to my mind. I had no place to stay, used to sleep where I worked or sometimes on the street.  One day I finally decided I’d had enough. Bought a mouse poison, tried to take my life. But at the very last moment I was too scared to die. I cried for a long time that night. I realized how miserable I had become to even think of doing that.  But that night I also realized something  maybe I’m not done yet. Maybe there’s still a small ray of hope. I still wanted to live, and live a good life. I had only two options: either change myself completely or kill myself. I couldn’t choose the second option.  So I started working hard doing different odd jobs. Quitted smoking and drinking at once it was so hard. I used to get worst panic attacks, but I managed.   Now I’ve been clean for a year. I have my own small room to live in, my own second-hand bike, and I earn through a ride-sharing app. I also started self-studying because I couldn’t finish my bachelor. Been learning programming from YouTube for two months now. It’s tough, but I’m thinking of joining classes soon. Someone told me you don’t need a college degree to become a software developer, and that really motivated me.  I even tried to apply abroad, but because of my police record it wasn’t possible. So now I just want to become someone respectable in my own country. I want to prove my father wrong. They still don’t know where I am, but one day I’ll go to them when they can proudly call me their son.  It feels unreal sometimes that I have my own room, my own food, my own bike , own laptop(second hand😁) all this within just one year. I can’t believe it. A year ago, I wanted to die. Now I just want to live better. Even though I'm alone , It really feels like dream to live like this.   Happy Happy tihar everyone and happy  bhaitika. Aja didi ko kasto yaad aayo!!

There could be others, who scored 1000, 999 and 998 before you. So, competition is tough, repeating same thing multiple times doesn't mean, good score. Overtime, brain starts to saturate, hallucinate and if not taken care, gives up and become mad. The competition itself is not for light hearted. TLDR: rpeating years, doesn't equal to same amount of preparations every year. Some years are good, some are not.

            "heading": "Time-Travelling to the 90s with Notepad 😭",
            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I’ve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don’t know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it.

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts.

They called the “earn and learn” program an internship, likely just to bypass foreign employment laws. In reality, it was pure exploitation. From what I’ve read, students were made to work five days a week in questionable conditions and study only one. I wouldn’t be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.

They outsource their jobs to poorer countries where people are happy to accept a meager $2800/month, whereas a domestic worker in the US would have to be paid at least double that. So the company saves 50% of their costs pretty much immediately. Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to. If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.   I hope the US government puts into place policies that make outsourcing jobs much more expensive/restrictive than hiring domestic workers.|||What you planning to do with the money saved|||what do you recommend to get the skill on ?|||What courses/sites helped you the most in developing your skills?|||Daily work hour?|||is it that common to find a remote job that pays in dollars or is it very rare? just curious bcz planning to study cs|||Is it too little too late to start at final bachelors year.

While most countries have been struggling with deforestation, Nepal somehow managed to reverse the trend.  A few key reasons:  * **Community Forestry Program** — locals manage and protect their own forests instead of the central government. * **Rural-Urban Migration** — many farmlands were abandoned as people moved to cities or abroad for work, letting nature reclaim them. * **Alternative Energy** — more use of biogas and LPG means less dependence on firewood. * **Reforestation & Conservation** — national parks, reserves, and local planting drives helped too.  Now nearly **45% of Nepal’s total land** is covered by forests — up from around **25% in the early 1990s**.  Pretty wild, right?   What do you think — is community-led management the real key here, or did urban migration play a bigger role?

If recovery isn’t possible, does anyone know **any trusted shops, vendors, or businesses that buy or accept large NTC balances** (maybe at a discounted rate)?

In very rare, exceptional cases, NTC may have options for extremely large accidental top-ups, though the taxes already paid to the government make a full reversal highly complex. * **Attempt a formal complaint through the digital wallet:** If they used a digital wallet like eSewa or Khalti, they should file a complaint with that wallet provider. These wallets can act as intermediaries and request a reversal from [Nepal Telecom](https://www.ntc.net.np/), though ultimately, NTC controls the outcome.   Long-term strategies for using the balance  Since a refund is almost certainly not an option, the best approach is to recover the value over time by converting the credit back into cash.  * **Offer balance transfers to friends and family:** The Reddit user can offer to transfer balance to friends and family in exchange for cash. This is a common and reliable method of liquidating NTC balance.    * **Balance transfer limits:** NTC allows up to 20 transfers per day, with a maximum of Rs. 500 per transfer.    * **Execution:** They can use the NTC mobile app or the USSD code `*422*SecurityCode*RecipientNumber*Amount#` to initiate transfers. * **Offer mobile top-ups in the local community:** For people who prefer cash transactions, the user can act as an unofficial recharge agent. They can offer to top up people's phones in exchange for cash, perhaps at a small discount to incentivize the transaction. * **Bundle and sell discounted packages:** The user can purchase various voice, data, and SMS packs offered by NTC and resell them to others at a discounted rate. For example, they could buy a large 28-day data pack with a market value of Rs. 999 and sell it to someone for a reduced cash price. * **Use the balance for services and bills:** The user can offer to pay for other people's utility bills that can be settled via an NTC number and accept cash in return. This could include things like landline or internet service bills if NTC provides them.   Warning for the Reddit user  * **Scams:** Advise the user to be very cautious about offers from strangers promising to buy the balance or provide a refund. They should only perform transactions with people they know and trust to avoid losing the balance without getting paid. * **Security code:** The NTC security code for balance transfers is like a bank PIN and should never be shared with anyone. The user must perform all transfers themselves. |||Chora chori thula vayinjel samma balance halna parena aba..😝|||At this point, I’ve accepted there’s no way to get a refund.

The guy *never* talks about KP Oli, UML’s corruption, or even the brutal killing of protesting students. Not a single strong word.  But the moment it’s about Balen or the current government, he suddenly becomes super active — posting videos, making speeches, calling everyone out. Like, where was all this energy when students were being beaten or when Oli was selling out the country’s interests?  It’s like he selectively targets whoever’s in power now, just to look “anti-establishment,” while conveniently staying silent about the past. If he really cared about truth and justice, he’d call out *all* sides — not just pick easy targets for clout.  Feels like he’s slowly turning into just another political opportunist hiding behind the “independent” tag.",

I was supposed to be home in just 1.5 months. I kept imagining how happy he’d be when he’d see me again.   He wasn’t just a pet. He was family, my little brother. I don’t have siblings, and he filled that space in my life with his sweet energy and unconditional love. I can’t describe the guilt and pain I feel.

Luckily, as the world is slowly becoming aware of this, so the regulations starts to exist.

I'm no expert but I  do come with a few facts . The actual knowledge I feel like I know it better than anyone here. Not bragging .  So take it as a means of education. I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it.

I used to work for a Nepali Marwari owner here in the US who had around 30 stores under one of the biggest wireless companies in the country. Dude was loaded the brand name itself brought in enough business to make him filthy rich.  But man, the micromanagement was on another level. He believed employees should always be under pressure. Two minutes late? You’d get sent home with 2–3 follow-up emails. He had cameras everywhere and watched every move if you touched your phone for even a second, you’d get an email warning.  We had to message the group chat every time we clocked in, went on break, and clocked out while doing same in an app. It was ridiculous. The managers around him were total yes-men with no real management skills or education, just doing whatever the boss said.  Most of us employees were Nepali, Indian, or other South Asians, and we just tolerated it. But eventually, they started pulling the same nonsense with the white employees constant monitoring, weird punishments, and micromanaging everything. Those folks didn’t stay quiet.  When they complained, he retaliated by transferring them to faraway locations (which, by the way, is illegal in the US I didn’t even know that back then). They ended up suing the company.  After months of legal battles, the owner lost big time. He had to settle for almost $1 million, and worst of all, he lost his business licenses. Now, he can’t make any major business decisions without approval from the state attorney.  Man had everything going for him a successful business, money, connections but greed and micromanagement destroyed it all|||Wow, the folks over at SCN really do seem to be speedrunning labor law violations.

Tech adaptations are wide and quick, but regulation and accountability are close to non-existent. There is also a steep decline in the quality and camaraderie of the developer community.   Ultimately, the possibility and goal of earning well compared to other professions is and has been the motivation for lots of young graduates getting into software/product development/design. With the field now getting more complex and overwhelming to start as a beginner, and the unstable tech-job market, it puts more pressure on newcomers to integrate.  For these kinds of companies (mostly newly started, providing services as consultants for foreign companies), there's a low probability of growing to the scale of other established tech companies in Nepal. But I'm not trying to undermine and paint a negative image here. Rather, it can be the best opportunity and environment for a motivated individual to learn and grow together with team members.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So, here are a couple of points I'd like to suggest to newcomers/students getting into this profession:  * **GROWTH**: Always keep your individual growth as the main motivator. Keep it as a core \"essence\" of being a developer. Comparing yourself with your own past self will help you a lot in the long run. Secondly, a good payslip is always great to have as a +motivator. * **Incremental & Iterative**: Anything you'll learn or want to improve upon will take time. You'll need to make mistakes/errors, analyse why and how they occurred, and do it again with the correction. * **EMPATHY**: It's what most people lack in every field, and I like to believe that people can change. An empathetic co-worker makes the working environment more pleasant just by being in the office. They will see their team members as a collaborator in their work rather than their 'juniors' or just 'people who work under their command'.  If the 'co-worker' or 'supervisor', who'll be involved with your onboarding/daily tasks, lacks any understanding of these aspects, then I believe they're not quite fit for a LEADERSHIP role, despite their years of experience and how much BETTER of a developer they are.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|||[deleted]|||\\#CompanyProfiling   noted!|||This is exactly what happens abroad lol.",

First of all, India has a 1bn population. Given the hostility between the US and china, most of the big tech have their satellite offices in India, and that gets so much of techs from India. Because, people see scope in tech, many Indians go for BTech, CS.  But - how much of tech innovation do you see from India vs China or the US?  There was a time once when you could hire 5 people in India with a budget for 1 in the US. Now that is slowly going away, so many of the tech companies are now expanding in Africa and Latin America.|||Lol I work with Indians in a US company, don't get me wrong there are a lot of quality indians software engineers but this premise about Indians being the only one who are crazy tech talented is a joke, if that was the case we'd see some innovative indian tech company comparable to the ones from China/US.|||'America Kya keheta tha' ?|||Bill Gates also said he would rather hire lazy people to his company because they would find an easier way to do difficult task.|||I once interned at one of the FAANG (now MAANG) companies, and from my experience, I can say without a doubt that Indians play a massive role in the top American tech firms. They’ve become an inseparable part of the U.S. IT industry a huge portion of the real engineering work is done by them. These companies rely heavily on Indian talent, and because of that, Indian Americans have grown to become quite influential, even in U.S. politics. It’s no surprise that they’re now the highest-earning ethnic group in the entire country.  I remember one senior engineer I worked with a German once told me, *“Indian Americans are the 21st-century Jews of America.”* That line stuck with me.  But it does make you wonder if Indians are so talented, why isn’t India as developed as the U.S.? The main issue is the lack of a strong support system and consistent government backing for innovation and startups. For a long time, India didn’t create the right environment to make full use of its skilled people.  Now, about whether India is catching up to China in tech not quite yet. Chinese engineers are incredibly skilled, and China still has a big edge in infrastructure, funding, and startup ecosystems. Right now, India sits at number three, behind the U.S. and China, in the global tech scene. But give it another 20–25 years, and India could very well take the second spot, right after China.  That said, India’s future looks bright. The liberalization policies and the country’s strong emphasis on education have built a solid foundation. Institutions like the IITs, AIIMS, and IIMs have produced some of the best minds in engineering, medicine, and business. These people are driving not just India’s growth but also global innovation. With an open economy, a thriving startup culture, and millions of ambitious young people, India is steadily moving toward becoming one of the leading technology and economic powers of the world behind China.|||Is there another Microsoft in China though?|||India chai haina China le chai banauxa arko MS    They are good at creating and that works too   India on other hand will send huge skilled resources tara banauna chai sakdaina hai   India ko IT market thulo xa    ani China ko le ta duniya nai chalya xa hai   reminded of some so called nepali techfluencers haru    Nepal lai IT hub banayera tech revolution lyaune    some dude from NASIT (shitty association of IT comanies of Nepal)|||Well Indians are great at tech that's a fact we can't deny that.

The reality is that India lacks internet giants, nor does it have widely used software applications. Even the major software applications developed domestically are from the US. While you could argue that Indians participated in the development of these applications, it's still not Indian software. This isn't entirely bad, however. The internet industry is dominated by only two major players: the US and China. Even Europe and Japan have seen their internet industries and talent drained by the US. For example, in the electric vehicle industry, Chinese electric vehicle companies are internet giants, while German electric vehicle companies are industrial giants. Germany's lack of internet talent forces it to partner with Chinese companies for technology, whereas 30 years ago, China partnered with German automakers due to a lack of technology. Before his death, Henry Kissinger expressed concern about Europe's extreme lack of long-term strategic planning. Many Europeans still fail to grasp this reality, their thinking still mired in outdated Cold War thinking, which sees a Soviet Union as the scapegoat for all their mistakes. India and many other countries haven't fared any better than Europe.|||Bro been working with Indians for last 2 years. 90% of them are \"Kaam chorr\".|||1.

But we studied together at NITR, India.  The process in India itself is top, so it's real hard to get recruited from Nepalese colleges.|||Applying to FAANG from India is not worth it bro. First thing the competition is huge and second thing the pay for FAANG position in India is like what at max 1.5 to 2 Crore if you get lucky. And I seriously believe that the stress to compensation is not worth it.  If it was in the case of USA especially in the bay area, then I would say the grind was worth it because they pay ridiculously high, like even after all the tax cuts and expenses you can save around 100-150k easily in a year given your compensation is 350-400k USD per year and the position is at the bay area.  But competition is tough there too, you need PhDs and all.  But I think it's still better than India. In India nowadays almost like minimum 10 lakhs students have already mugged up at least 300-400 leetcode questions so, chances are slim there.  My advice is target for such positions where the competition is low, grind there for 3-4 years and apply as independent contractors for remote position, you can easily make above 100k if you are sharp.  Then move to Romania applying a digital nomad visa and pay only about flat 10-11% tax for your 100k plus income. Cost of living is also affordable in Romania, soon to be included into schengen and of course after 5 years apply for PR, get the passport and travel freely for vacation. (It's passport is in top ten strongest list)  And this is the most achievable goal and path for a Nepali IT specialist. Even if you get 60k USD remote job in Nepal, it's not worth it because the progressive tax system will make the effective tax to around 30-33% and all your tax for what? Into the belly of corrupt politicians.  Actually it's a bad idea to live in Nepal, the tax is too much. You pay 25% tax and 13% vat for almost everything. Forget about buying vehicles, the added cost is like price of Vehicle(100%) and 80% flat tax + 13% vat + 10-25% profit margin + extraa whatever. You pay more than double for any vehicles.

Look at what companies are coming to your campus and prepare for it. Thats why most people are obsessed over getting into good universities there.

So there was this post by a user named TastyMarketing47 in Tech Buy/Sell offering GPT Plus at Rs.699/month or Rs. 1000/3 months(claiming “pay after getting the product in your own email”).  He had written a long convincing description saying things like:  > “Scam ho vannu vanda agadi read: I buy from Vietnam promotional offer and sell it here with Rs.200 profit per account. The price is cheaper than Toolsmandu (999) because of the Vietnam offer. Search it up.”   Sounded somewhat believable, so I messaged him. He acted very genuine — said “no need to pay before getting access,” and even added me to some kind of Oxaam workspace.  It actually worked for about 30 minutes, then I got logged out. Tried refreshing, logging in again, clearing cookies — nothing worked. I messaged him, and he replied once saying he’s “sorting it out for all clients ,” but after that — no reply, I checked post too deleted, and he disappeared.

I’m not talking about AI chatbots, have depth. 3. Look at dev opportunities in Europe. While I was in Norway, it was comparatively a whole lot easier to get a CS job than in the US.

I absolutely hate the Google calendar app on my phone. If you need some contributions for the app I can donate via PayPal or direct bank transfer if you are in Nepal.

Wth|||works offline once loaded. that was a great feature.|||atleast has no ads and does not refresh when changing month  unlike hamropatro  W|||Amazing ! Just replaced it with hamro patro. The widget of nepali date is what sold me. The UI looks clean. I like that i can see the previous month and calendar years back but it would be cool if instead of the drop-down it was something else as the drop-down blocks the view of the current calendar and i feel it looks like the design aesthetic with the rest of the app design.   I hope you keep improving and adding new features !|||Tried it. Looks good.   One thing that i felt redundant was the popup layout when seeking other dates. Like when i want to see what is on 3rd Kartik, it opens up a popup therefore blocking the calendar entirely. I have to then close the popup  to seek through the next date. I feel that you could just update the info below the calendar for the selected date instead of the popup.   Makes it easier to seek through the dates.|||whats smarter in this calendar?|||Best!

Loads way faster than HamroPatro. Going good till now. All the best.|||Wow! I’m super impressed. Great work, man!  Also, I saw a comment saying it’s not smooth and stuck between 30-90fps. Well! It’s really smooth on my iOS. It feels like above 90, probably 120. Also, when adding reminders, can you make it show nepali date as well? I often have to hop between two apps to confirm the Nepali date while adding reminders.  And, can you make the widget also switch between light/dark mode based on my device theme?|||Well the best part of the app is it's minimilastic. Thanks.. 😊|||Loved the widgets more. Less bloat.

Many talented individuals are even losing jobs and opportunities simply because there’s no reliable way to get paid for their work.

I kindly request you to post about this problem and urge the Finance Minister and related authorities to take action.

Are there specific things I should know about taxes and compliance? Should I only target certain types of companies that can handle these complications?  If you're from Nepal and working remotely for international companies, I'd really appreciate hearing how you navigated this. What do you wish someone had told you when you were starting out?

Reasonable: You are getting paid directly to your bank with a nominal transfer fee. 2. Legal: Bank will deduct 5% tax as per government rule 3. Scalable: This action is repeatable month-after-month regardless of amount.  If you're doing any third party systems, like Wise, you lose on three fronts:   A. Wise cuts a transfer commission   B. The amount needs to be converted to NPR before sending and costs money   C. Depositing in Nepali bank has another processing fee in rupees  So this is not a good way to receive salary every month. See how much money you're losing even before paying a single rupee in tax amount.  Some companies do have issues setting up complex arrangements for just one person.

If they commission the salary on bank account then they should have no problem of wiring it straight to your bank account. They'd send you invoice and use that Invoice to show the bank in Nepal as proof of your income and you can setup that recurring payment as your employment payment and bank'll deduce 5% on each transaction from that party, hence your tax payment for Nepal government.  Ask or search for your Bank's SWIFT code and provide necessary documents, that should suffice for international payment afaik.  Edit : unconventional payment should involve third party transaction. Paypal & payoneer work but payoneer is very unreliable. If everything works, no problem but to resolve ANY problem with payoneer is a nightmare. Skrill (I haven't used it) could be an alternative. You could use someone trusted who's abroad to use their paypal.

Since, most of the people have their past life and multiple relationships even before marriage these days. And that relation sometimes seems so so deeply rooted that it becomes difficult to forget. Some are involved in extramarital affairs as well. Then there's bitterness in the present married life and relations with family of husband. Now assume if her husband was single till the marriage for a perfect wife but what he got? Nothing but mental tension afterwards.   The psychological impact a normal people can't even bear. And sometimes girls even planned to marry a rich guy just for money and then divorce and get alimony which she'll spend with her lover. Sometimes, she even plans to kill her husband to get out of that thing. This is freaking crazy how people are thinking this way. I'm not justifying that she's the only culprit here but also her ex cum present hidden lover is equally involved.   Now in this situation it's better to live unmarried or take a grand amount as collateral if you are doing an arranged marriage. So that it will be easier for alimony.   You might call me bias but the thing is different. If we alternate the situation like a groom will have to leave his home and settle with bride forever, and if alimony should be paid by the bride after getting divorced, yeah a groom should have to give dowry as the collateral.   Fun fact: Love marriages crash faster than arranged ones. It’s like 1 v 1 versus many v many, so too many players in the latter provide team support 😅 during clashes.

What kind of take is this?|||Well then both genders will have to go their own way finding their partners. It's not like only men need women or vice versa. Both genders need to have something to show for themselves to be considered by their potential partner.|||Remove the concept of marriage altogether and many girls will not find a partner in the old age because nobody wants to deal with drama anymore.|||The comments on this thread just go on to further prove the issue that the text describes. Most men would rather call it \"hating on men\" or talk badly about women instead of rising to the occassion and actually trying to do and be better. It's not just a Nepal thing, though. The same thing is happening everywhere. Marriage isn't a means for money or safety anymore as it used to be. Women now are independent and can handle their own finances It's not even about social standing anymore, the patriarchal lines of hierarchy are slowly but surely getting blurred.   Nowadays, marriage is about partnership, trust, companionship, love and respect. Most men haven't understood that and would rather blame women as being \"gold diggers\" than realize that it's not the money (or the lack thereof) that influences the attitudes of women towards them.  Remember that we have an ever increasing **male loneliness epidemic** and it's not for no reason.|||The reason behind me not knowing how to approach woman is because of their parents who were mostly arrangely married and never allowed/encouraged their sons to do so|||Mate who gives a shit how people marry? let em marry arranged or by falling in love, as long as both parties consent who cares how good or bad they are at getting in a relationship|||Haha kta le matra bihe garne hora both party share equal part in this|||Girl has a lot of priorities.

When you cut off the expectations, you feel more happier and contained with yourself. You begin to prioritize, be selfish and learn more about people. I have the same situation. Accept that I left home 2 years back. First year was really difficult. This year also, I shifted in a new city. My aunty just bought me dry ass cookies and call it a day. I begin to hide my birthday and treat myself biryani,  ice cream and stuff. And why just birthday? I try to make my every moment special. I try to treat myself the most special person in this world. And people are getting attracted to me these days. But I don't care at all. I am just focused on my goals. People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within. And people don't understand that simple thing.🤣🤣🤣|||Yesterday it was mine birthday too but same situation.|||Happy belated birthdayyyyy|||mero nii birthday aaudai xaa wish gara la mallai on  November 4 nai birse bro . anyways dhillo bhaye Pani wish gare haii Happy birthday dai/dd|||Happy Belated Birthday <3|||Meroni thyo hijo.

But let me remind you some cases : Maina Sunuwar, Rabi Lammichanne and other where everyone praised the court and claimed justice stood.Even you might know many of the cases  What I find uncomfortably troubling is that  People have been shifting their narrative about the court in whatever comforts them. Literally what Rabi did : When big politicians got GUITY from the court he said \"adalat le vaneko namanne?\"  When it was his turn he said every court is corrupt trying to get away. We are facing a same scenario here. Firstly the case was approached from a minor consent. And as far i believe the age couldn't be proven to be under 18.

You don’t want to make fun of someone without evidence, period. Whatever Sandeep has done regarding such youtube content is very right. The cheap YouTube channel should be banned.|||OP youre a fucking pig, i know for a fact you're a paradygm employee being paid a measly salary they can afford writing this to try to defame him even further lmao, its his fault that he got defamed and now its \"victim\" mindset to ask for compensation and closure?   When a whore and a group of manipulators ruined all his effort, talent and the career he had built for himself?   fuck off. Your post is gpt generated garbage, with no human critique or elements be a man, be a human instead of a corporate slave being paid next to nothing.|||All you blaming Sandeep are either girls or just boys that are sore losers in life. Aba they’ll say I’m being sexual ki rude eta uta. Okay let’s go thru facts one by one.   Firstly the whole case looks fabricated as hell. The day that couple spent the night together, next day aayera afnai room mate sanga ekdum excited bhayera Kura gareko cha. A few weeks later gayera case haleko cha. Usko roommate ko statement sunnu paila.   First ma statutory rape bhanyo, which was a massive one. Tyo case ho Bhane Sandeep should rot in jail. Tara that wasn’t the case, ani age ta 18 above cha raicha Bhanera tha paye pachi case chai rape ko ma change bhayo. Tyo pani when you go through the whole thing, it is pretty easy to make it out that the girl was trying to mint money out of Sandeep. It was a honey trap Bhanera ta sabai lai tha cha.   I don’t know Sandeep personally and don’t care if he’s arrogant or k k. It doesn’t matter. Because that’s not why he’s defamed.   Aba you’ll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re. Harek din naya bayaan and naya kahaani. Kt party ko main intention nai was to get as much of compensation as possible rather than punishing Sandeep.   And brought shame to our cricketing fraternity rey? Yo statement batai it’s easy to assume ki yo post garne eauta kti ho, ki jindagi ma lukera basne kta ho or Bharkhar ko fucche ho.  Even Cristiano Ronaldo was accused of rape numerous times. Eauta case ta it’s ekdummai severe. That girl immediately told her friends and filed lawsuit walla. Sandeep ko ta proper honeytrap thyo, Ronaldo had an actual case against him. But bail payo, where he still continued with his career. Unlike Sandeep, Ronaldo continued with his career. Pachi final verdict afnai favor ma payo.   So did he bring shame to Portugal? To Real Madrid? (at the time of the case) Ani Sandeep le chai kasari?   You put yourself in his shoes. You go out on a date with someone. Everything seems perfect, you guys kiss hug and spend an amazing time together. Belka you guys stay out ani make out. Bholi you drop her home. Then you go out for your work, ani bahira huda nai after a few weeks you find out that girl has filed a complaint for rape against you. What would you do?   I’m more than happy that our recent constitution and policies are in full support of women. Patriarchal society where girls were always oppressed, we finally have laws that protect and safeguard women. Tara yei law lai misuse Garne haru ni Chan.

The situation remains uncertain. Several media outlets have only reported that his name is missing from the list of 20 hostages confirmed to be alive, yet some are hastily jumping to conclusions without verified information. Such speculation is irresponsible, especially when the facts are still unclear. These pages are so immaturely jumping to conclusions in a state where things are uncertain.|||Bipin looked fine in that released video dated November 2023. It means that either Bipin died during the strikes or Hamas' foul play. Our foreign policy is also to be blamed. How could they detain Nepalese who had no association with Israel?

Eleven of our sons, including Bipin Joshi, who arrived in Israel just 25 days before Hamas’s October 7, 2023, bloodbath, were brutally murdered. Four days ago, 48 hostages clung to life; now, only 20 survive. Hamas’s “justified” slaughter, draped in twisted dogma, mocks humanity. Two years of torment, dangling hope of Bipin’s survival, only to end in his cold-blooded killing by these bloody cowards. At home, Gen Z’s September “uprising” killed 51, including kids, burning Kathmandu, freeing 12,500 criminals to prop up corrupt elites’ spoiled brats. Our nation’s credibility is trashed, a global joke. Hamas and their ilk, like Jamkash, happily point fingers at Jews and Hindus for every woe, but when it’s time to face their own kind, they scatter like roaches, spineless. Yet we let their hate-preaching ideology fester in our hills, unchecked. No more. Deport their firebrand clerics, cut off their dirty foreign cash. We must back our own against Hamas, demand international recognition to flex Nepal’s strength, resilience, and power. This must never happen again.

We are Hindu majority. Nepalese of all religion are already normalized to not consuming beef, this will start a conflict amongst our own majority. Us not consuming beef has kept Muslims and Christians in low numbers- they are major consumers of beef and send missionaries everywhere to increase their numbers. If there are two similarly sized groups with different people- that will create political conflict and add to our issues. We already see this play out in western countries- they have major political issues around Muslims and recently Indians (who they associate with Hinduism which they've already begun to hate in Canada, and if you a brown Nepali- you are Indian to them) Don't make moves that will drive your own group's numbers low. We have to keep the status quo in regards to issues like this.   Not eating cow has not created any issue that is worth our attention. Focus on tackling actual issues like further eradicating this baun, chettri nonsense which is the bane of Hinduism- we can and are doing it while keeping our culture, traditions and identity.|||just say chamal ko bora ta paako this , visa ni paaulas ni and move on|||So much for a secular nation|||lets eat beef guys",

IRCC is the least of your worries. Its the boarder patrol services you should be concerned about if you try anything illegal - even a small one once to a kind Canadain.

Don't pretend to be gay either - thats fraudulent and also solictitaion of sex and goes against your agreement with going abroad. Be careful fellas.   also - why only is this post geared to boys ?

People romanticize going abroad, but they don’t realize it’s a full reset! Your last name, your family status, your struggles back home, none of it matters. What counts is how disciplined and valuable you are in that new system.  I’d add, learn to manage your emotions too. It’s not just physical or financial survival — it’s mental. You’ll feel lonely, rejected, homesick, but those who turn that into fuel grow faster than anyone else. Also, you don’t have to be the smartest person, but be reliable.

            "body": "I always thought my life was done for. I was a bad son and a bad brother. I let my family down so many times that they eventually kicked me out. Fair enough, I couldn’t offer them anything except shame and duniya ko tana. I’ve heard things like “Yesto xora janmaunu vanda na janmekai thik hunthyo”. Those words used to hurt me a lot, but still I couldn’t change.  I’ve done many wrong things in life which i regrets . Been to jail a few times, have criminal charges, got rusticated from college because of fights, couldn’t complete my bachelor. Friends betrayed me too they were only there when they could use me. As time passed, I got more depressed. Most of the time, only suicidal thoughts used to come to my mind. I had no place to stay, used to sleep where I worked or sometimes on the street.  One day I finally decided I’d had enough. Bought a mouse poison, tried to take my life. But at the very last moment I was too scared to die. I cried for a long time that night. I realized how miserable I had become to even think of doing that.  But that night I also realized something  maybe I’m not done yet. Maybe there’s still a small ray of hope. I still wanted to live, and live a good life. I had only two options: either change myself completely or kill myself. I couldn’t choose the second option.  So I started working hard doing different odd jobs. Quitted smoking and drinking at once it was so hard. I used to get worst panic attacks, but I managed.   Now I’ve been clean for a year. I have my own small room to live in, my own second-hand bike, and I earn through a ride-sharing app. I also started self-studying because I couldn’t finish my bachelor. Been learning programming from YouTube for two months now. It’s tough, but I’m thinking of joining classes soon. Someone told me you don’t need a college degree to become a software developer, and that really motivated me.  I even tried to apply abroad, but because of my police record it wasn’t possible. So now I just want to become someone respectable in my own country. I want to prove my father wrong. They still don’t know where I am, but one day I’ll go to them when they can proudly call me their son.  It feels unreal sometimes that I have my own room, my own food, my own bike , own laptop(second hand😁) all this within just one year. I can’t believe it. A year ago, I wanted to die. Now I just want to live better. Even though I'm alone , It really feels like dream to live like this.   Happy Happy tihar everyone and happy  bhaitika. Aja didi ko kasto yaad aayo!! Pic 7 year ago this day.  My last bhai tika.",

There could be others, who scored 1000, 999 and 998 before you. So, competition is tough, repeating same thing multiple times doesn't mean, good score. Overtime, brain starts to saturate, hallucinate and if not taken care, gives up and become mad. The competition itself is not for light hearted. TLDR: rpeating years, doesn't equal to same amount of preparations every year. Some years are good, some are not.

Because there was no one to guide me, i failed this year's neb board.   so from someone who learned from his own experience, my best advice is that you don't depend only on teachers from your school. there are tons of videos on youtube and tons of notes and  straight up answers in the internet.   if you do not understand and get anything at all, then only focus on the questions that are asked many times or repeated i.e only imp questions.   you have to make sure that you atleast passing marks, so look focus on the chapters you understand and master them first then only focus on others.   You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I’ve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others.

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can’t get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

Go there only if you have years of experience in a particular field. And Canada, UK and  Australia are not like they used to be.  Perhaps, Germany is a good choice, but you have to learn german.  If you are fine with India, you could go there too, but only if you can spend 50-60 lakhs, so that you can get into a good private college.|||Ma tw bhanxu abroad nai try gara|||Abroad try garney vaena vaney yetai ramro course padhney.|||If you want to go for studying and make a career then don't stay in Nepal.

It's not due to lack of knowledge from his side that makes it hard for us to grab the concepts, it's just the fact that he's shit at teaching and doesn't care about whether or not everyone understands. Regardless, I'm studying CS and want a good base in maths for the future. Mero first term aaudai cha, I tried to go through a few YouTube channels, some of them are alright but I already struggle with maths & physics so it's pretty difficult to understand *everything* I'd appreciate it if anyone could suggest any channels (or alternative platforms) which are good.

            "comments": "my suggestion would be that stop expecting everything from teachers in 11 and 12 and figure out what way of study suits you the best because if you are reliant on your teachers for every study resources then you'll get in trouble in bachelors or forward because here teachers  dont even give a shit if there sound is audible let alone good lectures i left relying on teachers in my 11 12 days because all of our clz teachers were shit and had to self study every chapter. if you are in 11 theres a high chance that you are yet to figure out your true study method. for me reading book line by line worked the best and i reckon this is the most optimal way to study as it not only helps you cover everything on your sylbs but also prepares you for high intensity study environment which is very essential for higher level studies..and if you're not understanding mechanics then there's a high chance that you're not willing to learn mechanics because it is the portion of  physics where you can follow everything intuitively and is most interesting one so try to learn it conceptually relating it to real life stuffs. as for yt channel ig physics wallah will be good but there will be a lot of things which are not in our course.. however you can try and learn yourself by reading books and if you dont understand any sentence then you can use chat gpt to crack it down ..and a free tip., understand derivations very effectively like every line and term, why and how they are there because if you do so you'll be able to solve every numerical, and also solve as much mcqs and numericals as you can|||Royera|||do past papers|||Hello u/Swiss_16, thank you for contributing to r/NepalPlusTwo.
