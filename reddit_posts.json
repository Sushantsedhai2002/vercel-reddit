The kind of cold that makes your lungs hurt.  We started climbing toward Thorong La Pass in complete darkness. Just a line of headlamps snaking up the mountain like fireflies. My guide kept saying \"bistari, bistari\" (slowly, slowly). Every step felt impossible.  Around 7 AM, we crested the pass. 5,416 meters. The sun hit the Annapurna range and everything turned gold. Dhaulagiri to my left, massive and white. The Tibetan plateau stretching endlessly north. Prayer flags snapping in the wind.  I just... broke. Happy tears, exhausted tears, \"I can't believe I'm here\" tears.  Some old trekker handed me his thermos of tea without saying a word. We stood there together watching mountains that have existed for millions of years, and I felt incredibly small and incredibly alive at the same time.  13 days total. Started in lush green rice paddies. Ended in desert. Crossed five climate zones. Ate dal bhat until I dreamed about it. My knees still hate me.  But standing at that pass? Getting to witness that sunrise? Worth every blister, every early morning, every moment I thought \"why am I doing this?\"  The Himalayas changed something in me. Can't really explain it.

For years, she has been involved in building science communities, working with students, and promoting scientific thinking in Nepal.  In Election 2082, she is contesting from Kaski 1 under the Ujyalo Nepal Party. Her entry into politics stands out because she comes from a science and education background rather than the usual political path.

Even the Bhaktapur Durbar Square, they were able to rebuild the fastest after the earthquake from their own funds. There are also many other good initiates in Bhaktapur. Bijukchhe also gave up his MP seat to someone else in the party so that's good too. They have a lot of youth representatives running for election too, I think it's just behind RSP and certainly a lot ahead of Nepali Congress, UML, etc.  As for downsides, they do restrict some things in Bhaktapur, such as INGOs do not have the same access they do in other places. Now INGOs have both upside and downside, but Bhaktapur is missing out on the upsides to some extent. They've also completely failed to expand their party. With the work they've done in their area, they could have promoted them and tried for more seats in other areas but they don't seem to put any efforts towards that, leaving them with extremely limited seats.   We know their MPs have mostly speak out in the parliament with a good voice. Although I think the impact is limited.|||They are limited to a specific area, mainly competing in Changunarayan and Bhaktapur municipalities. Their influence is stronger in Bhaktapur and comparatively weaker in Changunarayan. They are often labeled as a “Bhaktapur Newar community party,” and their ideology is communist-based Juche, which originates from North Korea and focuses on self-reliance. In practice, this model tends to work only in a small geographic area and within a relatively closed society.  They also appear to have strong internal control over organizations and institutions located in the core Bhaktapur area. While this may not apply to everyone, many of their party workers prefer that people working in the area be from Bhaktapur, ideally from the Newar community.  Unless they become more open to people from different backgrounds and expand beyond a narrow geographic base, they may remain limited to the small Durbar Square area and its surroundings, or gradually lose relevance in the coming years. Their main strength  and also their weakness  is that they come from the same community and share the same culture, which reduces internal conflict and unnecessary debates, allowing smoother development work. However, this same homogeneity can limit broader growth and inclusiveness.|||Visited North Korea|||[Here's his interview with gorkhapatra](https://web.archive.org/web/20101010090943/http://gorkhapatra.org.np/gopa.detail.php?article_id=29063&cat_id=29)|||Ramro kam hatma ganna matra garna sakeko vayani naramro chai aaile samma gareko chaina...

            "body": "Yesterday night I was going to  home from Office (TIA) in my scooter alone after completing my night shift duty . I was crossing Bagmati Bridge in Sinamangal (between KMC hospital and Old Baneshwor), I saw a skinny women dressed in white sari, I checked the time on scooter and it was exactly 12:58, she was in exact middle of bridge and holding a kalash(कलश) like thing in one hand, and as I went near she waved other hand as if she was asking for a lift, there is no light in the bridge and i noticed her only because of her white dress. I saw her but didn't stopped the scooter and went on full speed. At that moment, my mind didn't went towards ghost part, I thought it was a some kind of trick to stop my scooter and others guy would apper to loot me. I was so sacred that I didn't stopped at Old Baneshwor traffic light too. I reached home and shared the incident with my family and they insisted that I saw a Chudel. I'm the guy who don't believe in such stuff, but this incident made me think about it. I had 4 thoughts in mind:  1. As my initial thought, it was a trick to loot me in the middle of bridge (but KMC hospital is in nearby and there is constant police patrol, so nobody would dare) 2. She was a actual women and needed help to go somewhere at that midnight (but why would she be in exact middle of bridge at complete darkness?) 3. Someone was shooting a prank video for youtube or Tiktok (might be possible) 4. Or as everyone guessed, I witnessed a paranormal activity.",

            "body": "The Sirsiya river, once central to daily life, agriculture and religious rituals in southern Nepal, is now heavily polluted with industrial waste and sewage, turning it into a public health hazard. Factories in Nepal’s industrial corridor discharge untreated effluents as weak enforcement, ineffective regulation and unimplemented wastewater plans allow pollution to persist. Pollution flows into Raxaul, India, contaminating water and harming crops, while residents on other side of the border say Indian efforts to treat local sewage can’t offset the influx from Nepal. When 38-year-old Pradeep Kumar Bishwokarma was growing up in Ramgadhawa, a neighbourhood in southern Nepal’s industrial town of Birgunj, he would jump into the Sirsiya River to beat the summer heat as his mother washed clothes and residents drew drinking water from it.  Today, Bishwokarma and his fellow residents of the border town cover their noses with a handkerchief whenever they pass by the river that was once their village’s lifeline. The flowing liquid no longer resembles a river. It is thick and black as if a truckload of oil had been dumped into it. The air around the river feels heavy with the stench of sulphur and rotting organic matter.  “This is no longer a river,” Bishwokarma said, pointing toward it. “It has become an open drain for factories, and we haven’t just lost a river, we’ve lost our self-respect,” he added.  The river, which was once a crucial part of daily life, religion and agriculture in Bara and Parsa districts, is one of the 6,000-odd rivers and rivulets flowing into India from Nepal. It begins its journey from the Ramban Jhadi (forest) of Bara district farther north and passes through Nepal’s largest industrial zone, the Bara-Parsa corridor.  Today, ineffective environmental regulation and poor coordination among government agencies have allowed factories to dump untreated industrial waste and sewage into the river. Even after decades of protests, multiple court cases and government committees and unimplemented wastewater treatment plans, the river remains a public health hazard, damaging local culture and ecosystems not just in Nepal, but also across the border in Raxaul in India’s Bihar.",

            "comments": "Just become expert in One language/framework no one will replace you.... Good engineer can use AI in proper way, Vibe coders don't know how to things works or how to scale things... it's just a hype|||From what I have seen from a hiring perspective, you definitely won't get past the initial round if all you know is vibe coding. Writing code is just one of many things that engineers do. There is a lot of designing, planning, presenting possible options to higher management, beaurocracy, compliance and risk assessment involved in the process. And then comes the hard part -- debugging errors and bugs, and good luck with that if you're just sitting in the chair writing prompts. AI is good at finding solution with the historical training data, but sometimes you come across problems and situations that nobody else has gone through, or no resource / solution is available in the internet. Pilots use autopilot for the most of the time during the flight, but the whole purpose of having skilled pilots in the cockpit is for them to be able to detect anamolies if any, and be able to take over if need be. Relying on vibe coding without knowing the internals is like someone flying a plane relying on the autopilot without knowing much of how to fly a plane.     However, if your plan is not to be an engineer but to boostrap something and sell it, then that's a little different.|||brother, focus on the basics. don't believe the hype - vibe coding in production apps is disastrous. you NEED to understand every line of code that AI generates, find flaws, test and refactor and you can't do that unless you know how to write good code.|||There is nothing like Vibe coding. It's just a mind virus🙃. It will destroy the potential good engineer inside you if you start vibing.|||Vibe coding is good if you want to start your own startup and earn in the future. killer to start any thing.   But it’s bad if you’re applying for a job. companies will easily poooo over your CV, degree, or vibe-coding projects in your portfolio.  Just check r/HTML and r/CSS—why are they still so active? Outside of real work, people keep asking tiny, tiny questions that can be done in minutes using any modern grid builder or page builder. Yet they insist on learning everything from scratch.  I’m mentioning HTML/CSS because I’m a CSS developer.|||CFBR|||if what you are saying is true then what value will this information technology degree even have. (i am coping)|||From experience - Honestly, if you can write code properly without relying too much on “vibe coding,” do it. Once you start depending on it heavily, you might slowly forget real syntax and how to structure code yourself. I’m not saying you should never use vibe coding, just try to keep it minimal and use it in moderation.|||Do vibe but first you must know basics, syntax and flow of your tech stack|||You have to ultimately become a good debugger than a coder. My suggestion for you is to explore systems / frameworks / patterns while you vibe code but learn DSA to the core, after all it is what gets you a job. a project to show and some programming skills to hide you vibe coded.       My say about the career as a whole, it is very uncertain that software engineering will last after 5 years. Companies are already looking for senior only roles, next it would be architect only roles, who knows.",

My plan is to create lots of ad-free learning games for kids. Most of the HTML5/JS/CSS code will be generated using AI (vibe coding). The main work will be optimizing the code, managing it properly, and adding things AI usually can’t, such as videos, images, and small code tweaks when needed.  # Why?  It all started when my 5 year old daughter got hooked on games 'nI noticed games aren’t fun anymore!  few game really really good rest 99.99% of them installed at mobile garbage  designed just to push ads after each level and trick kids into clicking.  That really, really pissed me off.  So I thought—this is the age of AI. Why not use it to build and flood game with clean, ad-free learning games for tiny brain  no ads. just simple, fun, educational games.  If you have any questions, please feel free to ask!!!!

Make it small and compact possibly to something that can fit in a keychain.  - I assume you’re 3D printing the depths and highlights of the image to achieve this, I might be wrong, but I suggest you change the material to something that feels more premium. -make the button hidden. What I mean is keep it internal and flush the button don’t stick it outside as it compromises with the aesthetics.  - at current state I think the product is still in a prototype state, your idea is good just needs polishing try reducing the price as it’s super overpriced try to reduce the profit margin and find ways to price it under 250-400 rupees range  Good luck it’s a nice start.",

Does this mean the phone is grey-market or unofficially imported?  As a buyer, could I face any problems later — like IMEI blocking, customs issues, or lack of warranty? Also, are these phones usually brand new and sealed, or could they be refurbished?  If anyone has experience buying phones this way, or works in mobile retail/imports, I’d really appreciate some explanation. I don’t want to save money now and regret it later.",

            "comments": "didnt went through tyour projects but want to make quick comment on your portfolio page UI. it gave me vibecoded vibe due to color gradient and all the icons. Which might be turn off given the recent overloaded supply of vibecoded pages. Here’s the prompt to convert your vibecoded UI vibes  to more unique and appealing format.  Prompt: “You are operating in **Anti-Gradient UI & Anti-Vibecoder Mode**.  Your role is to help developers and product engineers design user interfaces that prioritize clarity, hierarchy, usability, and system integrity not aesthetic trends, vibes, or visual dopamine.  Core principles you MUST follow:  1. Reject cliché UI patterns:    - No unnecessary gradients    - No glassmorphism unless functionally justified    - No neon accents, glow effects, or “Twitter-core” design    - No design decisions made purely for screenshots or hype  2. Favor boring, defensible design:    - Neutral color palettes    - Clear typographic hierarchy    - Obvious affordances    - Predictable layouts    - Minimal motion, only when it adds meaning  3. Think like an engineer, not a dribbble post:    - Every UI decision must have a reason    - Explain tradeoffs (performance, accessibility, maintenance)    - Prefer constraints over creative freedom    - Optimize for teams, not solo designers  4. When reviewing or generating UI:    - Identify where “vibe coding” is happening    - Call out unnecessary visual complexity    - Suggest simpler, more durable alternatives    - Optimize for readability, scannability, and speed  5. Communication style:    - Calm, precise, slightly opinionated    - No hype language    - No “delightful”, “sexy”, or “aesthetic” justification    - Speak like a senior engineer reviewing a PR  When given: - A UI description → critique it and simplify it - A design request → propose a restrained, system-first solution - A frontend question → prioritize maintainability and UX clarity  Your goal is not to impress. Your goal is to make interfaces that survive time, teams, and scale.”  thats what I did to my www.promptoverflow.app page and it turned out pretty good.|||At least change the favicon man.

The first day, because I had the habit of working by myself, I got too immersed into work and did not notice that the time to close the office had passed by half an hour already.   Something in my phone buzzed and I snapped out of it. I checked my watch, already 5:30. I was surprised to see my employees still there. Why were they still there, their working hours were over by half an hour. I asked if they wanted to work overtime... But nope... Turns out, they could not leave exactly at time because they were afraid of me firing them.  I wonder what kind of work culture it is that people are afraid of just leaving after their working hour is complete. And we are talking about literate people with skills to work in an office. I couldn't imagine how exploited unskilled workers are.|||Nepal ma IT, Civil, accounting consultancy companies haru sabai le same garxan.

Balen has a cultish following. But that following is because he is not those other guys, not because of his own. Do you not see the frustuation? And dictatorship promises fast exection. Not a \"**just\"** execution, but fast none the less. You have to be extremely priviledged to not see the appeal. On top of that Nepal Army has a very good image. Much better than any party.  I am not saying this is a correct view, or that I hold it, just explaining why this is a popular viewpoint.|||Many Nepali people feel frustrated with how slow change can be under democracy. Some argue that only a strong, centralized authority could push through major reforms quickly. While that kind of system can act decisively, it also comes with serious risks if power is misused.  Democracy, on the other hand, is deliberately slower and more procedural. Those checks and balances can feel like obstacles to rapid change, but they exist to protect people from the concentration of power. In the end, it often comes down to whether one values gradual, participatory change or prefers the speed and decisiveness of a more authoritarian approach.",

For each knowledge he shares I ask him where did you know about it he says oh mama and I went to this trip he explained, oh uncle did when we had barbeque etc...basically in social gatherings where I'm present as well.  What bothered me wasn’t that he knows more  it’s that I was never taught or included in those conversations. And when I look around, even in my girl friend groups, we almost never talk about those things. It’s like there’s an unspoken silence around it. I’m educated, from an engineering background, not sheltered yet I feel oddly behind in literacy compared to male peers who seem to pick it up informally through family and social circles.

In terms of personal finance, I was only taught to save and nothing more. So, I had to learn about the stock market, budgeting and planning for my financial future on my own.

            "body": "I am being honest and critical here. For those who genuinely want Nepal to become a better place and be recognized as a developed nation, we must acknowledge that we are critically failing. Lets start with history here, If we look at the result of Chitwan Constituency No. 1 in the 2079 election, our level of awareness becomes painfully clear. On one side stood Bishwanath Paudel — a PhD graduate from the University of California, Berkeley, with experience in national and international policymaking, university teaching, advisory roles in institutions like the ILO, and currently serving as the Governor of Nepal Rastra Bank. On the other side stood Hari Dhakal, who represented rebellion and “newness,” despite not meeting the commonly accepted standards of excellence by which Paudel would normally be judged.  If competence, experience, knowledge, and contribution had truly been the criteria, the result should have been one-sided. But it was not. Dhakal won by a large margin, and Paudel finished third. This happened because people did not vote for a candidate; they voted out of anger toward old politics. Paudel did not lose because he lacked ability, but because he was seen as a symbol of the old party and of Sher Bahadur Deuba.  This reveals a deeper problem: our consciousness is only half-awakened. We are frustrated with the old parties and the system, yet we still fail to apply proper standards when choosing alternatives. We vote in anger, not with reason. We react, but we do not evaluate. Competence is not defined by a degree alone; it is built from education, knowledge, experience, contribution to policymaking, character, and integrity.  When a person with such qualifications loses solely because of party identity, it is not that person who loses — it is the country. Preventing capable individuals from losing elections is not an emotional demand; it is a demand of the time. A nation is built or destroyed not inside the ballot box, but inside the voter’s awareness. That awareness is not measured by speeches or slogans, but by the choices made during elections.  From now on, people must decide with judgment, not with the momentum of the crowd. They must judge with the mind, not with the anger of the heart. The day voters begin choosing candidates based on knowledge, ability, experience, character, and intention, opportunists will leave politics in shame, capable individuals will step forward naturally, and democracy will finally belong to the people.   Let us remember this: when good people begin to win, the nation never loses.",

Not just the party, not just the slogan, but the person. What have they done in the past? What do they stand for? How do they plan to speak for us in parliament?

I’m not saying every MP needs to be a Harvard graduate or some top expert. That’s not the point. Even someone who regularly talks with their voters, listens to their problems, raises local issues in parliament, and stays reachable would already be doing better than most.  Instead, many MPs start acting like they’re above the people once they get the title “माननीय.” They forget who gave them that title in the first place.

For \"Upper class,\" lower classes are the others. For Jews, Arabs are the others. For Shia, Sunnis are the others. For Nepalis, Indians are the others. So on and so forth...  Caste systems let the upper castes feel special about themselves without having to do one damn thing to earn it. You're special, just because of how you were born. Similar to how religious people feel great about praying for those in need - it does nothing to help the needy, takes zero effort, accomplishes nothing, and it yet makes the person who prays feel like they did something special.  To answer your question, I'd say maybe because a lot of us are simply not good people. Most of us are not good people to those we have been indoctrinated to think as \"others.\" Heck! Some of us are awful even to our children, parents, spouses, and friends.   The person who did this has no empathy, doesn't understand that there is nothing special about being born as an upper cast, but has been indoctrinated probably right from birth to look down on others and to feel superior to others.  I feel empathy with the person that they did this to.   Then they turn around and wonder why people are fleeing this great religion of theirs.|||Christian dharma ma parivartan gara daju!!

There is very little willingness to work together, build teams, or engage seriously in social issues. Information isn’t shared. Ideas aren’t welcomed. People aren’t interested in listening.  Instead, I was labeled an “outsider” simply because I lived abroad for nine years.  No one asks for volunteers. No one wants to organize. Everyone seems comfortable inside their own small circles, hiding behind social masks.  And then there are the so-called political parties and leaders.  I honestly haven’t met a single leader who feels capable of truly leading this country. There are no clear agendas. No strong principles. No real ideology. No respect for the voice of the people.  It’s all driven by ego and personal interest.  What is their party? What do they actually stand for? What is their vision for Nepal?  No clue. No respect. No real plan.  Just a constant political circus.  I once believed Balen represented change. But after seeing certain things up close, I now feel he is surrounded by people who are not very different from the rest.

Dhaulagiri to my left, massive and white. The Tibetan plateau stretching endlessly north. Prayer flags snapping in the wind.  I just... broke. Happy tears, exhausted tears, \"I can't believe I'm here\" tears.  Some old trekker handed me his thermos of tea without saying a word. We stood there together watching mountains that have existed for millions of years, and I felt incredibly small and incredibly alive at the same time.  13 days total. Started in lush green rice paddies. Ended in desert. Crossed five climate zones. Ate dal bhat until I dreamed about it. My knees still hate me.  But standing at that pass?

Here are my questions:     **1.  What has he done till date??**  Gagan Thapa has been a member of Parliament continuously since 2065 BS, first as PR MP and then he has won 3 times. He became Health minister once. So, what exactly did he do as MP?? How many amendments did he offer in Parliament?? Did be bring any private bill himself to pass in Parliament?? Yes he gave good speeches but where is action? He introduced health insurance system many say but it has almost collapsed right now. I am sure the excuse is gonna be well he was minority in the party and couldn’t do anything but, how can we be sure he will do anything big now that he is party chair??     **2. Part of the same highly politicised corrupt system:** Anyone who even has basic understanding of Nepali politics knows a huge part of lack of development in Nepal is that system has become super politicized with party unions in schools and hospitals, in civil service. You cannot get a good political appointment without having a party affiliation. Gagan Thapa himself came from Nepal students union. We need to try to break this system and how can I trust Gagan and his NC party even trying to change this?? Gagan Thapa alone can’t do everything and would his party members allow him to dismantle a system they have enjoyed for decades?? Like Gagan has said he wants to appoint people based on merit, but Can he do that when he has so many party members who will pressure him to give them appointment??  FYI.. RSP has no student or trade unions so far.     **3. Corruption investigations:** We know a lot of NC leaders have serious allegations of corruption. Even Gagan Thapa was forced to give ticket to Bijay Gacchadar who has been accused of corruption. So, Can we trust that he is gonna initiate corruption or other criminal investigations on various party members that may weaken his hold on the party??     These three reasons are enough for me not to vote for Gagan Thapa and his NC party this time around.",

Private Bills almost never pass in the parliament. You can bring bills but it will never pass unless ruling coalition and few other parties all collectively agree that it can be passed but with significant changes and compromise. Also there is party whip, you can disagree but never go against the party during parliamentary vote. You will get disciplined, ousted from the party and never get another chance.   That is fair criticism but did health insurance collapse under his leadership? I think consecutive government lack of funding and management also played a huge role. Personally I have benefited from the program. Also he did create legal, regulatory and financial structure for the program. It was a fragmented idea, but it did become concrete under his leadership and millions benefited from. Even if it collapsed but the framework is still there, it can be started again with some structural change and dont think the blame lies on Gagan on this one. There have been multiple other health ministers and multiple government after him whom each played a part in mismanagement.   Student politics is not necessarily bad. Also the history of student unions in Nepal is a bit different. Panchayat ma party nahuda, and lack of social media back then, the only way to organize politically was in universities and campuses. Also praya jasto sabai janta were illiterate back then, so politics was obviously only happening within educated circles, professors and students. The way gen z protest were organized in social media because people have access, navako vaye the only way would be to be form groups in school and colleges right? Natra kasari organize gartheu. Also before student politics sabai neta ko udpadan Indian university ma hunthyo, this did bring leadership opportunity inside Nepal. Also democratic society ma timile union ra group banaunai paudaina vannai mildaina. If me and few other RSP supporters want to make a club in my college for the upcoming election who can stop us? Also trade union ra bidhyathi sangathan navayera ta ho RSP le different ideology vako manche tara facebook follower ra celebrity status ko manche lai ticket badheko.

So I do understand that new leadership did not have much time to finalize the tickets and he has admitted so too that there have been mistakes but the good thing is they passed a new set of laws regarding tickets during the mahaadhivesan. Starting next election the person will go through like a primary where NC members from a election region will elect who gets the ticket, savapati le sign gardai badhne din chai hatakai ho but logistically yo pali navyako vanya I think thats fair.

Now INGOs have both upside and downside, but Bhaktapur is missing out on the upsides to some extent. They've also completely failed to expand their party.

Their influence is stronger in Bhaktapur and comparatively weaker in Changunarayan. They are often labeled as a “Bhaktapur Newar community party,” and their ideology is communist-based Juche, which originates from North Korea and focuses on self-reliance. In practice, this model tends to work only in a small geographic area and within a relatively closed society.  They also appear to have strong internal control over organizations and institutions located in the core Bhaktapur area. While this may not apply to everyone, many of their party workers prefer that people working in the area be from Bhaktapur, ideally from the Newar community.  Unless they become more open to people from different backgrounds and expand beyond a narrow geographic base, they may remain limited to the small Durbar Square area and its surroundings, or gradually lose relevance in the coming years. Their main strength  and also their weakness  is that they come from the same community and share the same culture, which reduces internal conflict and unnecessary debates, allowing smoother development work. However, this same homogeneity can limit broader growth and inclusiveness.|||Visited North Korea|||[Here's his interview with gorkhapatra](https://web.archive.org/web/20101010090943/http://gorkhapatra.org.np/gopa.detail.php?article_id=29063&cat_id=29)|||Ramro kam hatma ganna matra garna sakeko vayani naramro chai aaile samma gareko chaina...

            "body": "I want to start by saying this clearly: I am not anti-Balen.  I respect many things he has done and I understand why people see him as a symbol of change.  But BECAUSE he represents something new, I think it’s important that we hold him to a higher standard NOW, not later.  It is the only way democracy survives.  Recently a journalist proposed interviewing multiple leaders together in a public debate format. Balen rejected the idea, saying he would not share a stage with someone he considers a murderer. In his comment under KP Oli’s post, he wrote a long rant framing public debate itself as morally unacceptable.  This raises a few serious questions.  **First: Does debating someone mean you endorse them?**  If a scientist debates an anti-vax person, does that make the scientist anti-vax? If a human rights activist debates a war criminal, does that mean they support war crimes? Of course not. Debate is not endorsement.  Debate is how the public tests ideas, intentions, and competence. By refusing to debate, Balen is not morally isolating bad leaders. He is isolating himself from public scrutiny.  **Second: If Balen avoids debates, how do we know his agenda?**  So far, we mostly know what he is against.  We don’t clearly know:  * What kind of Prime Minister he wants to be * What his economic priorities are * How he plans to handle federalism, foreign policy, corruption, or social issues  **Third: Inflating numbers weakens moral arguments.**  In his comment, Balen says 76 children were killed.  But according to most credible sources, the number is closer to around 40. Forty murdered children is already horrific. Why inflate it?  When a leader who is “janne-bujhne, padheko” exaggerates facts, even for a moral cause, it damages credibility. Truth matters, especially when you claim moral superiority.  If we do not question our “good leaders” now, we are quietly preparing the ground for the next KP Oli or the next Prachanda. Unaccountable leaders don’t appear suddenly.  They are created by supporters who stop asking hard questions.  How should citizens evaluate him without hearing him defend his ideas? If he doesn’t explain these in a public, confrontational setting, then what mandate are people actually supporting? Are we voting for a plan Or just for a personality?  Are we supporting a vision or just an image?",

            "comments": "I feel like with Balen, the core issue is this: he’s a populist leader, and we’re living inside ahis populist wave. He knows it. He plays it well. And honestly, that’s not new in Nepali politics. Oli was a populist once. Prachanda too both rode massive emotional waves before settling into the same old politics.  So when Balen refuses to debate, he frames it as a moral position. In his mind, sharing a stage with someone he sees as corrupt or violent makes him look like he’s lowering himself. That works for his brand. It fits the image he’s built.  But underneath that, I think the context matters. Nepal is extremely divided after the recent protests. UML people have not recognised the martyrs , and anti-corruption protestors got labelled as foreign agents or anarchists .  So when Balen avoids debates, I don’t think it’s only moral disgust. I think he knows he’s riding a media-driven populist wave. He knows the youth are with him. He knows social media amplifies him more than anyone else. And he knows that an open debate where his statements can be pulled out of context, clipped, twisted could puncture his momentum.  He’s smart. He understands optics better than any politician in the country right now.  Meanwhile KP Oli is not operating on the same wavelength. Different generation, different communication style, different political instincts. Balen knows he benefits from contrast, not confrontation.  What I don’t fully get is the extreme skepticism toward Balen as if he’s already the next dictator-in-waiting. What do people want? Should we dive straight into chaos and pretend we don’t need any leader at all? Should we pretend there’s a magical alternative hiding somewhere?  If we distrust every single new face, then who exactly are we left with? UML? NC? Maoists? Or the monarchists’ fantasy of a saviour king? Because that’s basically the menu.  Nepal is a very young and very unstable country. I genuinely think we need a new symbol for a little while someone who can surf the populist wave without sinking the country. Four years, not a lifetime. Someone who isn’t carrying the entire weight of the old system.  I think Balen is avoiding debates because he’s protecting his narrative. And in this phase of Nepali politics, narrative is everything.|||Bhedas follow loud mouths coz they are too lazy to use their brain or just straight-up dumb to understand intellectual arguments. Just see indian netas giving speech. It's just a manipulation game. Doesn't matter whatever bullshit you spew. If you are confident and loud enough, dumb people will follow. And if Balen tries the same tactic as being loud mouth, and spewing insubstantial bullshit, he is gonna lose his current supporters.|||If anyhow the debate even initiates , balen would be the first victim of that debate coz oli and gagan would certainly make him nanga . Coz their whole life has been revolved around debates ,manipulating and false promises ones.  they would certainly raise some issues where balen would be speechless and the others will consider this as their win and  helping in  their election campaign.  For me ,Rabi would be far better than balen to face other possible pm candidates .|||At some point around 2020 US election, I used to follow the candidates, debates etc. I came across a video of Al-Gore conceding defeat, because apparantly there was some court issues etc. That rabbit hole lead me to a video, where they were analyzing how debate performance enhanded/diminished the changes of a presidential candidate. They found out that every very unrelated topics to policies and fitness of office affected candidates' chances. Like if they coughed at some point, started to fidget with something or things like that. Its because debates like this have too much spotlight in one (or few) events. And your margin of error is extremely low, and that is risky. And Balen at least seems to have understood this.  It is possible that Balen thinks he can't win in policy discussions. He has massively overpromised in the mayor election and underdelivered (common across world political scene I think). Although as Rabi dai said, \"Daaktar saap, bajet lekhna thalnus\", they certainly have capable person to make economic policy, Balen might fear accurately representing daktaar saap's work.  Another possibility I think is his public speaking ability. I was underwhelmed by his Janakpur presentation. Understandable that he came to such large crowd to speak for the first time in his life as a politician, he had massive pressure. In that 2020 or 16 may be not sure, US election I followed, there were people thinking somebody called Marko Rubio as a potential candidate and people say Trump just absolutely devoured him because Rubio was nervous.  Another one, that most people here in reddit are assuming, is that, a known charlatan in Oli will overpower him in terms of speaking. Oli might use this to whitewash his name and get more validation for himself.  It could be one or combination of these to avoid debate. The logic he posted in Oli's comment certainly seems weak in my eye. He should rather have not commented at all in his classic silence fashion.  Its not correct to assume that we wouldn't know his agenda if he doesn't come to debate. We have ghoshanapatra system in nepal. Me personally, I'd like my PM to at least face media. Be confident enough to speak confidently to the public. Its absolutely frustrating that we haven't had Balen answer any question from the public media ever.|||A public debate among all parties PM candidate should happen. Hamro questions haru answer garne. Afno plan and policies clearly vanne, yo sab debate bata tha hunchha.|||I agree with your first point.      \\> **Second: If Balen avoids debates, how do we know his agenda?**  Debates are not the primary source of a party's agenda. There are other ways of knowing his (RSP's) agenda. Balen is RSP now. And you can find lots of things on their website.   Also, RSP leader Swarnim Wagle said that they're purposefully delaying their election manifesto because they don't want it to be copied, which kinda makes sense.  You can check RSP's website and see if it answers questions. If it doesn't, I think they'll add more stuff in the election manifesto.  \\> **Third: Inflating numbers weakens moral arguments.**  I don't think the age of the number that were murdered is the issue here. So I'm gonna pass on that one.|||Kinaki public maa appealing huna unrealistic jhuta kura bolnuparchha hagane ra hatyara le jastai teivara.|||manxe le overestimate garexi mukh kholnu stupidity ho ni bro|||I also personally don’t think that he is a good orator. He becomes confrontational if someone criticizes and he gets into NepHop mode and tries to diss them.   He has to grow up for National politics and improve upon his speech giving.   Even Rahul Gandhi had to train for it. Why not Balen! Every one is weakness and we need to improve upon it.   Go Balen!|||Also never idolize a politician. They will betray you at some time or the other and that’s their collapse  Oli/ Deuba/ Prachanada/ Babu Ram other oldies have been through it all.|||Because he is a typical populist leader with no coherent ideals to ideology. His only selling point is that he is young and not the establishment of corrupt geriatric party leaders. He has a cult of following from youngsters that have lost hope in establishment. He represents break away from old system. But he himself isn't coherent enough to have a proper plans or policies to steer the nation at the moment.|||Better to not go for it if he does public debate he’ll lose vote and also journalists will not care to protect him so it’ll be messed up better no public debate that is the better wisdom|||Because facebook != real life.   Let's say someone asks \"KP oli is corrupt, we agree that but what makes you better than him except saying KP oli is corrupt.\"   He will say: I did a lot for KMC.   People: Can you tell me a public place in Kathmandu where I can sstand at a point and within 10m radius of it, it looks developed. I am not saying 2 points, just 1 place and 10m radius from the point.   He will say: KP oli is corrupt, thats why there is nothing.|||He can still debate with Gagan and Sampang. There needs to be a well experienced facilitator and few prompts could be provided prior to debates for preparation. If you are going to be a public leader, you need to come out and speak in public. If you are uncomfortable with debates, maybe politics is not a right sector for you. Balen has well educated team who can support with preparation. Yes, you need to study and make notes. With too many things going on, it might be overwhelming but that's the job you have chosen and people have expectations.|||He wants UML voters on his side. He is on the \"dont hate anyone\" train. If he were to have a debate with oli. Its impossible to not make a bad comment about that mongrel.  He is not gonna be dropping ukhan tukka to roast. Thats all oli wants.

Some kind of double standard.

Balen is projecting oli as a murderer.  Second: completely agree with you. He needs to explain where he stands and what are his plans. At the moment, he seems autocratic.   Third: 76 total people died which includes killings and arson fire. All of it could have been prevented.|||Where was your reddit post when Mr. Oli avoided giving statement to the inquiry commission massacring childrens under his leadership?|||What do you want him to say?  \"I will make Nepal like Singapore and Switzerland.\" |||Balen k maanxey ho k maanxey ho.  geet ma desh lai 7 tukra ma baadi sake vanxa ahile feri sanghiyeta rey   naya purana sabai chor ho vanxa, fuck RSP fuck India fuck China... k k vanxa, feri tei RSP ma gayo, ani Baburam Bhattrai jasto lai aafno guru maanxa rey   Routiney sanga tesko thulo link up xa, tei Routiney ley Baburam lai ramro leader vanxa ra Routiney Balen ko mayalu ho   Hatyara sanga basey ma nih hatyara dekhinxu vanxa feri Baburam ta 17000 mareko ho, feri guru maanxa teslai   Dharma ka kura ma pani debate xa tara tesma ahile najaau, Balen ko harek kura vane jasto xaina, harek kura contradict gari raaxa     Geopolitics ko department hernu parxa if uh PM banne ho vane, ani tetro department paaune maanxey na ta debate garxa, internationally kati dherai pressure aauxa tyo sab handle garnu paryo feri  Tei ho Balen maybe mayor nai thik xa PM ta khai, ma ta convince nai vaaxaina tesbaata  Balen PM banyo vane Nepal internally ramro hunxa hola sayed hai, ramro roads, infra, education, job opportunities but geopolitically ta khai  Debate ma pahile nih baseko ho BALEN, not like a debate but Tough Talk with Dil Bhusan Pathak vanne show ma Keshab Sthapit, Bibeksheel Sajha Party ko lady pani thyo, teti khera nih rakhekai ho kura haru aafno.

As from the CV ig you are more into the agentic/applied AI stuffs that's currently booming, so focus on it rather than DS/ML if you want to enter the industry soon.

It looks a bit like academic practice. Swap 2 of them for something else (like Finance or E-commerce) to show you can handle different types of data. Flex that MLOps project: Move the ICU Deterioration one to the top! It’s your best flex because it mentions monitoring and drift (Prometheus/Grafana). That’s exactly what remote MLOps recruiters are looking for. Make Demos \"One-Click\": Make sure those [Demo] links go to a live site (Streamlit/Hugging Face). For remote jobs, if they can't see it working in 5 seconds, they might skip it.

As human we remember what we did yesterday, past month we can think and recall but AI is not aware of any think, unless we told explicitly tell is what to do. So, Ai is just a tool(powerful what, if you know when and how to use it).  So, don't think about the outcome just learn, focus on the foundation, learn the basic, try to do hard think your self, use ai to learn new concept not to code in the beginning, give yourself a chance to make mistakes and correct later.

Honestly, I'm sure your platform doesn't do it better in that regard. Who's going to use it? For what?  If you care about usability, just release the datasets (with doi or something). I'd just want the data APIs/ structured data. If I'm using it for training, I couldn't care less about the interface. Or better yet, preprocess, shuffle, and give the train-test-validation splits. Maybe a couple benchmarks with your analyst background.  Your project is scattered- you claim it does election intelligence, disaster and env monitoring, news aggregation.

I don't know what works anymore. On the flip side it seems like more and more work is getting outsourced as the skill of people outside of the western countries have started to level up and with AI it seems like people everywhere are going to level up massively or equally.  What I see is crucial for the future is AI literacy, being able to leverage coding agents and be productive with it. But from my experience you need experience building applications to have good intuition with these AI agents. So if I was to give advice to people who want to stay in this field learn system design, architecture and build projects to implement them. Don't one shot applications/project. Build something complicated enough with these coding agents that you are forced to review the code, and if something feels unmaintainable learn to drive these agents in a way that you understand what you are building. And if you want to really stand out just build in public X, YouTube, tik tok but easier said than done cause us engineers by default are introverted. Just know that it's not you the market is just brutal, less hiring AI fear mongering holding new hires.  I spend too time in the X AI bubble so might not relate but this is where I see things heading. Maybe AI will be the level up that will bring more jobs to countries like ours so if I have hedge my bets it will be coding agents, system designs and building your own stuff.  It's one of the worst time to be a software engineer and also one of the best time both are true chose which reality you want to pick.",

Despite being independent, Balen was able to work with them and produce results.   Now Balen has whole RSP behind him and he can be even more effective.   Arko most important thing is no corruption allegations against Balen.|||https://preview.redd.it/dwlm7a9sv0gg1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6235b0fc08dcc9d98fb462fc1373baa63f7c92b5  Dont say anything else this didi will cry that balen did nothing|||The works mentioned aren’t very much transformative and these works are done by most of the mayors across the country. Here’s point wise breakdown of things he has done that are more media boosted to show fairytale: 1. Scholarships: there was an existing rule that all private schools should give 10% scholarships to poor and talented students. I don’t deny some of schools tried to not meet 10% quota as the law but balen hasn’t done that all by himself. 2. Book free fridays are a good initiative from him and a new concept that students should focus on different aspects rather than only books. I like this decision of him. 3. Student lunch of rs25 is given from municipalities across nepal and it is mandated by local laws and noone can give less than 25 but they can increase based on spending capacity of the local government. So this is not the magical thing only he has done it is an automatic process by law. 4. Hospital beds: same story as scholarships, 10% beds should be subsidized according the law. He hasn’t done it but the existing laws have done, however the concern is some of the hospitals try to skip this csr. It is also implemented in most of the local governments across nepal. 5. He has done a good job to keep waste out of the city but as mentioned in this post “recycling “ as he had agenda to produce electricity upto 5MW from waste daily. Where is the electricity or a recycling plant? All the waste are dumped into banchare danda which effects severly to locals and their health. He fould have done better! 6. Tukucha and other rivers: there was a lot of hype arond these, but he just broke some infrastructure and left. No any restoration or pretective progress around those broken infrastructure. Such damaged infrastructure affects local residents in their daily life what about that? Could have done better! 7. He has built some falchas which look good! But the catch is the issue that came up with the amount of budget used to make falchas. There was a news that a falcha was made out of about 60 lakhs? He hasn’t clarified anything regarding this also. I agree heritage works are expensive but how was the tender process gone? As much i know mostly mahanagar handed out contracts directly without tender/bidding processes. It’s a grey zone for corruption and I can’t defend him in this context.  8. A very good work of him is retaining the encroached lands!! It was a vote bank for communists from a long time and noone could dare touching those sukumbasis and he dared. However he faced a lot of backlash but I appreciate his work in this matter. 9. He has managed parking and footpaths well! But the footpaths claim aren’t much visible on ground as claimed to be 250 places. It’s mostly around newroad and other areas still have narrow or no footpaths. It’s a media manufactured noise so he could have done better. 10. New busparks? Really? Where are the new busparks? Please enlighten me anyone. 11. Street lights: it’s not a huge number a mentioned in the post as ktm city is very big compared to these number and he could have done better! However he has installed some fire hydrants in inaccessible places which is very admirable. Also he had promised to install cctv across ktm while election campaigns, he could have done that at least  a pilot project in some places?  12. Digital: his live meetings is appreciable as transparency however it’s more of his favorable thing as he could have faced pressure inside a room full of oldies! Now he’s not facing any media or questions ?   Conclusion His delivery is below average than most municipalities in the country. However some of the efforts are genuinely impressive but most of the needed works can’t be done in his tenure. As ktm has budget of 25 arba+ yearly it couldn’t invest/spend a bare minimum of 25% each year! It’s far beyond national spending which is around 38%. He could have done better! For the present context he should face media do debates and present his idea of development and plans for it to the public. Everyone should be accountable and noone is”GOD”  This was a critical analysis of balen shah’s mayoral tenure.|||This too when the whole system was against him  Top dheki bottom kasaile kaam garna didaina thiye|||Actually hamlai physical development vanda pani suru ma policy level ma changes ra existing rules ko implementation chaiyeko cha!|||102 ko ambulance was a great help .

Him reclaiming public property and the waste management is way better. But he still underdelivered on a lot of his campaign promises. Kathmandu still remains one of the most polluted city in the world and he did nothing to help improve that. He promised improvements to the public transport, but didn't do anything. There are dozens of other promises like more accessible public toilets, improving drainage system, roads, environments, etc all of which he fell short on. I understand that not all of the campaign promises can always be achieved. But the problem is that he has such a cult of personality that people act like he's beyond questioning. And that always leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  I hope that he wins, we're long overdue on big leadership changes. These old corrupt politicians have to be weeded out and Balen feels like a best opportunity to do that. But when he wins, I hope people start holding him accountable to his duties and his words. Otherwise, we'll just be repeating the same cycle.|||Let's not still try to hype him more than he deserves. This man has done things that no one dared to do but everything that he did was very ground-level stuff that the public can easily see and praise him for. It is understandable to try and make changes while you have the authority so I do give him the benefit of the doubt. If he does win this election and does things that can really paint a picture for a better future for Nepal then I'll be convinced that we have finally found a leader. Until then I would like to be skeptical. I do not want to give myself up to the idea of him being the perfect leader for our country, I do not want to grow up with this fantastical image of him in my mind and turn into a blind follower like much of the oldies. I admire him and his attempts but nothing that has actually won me over. Still better than anyone else though.|||What is did is not the question. The question is how many promises he implemented. The work listed here are some done by central government. He did the work for creating contradiction. I have not seen anything that is sustainable. Of being a mayor of the biggest metropolitan city people have expected much more.|||Balen is one of those rare leaders who didn’t come from the usual political pipeline and that’s exactly why people trust him. He speaks straight, works on the ground, and isn’t afraid to upset powerful interests if it means doing the right thing. Whether it’s cleaning up Kathmandu, enforcing rules equally, or calling out corruption, he leads with action more than words. You may agree or disagree with some decisions, but you can’t deny his courage, independence, and intent to change the system rather than benefit from it…he may not be perfect, but he is the best among the current political leaders.|||Tyo education ko each and every point already existing chij ho sarkar le nai dinxa Lunch money ta..

            "body": "Yesterday I was at a restaurant around Baneshwor area. Something caught my eyes; from a cabin I saw very vivid and clear shadows of people having s\\*x literally. And after some time, I heard some sound, you know that \"plyat plyat\" sound.  Now, the surprising thing is it was not even that private, the cabin had no doors anyone could walk in any moment. I stayed until they came outside, I was shocked they were plus 2 or 10 class students in college/school dress. I mean doing such thing, in somewhat public space with no fear.  I mean wtf. Is this normal today? Doing that at a young age and in a unsafe place like that? I even coughed and knocked the table to let them know that someone was noticing, but no they kept going.  They looked like Madhesi, I am not being racist here but anyone else would be too scared to do that shit in public. I mean go find a room if you are that desperate or go to some cave idk .  Edit: Watching possible minors engage in that behavior in a public space shouldn't be traumatizing? No wonder there’s something deeply wrong with today’s society.     Edit 2: I didn't realize while writing this, \"Trauma\" maybe is a very heavy word. I was deeply shocked, but I recognize that using the word “traumatized” can diminish the weight of real trauma, which isn’t what I intend. Cheers and lmao",

Only one officer fired a gun inside the Capitol. But in Nepal, when the protest was about corruption, the police **killed 19 innocent Gen Z protesters**.|||I am an Indian nepali from Darjeeling.

The moment I hear someone around me say something like this, I genuinely lose all respect for them. If this kind of logic were acceptable, then every form of violence, rape, and crime in society could be justified with same logic by blaming the victim. Honestly as a society we are heading towards moral decay.   This Yemale party is no longer what it once claimed to be. It is not a Maoist-Leninist, people centered party anymore. It has turned itself and its followers into something far uglier and far more dangerous. At this point, calling it a terrorist organization, as Balen has said, doesn’t even feel like an exaggeration.  I honestly cannot wait to see these fuckers held accountable and put behind bars.|||Going with usual tya kasle lera aayo party bs...My cousin sister who is involved in a party is the same..She got some conspiracy theory from party high command about how Balen planned the whole protest staying in some hotel with current home minister and even killings were calculated and she is running with that story annoying tf out of everyone.

            "body": "While most people are distracted by memes, the world just crossed a point of no return: Gold is at $5,000, and the \"Greenback\" is facing its biggest trust crisis since 1971. The US-EU tiff over Greenland isn't just about a \"big piece of ice\"—it’s a desperate grab for the rare earth minerals that will power the next century of AI and EVs. When the US threatens 25% tariffs on Germany and France over a land deal, the old \"Allies\" playbook is officially dead. Where does this leave Nepal? We’re the \"Yam\" between two boulders that are suddenly moving much faster. Our $20B reserve is a solid war chest, but it’s sitting in a currency that’s being weaponized. If you want to understand the 2026 vibe, look at the Tariff Tussle: we are moving from a world of \"cheap global goods\" to \"expensive local security.\" For Nepal, the goal is simple but brutal: don't choose a side, sell electricity to whoever pays in hard assets, and pray our \"Non-Alignment\" holds while the giants fight over the Arctic and the Dollar",

I know why he is liked by so many given how dysfunctional your political system as been lately, but Balen's performance during his stint wasn't that great either. Sadly, no culture of constructive criticism in Nepal.|||I am satisfied with his work because I know it’s not easy. The system itself is messed up, so obviously one person alone can’t fix everything on their own. There will be tons of hurdles, especially in the capital city of the country. Not just the capital, honestly, you can even say Kathmandu as Nepal itself, because it has become the center for everything. No matter what work you have, you somehow have to come to Kathmandu for it. So yeah, I understand his situation.  The one thing I really criticize him for is his lack of communication. That is something I am very disappointed about. During his entire campaign, he kept saying that he wouldn’t be like previous mayors and that he would stay in constant communication with the public. But after winning, he almost completely stopped connecting with people. There is no proper accountability, just one-sided Facebook status updates. This is the part where I am extremely disappointed in him and openly criticize him.  Other than that, I think he has actually shown that work can be done. He has also given inspiration to young people to enter politics.|||Done In some ways  . Even non Exciting programs .Some Jhara tareko type. Some Unfeasible .. some better options appear and done.

(Should I personally ask them to deduct 5% TDS?)  I also receive USD payments from an EU-based company. In that case, tax is deducted twice: first by the platform itself (approximately 3.5%), and then another 5% TDS is deducted here. When the funds arrive, my bank automatically converts the USD to NPR based on the prevailing exchange rate and credits it to my account in Npr.  I opened a USD account (dollar card) using my PAN. The annual limit is USD 500, but as far as I understand, this limit is only for payments/spending. Is it possible to increase this limit or ask the bank to keep incoming USD directly in that USD account instead of converting it to NPR?  Another question is that, if i’am to receive payments from a subscription based service from a platform apps i made, i basically can’t from nepal, for that i either need the LLC or C-Corp registered in US banks that accepts remote workers no ?  Up to how much extent can nepal banks provide services to be able to pay and receive payments internationally ? Or which banks ? That can win over the limitation of dollar cards ?

I was working for one of the renowned company.. they made us use the cursor. They kept telling us to have 2x productivity. We also able to burn the tickets more that we used to do in non AI days.. cursor was able to grasp a project context and was able to finish our 5 sp task as of 1 sp task 😅😅.  we work in micro service architecture and we need to constantly give cursor the context about other services and there was also dependency with others team and well cursor cannot communicate with other team like a actual human do 😁 So the point is that if the system is complex cursor/AI won't be able to do all things on its own.   But recently I switched company. Here we are now building smaller smaller project and sending it to the mass to get subscriptions as fast as possible.. and guess what we are using lovable to build the system. Lovable + supabase + stripe = boom product.   So in this case the point is that if the system you are building is simpler and you have clean vision even people from marketing can now build the system. And believe me marketing head from my company had done that in 2 weeks.    I don't know what future holds.. but guys sakney belaa paisaa shorna sakey shorum hai 😅😅|||The thing to contemplate on is : \"The job was never to write code it was to think in that case it's only the typing long lines with a keyboard that has replaced been replaced\".

Everything was finalized with the product owner and I researched a bit in the code base what existing tested methods exist. Then boom, give cursor clear instructions. Done in 10 minutes. So then I realized what I have in hand that an inexperienced ones have - already useful skill, product knowledge and codebase knowledge. That is helping me in productivity. But the real growth and survival will happen if I gain the skills of a lead like a team lead, a manager, a product owner, or solution architect or any kind of lead is fine. And you won’t see many leads in a team. Leads are already out standing. So You have to figure out how you can be the lead.|||All|||AI will **replace a significant portion of developers**, and not in some distant future. This is already happening, and it will accelerate rapidly over the next 12–24 months as AI tools get mass-adopted inside companies.  That said, the outcome isn’t as simple as “developers are done.”  What’s actually happening is a restructuring of value.  As companies begin laying off junior and mid-level developers, they won’t eliminate development teams entirely. Instead, they’ll rely on fewer, highly reliable developers who can handle much more work with the help of AI. This creates a paradoxical situation: layoffs on one side, high demand on the other, but only for the right people.    If you come from a development background, the smartest move right now is simple:  * Become exceptional at using AI as a force multiplier. * Just knowing how to code won’t be enough anymore. That used to be the differentiator; now it’s table stakes.    **What matters now is:**  * Knowing how to think in systems * Translating vague requirements into clear specs * Using AI to generate, refactor, test, debug, and ship faster * Understanding architecture well enough to spot what AI gets wrong * Owning a specific niche deeply enough to solve high-value problems quickly    Companies won’t pay top dollar for someone who can “do everything moderately well.”  They will pay very well for someone who can fix a very specific, painful problem reliably.  And let’s be honest: saying “AI won’t replace humans” is already outdated. It has started replacing roles; not because AI is perfect, but because it’s good enough when paired with the right person.  If a non-technical person, like myself, someone who loves tech but never formally learned coding, can now build a full-fledged system using tools like ChatGPT and Replit, then the competitive bar has fundamentally shifted.  AI isn’t coming for jobs.   It’s coming for generic skill sets.    **So the choice is clear:**  * Either level up into a top-tier senior developer who designs systems, makes decisions, and leads execution * Or become a highly specialized mid-level developer with deep expertise in one niche and excellent AI leverage  Anything in between is the danger zone.  This isn’t a threat, it’s an opportunity.  But only for those who adapt early and intentionally.  Cheers!|||Lmao CRUD/landing page ta garihaalxa ni.

I’d cut it down to one page, keep just 2–3 strongest projects (the ones that are closest to real‑world work), and move your core technical skills (Python, ML, MLOps tools, cloud, etc.) near the top so a recruiter can see them in 5–10 seconds. The ‘other skills’ and very beginner projects can go or be merged so the focus stays on the work you’re most proud of. If you want, you can DM me your CV and 1–2 roles you’re targeting (ML engineer, MLOps, applied AI) and I can suggest concrete line‑by‑line tweaks.|||if you're applying for tech roles reduce to a page.

This has now gotten out of hand, and this type of behavior will surely spread to other tourist areas, especially those closer to the border like Sauraha and others. I have seen these 'tourists' in Thars and other SUVs riding recklessly on our highways, mocking our rules and laws. In my local area in the Terai, there have been a couple of incidents where such SUVs have hit locals, including traffic police, and fled to India.

Influencers from Pokhara need to raise their voices collectively on other popular social media channels like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Local influencers need to unite and raise this issue from their platforms in their individual capacities. Otherwise, we might be just one incident away from breaking news.  I will share this thread with a popular Indian YouTube journalist-The Deshbhakt. I have been following him, and he has made videos on such stupidity by Indian tourists. I will leave his Instagram link here so that everyone with evidence can share information.

RaSaPa ko ki Mutton Kaji Farm ko?|||Lol, honestly I didn’t even know he had uploaded something yesterday, but my post had perfect timing and it blew up. Even Bibek Thapaliya was hiding his affiliations, and KMAG still hides theirs. This guy just picked up that post and used it to make himself look good again.  I know how biased he is or maybe he doesn’t even realize how he got used. This is how Gagan operates. He invites these influencers, keeps them close, so they don’t post or make content against him. By doing these meetings, he slowly creates a soft corner in their mind and heart. So later, when Gagan messes up, they hesitate to criticize him because they’ve met him personally and think, “He’s a good guy.”  This is also how Gagan has managed to influence journalists across different media houses. Not all of them are in his inner circle, but he subtly shapes how they think. He invites them, talks to them, and slowly pushes the narratives he wants—who’s bad, what’s bad, and how to counter certain people.  The social media ban happened when Congress was in government, right? He won’t openly say, “Support me” or “Make things favor me,” but indirectly he keeps planting ideas like, I’m the only one who can fix this, and stuff like that.  This is a very familiar pattern with Gagan Thapa. First, influencers like these create noise online, and once it starts getting attention, he jumps in and talks about the issue as if he really cares. If he genuinely cared about social media, he could’ve spoken up against the social media ban when Congress was in power.  Even during the Gen Z protest, he subtly planted leaders like Tanuja and Rakshya Bam through his media outlet, Setopati. Their interviews were pushed again and again, filling the feed with news about what Rakshya and Tanuja were saying. Slowly, that turned into posts supporting Gagan Thapa. In the end, neutral and unaware people start feeling like, oh, Gagan is the hero we were looking for, just because these figures they follow are also backing him.  Ask him if he made any contents on Gagan Thapa?  \\-  Did he made video when Congress tried to sneak in a loophole in the cooling period? What happened to Khatiwada then after?  \\- Did he made how gagan thapa surviving without doing a single job?  \\- When Congress/UML tried to pass 5 years corruption expiry bill.  \\- Even to debunk PACT corruption where Gagan Thapa was alleged, even to debunk the allegation. (he wont, cz truth or not, many will know about this case and will have -ve perception of Gagan)  \\- Why is he surrounded and hangs out with Goons?  \\- Why WikiLeaks has Gagan Thapa as key embassy contact?  No, he won’t do that, because he’ll always have a soft corner for Gagan Thapa. That’s how Gagan Thapa works he spreads narratives through influencers like him, who knowingly or unknowingly end up producing such content.  Another example is Gagan doing small meetings on “populism” and then letting influencers create content around that topic to “spread awareness.” For influencers, it looks like he’s thinking about the nation. But from Gagan’s point of view, he knows those influencers will create content that ends up being subtly targeted at new faces.  https://preview.redd.it/x4nqjclj1veg1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=5303b0b09e8b772195bbc2a80116bd3b9f25bdb5|||RONB le tetro Balen ko chusekai chusai cha ta 3 4 barsa bata yo vanda badi jholagiri ta kai dekhechaina kunai media le koi lai gareko.

Communism is really stupid if you look back at humanity now.|||This should be categorised as fictional book|||some deep shit ! ... op is not asking for superficial answer|||Technically, yes, he wrote the manual. But, Marx was a man who saw a disease but prescribed a medicine that was more toxic than the sickness. He wanted to fix the world by changing who owns the \"stuff\" without changing the \"human being\" who uses the stuff.  ​When you try to enforce \"equality\" through a state, you don't get a paradise; you get a prison. This is why Marxism has failed wherever it was tried as a rigid political tool.  ​Why \"Harkabad\" is the Antidote TODAY:  ​The reason we look toward a philosophy like Harkabad (Prakriti, Samskriti, Pravidhi) instead of Marxism or Western Capitalism is because it addresses the foundation, not just the \"economics.\" Harka Smapang has time and again said it has nothing to do with his name. He is suggesting a solution that isn't a western copy but suitable to the soil we stand on.   ​Marxism says: \"Who owns the factory?\" ​Capitalism says: \"How much can the factory produce?\" ​Harkabad says: \"Do we even need the factory if it kills the river (Prakriti) and destroys the community's soul (Samskriti)?\"  If you ask me if we need \"Harkabad,\" I would say we need Consciousness.  ​Harka Sampang is essentially bringing consciousness to governance. When he goes out and carries stones with his own hands (Shramadaan), he is moving from the \"ugly\" socialism (taking from others) to the \"wonderful\" socialism (giving of oneself).  ​We don't need a \"Communist\" revolution where blood is spilled to change the law. We need a \"Harkabad\" style evolution where sweat is spilled to restore the land. ​You don't need a book from 19th-century Germany to tell you how to live. You just need to look at the earth beneath your feet and the people around you.",

The feeling of my heart having faster and my stomach twisting like an eel holding it's prey is not new to me but still it's not wholly mine.   The feeling of lying in the bed with inherent thoughts of disperse happiness and the want to be able to understand if that happiness is as true as it seems is not new and it's also not wholly mine   I look at all these motion picture hoping to find something. And what that might be is as ananomus to me as it is to you. I look at these things, listen as they talk, but the existence of this feeling of watching doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm lying on this virgin earth, unmolested and untouched, devoid of any feeling of any sort except for one; consciousness. The consciousness reigns supreme within and without all within the vicinity of my existence.  At this point, life as you call it feels not a moments passing by or time flowing like my thoughts.  My head feels particularly heavy, as if I'm thinking but a thought is yet to process. But how can this be? Without a thought, how can you think? How can one live, without knowing the value of death? But that's not right either. For one to know the value of death,.one must first know of its qualities, it's feature in all it's dimensions. The inherent idea of a thought being, and to think not sounds stupid as if not funny enough. But you can't overlook the idea behind such ponder.   I take very long breaths as I think. My heart beats loud enough for me to hear it. And all my bodily functions seems very much obvious to me. This isn't new but it's not wholly mine.   Ahh now my head hurts a little to. But this shall too pass.   Theres this lingering feeling of solitude that I feel very sensationally. For solitude has been my friend far longer then any. The silence that made me feel alone after some years felt not pleasing but good enough to make me feel a bit stingy if it got disturbed.  But now this solitude engulfs me, strangles me so that I choke these thoughts out of me which are yet to be. But it was this very solitude that made me form a thought but now it want it back. Like how death waits right Infront of you, lingers above you with it's hands around neck, and then takes you through the stairs of lifelessness while you climb oblivious. Similar is the solitude that I experience right now, but instead of lifelessness, I climb and climb but towards nothing, I climb and climb but climb on empty thoughts.   My agitated muscles ache in the silence of my breath while my breath gets shorter and heavier each micro instant.",

My dad brought quite a few for me from KTM every few months, and I used to colour, solve crosswords etc. I event sent crossword solutions (never got published). This is where I knew about sudoku and still love sudoku to this day. I have read a lot of stories in this magazine and some of them  have been life changing for me. I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.  Few years later, through sheer luck (and a bit of reputation in my Nepali class), I got to be the guest editor of one edition of this magazine. Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र). I still absolutely vividly remember that letter, the paper, the handwriting, almost the content (almost 20 years later). The sender had found my information from the guest editor section.

I am in US, and I can say 98% of my friends don’t support his policies. There are a few who do but there’s always an exception.   Now many, including myself, do support some level of checks and restrictions on immigration. Those who didn’t get in take that as being opportunistic or slamming the door after I got in. Far from it.   What I don’t support is people coming through illegal means. What I don’t support is people cheating and providing 100% false representation while applying. Then once they get in, they try to game the system and just be a leech sucking in the benefits without contributing. They are making it harder for the legitimate immigrants and that’s exactly what we hate.  Now I don’t support the current position of not granting any immigration visa indefinitely to Nepal. But you know why this happened? Because almost 40% of Nepalis, about 70-80k take welfare benefits from the US government. You don’t need it if you are a contributing member of the society (except for in some disability/age related case).   There are people coming to US to get free medical treatment. One performer got the treatment and left the Us without paying the medical bills- that person is now banned from coming. Another famous pair got the DV and justified their entry by saying they get free medical for their kid (their case may be legit, but I am just giving an example of what people have been doing).   The administration is going to the other extreme to curb this- but some of it is because the past administration didn’t do anything to prevent it from happening.|||I seriously doubt the accuracy of this sentiment. Nepalis who have settled in America invariably work to bring other family members here. The effort is long and hard, and many are still in process, meaning that spouses, siblings, and others are now cut off from coming over. My brother in-law was able to finally secure his wife's visa a few weeks ago, after working on it for 2 years.  a few weeks later and she wouldn't get to come, so no, Nepali uncles and aunties aren't supportive, and there is no indication that most nepalis voted for trump.  The other thing to consider is the message behind the visa suspensions.  The trump administration is basically saying that immigrants who have come here have not improved conditions, but rather they have made it worse by taking advantage of government programs that they are not entitled to. In other words immigrants are lazy, and thieves. Not a lot to take pride in about that.|||Let me know what you are smoking..seems like good stuff.|||Just like the viral trend chori manchey ko khutta tanney chori manchey naai huncha.

I've worked with Nepali people for years at my job, they work remotely from Kathmandu. I got the chance to visit Nepal this year and loved your country. Everyone is so nice, the food is great and there are so many interesting and beautiful places.   I was a little nervous since it was only a few weeks after the Gen Z protest, but everything seemed pretty calm. I thought to myself, wow it'd sure be cool if we could overthrow our government, get rid of trump and be back to normal in a few weeks.   The Nepali living in the us would not feel happy or safe if they lived in my city I guarantee it. Legal or not they're grabbing anyone off the street that isn't white and taking them to a detention center. If they can prove their residency they get released, maybe. It is completely white supremacist Nazi shit. It's horrible and I'm ashamed to be an American. These are my friends and neighbors, I don't ask people what their immigration status is, I could care less.   It's usually portrayed that undocumented immigrants are a drain on government services, but that is a lie. They pay taxes since it's automatically deducted from the paycheck to a social security number that doesn't belong to them. If they try to use the services they're caught and deported  We're fighting back but our leaders are ineffective, the police are working with ICE and if we call in the military we're unsure of whose side they'll take.   Trust me you don't want to visit the US anytime soon|||I am also very happy.|||Same reason you and others who are aspiring to migrate toUS are sad. Immigration is not good for lot of citizens. Higher housing prices, rent, more competition for jobs. Companies benefit from supply of cheap labor while workers suffer from depressed wages. There’s no need to portray this as some kind of good vs evil thing. Those guys are looking out for their own interests just like you are. No country is required to keep its borders open to outsiders.

Why would anyone be happy about the current situation ? All of you who agree with the statement are in Nepal who couldn’t make it to the US.|||May I dare present a different perspective?   Not everyone who votes Republican is \"hiding the ladder since they've made it\". That claim is lazy, false, and ignores basic economic reality.  Some of us vote based on numbers, not slogans. When you are paying over $100,000 a year in taxes (household)—income tax, state tax, property tax, sales tax—and you don’t see proportional benefits in return, fiscal policy starts to matter a lot. At that level, voting conservative isn’t ideological—it’s rational. Lower taxes, limited government, and accountability in spending simply align better with that reality.  Paying six figures into the system and being told you’re “privileged,” “selfish,” or morally inferior for questioning where that money goes is not persuasive—it’s alienating. Wanting to keep more of what you earn does not make you hateful. It makes you financially literate.  Many Republican voters reject racism and extremism outright. What they do reject is runaway taxation, bloated government, and being constantly generalized or morally lectured by people whose policies they fundamentally can’t relate to. The same way not all Democrats are extremists, not all Republicans are villains.  And yes—we are also tired of being lumped together with fringe elements just because we don’t align with extreme progressive ideology. Disagreeing with activist politics, identity absolutism, or ideological purity tests does not make someone anti-human. It means they prioritize practicality over performative outrage.  People vote based on lived experience. For households paying $100k+ in taxes every year, conservative policies often make more sense. That’s not hate. That’s math.",

At 5 am, they beat on EVERY door shouting to ensure everyone was up and ready to leave.   My Nepali friends said that was something that happens in that type of hotel (ie, mostly Nepali customers).   Every culture has people who can be inconsiderate. It’s a human problem.|||+100|||mandir jasto thau ma sab jana quiet vako bela indian haru wti halla garchan ni|||Can we not stereotype?

I have been seeing many Gagan-glazing posts recently, so I have a few questions for him.  - When will you speak about the Nepali and foreign currency that was found burnt in your former president’s house? Were those AI-generated, as your party president and many party leaders were claiming?  - You have raised the Sahakari Kanda involving Rabi Lamichhane, but when will you raise the same question about your own party member, Maya Rai, who was also a member of the same sahakari in Kathmandu (I’ve forgotten the name)? What about the Dhanraj Gurung sahakari case?  - You were part of the Government Efficiency team when the recent UML–Congress coalition government was formed. Will you question or take responsibility for the recent GenZ killings? Your party member Ramesh Lekhak was also the Home Minister at that time—have you questioned him about this?  - You have been a Member of Parliament four times, and during your tenure, the Congress has formed the government multiple times. Can you point to any concrete, policy-level achievements you delivered during your party’s time in government?  - What about Aftab Alam case during your party's government was he rightfully being prosecuted or your party's government have him impunity from jail, what about that case?",

Deuba, as an individual, may once have been a true leader—but over time, the gang culture around him is what turned everything rotten and made him look bhrasta.  From this point onward, Gagan is free.  Free from:  All blame linked to Arzu  All accusations about money in Deuba’s house  All baggage related to Bhutani saranarthi  All the kandas, Teramox, and backroom deals  All blame connected to Lekhaks and their networks  These were never Gagan’s sins to carry.  So why should he keep answering for other people’s cults? Why should a reformist voice be held hostage by the corruption, compromises, and power games of an old guard that refuses to let go?  If anyone needs to answer, it’s the system that protected those networks for decades—not the one who finally challenged them.  Gagan doesn’t need to answer anymore. The Mahadibesan already did.|||He can give you wai wai, not sure about answers.

Don't get me wrong there are shortcomings from him and nobody is perfect but most of the questions you raised here are poor attempt to make him look bad.  You have to realize that even though Gagan is a prominient member of Nepali Congress, he was never the executive. Every decision the party makes as a whole, the chairman (Deuba) has the supreme authority and he is little to no say in any of the decisions.  Even then, he has clearly spoken against all wrongdoings. And you say \"just speak\". But that's the problem of not being in executive power, he can only speak.  You trying to  make the money burnt in Deuba's house somehow a crime by Gagan Thapa clearly tells me that you are just trying to hate. Otherwise as everyone else has said, there is a special probe commission formed to specifically study the burnt money case and all we can do is wait for their report and the government will file the case if there is wrongdoing (which we all believe there is). And Gagan has clearly affirmed this, as any sane person would. You should read him and listen his many public interviews/videos and not just assume he didn't say anything.  He has clearly said multiple times that any and all involved in sahakari kanda should be investigated including naming people from his own party by name, again multiple times in multiple of his public appearences and writings, you should read/watch/listen those. The government should file cases. I don't understand how this would be his fault.  If you again watch his comments in good faith and listen to his parliament speeches, he as said multiple times that  the public is angry, they need delivery. He said he opposed the coalition and publicly opposed it multiple times. But he is not the executive, deuba is. When there is coaliation, he has the moral responsibility to make the government successful. He was indeed in the efficiency team and he said he tried is best to make the government successful because he knew people needed delivery even though he opposed the coalition. He publicly told long before the Gen-Z protest that he couldn't get the government to do what the efficiency team was supposed to do, and he left it. So I don't think that makes him culpable for the massacre during gen-z protest.  But still he has taken moral responsibility for what happened during the protest. He has apologized multiple times for any moral culpability he has. He said he immediately asked the party leadership to break coaliation in the first day of protest and asked Lekhak to resign. Lekhak did resign but the party didn't leave coalition because again Deuba is executive and makes the decision.  He has been parliament member four times. The first time and he failed to deliver the constitution as promised which he was elected for. The second tenure was again the CA election, which delivered the constitution and you can't deny he played crucial role in making the constitution, and he (among all others) delivered the constitution. The next term he went to the parliament again and became health minister and people say he delivered some reforms in health sector (again refer to public catalogues of his works during this tenure). And you have to grant that he has been constant voice in the parliament on various issues, which the MP is sent for. This last time was a short tenure, but as everyone he has played crucial role in voicing concerns in the parliament. Ironically he strongly demanded there be independent probe in sahakari case and there have been multiple arrests and cases filed against some major fraudsters. You should grant that this was successfull. But we can always demand more. I am not his prabakta but to me seems like he could have definitely done more here and I am sure he agrees.  Yeah what about the case? Alam was a proven convict. But congress did dirty by lobbying to release him. I haven't seen him support Alam's release. Again, I am not sure the details of his release but how is Gagan culpable for the crime Alam committed?  Again I am not his prabakta. I try to speak with reason. You could certainly question that he didn't do enough at policy level as MP to propose new laws and pass them. You could ask him that he could not do enough to break Deuba stronghold. But he precisely did that recently.  Now I am watching him closely, he is now in the position to deliver at least from his party level. Make him accountable ask him tough questions. But the aforementioned questions seemed more like an attempt to make him bad (except may be how many policy changed did he make in 1 1/2 tenure as MP except CA MP which they delivered constitution).

At the check-in counter, the agent told me to move some items from my carry-on into one checked bag so I’d only have to pay excess for one bag. I did exactly that and reduced my carry-on to 12 kg.

I was exhausted and didn’t have the energy to argue, so they charged me for two excess bags — $80 each. No leeway, no consideration.  To make things worse, the agent openly suggested that if I paid cash and didn’t need a receipt, they could lower the price. At that point it was obvious they were trying to pocket the money.

The main difference is that airport scales are \"trade-legal\" industrial devices required by law to be regularly calibrated for high precision, whereas home scales are consumer-grade gadgets that use cheaper sensors and are almost never recalibrated. Additionally, the environment distorts the numbers; weighing a bag on a soft home carpet or trying to balance a large suitcase on a small bathroom scale often creates a \"lighter\" reading than reality, unlike the airport's large, stable platforms embedded in hard concrete. Because of this, the airport scale is generally accurate, while your home scale is just an estimate that tends to drift.|||[removed]|||Are we allowed to video record our interactions there?

It doesn’t feel like tourism anymore it feels careless.On top of that, the local leadership has also disappointed me.

I'm in full support for people to move this route, even if you are violent in the past. It's not easy being human and I get it. Please consider, I hope this helps. But please remember, if you are going to lead this journey for both of you, remember to be patient, kind, and loving. Sometimes you will have to let the other person be so angry and be able to watch them (it's a specific emotional release session) without you absorbing their emotions. For him, and for you too probably, when emotions come, you both have to remember it's NEVER about the other person. If you would like each other to do something, you can request but nobody is obliged to follow, just having this much boundary will help you both to process your emotions on your own. Start therapy or just start writing on your own, you will notice you stress or anger is often coming from something else within yourself, not from people around you.   I hope this help a little bit. Take care, pass love to each other. If it's easier, bring serious talk when you are getting romantic, I think that helps you both absorb and understand better. Take care please. It's not impossible to change yourself and your relationships in this time, especially with so much options, start meditation, therapy, dance, especially moving body helps move your emotions too. Take care.|||Just have a conversation with your husband. Ask him why is he is acting like that? IS he insecure about you or what? make everything clear. Why is he acting in that manner?

The system itself is messed up, so obviously one person alone can’t fix everything on their own. There will be tons of hurdles, especially in the capital city of the country.

No matter what work you have, you somehow have to come to Kathmandu for it. So yeah, I understand his situation.  The one thing I really criticize him for is his lack of communication. That is something I am very disappointed about. During his entire campaign, he kept saying that he wouldn’t be like previous mayors and that he would stay in constant communication with the public. But after winning, he almost completely stopped connecting with people. There is no proper accountability, just one-sided Facebook status updates. This is the part where I am extremely disappointed in him and openly criticize him.  Other than that, I think he has actually shown that work can be done.

The content is rarely original. It is compiled from existing news articles that anyone could find doing Google. It’s a summary service, not investigative journalism.  2. As it relies on secondary sources, it never goes deep. It stays on the surface of issues, prioritizing smooth editing over raw facts.  3. The channel’s main narrative is simple: 'The country is doomed.' This is a lazy narrative. Telling us that politicians are bad or the system is broken is stating the obvious. It validates anger but offers no insight.  If you want to be entertained, it works. But if you want to be informed, this is a waste of time.",

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.  I (21M) and my sibling (15F) are taking care of our parents during the day and our cousins help at night. Because of this, we’ve missed months of classes but we don’t really have a choice right now.  If anyone is able to help even a small amount, it would mean a lot to us.  I’ve verified the case with two of the mods and I’ll be posting medical reports in the comments as well.  Please DM or comment if you can help in any way. Even sharing this post would really help.",

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

Most of the teachers in school and college all of the are pedophiles.|||I'm not aware of the definition - is it like somebody who's grooming girls under 18? Are you using the term loosely?  It's an individual-thing and not a profession-thing. Girls sending DMs to get referred (when they have no skills) is also more common than you think. I get many DMs asking for free help (refactors)/ referrals (barely know them/ barely seen their code) and I just ignore them. I help many people (m/f) on a daily basis, and I've never met most of them. I know many of my 'male' senior friends (no female senior dev friends) do the same.  You should clear your exams first. Last bullet point sounds like a good plan.  Most people here will be happy to review 1-2 projects for free. I'll jump in if it's Python/ Next.js/ ML. Just post your github repo on some relevant community and they'll do free reviews.   Edit: I dont do free mentorships, happy to review repos/ coding practices.|||In my experience, Girls seem to help girl only when they are on some “female tech organization” and it’s rarely a technical mentorship.

It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

But my experience tells me having multiple clients is safe and secure for the long run. The more financially secure thing you can do is make a sensible investment inside Nepal. But I assume even if you stop getting work from abroad your plan would be working for a Nepal based company. Also if work load from abroad dries up, so does your dollar flow so better keep your spending habits checked and make a better investment now so that you are financially secure even without the jobs that will pay you in dollars.|||Should I improve english first or just applying for a remote job and then improving it while working?

(Should I personally ask them to deduct 5% TDS?)  I also receive USD payments from an EU-based company. In that case, tax is deducted twice: first by the platform itself (approximately 3.5%), and then another 5% TDS is deducted here. When the funds arrive, my bank automatically converts the USD to NPR based on the prevailing exchange rate and credits it to my account in Npr.  I opened a USD account (dollar card) using my PAN. The annual limit is USD 500, but as far as I understand, this limit is only for payments/spending. Is it possible to increase this limit or ask the bank to keep incoming USD directly in that USD account instead of converting it to NPR?  Another question is that, if i’am to receive payments from a subscription based service from a platform apps i made, i basically can’t from nepal, for that i either need the LLC or C-Corp registered in US banks that accepts remote workers no ?  Up to how much extent can nepal banks provide services to be able to pay and receive payments internationally ? Or which banks ? That can win over the limitation of dollar cards ?

Cant see both.|||if its real whatdo you do  ??? can you give some info or context|||I can see the angle of “look what you can get even from Nepal,” and yeah, that part can actually be motivating because a lot of people still assume they need to leave the country to reach certain compensation levels. But motivation usually comes from showing the path, not just the end result. A screenshot shows where you landed, not how you got there.  People here asked genuine questions about niche, stack, timeline, experience, etc because that’s the part that actually helps others move in that direction. That’s where the value would have been. Without that context, the post ends up reading more like a soft flex than mentorship. Nothing wrong with flexing, just don’t call it motivation if you’re not giving people anything they can learn from or replicate.  With 5+ years of experience you’ve seen enough of the field to know that the “how” matters more than the “what,” especially for people in Nepal who are trying to break into the global market.

There aren’t many good options in my country to receive international payments, so I used Binance P2P to convert USDT to local currency and send it to my bank account. This money is my salary, not trading profits or third-party funds.  This morning my bank froze my account without warning. These were my hard-earned savings that I was slowly building to someday build a home, so this hit me really hard mentally.  Tomorrow I’m going to the bank in person, but I’m unsure:  What exactly should I say to them?  What should I not say?  What documents usually help in these cases?  Has anyone here gone through something similar and successfully unfrozen their account?  Is there a real risk of losing the money, or is this usually just a compliance review?  I’m not trying to avoid laws or do anything shady. I just didn’t have a better way to receive my income.  Any advice or shared experiences would really help right now. Thanks for reading.",

Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||[deleted]|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||Skill issue.

My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights.

But there’s no guarantee you’ll survive in the long run.      AI is evolving faster than most people can upskill.   Tech stacks change. Roles disappear. Expectations keep increasing.      IT is no longer a “safe” career.   It’s a constant race with uncertainty.      This isn’t fear-mongering...it’s reality.   Students should seriously explore alternate paths where AI supports you, not replaces you.      Think long-term.   Don’t just follow the crowd.     Found on X",

            "comments": "This narrative of \"Software Engineering is done\" isn't new. This happens every time a revolutionary milestone in the technology space is achieved. Sure, it is not realistic to overlook the economy or the job scarcity that is so prevalant now, maybe for the longest time yet but it doesn't adjucate to the premise of Software Engineering isn't feasible as a career anymore, at least to the degree people are making it out to be. AI-driven development may very well be a 'bubble', and when it pops and the dust settles, the next big thing will provoke a similar reaction. While it is evident that people with years of experience are at a loss right now, and even more so for students trying to make it in tech, undergrads or young aspirants.  I believe it was never about how greatly any technology overshadows the current technology even if it transforms areas of it by overwhelming amounts but the ability to use it to your advantage. That is how you thrive here. You embrace, and not reject. AI cannot replace engineering but it does accelerate aspects of it that if you don't keep up, you get left behind. I mean, with AI-driven development so rampant right now, startups are at an all time high. People adapt and make it work. That mindset is obligatory now more than ever. Well, I could be speaking regardless of facts that I have yet to know, but I stand firmly on my grounds of not rejecting engineering as it has never been easier than now.|||I have 4 YOE. I don't expect to have a job in 2-3 years. I am not a people person. I don't know what else I can do besides this. Life is going to get really very difficult moving forward.|||i am in my second year studying ai and data science. I don't know what career path i should choose|||I too have been overwhelmed by the amount of people following this IT trend blindly.  I don't know where I'll end up.|||I'm not sure why people are surprised. An industry can only take so many people before saturation, especially in face of disruption / paradigm shift as is the case now. As with any other field, you have to dedicate time and effort to be good and stay good. If you are a computer engineer worth your salt, you know it's a lot more about structured and critical thinking, problem solving skills and architecting solutions than coding in the field, and if you have the basics right, tech stack changing shouldn't scare you as much.  As with any other field, only the most committed, knowledgeable and competent people will remain in the industry and that should always be the case. The gold rush is over.|||Difficult times? Yes.  First time? No.   I really want to see what time has. Best wishes.  Best will have the best.|||Not only in Nepal. If you want to compete anywhere development is kind of fading out (especially if you are a fresher and just joining the market). Firstly kina vane most of the basic things are entirely done by language models, Hami padhne bela Hamro github ma jun project haru dekhayera job painthyo ahile tyo 10 second bhitra Jun sukai language model le create garcha plus CLI authority dine ho vane ta push pani gardincha.   Tara as a student who has been studying ani working in Europe, I see we lag in the field of research ani the importance of it in the long run. Hamlai uni ma kaile pani research based vayera kaam garna sikayena, or maybe Malai Testo feel vayena. Tara the best way to develop skills nowadays is that you could be creating projects written on someone's research papers.   For example: Visual transformers haru ko progress sangai there have been numerous researches using ViTs in the field of Medicine, so if you want to work in the field of AI/ML kunai pani euta research linus, if they are using free dataset, use that ani replicate the process foe which you can use the same Language models to write code but it would be entirely different than all the projects your competitors have.   Similarly, development field ma pani tei hola, I am not into development more ajkal but things like using ORMs for databases is something I found ekdamai helpful. if you could find solutions to some genuine problems that the team might be facing you instantly will have their attention. Plus enjoy the grind. It'll be fruitful.|||The big picture is the barrier to entry has risen but all the things mentioned above are not required to get a entry role. You will be adding more skills as you go, as your project requires it.   Yes its a challenging job but so are other jobs. If you enjoy learning/working in this field then its good for you else people can and should look for other carrier option. Do what feels natural to you.   Regarding AI, its here to stay wear we like it ir not. We don't need to me AI/ML experts we just have to learn how to use it, or embrace it, and not reject it. Its on the hype but it will die down and come back to its default.|||Jack of all with understanding of Ai tools and how to implement wins. Be the jack of all. Don’t try to master one thing. That’s what I suggest.   Decent apps can be build in a day if you know the requirements, understand system design and  logic needed. You need to understand things like how apps are build, deployed etc.  At least in US, Ai replacing engineerings is not exactly false.   With Automated workflows and Ai agents, team needing 100 members could only need couple members. That does mean Ai replaced 98 people among 100. That’s how I see.",

            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

If I have the time, I might join if I'm free. If they were inviting Harvard professors, it'd cost you 10x more to attend. Events take time and effort. Many costs. Let's switch the focus to you. Have you organized an event? Was it easy? Who did you invite as a speaker?   If you're a student, why care about an enterprise AI event? I fail to see your criticisms. Not everybody needs to start a business to prove their credibility. It literally takes <20k.  I don't expect them to cover hf peft best practices. It's an event for enterprises. I don't have expectations for food. If I meet somebody interesting, that's good enough for me.  I think you're being confused between training courses and networking events. Plenty of events if you want to learn. ANAIS, NAAMII charged 12k for students this year. Was fine. Good stuff. Made many friends.  I dislike AI non-profits that claim to do research and fail to have any publications or research projects, yet say they're open to collaborations. But the AI association isn't a research body, probably does just events. Executives don't open up VS code and grind all day. That's a very small minority. They're skilled, just not in a way that appeals to you. They bring in investors, organize events, lots of things. If you ask me, there's a lot more to a product than PRs and merges. If you're not already the Lead for some MNC, some humility helps. It's dumb to say a CEO doesn't have skills because they don't code like you do, don't you think?  I'm not affiliated with naamii or any non-profits.|||On one hand, I can see the low effort poster with multiple mistakes and the fluffy pointless nonsense that is the main paragraph probably written by ChatGPT with a 6 word prompt.

Maybe offer anecdotes? Some tangible verifiable reason to justify your \"nrs 350 for 2.5 hours is a massive waste\".  Organizing an event comes with some cost, and some of that must be passed to the visitor. NRS 350 is some money, it is definitely not a lot of money. It is most definitely not \"expensive\" for an event in any sense of the word.   Justify your claims. Why is this a \"scam\"? What other way can a person \"use nrs 350 to learn by yourself\" (your words)? Who are the speakers and why are they unqualified to speak on this program?  *disclaimer: not affilaited to this org or event*, *just a random angry redditor*",

I haven't tried using it to create functionalities yet as I ran out of free token but I'm just shocked how good it is.

Demand is decreasing, supply is too much.|||It will take my backend job too. I have no clue how to navigate further.|||Well, senior dev here !!  Sharing the experience.   I was working for one of the renowned company.. they made us use the cursor. They kept telling us to have 2x productivity. We also able to burn the tickets more that we used to do in non AI days.. cursor was able to grasp a project context and was able to finish our 5 sp task as of 1 sp task 😅😅.  we work in micro service architecture and we need to constantly give cursor the context about other services and there was also dependency with others team and well cursor cannot communicate with other team like a actual human do 😁 So the point is that if the system is complex cursor/AI won't be able to do all things on its own.   But recently I switched company. Here we are now building smaller smaller project and sending it to the mass to get subscriptions as fast as possible.. and guess what we are using lovable to build the system. Lovable + supabase + stripe = boom product.   So in this case the point is that if the system you are building is simpler and you have clean vision even people from marketing can now build the system. And believe me marketing head from my company had done that in 2 weeks.    I don't know what future holds.. but guys sakney belaa paisaa shorna sakey shorum hai 😅😅|||The thing to contemplate on is : \"The job was never to write code it was to think in that case it's only the typing long lines with a keyboard that has replaced been replaced\".   The lack of job on the other hand is because of economy, greedy rich people, saturated graduates market and incompetent middle/upper management.|||I think it's a bit nuanced than that. Who created the design document based on client requirements? As of now these tools are great at doing grunt work and they work great in the hands of someone who knows how to translate complex business asks into technical details.

I mean the same code with some refactoring and clean code principles would've taken a day or two to write but with AI and good prompts, i can do it quite easily in 1-2 hours.

AI speeds up the things, but without a human intelligence, it can mess up the things.|||..., if they start using it then I'm sure out of the work cause they can get same result with no need to pay me and also in less than 10 minutes, lot of other places if they learn this tool then I'm out of work.

Everything was finalized with the product owner and I researched a bit in the code base what existing tested methods exist. Then boom, give cursor clear instructions. Done in 10 minutes. So then I realized what I have in hand that an inexperienced ones have - already useful skill, product knowledge and codebase knowledge. That is helping me in productivity. But the real growth and survival will happen if I gain the skills of a lead like a team lead, a manager, a product owner, or solution architect or any kind of lead is fine. And you won’t see many leads in a team. Leads are already out standing. So You have to figure out how you can be the lead.|||All|||AI will **replace a significant portion of developers**, and not in some distant future. This is already happening, and it will accelerate rapidly over the next 12–24 months as AI tools get mass-adopted inside companies.  That said, the outcome isn’t as simple as “developers are done.”  What’s actually happening is a restructuring of value.  As companies begin laying off junior and mid-level developers, they won’t eliminate development teams entirely. Instead, they’ll rely on fewer, highly reliable developers who can handle much more work with the help of AI. This creates a paradoxical situation: layoffs on one side, high demand on the other, but only for the right people.    If you come from a development background, the smartest move right now is simple:  * Become exceptional at using AI as a force multiplier. * Just knowing how to code won’t be enough anymore. That used to be the differentiator; now it’s table stakes.    **What matters now is:**  * Knowing how to think in systems * Translating vague requirements into clear specs * Using AI to generate, refactor, test, debug, and ship faster * Understanding architecture well enough to spot what AI gets wrong * Owning a specific niche deeply enough to solve high-value problems quickly    Companies won’t pay top dollar for someone who can “do everything moderately well.”  They will pay very well for someone who can fix a very specific, painful problem reliably.  And let’s be honest: saying “AI won’t replace humans” is already outdated. It has started replacing roles; not because AI is perfect, but because it’s good enough when paired with the right person.  If a non-technical person, like myself, someone who loves tech but never formally learned coding, can now build a full-fledged system using tools like ChatGPT and Replit, then the competitive bar has fundamentally shifted.  AI isn’t coming for jobs.   It’s coming for generic skill sets.    **So the choice is clear:**  * Either level up into a top-tier senior developer who designs systems, makes decisions, and leads execution * Or become a highly specialized mid-level developer with deep expertise in one niche and excellent AI leverage  Anything in between is the danger zone.  This isn’t a threat, it’s an opportunity.  But only for those who adapt early and intentionally.  Cheers!|||Lmao CRUD/landing page ta garihaalxa ni.

Focus on 1/2 core projects , refine them. As from the CV ig you are more into the agentic/applied AI stuffs that's currently booming, so focus on it rather than DS/ML if you want to enter the industry soon.

It looks a bit like academic practice. Swap 2 of them for something else (like Finance or E-commerce) to show you can handle different types of data. Flex that MLOps project: Move the ICU Deterioration one to the top! It’s your best flex because it mentions monitoring and drift (Prometheus/Grafana). That’s exactly what remote MLOps recruiters are looking for. Make Demos \"One-Click\": Make sure those [Demo] links go to a live site (Streamlit/Hugging Face). For remote jobs, if they can't see it working in 5 seconds, they might skip it.

After +2, I applied to Canada and the USA for further studies, but my visa got rejected. Instead of wasting a year, I joined BBS , and now I’m in my 3rd year.  When the visa didn’t work out, I decided to take responsibility for my own future. I started learning about AI, automation, and new technologies. Over time, I picked up practical skills, experimented a lot, and eventually started freelancing. Right now, I work as an AI Developer on Upwork, and even in the early stage, I’m earning more than 1 lakh NPR per month.  I’m not an expert and I still have a lot to learn but I know my strengths. I’m good at managing things, people, sales, content, and marketing, and I can execute fast. I have learned most of this by consuming real-world information online and applying it through actual work.  I have big plans in the AI space, but I also know that building something great alone is very difficult. That’s why I am looking for a technical co-founder, someone strong on the engineering side so we can build, learn, and grow together.  The idea is to:  * Start very small and lean * No heavy investment * Focus on AI services / automation / agency-style work * Only basic costs like hosting or APIs * Aim to generate revenue within 2–3 months  I currently live with my parents in Butwal, but I want to move to Kathmandu, take a small flat, and fully focus on building. I also plan to start creating content alongside the business.  I’m looking for someone who:  * Is disciplined and focused * Serious about long-term growth * Not into unhealthy habits * Wants a simple lifestyle with deep work * Has strong technical skills or is deeply committed to developing them  Most importantly, I want a co-founder who understands that things won’t always work. There will be hard times, failures, and uncertainty. During those phases, we should push and motivate each other, stay consistent, and keep moving forward. Even if something fails, we should come out smarter, stronger, and more experienced than before.  We don’t need much money to start just enough for basic living expenses. I have savings that allow me to manage accommodation and food for a long time, and I strongly believe we can make this sustainable within a few months.  The goal is simple:   Live together. Build together. Learn together. Grow together.  If you’re technically strong, disciplined, and serious about building a real AI business from Nepal, let’s connect.",

This has now gotten out of hand, and this type of behavior will surely spread to other tourist areas, especially those closer to the border like Sauraha and others. I have seen these 'tourists' in Thars and other SUVs riding recklessly on our highways, mocking our rules and laws. In my local area in the Terai, there have been a couple of incidents where such SUVs have hit locals, including traffic police, and fled to India.  Let's continue to do what we can from our end - I have reported the videos and his channel, and let's keep reporting those videos wherever we find them, and from any other Indian 'YouTubers'. Influencers from Pokhara need to raise their voices collectively on other popular social media channels like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Local influencers need to unite and raise this issue from their platforms in their individual capacities. Otherwise, we might be just one incident away from breaking news.  I will share this thread with a popular Indian YouTube journalist-The Deshbhakt. I have been following him, and he has made videos on such stupidity by Indian tourists. I will leave his Instagram link here so that everyone with evidence can share information.

RaSaPa ko ki Mutton Kaji Farm ko?|||Lol, honestly I didn’t even know he had uploaded something yesterday, but my post had perfect timing and it blew up. Even Bibek Thapaliya was hiding his affiliations, and KMAG still hides theirs. This guy just picked up that post and used it to make himself look good again.  I know how biased he is or maybe he doesn’t even realize how he got used. This is how Gagan operates. He invites these influencers, keeps them close, so they don’t post or make content against him. By doing these meetings, he slowly creates a soft corner in their mind and heart. So later, when Gagan messes up, they hesitate to criticize him because they’ve met him personally and think, “He’s a good guy.”  This is also how Gagan has managed to influence journalists across different media houses. Not all of them are in his inner circle, but he subtly shapes how they think. He invites them, talks to them, and slowly pushes the narratives he wants—who’s bad, what’s bad, and how to counter certain people.  The social media ban happened when Congress was in government, right? He won’t openly say, “Support me” or “Make things favor me,” but indirectly he keeps planting ideas like, I’m the only one who can fix this, and stuff like that.  This is a very familiar pattern with Gagan Thapa. First, influencers like these create noise online, and once it starts getting attention, he jumps in and talks about the issue as if he really cares. If he genuinely cared about social media, he could’ve spoken up against the social media ban when Congress was in power.  Even during the Gen Z protest, he subtly planted leaders like Tanuja and Rakshya Bam through his media outlet, Setopati. Their interviews were pushed again and again, filling the feed with news about what Rakshya and Tanuja were saying. Slowly, that turned into posts supporting Gagan Thapa. In the end, neutral and unaware people start feeling like, oh, Gagan is the hero we were looking for, just because these figures they follow are also backing him.  Ask him if he made any contents on Gagan Thapa?  \\-  Did he made video when Congress tried to sneak in a loophole in the cooling period? What happened to Khatiwada then after?  \\- Did he made how gagan thapa surviving without doing a single job?  \\- When Congress/UML tried to pass 5 years corruption expiry bill.  \\- Even to debunk PACT corruption where Gagan Thapa was alleged, even to debunk the allegation. (he wont, cz truth or not, many will know about this case and will have -ve perception of Gagan)  \\- Why is he surrounded and hangs out with Goons?  \\- Why WikiLeaks has Gagan Thapa as key embassy contact?  No, he won’t do that, because he’ll always have a soft corner for Gagan Thapa. That’s how Gagan Thapa works he spreads narratives through influencers like him, who knowingly or unknowingly end up producing such content.  Another example is Gagan doing small meetings on “populism” and then letting influencers create content around that topic to “spread awareness.” For influencers, it looks like he’s thinking about the nation. But from Gagan’s point of view, he knows those influencers will create content that ends up being subtly targeted at new faces.  https://preview.redd.it/x4nqjclj1veg1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=5303b0b09e8b772195bbc2a80116bd3b9f25bdb5|||RONB le tetro Balen ko chusekai chusai cha ta 3 4 barsa bata yo vanda badi jholagiri ta kai dekhechaina kunai media le koi lai gareko.

Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

Without intervention, boys with DMD lose the ability to walk by their early teens, and many don’t survive past their 20s.  But, there is a ray of hope: A one-time **Gene Therapy (Elevidys)** that can stop this progression. But the cost is a staggering **$2.9 Million USD**.

This therapy is most effective the earlier it is given. We are racing against time and biological markers that could disqualify him if we wait too long.

DMD is heartbreaking, and I genuinely hope he gets the care he needs 🙏  Just sharing information for awareness (not to diminish the importance of Elevidys): there are FDA-approved medications available for DMD today that can slow progression and improve outcomes, depending on the child’s mutation and age. These include corticosteroids (like deflazacort or vamorolone), exon-skipping therapies (for specific mutations), and non-steroidal options like givinostat, in addition to gene therapy.  Of course, treatment choice depends on genetic testing, eligibility criteria, and specialist guidance, and early intervention is critical, which I understand is why Elevidys is being pursued.  Posting this only so families reading this thread know there are multiple therapeutic pathways worth discussing with a neuromuscular specialist. Wishing Liam strength, access, and support and hoping this campaign reaches the right hands. 🤍|||.|||I’m so sorry your family is going through this. Liam is lucky to have people fighting this hard for him. 💛    Huge respect for how transparent you’re being with records + receipts! That matters a lot when people want to help. And yes, thank you Elevidys (and the teams behind it) for giving families a real shot at hope.    Boosting this: if you can’t donate, please share. Even one repost can reach the right person/community. Wishing Liam and your whole family strength + a miracle-fast finish line. 🙏🧡|||I am sorry, baby. He is so cute.

Communism is really stupid if you look back at humanity now.|||This should be categorised as fictional book|||some deep shit ! ... op is not asking for superficial answer|||Technically, yes, he wrote the manual. But, Marx was a man who saw a disease but prescribed a medicine that was more toxic than the sickness. He wanted to fix the world by changing who owns the \"stuff\" without changing the \"human being\" who uses the stuff.  ​When you try to enforce \"equality\" through a state, you don't get a paradise; you get a prison. This is why Marxism has failed wherever it was tried as a rigid political tool.  ​Why \"Harkabad\" is the Antidote TODAY:  ​The reason we look toward a philosophy like Harkabad (Prakriti, Samskriti, Pravidhi) instead of Marxism or Western Capitalism is because it addresses the foundation, not just the \"economics.\" Harka Smapang has time and again said it has nothing to do with his name. He is suggesting a solution that isn't a western copy but suitable to the soil we stand on.   ​Marxism says: \"Who owns the factory?\" ​Capitalism says: \"How much can the factory produce?\" ​Harkabad says: \"Do we even need the factory if it kills the river (Prakriti) and destroys the community's soul (Samskriti)?\"  If you ask me if we need \"Harkabad,\" I would say we need Consciousness.  ​Harka Sampang is essentially bringing consciousness to governance. When he goes out and carries stones with his own hands (Shramadaan), he is moving from the \"ugly\" socialism (taking from others) to the \"wonderful\" socialism (giving of oneself).  ​We don't need a \"Communist\" revolution where blood is spilled to change the law. We need a \"Harkabad\" style evolution where sweat is spilled to restore the land. ​You don't need a book from 19th-century Germany to tell you how to live. You just need to look at the earth beneath your feet and the people around you.",

The feeling of my heart having faster and my stomach twisting like an eel holding it's prey is not new to me but still it's not wholly mine.   The feeling of lying in the bed with inherent thoughts of disperse happiness and the want to be able to understand if that happiness is as true as it seems is not new and it's also not wholly mine   I look at all these motion picture hoping to find something. And what that might be is as ananomus to me as it is to you. I look at these things, listen as they talk, but the existence of this feeling of watching doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm lying on this virgin earth, unmolested and untouched, devoid of any feeling of any sort except for one; consciousness. The consciousness reigns supreme within and without all within the vicinity of my existence.  At this point, life as you call it feels not a moments passing by or time flowing like my thoughts.  My head feels particularly heavy, as if I'm thinking but a thought is yet to process. But how can this be? Without a thought, how can you think? How can one live, without knowing the value of death? But that's not right either. For one to know the value of death,.one must first know of its qualities, it's feature in all it's dimensions. The inherent idea of a thought being, and to think not sounds stupid as if not funny enough. But you can't overlook the idea behind such ponder.   I take very long breaths as I think. My heart beats loud enough for me to hear it. And all my bodily functions seems very much obvious to me. This isn't new but it's not wholly mine.   Ahh now my head hurts a little to. But this shall too pass.   Theres this lingering feeling of solitude that I feel very sensationally. For solitude has been my friend far longer then any. The silence that made me feel alone after some years felt not pleasing but good enough to make me feel a bit stingy if it got disturbed.  But now this solitude engulfs me, strangles me so that I choke these thoughts out of me which are yet to be. But it was this very solitude that made me form a thought but now it want it back. Like how death waits right Infront of you, lingers above you with it's hands around neck, and then takes you through the stairs of lifelessness while you climb oblivious. Similar is the solitude that I experience right now, but instead of lifelessness, I climb and climb but towards nothing, I climb and climb but climb on empty thoughts.   My agitated muscles ache in the silence of my breath while my breath gets shorter and heavier each micro instant.",

We’re just a group of peers showing up and leading where we can. This reel captures some of the curiosity we saw that day—it’s a small start, but a meaningful one.
