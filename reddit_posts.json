Our budget is around ₹12–14k per person (19,000–22,000 NPR) Is it realistically possible to do any of these within that budget?

            "comments": "Very tight budget. Maybe pokhara but I guess it'll be a very very budget travel and very basic|||With ₹12–14k per person you’ll need to be selective. Pokhara and Ilam are realistic in that range. ABC is possible but tight. Mustang depends which Mustang you mean. Lower Mustang can work on a budget. Upper Mustang won’t, because the restricted area permit alone is USD 500 per person.  For ABC, if you go budget style, use buses instead of flights, and stay in basic teahouses, you’re usually looking somewhere around 18–25k NPR per person depending on how many days you take and how much you spend on food. It can be done near your upper limit, but there isn’t much buffer for delays or extra days.  Planning yourself will always be cheaper than booking from India. If you decide to use an agency, booking locally in Pokhara or Kathmandu is usually more flexible and negotiable than online packages.  A lot of people underestimate transport to the trailhead, extra meals at altitude, charging, hot showers, and an extra acclimatization day if needed. Those small things add up.  If you’re looking for the strongest mountain experience within budget, ABC or even Mardi Himal makes more sense than Mustang.  Are you thinking full trek experience, or more of a base location with short hikes?",

We’re looking for careful, detail-oriented annotators based in Nepal. **We have a rush job to do by Friday, so we're looking for people as soon as possible.**  **What the work involves**  You’ll be given short videos (typically 3–5 minutes). Your task is to convert each video into a structured, timestamped SOP that captures every distinct hand movement.  This is precision work. It’s not basic captioning or summarizing.  For each video, you will:  1. Write a short overview (2–3 sentences). We usually provide an AI-generated draft. Your job is to verify and correct it. 2. Create step-by-step annotations.  * Target: 40–60 steps per minute. * Each step must represent one clear hand movement. * Each step must include start and end timestamps (accurate to 0.01 seconds).  Every description must follow this structure:  **Hand + Action + Object + Location**  Example:   “Right hand places the blue basket on stainless steel table.”  **Granularity example**  If someone grabs a tape roll and puts it in a box:  Correct:  * Right hand grabs the tape roll from right side of table. * Right hand places the tape roll inside the cardboard box.  Too detailed:  * Right hand reaches toward tape roll. * Right hand grabs tape roll. * Right hand moves tape roll. * Right hand places tape roll in box.  We want atomic but meaningful actions — not micro-movements, and not combined actions.  **Quality standards**  * No overlapping timestamps * No combining multiple actions in one step * No references like “then,” “repeat,” “again,” etc. * Consistent terminology (e.g., always “digital scale,” not sometimes “scale”) * Clean grammar  Accuracy expectation is above 95%.  You may have up to three videos assigned at a time. Deadlines are typically 24–48 hours depending on length.  **Who this is suited for**  * Engineering or medical students * People with manufacturing or lab exposure * Anyone comfortable with structured documentation * Detail-oriented individuals who can work independently  If you’ve ever written SOPs or enjoy breaking down processes step by step, this will suit you.  **Compensation**  Paid per video. Rates will be discussed after a short screening test. Strong performers will get consistent ongoing work.  **If interested, please DM me with:**  * Your background (Resume/CV is preferrable) * Your field of study or work * Approximate availability per week * Why you think you’d be a good fit  We’ll send a small test task to shortlisted applicants.  Serious applicants only — this requires focus and consistency.",

In this age of tech, pads are backwards - think about how much microplastic you are contributing - know that the plastics come back to your food. (Taking this tone because of commenters saying kapda is backwards)  Period panties don't let anything spill through the night -- even if I sleep on my back. The one I use for nights is boxer briefs from PeriodAisle. I switched 4 years ago because I was so tired of getting anxious during those nights, I was so so tired. I wash the chunky parts away right when I change and let the washer do the rest of the cleaning on delicate cycle - then I hang dry them. I have like 8 of them, enough for one complete cycle.  Try cups and discs. Tampons are riskier so I wouldn't recommend except for swimming while on period.  If you must use pads please use cotton pads wtihout perfume or bleach.  I get cramps when I don't eat well. Otherwise I don't. I don't take meds when it hurts too much (sometimes it happens), I just take the day off.

            "body": "It depends, but I say a big no.  Even though the company is US-based, the process is typically Nepali, which means if you want to get a promotion in salary and title, you don’t need skills - you just need to pursue your manager’s foot and lick.  The initial offer salary seems good, but after working for a year, you will realize why your salary is this low. And if fairness and equal opportunity matter to you, then do not join - the selection process there is completely biased and based on personal preferences rather than **merit**. This may be the only boring company in the world where around \\~30% of the people are managers, and most of them do not deserve to be managers - they can't communicate properly in English, though a rare few are knowledgeable.  The company doesn't focus on employee training except for company policy training. It seems the company mostly focuses on quantity rather than quality. The IT service is good-they provide good devices and support you as well- but to get that, you have to lick your manager’s foot again.  New technology adoption is not at that level in Cedargate, and they prefer to use mostly free products. If you prefer WFH, then don’t worry-even if HR says one thing, you can get it, but again, just lick your manager’s foot.      The company was good during the Deerwalk time.  **So, if you want to learn and do something in your life, don’t join Cedargate - you will be frustrated. But if you just wanna chill, join there.**",

Please keep in mind, you might have to add 2-4 more videos in addition to this 24, if required.

But if you want a complex web app with interconnected logic, validations, state management, caching and everything, those are the areas where AI is still with lots of flaws.  This is not to discourage you from learning, but to leverage AI to learn faster and quicker.|||You should focus on creative frontend and overall knowledge on how frontend is built and works and you can learn coding too or use ai for codes if you learn enough to fix the broken codes|||you should really look into AI native roles. the industry is moving past traditional machine learning and honestly everyone is doing frontend and backend these days |||Keep doing if you like it|||I heard this from a guy in instagram,   \"**Yes, You can see the pictures of mountains, museum, rivers in your mobile phone.

Not exactly this sentence, but somewhere around this.  And i think this goes for every art form out there. Yes, AI can do coding for you, and it may even do a better job than you.

Humans are still easier to train and teach than these LLMs. Once they are past their context window limit, you have to feed things again and again.|||Yes, especially if you enjoy design. Frontend isn’t going away in the AI era; if anything, good UI/UX + frontend skills are more valuable because someone still has to turn ideas into usable products.

My goal is to make the billing process seamless by integrating **Dynamic QR codes** (the ones where the amount is already set, so the customer doesn't have to type it).  I’ve seen many restaurants already using this, but I have a few technical questions for the devs or business owners here who have experience with this:  1. **API Keys:** To enable Dynamic QR generation within my software, do I need a separate API key for **every single merchant** (shopkeeper), or is there a way to do it through a single integrator key? 2. **The Integration Process:** How does the communication work? Does my POS talk directly to Fonepay's servers to get the QR string, or is it handled through the merchant's bank?  Maile socheko chai, merchant le aafno unique Secret Key mero POS setup ma halne, ani billing hune bitikai mero software le dynamic string generate garne. Is this the right way to scale to 100s of shops?

            "comments": "you definitely need merchant-wise API keys. Each shop gets its own Merchant ID and Secret Key from their acquiring bank, so your POS should have a settings page where they enter these once. Your software then talks directly to Fonepay’s API to request a dynamic string, which you’ll convert into a QR code on-screen. To ensure a smooth checkout, you’ll typically need to poll their verification API every few seconds until the payment is confirmed before printing the final bill",

There was this girl in 10th grade. She wasn’t that model pretty but she was pretty enough.  We started talking randomly and then I just fell for her, she later was so special to me I still can’t fathom that. We’re still friends even after 3 years, we still talk occasionally, it was beautiful. It was just so beautiful. We never dated but I still think of those moments we used to talk. She’s got a boyfriend now but yeah I feel happy for her.|||Looks makes  you noticeable personality make you respectful and lovable. Every person have different threshold for looks and personality.|||Ok personally I know some of girls ( friends ) , I go backdate when I first met them to remember how Pretty are they at first look , i can’t rate them now or say it but for your sake not even average looking but now I feel like they are the angels by nature - for me it was not looks it’s personality, he or she the beauty will get bored some day I guess but beautiful nature won’t, like we experience our parents love , just need a good companion that’s it it not has to be good looking companion  ( this is my opinion, my perspective can be wrong but I trust this)|||earlier i used to think of myself as someone who falls mostly for looks but i have started to realize that i give much more preference to the nature not personality necessarily, but the inherent nature of her soul.   but she should be atleast decent looking.....but tbh i am finding hard time to find such girl.....maybe cause i am not so outgoing and extroverted",

Record anusar, statue was commissioned by Vishugupta of the gupta dynasty (son of the more famous Jisnugupta) tyeti bela Lichhavi dynasty was like a vassal state to the gupta dynasty. Ani bishnugupta Kathmandu airaney belama yo statue commission gareko. Made from nagdhunga (basal stone).  Yo statue chai harako thiyo (puriyeko) maybe due to lack of maintenance, earthquake who knows.   Malla raja ko palama euta kisan ley khanney belama bhettayo yo murti feri. Legend was that he hit the statue's toe and blood gushed out. Tyeti bela, for myriad of reason, it was named budhanilkantha. Probably because theological literacy wasn't high/ maybe the farmer was more of shiva bhakta. Maybe the coutnry was in the shiva bhakta phase as later royal families have been heavy shiva bhaktas.   Until later, when people recognized, ahh you bishnu ho siva hoina it's name was already 'sealed' as budhanilkantha, including the name for the area. Hence it's called budhanilkantha ani narayanthan.   |||Aww man I stole so much money  and fruits from this temple  When I was homeless.|||It is believed that a mirror image of Lord Shiva can be seen on the underside of the statue, which is surrounded by water from Gosainkunda (a lake created by Shiva).|||TLDR; Honestly, it’s Narayan (Vishnu), but you’d be surprised how often people get confused and wonder if it’s actually Buddha instead of Shiva.  From what I’ve read, the evidence leans much more toward it being a Narayana site. Budhanilakantha is one of only three Jalashayana Narayana (Vishnu sleeping on the cosmic waters) in Kathmandu Valley as far as I know. The other two are at Balaju (erected by the same patron king AFAIK)  and inside Hanuman Dhoka Palace, though that one was added much later by Pratap Malla.  Some old chronicles say that King Haridutta, around 350 A.D., built Budhanilakantha and also set up four other Narayana temples at the four corners of the Kathmandu Valley. That’s Changu, Bishankhu, Ichangu, and Shesh Narayan. Even today, people try to visit all four in one day, which is basically like doing a Narayan dham within valley. And very surprisingly, if you add Budhanilkantha (as fifth point) into the map it forms the legendary \"Khadga\" shape which is described to be the shape of ancient Kathmandu Town Planning. More so, these Narayana Shrines are located cardinally to each other which makes it much cooler (I cant infer much more from it than that lol). Here is the image for y'all to see: [https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0](https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0)  There’s also this story that King Haridutta saw Jalashayana Narayana in a dream, telling him to dig up the original image buried under the Rudramati riverbed. So he built a pond and installed the sculpture there, along with the four corner temples. This is confusing because , other historical analyses and inscriptions suggest the image was consecrated by ruler Visnugupta around 5th century A.D, much later than Haridutta.  The statue itself is amazing. It’s the largest stone sculpture in the Kathmandu Valley, carved from a single block of dark granite. Some stories say they dragged it across the Valley with forced labor, but some scholars argue the granite was actually nearby in the Shivapuri hills, which makes more sense (in some article by Sudarshan Raj  Tiwari, I am not sure). So I dont know which one is more valid, this or the claim mentioned by u/ZoWakaki above me.  Now, the most interesting part is that Buddhists also worship this image as Nilakantha Lokesvara, a form of Avalokitesvara. Avalokiteshvara is considered to be a form of Shiva in Buddhism or vise-a-versa, which can be one way where the Shiva/Vishnu connection in Budhanilkantha comes in place. In fact, if you look closely, you can almost see the Buddha’s forehead in the face of the sleeping Vishnu. Even the long ears of the statue are very reminiscent of Buddhist iconography we see around the valley.  As for the name Budhanilakantha, there’s a story about Shiva drinking poison during the Samudra Manthan. His throat was burning, so he struck the mountain with his trishul and created Gosaikunda Lake. The water from that lake is said to flow down to the pond at Budhanilakantha, and since Shiva’s called Nilakantha, that might be how the place got its name.

It’s obviously not a native word, and even its English meaning (“final”) has nothing to do with how we use it. And yet it’s everywhere now, especially in urban Nepali.  So I’ve been wondering:  * How did **“last”** end up meaning *“extremely”* or *“intensely”* in Nepali instead of *“final”*? * Why did Nepali pick up this English word when we already had intensifiers like **धेरै, एकदमै, निकै, अति**? * Is **“lastai”** more about borrowing *vibe / tone* rather than literal meaning? * Do other languages (especially multilingual or post-colonial ones) have words like this  ones that make zero etymological sense but still work perfectly in everyday speech? * And why do you think this kind of shift happened **specifically in Nepal**, and mostly in recent decades?

I look at those big houses inside the ring road and think — what did their ancestors do differently? How did they manage to secure land in the most valuable parts of Kathmandu? Today those properties are worth crores, and the people who own them seem to have such a huge head start in life. Was it political connections? Business foresight? Old money from Rana times? Just luck and timing when land was cheap? Or were they simply more ambitious and risk-taking than the average family? Meanwhile, many of us are just trying to survive — paying rent, sending money home, saving slowly, feeling like we’re always starting from zero. Sometimes it feels like no matter how hard we work, generational wealth is on a completely different level. I don’t hate anyone for it. I’m just genuinely curious — how does that level of wealth and power actually get built in Nepal? And realistically, is it even possible for someone without that background to catch up?

I have seen people living in Baluwatar in surprisingly low quality buildings and living standards. Conversely, I have seen others become wealthy in just a few years, one person in particular grew so rich from hydropower shares that had previously left him desperate because they hadn't yielded results for years. He overnight turned his hut like house to a palace like building in same place.  ​Many factors contribute to these different head starts. While \"money attracts money\", United States becoming wealthy wasn't just about the valuable land they acquired centuries ago, we have seen many historically valuable lands sitting in ruins even today. The primary drivers of the early US economy were linked to Europe's colonial past, which extracted, looted and exploited wealth from around the world, especially India and Africa. Those wealthy individuals brought that capital and their slaves on early ships to the USA.  ​Furthermore, those who work for others may never accumulate as much wealth as those who innovate. Many residents in Baluwatar and other posh areas of Kathmandu today are not just the \"old money\" elite, but innovators who started only a decade or two ago.

In Nepal, Kathmandu traffic police already use ANPR for hit-and-runs, expandable to Pokhara for real-time alerts and fines targeting high-violation zones near tourist spots like Lakeside. Predictive models from vehicle trajectories can map hotspots, informing patrols or barriers during peak Indian tourist influx.  # Sanitation Monitoring  AI-powered video analytics on existing public cameras can detect public defecation or littering in real-time, classifying events by actor (pedestrian/vehicle) with models like MoViNet or deep learning for behavior recognition, capturing plates or faces for enforcement. Similar systems in India (e.g., Varanasi CCTV for litter) reduced complaints by 15%, adaptable to Pokhara's Lakeside where complaints about Indian tourists' littering and urination are common. Integrate with 311-style apps for citizen reports, using geospatial clustering to prioritize public toilet builds and attendants, as proven effective in San Francisco.  # Civic Sense Campaigns  Analyze geotagged social media (e.g., Instagram posts from Indian tourists) and complaint data with NLP and clustering to identify patterns in low civic behavior, informing targeted awareness via ads or signage in Hindi/English. Tourist flow analytics from mobility data can predict high-risk periods, optimizing signage and fines at hotspots, boosting compliance as seen in Nepal's open defecation campaigns. Dashboards for authorities track ROI, like violation reductions post-intervention.|||Make connections, try to get projects and contracts.

But those people rarely watch any Nepali football games because we don't win.|||Because its the only thing that gives happiness and sense of patriotism to us Nepalese people.|||it is because of passion in both players and the supporters. so many of the previous generation players are in the cricket field. eg. paras khadka is the secretary of the CAN, binod das is the cricket manager, shakti gauchan is one of the former player who is grooming young cricketers in his locality, former players are busy in running cricket academies or coaching in the academies, and the list goes on. yes, many former players have went abroad to look for better future but they are also supporting nepal cricket whenever possible (co-owning various franchise leagues, arranging minor leagues in different parts of the globe).  football is really popular in nepal same like it is in all around the world. only issue with football nowadays is that it is runned and administered by very corrupted officials. they have no interest in developing and decentralizing football. their sole focus is gaining socio-financial benefits while being in the ANFA. i am very hopeful if we get football version of paras khadka in anfa, things will get better sooner than later.  |||Cricket was not that much popular back then it was after Nepal qualified to t20 world cup in 2014  it became mainstream.|||If the game had happened in Delhi, you’d have seen real number of Nepali people attending, Mumbai is just tad difficult to get to from Nepal.|||nepali team win games. qualify for tournaments unlike other sports. sandeep playing in ipl. a competent board plus npl.|||I started watching cricket cause of my brothers and wonder the same|||In late 80s and early 90s, at least in Kathmandu, cricket was not very popular. It was football and you would see that play out in Tundikhel, 365 days a year.  After Ganesh Thapa took the helm of the ANFA, football started going downhill despite $$$$ budget thanks to the systemic corruption, giagantic $$$$ embezzlement, dadagiri/ gundagardi and match fixing.  The increasing popularily of cricket coincides  with the gradual demise of Nepali football.  So the star player in my book is Ganesh Thapa!|||Basically first most of our Neighbours play it so we came to know about it and start playing it, second we started playing better, third T20 and IPL happened.|||Sandeep lamichhane k hora, he was globally recognised 23yo age ma record Banako haina ra tesle?|||[deleted]",

Game is just Sandeep, Airee and pray.|||I have watched most of nepal’s match full, lets be realistic we don’t have technically sound players except Sandeep. We lack in all areas Tactics, Techinque, match awarness.

That's my only explanation.|||The expectations of the public is amazing. The team is still in its infancy, let cricket develop in the country and with that, the players will.   Im still proud of what this team achieved against england and shows how much better we have gotten.|||we were gashlighting them we dont have that much technical player, no player can hit sixes except few for the slower ball. look the italian player moving on crease against the spin its so good to see their technical abilities,now they are going to register the first win.hamrw fanbase dherai cha tei vayera gashlight garya lagcha k malai sometime ,we do lack skills ,we dont have power hitters|||Lack of exposure .    Also dal bhat power getting exposed |||Nepali team was never that good and Nepali cricket is overrated. we got lucky against England but still couldn't win. this was our bad day and we got punished. Italy did the same thing to UAE l a week ago. a team on par with Nepa btw. so, don't underestimate Italy they are a good side. both Italy and Nepal are decent associate sides. they played good today but we didn't.  here is how I see things. in T20 luck matters a lot. and if we look at the last 20-30 matches of Nepal. we won by very small margin. we never saw one Nepali player dominating with impressive performance. it's always. a few different players getting lucky. them scoring 20-30 runs each or some lucky bowling. and then getting enough to win by a lil margin. that shows to me that our players lack star talent. if we look at our results in longer formats like ODI.  where skills matter more, we suck even more.  I personally haven't bought our bowling is really great story either for a while now. our only decent bowler (by world cup standard) we have is Sandeep, everyone else is meh. I mean, we can't bowl fast bowls faster than 130s. Nandan is the only noticeable seamer, and he has a problem with accuracy with meh speeds. all other bowlers are meh in my eyes. I think airee can stay cool headed tho. people say we have good spinners. but if we look at the turns we get, out bowlers get less turn than other teams. and our spinners are slower as well. we have managed to do well sometimes with bowling against weaker sides. but with strong teams. we haven't shown the ability to be able to put pressure on the other team and they have destroyed us without losing a wicket more than once.  plus, I think our team lack good tactical understanding as well. I always see them making so many mistakes. like bruh why send karan to bowl in the end and not airee against england. or in the lokesh not trying to move around and try different shot. when curran threw all the bowls the same way.  I mean I am not someone who understands cricket that well. but to me it looked like today. our batsmen were confident and tried to play sixers. instead of our regular strength of running between the wickets and fours. and they didn't have enough skill and power for good placement or to clear the boundary. couple that with good italian strategy and fielder placements. and it was just bad day for out bowlers. funny how literally every shot was caught today, straight into the fielder's hand. it was goofy ash 😭|||Was hainw is|||Nepal has been playing same like this since day 1, just few miracles happens or then else we keep on playing in same form since Parash Khadka days.

Not even a single player has performed consistently for a straight five games. We as a Nepali Fans have made Nepali Cricket and Nepali Cricket Players GOD like. Our criticism is childlike. We praise or criticize for just one game.   It’s a game but losing to Italy without taking any wicket shows our determination in the field. Looking at the past matches, approach to the game after a big hyped loss, we have underperformed. We accepted the loss with Italy right after our first inning, way before the first ball of second inning.   Our cricket has lost stories of passion in game after Paras Khadka Era.|||let's switch back to politics to get over with this humiliation.   k bhanney, kta haru le hagey ra aye yaar.|||Nepali players aren’t mature enough and not physically strong.

If the test is positive then You can visit any hospital that has an Gynecology and Obstetrics Department. Or you can visit a Marie Stopes clinic near your. They provide abortion services and are experienced in handling these situations. you can probably get either a medical or surgical abortion. They might do an ultrasound to better determine the exact date. Medical abortion includes taking a pill or two and is usually an easier option. Surgical abortion is also a relatively minor procedure but it usually requires you to be admitted. Both of them are very safe when supervised by an experienced medical practitioner but like everything else, it also has risks. I would advice you to have a trusted friend with you during the process (doesn't need to be the guy as your consent is all that is needed for the procedure).|||Consult Marie stopes.

If you are not comfortable with going to the marrie stops center then seek help from the doctor ( medical officer/ gynaecologist) in private  hospital she/ he will examine and also recommend usg . And then according to the age of the fetus and the mother's health condition you will recommend medical termination or MVA or curettage. Do not take over the counter MTP drug as if the fetus is still in the tube,  it can cause rupture and that's a surgical emergency.|||Go get it checked out at your nearest (or farthest) marie stopes. I had been to the one in putalisadak.       Also, for your peace of mind, 4 days late is not too late and kits can be false too. Test a few times using kits from different brands. First morning pee is best.   And pretty sure this early stage ma if positive for sure, medication will work.|||Hi. Medical professional here. First and foremost do a urine pregnancy test. Use at least 2 different tests. Early morning mid stream urine is the best sample your partner can get. Since it’s been a month - your test results should be accurate ( read the instructions on the wrapper- if she’s pregnant ,2 lines should appear marked below C and T ) After that visit your nearest OBGYN doctor/clinic. Government hospitals and clinics are optional too. Marie Stopes is also a choice. It is very important you go to a professional and not just a pharmacy. An Ultrasonography ( USG ) - nepali ma video xray vancha - is a must which your doctor will recommend. It’s necessary to figure out where the fetus is implanted in your partner’s body or if it is an actual embryo as opposed to something else ( i.e - molar pregnancy ). If everything is as expected in the USG - you will be given an option for medical abortion or surgical ( D & C ) . They both have their pros and cons but a medical abortion ( taking pills ) would be relatively easier for your partner. After being prescribed, take the pills exactly as instructed and be by your partners side for a whole 24-48 hours. The physical pain and bleeding will be intense. She will require alot of re-assurance, support and rest. Fluids, hot water bags, pillows - things that will help her during this time. It might be tough on her mentally and emotionally as well. Your role as her man is important here. Be there for her every step of the way. Once the abortion is over ( she may feel like she passed a huge clot ) , the next step is to go for a follow up as the doctor has recommended. This is usually after 7 days. A USG will be required again to see if the products of conception have all been flushed out. Once again do NOT skip this step, it is very necessary for if the pills for some reason did not work as expected, a host of complications can happen. If the second USG report also shows up clear as intended-  pregnancy has been terminated.  Now , She will bleed for quite sometime after this as well ( approx 2 weeks after taking the pill ) it could go longer than that. If the bleeding is too long and too intense, go back for a checkup. If there’s any severe abdominal pain even after the abortion or fever, shivering, dizziness, feeling faint, severe nausea vomiting etc. during this process go to the ER immediately. Very important. Also Do not hesitate to ask your doctor during any visit , anything that you are unsure or unaware of and never feel ashamed or uncomfortable in your decision. I have not elaborated on other possibilities like an ectopic/ molar pregnancy as if thats the case then its best to hear it from your consulting physician and follow their advice. What i’ve explained above is what you could expect if your partner has a normal pregnancy and medical abortion so that you are re-assured about the whole experience. My best wishes to you both . Good luck|||Don't panic. First do urine test, it will give you 100% accurate result.|||Baau vayexau ta congrats 🎊🎉 yrr badhai ho badhai|||First confirm pregnancy ho ki nai vanera, sometimes faint line false positive ni huncha.

I can understand bringing a surprise for children or parents, but the expectation of gifts for everyone is ridiculous.   I had a scenario a few years ago where my brother is from Nepal and my SIL is from India. Bro and SIL were living in Delhi. Parents would travel to the US regularly to see my family and often spend a day or two in Delhi on there way to the US to see family. Always bringing gifts, no matter how tedious or common the visits were. One time my wife was about to give birth, so they jumped on a flight to the US to be with us. The had a 3 hour layover in Delhi, so they grabbed lunch with brother and SIL before their flight to the US. (Remember this is last minute, trying to rush to the USA to help). They didn’t bring my sister in law a formal present (that had been married for 8years) at the quick meeting between flight.  My SIL went home and threw a big fit about her not getting a gift and how disrespectful they were. She locked herself in her room pretended to cry for days.   Am I crazy for thinking my SIL was rude. Or, were my in-laws out of line for not bringing a gift in an emergency situation?  Edit: SIL’a family is well off and she has always been “spoiled”  Edit: My in-laws feel extremely guilty 10 years later for not breaking aging a gift on an emergency trip.  Edit: Spoiled SIL wouldn’t speak to family for almost 2 years after this.  🤦🏻‍♂️|||Even if you can afford it, bringing gifts to 50+ people is excessive. Be selective. Give to those who are actually adding value to your life and your family’s life. If they are being funny about it, you will see who is actually there for you, not for what you bring.  I used to be quite generous, would fly back with a suitcase full of bits and bobs for all my extended relatives.

The students and genz are big in number in big parties there.

Even though there has been some forms of violence on minorities since Hasina fled, most of them were crimes that had nothing to do with religious hatred. The interim govt had established a fact-check wing that continuously analyses this cases and provides evidences in support. We have largely been living really freely and the last 1.5 years has been the golden age for free speech and political debate for this country since our independence.  Now where do these news then come from? India. Indian BJP bots obviously benefit by ruining Bangladesh's secular image to the international world so they get leverage to interfere with Bangladesh's politics. The fact-check wing continuously analyzed these fake cases talked about by India media for the last 1.5 years.

Right now they are a centrist party. Although how they play out in the actual reality is yet to be seen, hindu population in this country voted for BNP by huge margins, BNP has \"tried\" to show itself as the leftist even recognizing atheists that previous govts never did to get the minority votes and this got them the historic win.  NCP is the party that the youth are most hopeful about. They got 5 key seats but in a country of that big of a population you need more than a year to get a huge fanbase.

There were multiple casualties in that incident including killing of a toddler. The killing of policemen there with such brutality was unimaginable.  Everyone was unequivocally against what happened, multiple charges were pressed and people have been convicted with serious consequences. All of us, agreed that a political movement somehow got violent and resulted in unimaginable tragedy. We all agreed they needed to be put to justice.  Chait 15 was not even a protest, it was supposed to be a public gathering, a power show of some kind. It was led by Durge \"Mahisasur\" Parsai. Most people here were against his movement, including the media. They stoned a building and burned it. A journalist tragically lost life and the government \"murdered\" somebody in the street. They vandalized Bhatbhoteni and incurred significant loss. We were vehemently against Durge for what happened. The voice against the government murder was \"muted\" and people tended to take side of government, because the protesters (by that time) had been rowdy. All of were unequivocally against Durge. Balen attributed Gynndra for moral responsibility for the protest and fined him.  Now the Bhadra 23 protest, all of us \"supported\" the protest against corruption. Khadge Oli probably thought he would do exactly same as the Chaitra 15 protest and underestimated the potest. It went violent after it broke the barricade. The government caused unimaginable tragedy. 19 protesters \"murdered\" withing few hours is unimaginable in a democracy. We again unequivocally held the government, Khadge Oli responsible for the murders.  What heppened next day is also unprecedented and unimaginable. I fear, if I say it was wrong, then I may be painted as taking the side of government and not of the protesters. Its a false dichotomy. But lets face it, what happened in 24th was wrong.  In all of these above, the people involved in either sides were Nepali. We are responsible for all of the above on either sides. Blaming one or the other, saying घुषपैठ or foreign forces, winning election and putting Bhauju behind bar is not going to fix it. There is only one way to fix it. Education. It takes at least 10 years for education improvement to take effect. And ain't nobody gonna win election by saying \"I will improve education\".",

Peaceful protests are a facade that exist to maintain the status quo. Every revolutionary act in history has had a degree of violence involved and ours was no different. Morality is beyond good and evil.   Edit: I too agree that universal education is necessary in our population. But, equating education it with non violence is a nonsensical argument.|||Agreed. Its education that we are lacking. Zero sense of community, Afulai matra vaye pugxa hune, aruko khedo khanne etc etc. Always blaming the government, its ironic. But again the education we get boils down to being political too. The education we are given is laughable. its like People in power keeps wanting us dumb to keep taking advantage. Such a dumb cycle. :”)|||[deleted]|||New to the country but was here during the protests. Education is def one of the keys and you are right it will take a decade for it to take effect, probably a generation for it to yield results. Having said that education is a lever of uplifting oneself from their current socio economic status and until there is a way for people to satisfy that need in Nepal (jobs and the like) imo more education will just get brain drained out.  Loved the point you are making BUT would love it if you could expand on it. Ie like what portions of education in Nepal do you think would need to be adjusted (unified teaching topics on a specific subject, reforming the countries education system, etc)? I get there are many other factors to consider when it comes to sociopolitical upheavals but how do you think education will take a part in fixing it? I am assuming you were educated in Nepal so insight into your experience would be amazing!|||Saw your other post, why was it removed lol|||Yes|||Short answer - Yes ,    Long answer - A long long yes |||Education is one of it- yes, education will solve everything-no. Things like civic sense, public empathy, ethics, and etiquette is another aspect of an ideal society, which is even harder to achieve, and takes longer than just hitting the literary rate benchmark.",

Do you think **child trafficking from orphanages in Nepal** could really have happened?   If it did happen, is it possible that **powerful politicians** were involved?

            "body": "Sharing an update on NARADA, an intelligence platform I have been building that aggregates publicly available government data across Nepal into one analytical system. A lot has changed since my last post, so here is what is new.  \\*\\*Geospatial Damage Analysis:\\*\\*  The platform now runs spatial analysis using Sentinel-1 (SAR radar) and Sentinel-2 (optical) satellite imagery. It works by comparing pre-event and post-event radar reflections using pixel-wise t-tests to detect structural damage to buildings, even through cloud cover. The system classifies damage zones by severity (Critical, Severe, Moderate, Minor) with 95% confidence scores. This can be applied to natural disasters, civil unrest, or any event where infrastructure damage needs rapid assessment without people on the ground.  \\*\\*Corporate Intelligence:\\*\\*  Every registered company in Nepal (341,801 as of now) has been scraped from CAMIS (Company and Industry Registration System). Each company record includes registration date, type, district, and directors. To detect hidden links between companies, I extract phone numbers from registrations, hash them using HMAC-SHA256 for privacy, and then cluster matches. This found 6,388 phone clusters linking 14,613 companies, meaning thousands of seemingly separate companies share contact information.  Government contract data from 2020 to present has also been scraped. This gets cross-referenced with company records to flag anomalies like a single entity receiving disproportionate contract awards, or newly registered companies winning large tenders.  One concrete finding: a single phone number cluster linked to 51 companies, all registered as agricultural firms. The pattern is consistent with shell companies created to exploit agricultural tax exemptions.  \\*\\*Trade Intelligence\\*\\*  Customs import/export data (1.68 million rows, 6,073 HS codes) is processed to map trade flows by commodity, partner country, and customs office. The system calculates trade balances and can flag anomalies like unusual pricing, volume spikes, or routing patterns that are commonly associated with trade-based money laundering.  \\*\\*What is coming next\\*\\*  Director and shareholder data for public companies will be linked into the corporate graph soon, which will allow mapping of beneficial ownership networks across Nepal’s corporate landscape.  Important note: All data used in this project comes from publicly available government sources. No private data is accessed or stored. Phone numbers are hashed and never displayed in raw form.

What kills batteries are the charge and discharge cycles.|||You can keep it plugged it but keep it within 80% range while keeping it plugged in. Even if it used unplugged 20-80 % of battery cycle is recommended for better battery health.|||It’s better to keep it plugged in instead of disconnecting when battery reaches full and then charging again when it gets low.  Also enabling battery protection or charge limit helps extend battery health.|||pro tip limit charge to 80, keep it plugged in and use it|||Laptop is kind of different from phone in that you can remove the battery and use it with charger normally. In phone you will still need battery inside even if you use power from socket. This suggests fundamental differences.|||Best use case is having it plugged in while you use it, and keep it unplugged when you're not using it (like a desktop lol). Laptops have pass-through charging, when you charge your laptop, the power is supplied to the system and the battery. When the battery is fully charged, power is no longer supplied to it, and it's not providing the power either — the system is still powered directly from the charger. You don't have to worry about overloading the battery or \"battery padkinxa\".  Batteries are most unstable(prone to degradation) at the top and bottom ends, commonly considered 0-20% and 80-100%, so keeping 100% charge at all times will degrade the battery much faster and eventually cause swelling. You will see a lot of 20-80% charge rule for battery longevity, while it is a good thing to follow, a big contributor to degradation of laptop batteries is actually **charge cycles** — if you try to keep the battery in the 20-80% range by constantly plugging and unplugging the charger, it'll cause more harm than good. Instead, just have it plugged in during use and unplug it when you're done, that gives it enough leeway to avoid high charge cycles(degrades faster than keeping at 100% afaik). And then there is the 80% charge limit feature, which allows you to keep your laptop plugged in without stepping into the more unstable zones while avoiding an increase in charge cycles. Just in case, deplete and fully charge your battery once in a while so that the drivers/ any proprietary software can recalibrate accurately.  I was doing the plug-unplug to keep it at 20-80%, and that degraded my battery from 100% health to 90% in 3 months. What I do now is, use my laptop unplugged until it gets around 40-60%(low up to 20-25% sometimes), then use it plugged for the rest of the day and unplug when I'm done. Doing this for the past 6 months has degraded the battery by 3-4% only, battery health now at 86-87%.

Charging at 100% 2. Discharging completely 3. Charging cycles 4. Heat   How to prevent  1. Use laptop plugged in to avoid spending precious charging cycles 2. Best use it between 40% to 60% charge You can set this via vendor apps like MSI center, armory crate, etc 3. Never use it at low battery percentage and never retain battery at full charge.  4. Battery needs cool environment, so give it better ventilation and airflow|||What actually damages the battery is the charging cycle. So you should use your laptop while plugged in and also limit max battery to around 80% (if your laptop has this feature)|||I have added a battery charge limit to 80%(my laptop allows it), and i always plug it in while using.   It performs the best this way. It used to heat up when it used to be in charging state(below 80%, as it needs to climb to 80% and it has fast charging), since i always plug it in, it does not heat up and remains 80% all the time, and it also helps if there is power outage.  Since the battery is mostly at 80%, it’s less likely to wear out or degrade as quickly.|||For me , the charge is on and connected 24/7. You might say making 100 percent charge is not good and you are correct that's why my charger limits charge at 80 percent,never charges above it and charging starts after 30 percent. After five years also no issue in battery and battery cycle is also very less to none. |||there is simple rule for battery cycle - keep charge between 20% – 80%  if you want more PRO tips then use chatgpt.  # how should I charge my laptop to maintain battery cycle health?|||people telling in comments know nothing, here is educator beneficial 😹, so bms manages all thing what is good for battery or not, not you or anyone, so bms have heat sensor, overvolt, undervolt, overload, short circuit feature to keep battery safe, people say 0% = bad for battery but, the one who designed bms knows what people will do so they mostly keep over low to make it more safe, think like this, if there was no little high set in bms then it will be like this, if 18650 battery have 2.5v as true 0% battery percent, then bms will say battery is 0% when volt is at 3.0, and if it is 3.0v the true 0% then bms will say 3.3v is 0% to user so they cannot force battery to die fast, and same for charge, and bms also have overcharge protection, its not lead acid battery that you charge over volt, so charging is exact max volt like 4.2v is 18650 battery max volt so charger's converter is making it perfect 4.2v or even 4.1 by default, so anyway it don't get overcharged, and when volt is at set level battery cannot go over that volt even you keep 24hrs charged or 24 years, so 4.2v is 18650 max volt, 3.0v is low, so bms handles this, you cannot force, you can do one thing different here, when you charge battery 100% and unplug and use another 4-5 hrs and make it 10% and again plug and make it 100% and repeat things, this will just finishes cycle, which all battery have limit and 18650 battery have 1500-2000, but it depends in ratings, not expecting, but most good 18650 have this cycle means 0-100% discharge and charge reduces one cycle this means after 2000 cycle a battery willl feel slightly low ah, means if your battery is rated 40whrs it will feel 35whrs, means low backup, and this is bad and doing this have no good thing, because when you plug charger and use you are using charger power to use mostly and charger also charges battery and this thing can also work like ups, which is good, directly using with battery is bad unless you want it anyway, and charging and using will not reduce battery cycle keeping battery max as possible good in health, because when battery reaches 100% bms won't let overcharge + volt cannot become 4.3v if charger is giving 4.2v,",

I had 0 experience but applied anyway and they called for an interview. Apparently the front desk officer just called anyone who applied without reviewing the CV. So when I entered and told them I have 0 work experience the one dude told me \"Job Description padhenau? We asked for 1+ experience\". I improvised on the spot and said if there was any vacant position and the other guy said ok I'll check and let you know. I didn't hear back from that company.   But after that I became more shameless and applied everywhere because that was the worst thing they could say.",

I was once on 200/300mbps package myself but looking at how much I was paying vs how much usage I was getting for my money I decided to scale back to 75mbps. It worked equally well for my house of three floors, 2 families and maybe 10-12 devices in total, phones and laptops. Download speed was reduced yes but I wasn't affected all that much. I later upgraded to 100mbps because it was even cheaper than 75mbps and have been satisfied with is ever since. I don't have a mesh router nor the latest wifi technology. A simple main router on 2nd floor + a wifi repeater on 1st floor + an old wired Mi Router 3 on ground floor covers all of my house with enough speed working out just fine. And the best part is I pay less than 10000 per year for my unlimited, no FUP 100mbps up/down internet.    |||I think they charge extra for replacing router too.|||I strongly encourage to use your own router and not the ISP. If the ISP doesn't allow this, get a better ISP. |||WiFi 6 honestly wasn’t worth it for me. I upgraded as soon as they started marketing it, expecting noticeable improvements, but there’s barely any real difference in day-to-day usage.  I do have a WiFi 6 supported device, but it’s not even WiFi 6E, it’s just 802.11ax on the 5GHz band, not the newer 6GHz band. So the upgrade didn’t feel like a major leap.  I’m subscribed to the advertised 600 Mbps plan, but in reality, I haven’t seen any meaningful improvement in my workflow. I do a lot of uploading and downloading for work, and the difference has been minimal. It feels more like a pricing upgrade than a performance upgrade.  Even when I connect via Ethernet and test the speed, I usually get around 280–300 Mbps download and about 150 Mbps upload, nowhere near the advertised numbers.  I tried contacting customer support, but they mostly just restart the router and don’t really provide technical clarity.  So yeah, don’t just fall for the “600 Mbps” marketing without understanding what you’re actually getting.|||Not much, They are just selling new nokia routers since they got bored with beacon routers.|||Bring a wifi 6 wifi extender that works with Ethernet cable and use it for yourself.

Just go to their LinkedIn profile and click on the Contact Out extension, and you'll get their mails, but the main part will be to write a killer cold mail, which I think should be your first priority.  What you should actually do in that cold mail is: 1. Write a killer title, something which maybe grabs your attention in the subject. 2. After that, in the body, explain something like: \"I'm this year old. I am into X; I love Y. I have this experience; I have worked on these projects. I would love to intern at this company or at this startup. I would contribute in these bits, and I just give a short 2-3 point on what you are going to contribute to them.\" 3. At last, till them, I have attached my CV. Would love to chat, something like that.\"   Write like a killer cold mail, and you're good to go.

Learn to read the game ( calculate overs left, the way pitch is, look how the bowlers are bowling based on field position and take occasional risk by moving in the pitch).  No need to be over hyped and play reckless shot to be a hero. Play smart.  To be less critic, most of the developed teams come up off a well structured cricket scenario. They are taught these basics through different level of games that they play in. Nepal lacks these structures.   Additionally Nepalese lack the physique and strength to clear boundaries so we need to learn to be composed and learn play to our strength. Fast bowls are relatively easy to hit as it comes at pace, spin and slow cutters need bodily strength. A difference seen in between ours and 🇮🇹 innings. They moved around the pitch when Nepal was bowling straight, had power to clear.  Too much can be said, the players are obviously smart to understand this but need to implement it in their mindset. Raw energy can make miracles happen but consistency comes from a calm mindset and smart decision making. This was the difference between us and italy.|||Kei ni thik xaina k hamro team ko tait dui tinta hit lagyo  ani hype ma aako player jasto vayo aile eauta bowler xaina jasle ma yo ball falxu vanera tei falna sakxa jasto jastai ma yorker falxu vanera short pitch falni bowler haru xa Ani batsmen haruni asti hype ma aayo ani six hanna parxa aba maile vanera jabarjasti shot kheliraxa chauka hanni vaneko misplace vara ho kasaile maile yo shot khelxu yo gapma khelxu vanera kheleko dekhina maile  Ani arko vaneko decision match khelna vanda agadi study garxa jasto ni lagena malai opponent ko asti Eng saga pani spin khelna garo manirathyo karan lai dira last over testo ni garxa yr kasaile  Ani vanna sajilo xa vanlau haina thaxa sajilo xa tara hamro local team le india bata bolauthem aaira hunthyo khai biharko b c kun team haru khelna, yo vanda hamrai team ramro thyo jasto lagxa aileherda kheri  Yesto serious discussion hunthyo yr sab situation calculation garera rakhthem aggilo dinmai toss jityo vani yo garni haryo vani yo target kati pauda k garni mausam herthem swing khanxa ki nai vandai eauta local tournament ma ta ani aafno desh ko halat hawa xa ghartira khelejasto k j hunxa hunxa vanera hidejasto khelna pani,chittai dukhera aayo yr tait :(|||Asti England ko game ko performance herda ta aaja 200+ huney thiyo, khulit parey.

Its just either computer or bio to choose from. Tara maths ma ramro xau vane u can take management too. Management ma u can take subjects like  general mathematics and business maths. But aba plus two ma aisakesi math will be a bit different but u can cope with it if u r interested in maths. Aba its ur choice, if you want to pursue a career in applied science like engineering then you can choose pcm as your subjects basically (Science stream). If you want to pursue a career in financial science like business management then you can choose management as your field of study. Tara in the context of countries like Nepal you can study applied science only if you had studied pcm in plus two. So aba Nepal mai basera padhne soch xa vane I would recommend pcm, tara if you are likely to study in foreign countries than management lida ni testo farak pardaina. But if ur sure studying financial sciences then u can study management.|||4 gpa holder here (opt math+computer) Aba for me, 4 gpa ayepacchi ta it's automatically science (ofc, I didn't even have a choice) Ani are you sure you dont want to take bio?

For us however, this is our first horrible man made mass scale event.    for example my mother told these are the events she witnessed, heard about ( there was no internet and reporters were getting chhopped up so source is her words and the fear and disgust in her eyes when talking about it)   i, maobadi kidnapped her school science teacher and tied him to the ground and they started nailing him with large and small nails from the legs and hands, slowly and all over his whole body,   ii. they kidnapped a man form his house at night, made him collect firewood from the forest , they started a fire, like a campfire, beside the fire they asked the kidnapped man to dig up a hole, he did exactly what they said. and after all that in the morning they invited many people from the village including his family members, and they burried him alive with his head sticking out form the  ground so that he could hear and see what was happening and finally they covered his head with the burning coals .    these are just examples and your and my parents have seen/ heard about a lot of similar killings kidnapping , public beheading etc  From their point of view, The old parties have maintained peace, ended such horrible war so they have gained a lot of trust. The old parties have shown their strength, in ending rana rule to ending civil war to ending king's direct rule and our parents know what the political paties gave them the rights and freedom which they have now.    So They're willing to bet one more time that These parties can and will always uphold our sovereignty, freedom and country as a whole.  So it is our duty to make them trust the newer political parties,    it is our duty to make them understand that we will not let the sacrifices and changes made by the old political parties Go to ruin ( the rights and freedom given by the constitution).    It is our duty to make them understand that the the political parties which ended rana rule and the kings rule  are themselves becomming similar elites.    It is our duty to make them understand that the old parties are using similar dictatorial practices which our parent and grand parents fought and ended.  And this is not going to be fast and easy, this is a long process will take years and years.   If you cannot convince your family members think how difficult it  is going to make a stranger understand.  And one more question, why would they listen to you. You are so short sighted and narrow minded. you want people to do exactly what you want them to do just because you said it. You start name calling your family members when they questioned choice which you made for them. They gave their reasons why they're voting. And they are damn right on questioning balen. Why should they trust him, just because he and the media said it.  Isn't that we all be doing, questioning . and They are questioning, You failed to give them answers. Its all on you. Have you asked yourself why should i vote balen?? What answer did you get Try answering without using the words like \"purano party\" \"yemale\" etc. does your answer focus more on old parties or the plans and policies for the country. If it is the first choice you're the veda.  One more thing, it is very sad, but the number of people you've killed does not really seem to matter in national level politics. Prachanda has claimed responsibility for 5000 killings. He became PM multiple times. He has sent kids of 13 and 14 years to the front lines to be used as a cannon fodder.   In short, your parents have seen very brutal violence and They know how bad things will be if old parties get elected but They do not know anything about the newer one. ( might be better or might be wayyy bad.) so they're picking certainity instead of incertainity.     |||vote waste garxa euta generation   dukha paauxa arko generation|||Balen haryo bhane, it's not the end of the world.

No direct flights to Europe, US, or Australia  Futute vision should be something like:  Travelers arrive at one of Nepal's many modern, spacious international airports, from where they'd take easy metro to the nearest cities, all of which provide an easy access to adventures that fill the entire spectrum of bare-bones to ultra luxury. Eating street food and drinking any water causes no stomach issues.  That's just my quick brainstorming.|||What Nepal needs is a good PR team too|||You are right mate.. but due to political instability and corruption makes country backwards..Nepal has big potential to get developed which lays between big giants neighbors.|||So true. I have so many friends abroad who've told me they want to do the ABC trek in the last year, but they've always changed their minds when they've seen what's been going on in the country. Truly sad.|||[removed]|||True we have a huge tourism potential and we could be a destination for adventure sports. Besides trekking (but it's amazing what Nepal offers) we can offer lots of stuff like you mentioned but what we lack is infrastructure. How do you get to the trail head to start your mountain biking? Yes we have roads but how reliable are them. We have seen the safety records. If a rider gets into an accident how fast can medics reach him or her. How are they transferred to the nearest hospital safely.  We could be a destination for high altitude training camps like in Kenya or Colorado or Arizona but again what can we offer besides altitude. We have trails but do we have tracks for the work out ? Do we have a combination of flat and hilly lands around that altitude because Nepal's altitude rises rapidly in a very short distance. I know about a high altitude training program in Jumla. Hope that is a success. Training camp would need a good infra as well like basic PT, Gym, Recovery stuff etc.  We have the potential but we need to harness it. Harness in a sustainable way because if we are to increase the number of tourist sustainability is important, safety records are important because the majority of tourists consider everything, risk vs reward. I hope you succeed in your future endeavors but I suggest you to travel abroad to check the Tourism Sector before you venture on yours. Nearest is Thailand , you could see how they have harnessed their tourism potential. Their service industry compared to any other country in the region is miles ahead. Infrastructure, hospitality, transport etc they have it covered.   It's just my observations as I have traveled across Asia, Americas, Europe  when I can and I always think what Nepal could be.|||Do the cluster analysis of whatever feasible in nepal. Have a research team there are a lot of potential in Nepal.  And for tourism, I have read the tourism cluster in Nepal, and yes it will be wonder.|||[removed]||| * * Anyone who loves Nepal and hiphop, please give this a look. We're running a competition to win a trip to an international hiphop event in November. We've got Verb T and Jazz T from the UK confirmed so far and many more to come.

But I just want to say that I love Nepal. My wife and I have spent several weeks there each year for the last three years. I'm just happy to be there whatever we are doing.  Incredible nature. Great vegetarian food. Lovely people. A deep spiritual vibe. A unique country. Amazing!|||Yea very high potential for top tourism.  besides the amazing nature, many people also speak English - which is an advantage compared to many Asian countries where majority of their populations can’t speak English.   But the infrastructure just isn’t there yet. Close neighbor who has done it well is Thailand - their tourism industry and volume are another level. Their roads, airports, hospitality, foods, entertainment, tourist police to ensure safety, etc. make it easy to attract tourists.|||Isn’t the lack of infrastructure in Nepal part of what makes it appealing? Difficulty getting to a destination creates meaning. When everything becomes easy, it turns into disposable content for a feed. You don’t get profound experiences, you get optimized tourism. Yes, infrastructure improves lives, and that matters. But if development is driven mainly by attention and clicks, we’re not building a future. We’re building a theme park.|||[removed]|||Tourism is never good for economic growth in Country, see Thailand as they grow at 2% every year despite having so Tourist for that they have literally convert the whole country into a PUB",

Legend was that he hit the statue's toe and blood gushed out. Tyeti bela, for myriad of reason, it was named budhanilkantha. Probably because theological literacy wasn't high/ maybe the farmer was more of shiva bhakta. Maybe the coutnry was in the shiva bhakta phase as later royal families have been heavy shiva bhaktas.   Until later, when people recognized, ahh you bishnu ho siva hoina it's name was already 'sealed' as budhanilkantha, including the name for the area. Hence it's called budhanilkantha ani narayanthan.   |||Aww man I stole so much money  and fruits from this temple  When I was homeless.|||It is believed that a mirror image of Lord Shiva can be seen on the underside of the statue, which is surrounded by water from Gosainkunda (a lake created by Shiva).|||TLDR; Honestly, it’s Narayan (Vishnu), but you’d be surprised how often people get confused and wonder if it’s actually Buddha instead of Shiva.  From what I’ve read, the evidence leans much more toward it being a Narayana site. Budhanilakantha is one of only three Jalashayana Narayana (Vishnu sleeping on the cosmic waters) in Kathmandu Valley as far as I know. The other two are at Balaju (erected by the same patron king AFAIK)  and inside Hanuman Dhoka Palace, though that one was added much later by Pratap Malla.  Some old chronicles say that King Haridutta, around 350 A.D., built Budhanilakantha and also set up four other Narayana temples at the four corners of the Kathmandu Valley. That’s Changu, Bishankhu, Ichangu, and Shesh Narayan. Even today, people try to visit all four in one day, which is basically like doing a Narayan dham within valley. And very surprisingly, if you add Budhanilkantha (as fifth point) into the map it forms the legendary \"Khadga\" shape which is described to be the shape of ancient Kathmandu Town Planning. More so, these Narayana Shrines are located cardinally to each other which makes it much cooler (I cant infer much more from it than that lol). Here is the image for y'all to see: [https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0](https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0)  There’s also this story that King Haridutta saw Jalashayana Narayana in a dream, telling him to dig up the original image buried under the Rudramati riverbed. So he built a pond and installed the sculpture there, along with the four corner temples. This is confusing because , other historical analyses and inscriptions suggest the image was consecrated by ruler Visnugupta around 5th century A.D, much later than Haridutta.  The statue itself is amazing. It’s the largest stone sculpture in the Kathmandu Valley, carved from a single block of dark granite. Some stories say they dragged it across the Valley with forced labor, but some scholars argue the granite was actually nearby in the Shivapuri hills, which makes more sense (in some article by Sudarshan Raj  Tiwari, I am not sure). So I dont know which one is more valid, this or the claim mentioned by u/ZoWakaki above me.  Now, the most interesting part is that Buddhists also worship this image as Nilakantha Lokesvara, a form of Avalokitesvara. Avalokiteshvara is considered to be a form of Shiva in Buddhism or vise-a-versa, which can be one way where the Shiva/Vishnu connection in Budhanilkantha comes in place. In fact, if you look closely, you can almost see the Buddha’s forehead in the face of the sleeping Vishnu. Even the long ears of the statue are very reminiscent of Buddhist iconography we see around the valley.  As for the name Budhanilakantha, there’s a story about Shiva drinking poison during the Samudra Manthan. His throat was burning, so he struck the mountain with his trishul and created Gosaikunda Lake. The water from that lake is said to flow down to the pond at Budhanilakantha, and since Shiva’s called Nilakantha, that might be how the place got its name.

            "comments": "Much of what we call national Nepal today was shaped by the effort of King Mahendra. Before his time, even school textbooks were in Hindi, children literally had to read “हमारा देशका नाम नेपाल है”. That alone shows how fragile our national identity once was.  Ask yourself, why can’t we clearly distinguish Amar Singh Thapa from Bhimsen Thapa? Because most of the portraits we rely on were painted by the same court artists during King Mahendra’s era. The same question applies to Divya Upadesh, where was it for all those years? Why did it suddenly surface and gain prominence later?  Maybe some things were rediscovered, maybe some were reconstructed, we may never know for sure. But what is certain is this, King Mahendra played a decisive role in nationalising Nepal’s identity, language, history, and sense of self. Fabricated or rediscovered, those efforts unified a fragmented country. And that, undeniably, was a great deed.|||Because this painting was made during the reign of King Mahendra to show brave king Prithvi Narayan Shah as there was no proper art of King Prithvi Narayan.|||Well that's art not history.|||Glad you are exploring this topic. Feels like you are also curious about history and socio-political anthropology.  Mahendra was driven by political consolidation and a single national narrative. His reign coincided with serious regional instability. To the north, Mao’s Cultural Revolution was unfolding in China. To the down   East Pakistan was breaking away to form Bangladesh. In that context, there was a real fear that Nepal’s sovereignty and internal cohesion could be threatened.  As a result, many reforms and symbols were manufactured or standardized during his tenure to construct a unified national identity. This included the bringing of civil service  (bureaucracy, police, army), the national anthem, the national dress (daura suruwal and dakha topi), the national curriculum (mahendra mala), and the formalization of historical narratives and political doctrine.  Much of what is presented as *Divya Upadesh* guidence book from Prithvi Narayan Shah was entirely manufactured and institutionalized during Mahendra’s rule. From the iconic image of Prithvi Narayan Shah, including his gestures of index finger pointing upward direction (we are one unity symbolism), facial features, dress, and artistic representations, to the moral and political messages attributed to him, these were part of a deliberate political project rather than an untouched historical inheritance.  It is also important to remember that during Prithvi Narayan Shah’s time, there was no modern India or China as nation-states. Phrases like “dui dhunga ko tarul” were reframed as geopolitical doctrine. The *Divya Upadesh* attributed to him was manufactured, published, and promoted during Mahendra’s tenure, much like the Mahendra mala national curriculum that emphasizes narratives such as the Nepal–Anglo war was fought bravely and Nepal being “second richest in water resources.” These were not neutral historical facts but components of a deliberate nation-building strategy.|||It’s kind of a propaganda painting. It’s not that uncommon in the world . Look at that Khukuri thing next to his throne. What even is that lol 😂? Even that pose was created for the purpose of propaganda. That one finger pointing upwards saying we are one ☝️. We don’t even know what he actually looked like. No description even exists. It was all created during Mahendra’s reign. Most people before probably didn’t even know who he was except for the people of Kirtipur who have had a grudge against him for a long time.|||The painting was commissioned by Kind Mahendra and was done by Amar Chitrakar in the 60s.

There doesn’t seem to be any proposal for institutional change in Nepal. RSP is basically running on “Out with the old and In with the new” but not new policies (case in point Balen’s Socialist tilt, his post about that cement factory etc).

RSP is the radical opposition as most of the influential figureheads of the revolution have now joined the party.

            "body": "I and two of my friends (they both abroad now) had once planned to open a Chhyang Factory in Nepal.   Before anything, I did thorough research, budget allocation, finding international markets, our cultural ties to the drink, even learnt to craft it with help of my Newar Friend circle and their families. For the extension of the project I went to Ilam in search of world class millet and spices. Got few leads, came back bought equipments and started making it. Everything was precise, the ferns and ferments, batch tested almost died drinking the first batch, created and recreated again to make a perfect batch. I had documented every single activity.   Now just to be sure, I first went to IRO, the main office of revenue, Lazimpat to check if the laws of Nepal permits Chhyang; and the officials were quite helpful about it, they turned the pages, pointed out Chhyang as rice beer and mentioned it was taxed 10/- NPR per liter as per the laws of Nepal.   Quite hopeful, we set up a meeting with the director of DOI for the next day, stayed all night to give final touch to our documentations, confident that we will be able to establish one.   Next day, both technical and general directors were in the room during our appointment. We presented our plan, applications and the available resources we had for the establishment.   “Bhanne bittikai tesari paincha?” The first words from the reputed officials. It might not be simple but we had our budget, the land lease requirements, technical scheme, and everything intact.   Our point was, “Nepal ko identity drink Korea bata import huncha, with hefty taxes, but if we do it here instead, we would be able to minimize import, provide employment opportunities and possibly export it too!”  I know Korea has it there as their drink as Makgeolli, but merely importing it instead of making chhyang here makes no sense.   After long discussion, the directors came to the conclusion that we submit our proposal with all the schemes, technicalities and budget and then have a meeting with the industry board lead by then minster for Industry, Mahesh Basnet.  We shook our heads, submitted our file, told that we will be called someday for this matter, could be tomorrow or 10 years from now.   We almost gave up at that point. Now both my friends are abroad, promising to return back if they call, but no one calls.   I don’t expect them to call, but sometimes I go to various chatpate stalls just to check if I find the pages of our documentation wrapping those 20/- or 50/- ko chatpate.   TL;DR  1. Nepal imports korean makgeolli as Chhyang, full of preservatives to keep it alive for a ling time.   2. Thoroughly researched-made documentations, technical schemes, budget allocations for establishing Chhyang as a well-lived Nepali Drink.  3. Visited IRO, the main revenue office and got a green flag from them for the establishment.   4. DOI doesn’t give a f\\*ck, instead implied that this is not possible as their books doesn’t recognize Chhyang, so asked us to submit the proposal documents and their classic “pachi aaunu”.  5. Friends gave up moved abroad. I still check if I can find the pages of the proposal wrapped in Chatpates or Badams.",

OR      2) If no equity, just leave ASAP!!! you don't have to feel bad for your boss / seniors / company / friends who don't value your labour and contribution (assuming you are the tech lead taking big decisions that make or break the company's future)     DM me if you or the company or both want to negotiate an equity vesting plan that justifies the contribution for both parties.

We tend to reduce individuals into neat categories of \"good\" or \"bad,\" when in reality most human lives exist somewhere in a moral gray space.  The figures are indeed contributions to modern society, having shaped our understanding of the universe in the case of Stephen Hawking and the overwhelming propagation of personal computing that underpins everyday life, thanks to Bill Gates. Their contributions are objective in nature, measured, and historically significant.  The Epstein case has indeed cast a sinister shadow on the reputations and personal integrity of those associated with it. Any wrongdoing ought to be investigated, prosecuted, and judged on its merits. Accountability counts.  Yet, it is quite dangerous to erase or dismiss intellectual and scientific contributions on the basis of particular personal moral failures; by doing so, it is an effort to distort history. If we were to get rid of every successful idea that had come from flawed individuals, much of human progress would disappear along with those who themselves were flawed.  We can—and should—condemn bad behavior without discarding valuable, valid contributions to knowledge and society.  Scientists are more likely to value human progress, curiosity, and long-term thinking—but they are not immune to moral failure. Their work can be noble even when their personal lives are flawed. Judgment must be based on evidence, not archetypes.|||Not remove but edit by keeping his bad pedophilic side in the chapter.Let the readers decide what to think of him by reading his biography.|||He did biggest contribution for science.

However, his contributions to the physics community are unimaginable. As a physics student, I was inspired by his book A Brief History of Time. When it comes to moral responsibility, I believe we should take such matters seriously. However, removing his biography from textbooks is not justified. As far as I know, he was never convicted; he was only accused, largely based on a photograph. If we consider that he was a famous person known for his intellect, it is also possible that people simply wanted to take a picture with him. It could have been anything, but jumping to conclusions is not fair. The mindset of “guilty until proven innocent,” which is common in Nepali society, can seriously damage someone’s reputation, whether they are living or deceased. I also saw someone arguing that other scientists went to that island as well. Yes, that could be possible. They may have gone there for donations or funding. People should also understand how research and experiments work. Many scientists attend seminars, conferences, and even social events to secure funding from wealthy donors for their research projects. That is part of how scientific funding operates. It may sound unpleasant, but it is often the reality. However, concluding that they raped minors without concrete evidence is unreasonable. From my perspective, why don’t we conduct our own research before forming judgments? We know he was famous. We can consult medical professionals or simply search the internet regarding his medical condition after paralysis—you understand what I mean….|||Does his contribution to the science and the world will be false because his name was in epstein file?  Naive People like you think the world exist in black and white?|||Those who're saying his professional works matter only, then ig Sanduk Ruit's biography was removed! But he was a good person too  A \"biography\" actually includes every aspect of the person's life. And if they don't remove it, then instead add these epstein files also in his biography, so people don't mistake him as a great PERSON too.|||[deleted]",

That day - we had lunch together and later - it was normal - majjale basera khanthem. We worked for a year or so.    I left that job - after 6 months or so, I happened to go to one of my co-worker's village. it was dirty, village was dirty okay, with nasty odour, we were there for a NGO and had to do work.  He offered me meal, there,- I declined citing that I don't want to have now, also  because the area was dirty and I am such a prick in such cases, I have problems.       A year later - I was in town nearby one of the villages in terai - and there were similar coworkers - I was stationed there so had to take meals in office / around office. I called coworkers - but they hesitated  and never came to eat together.    So - slowly there is change happening but. economic standards are changing and with that cleanliness and other things associated with money are also changing.    Kathmandu ma kam garne colleague - they were open to mingle/ eat with me but not terai ko sano town ma kam garne sathi.

Dhanna le mero pariwar maa chai koi xaina loyal voter tin taauke ko, naa RSP supporter|||brainwashed bhako haina, Veda ni haina, our parents have seem wayy wayy more horrible situations, killing and what not, so a lot of them are desensitized on events of bhadra 8 and 9.    For us however, this is our first horrible man made mass scale event.    for example my mother told these are the events she witnessed, heard about ( there was no internet and reporters were getting chhopped up so source is her words and the fear and disgust in her eyes when talking about it)   i, maobadi kidnapped her school science teacher and tied him to the ground and they started nailing him with large and small nails from the legs and hands, slowly and all over his whole body,   ii. they kidnapped a man form his house at night, made him collect firewood from the forest , they started a fire, like a campfire, beside the fire they asked the kidnapped man to dig up a hole, he did exactly what they said. and after all that in the morning they invited many people from the village including his family members, and they burried him alive with his head sticking out form the  ground so that he could hear and see what was happening and finally they covered his head with the burning coals .    these are just examples and your and my parents have seen/ heard about a lot of similar killings kidnapping , public beheading etc  From their point of view, The old parties have maintained peace, ended such horrible war so they have gained a lot of trust. The old parties have shown their strength, in ending rana rule to ending civil war to ending king's direct rule and our parents know what the political paties gave them the rights and freedom which they have now.    So They're willing to bet one more time that These parties can and will always uphold our sovereignty, freedom and country as a whole.  So it is our duty to make them trust the newer political parties,    it is our duty to make them understand that we will not let the sacrifices and changes made by the old political parties Go to ruin ( the rights and freedom given by the constitution).    It is our duty to make them understand that the the political parties which ended rana rule and the kings rule  are themselves becomming similar elites.    It is our duty to make them understand that the old parties are using similar dictatorial practices which our parent and grand parents fought and ended.  And this is not going to be fast and easy, this is a long process will take years and years.   If you cannot convince your family members think how difficult it  is going to make a stranger understand.  And one more question, why would they listen to you. You are so short sighted and narrow minded. you want people to do exactly what you want them to do just because you said it. You start name calling your family members when they questioned choice which you made for them. They gave their reasons why they're voting. And they are damn right on questioning balen. Why should they trust him, just because he and the media said it.  Isn't that we all be doing, questioning . and They are questioning, You failed to give them answers. Its all on you. Have you asked yourself why should i vote balen?? What answer did you get Try answering without using the words like \"purano party\" \"yemale\" etc. does your answer focus more on old parties or the plans and policies for the country. If it is the first choice you're the veda.  One more thing, it is very sad, but the number of people you've killed does not really seem to matter in national level politics. Prachanda has claimed responsibility for 5000 killings. He became PM multiple times. He has sent kids of 13 and 14 years to the front lines to be used as a cannon fodder.   In short, your parents have seen very brutal violence and They know how bad things will be if old parties get elected but They do not know anything about the newer one. ( might be better or might be wayyy bad.) so they're picking certainity instead of incertainity.     |||vote waste garxa euta generation   dukha paauxa arko generation|||Balen haryo bhane, it's not the end of the world.

Decent food  Cons: 1. Awful international airport 2. Terrible roads 3. Eating local food and drinking local water will make travelers sick 4. Polluted, cramped, chaotic, dirty cities 5. Garbage everywhere 6. No direct flights to Europe, US, or Australia  Futute vision should be something like:  Travelers arrive at one of Nepal's many modern, spacious international airports, from where they'd take easy metro to the nearest cities, all of which provide an easy access to adventures that fill the entire spectrum of bare-bones to ultra luxury. Eating street food and drinking any water causes no stomach issues.  That's just my quick brainstorming.|||What Nepal needs is a good PR team too|||You are right mate.. but due to political instability and corruption makes country backwards..Nepal has big potential to get developed which lays between big giants neighbors.|||So true. I have so many friends abroad who've told me they want to do the ABC trek in the last year, but they've always changed their minds when they've seen what's been going on in the country. Truly sad.|||[removed]|||True we have a huge tourism potential and we could be a destination for adventure sports. Besides trekking (but it's amazing what Nepal offers) we can offer lots of stuff like you mentioned but what we lack is infrastructure. How do you get to the trail head to start your mountain biking? Yes we have roads but how reliable are them. We have seen the safety records. If a rider gets into an accident how fast can medics reach him or her. How are they transferred to the nearest hospital safely.  We could be a destination for high altitude training camps like in Kenya or Colorado or Arizona but again what can we offer besides altitude. We have trails but do we have tracks for the work out ? Do we have a combination of flat and hilly lands around that altitude because Nepal's altitude rises rapidly in a very short distance. I know about a high altitude training program in Jumla. Hope that is a success. Training camp would need a good infra as well like basic PT, Gym, Recovery stuff etc.  We have the potential but we need to harness it. Harness in a sustainable way because if we are to increase the number of tourist sustainability is important, safety records are important because the majority of tourists consider everything, risk vs reward. I hope you succeed in your future endeavors but I suggest you to travel abroad to check the Tourism Sector before you venture on yours. Nearest is Thailand , you could see how they have harnessed their tourism potential. Their service industry compared to any other country in the region is miles ahead. Infrastructure, hospitality, transport etc they have it covered.   It's just my observations as I have traveled across Asia, Americas, Europe  when I can and I always think what Nepal could be.|||Do the cluster analysis of whatever feasible in nepal.

Great vegetarian food. Lovely people. A deep spiritual vibe. A unique country. Amazing!|||Yea very high potential for top tourism.  besides the amazing nature, many people also speak English - which is an advantage compared to many Asian countries where majority of their populations can’t speak English.   But the infrastructure just isn’t there yet. Close neighbor who has done it well is Thailand - their tourism industry and volume are another level. Their roads, airports, hospitality, foods, entertainment, tourist police to ensure safety, etc. make it easy to attract tourists.|||Isn’t the lack of infrastructure in Nepal part of what makes it appealing? Difficulty getting to a destination creates meaning. When everything becomes easy, it turns into disposable content for a feed. You don’t get profound experiences, you get optimized tourism. Yes, infrastructure improves lives, and that matters. But if development is driven mainly by attention and clicks, we’re not building a future. We’re building a theme park.|||[removed]|||Tourism is never good for economic growth in Country, see Thailand as they grow at 2% every year despite having so Tourist for that they have literally convert the whole country into a PUB",

Record anusar, statue was commissioned by Vishugupta of the gupta dynasty (son of the more famous Jisnugupta) tyeti bela Lichhavi dynasty was like a vassal state to the gupta dynasty. Ani bishnugupta Kathmandu airaney belama yo statue commission gareko. Made from nagdhunga (basal stone).  Yo statue chai harako thiyo (puriyeko) maybe due to lack of maintenance, earthquake who knows.   Malla raja ko palama euta kisan ley khanney belama bhettayo yo murti feri. Legend was that he hit the statue's toe and blood gushed out. Tyeti bela, for myriad of reason, it was named budhanilkantha. Probably because theological literacy wasn't high/ maybe the farmer was more of shiva bhakta. Maybe the coutnry was in the shiva bhakta phase as later royal families have been heavy shiva bhaktas.   Until later, when people recognized, ahh you bishnu ho siva hoina it's name was already 'sealed' as budhanilkantha, including the name for the area. Hence it's called budhanilkantha ani narayanthan.   |||Aww man I stole so much money  and fruits from this temple  When I was homeless.|||It is believed that a mirror image of Lord Shiva can be seen on the underside of the statue, which is surrounded by water from Gosainkunda (a lake created by Shiva).|||TLDR; Honestly, it’s Narayan (Vishnu), but you’d be surprised how often people get confused and wonder if it’s actually Buddha instead of Shiva.  From what I’ve read, the evidence leans much more toward it being a Narayana site. Budhanilakantha is one of only three Jalashayana Narayana (Vishnu sleeping on the cosmic waters) in Kathmandu Valley as far as I know. The other two are at Balaju (erected by the same patron king AFAIK)  and inside Hanuman Dhoka Palace, though that one was added much later by Pratap Malla.  Some old chronicles say that King Haridutta, around 350 A.D., built Budhanilakantha and also set up four other Narayana temples at the four corners of the Kathmandu Valley. That’s Changu, Bishankhu, Ichangu, and Shesh Narayan. Even today, people try to visit all four in one day, which is basically like doing a Narayan dham within valley. And very surprisingly, if you add Budhanilkantha (as fifth point) into the map it forms the legendary \"Khadga\" shape which is described to be the shape of ancient Kathmandu Town Planning. More so, these Narayana Shrines are located cardinally to each other which makes it much cooler (I cant infer much more from it than that lol). Here is the image for y'all to see: [https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0](https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0)  There’s also this story that King Haridutta saw Jalashayana Narayana in a dream, telling him to dig up the original image buried under the Rudramati riverbed. So he built a pond and installed the sculpture there, along with the four corner temples. This is confusing because , other historical analyses and inscriptions suggest the image was consecrated by ruler Visnugupta around 5th century A.D, much later than Haridutta.  The statue itself is amazing. It’s the largest stone sculpture in the Kathmandu Valley, carved from a single block of dark granite. Some stories say they dragged it across the Valley with forced labor, but some scholars argue the granite was actually nearby in the Shivapuri hills, which makes more sense (in some article by Sudarshan Raj  Tiwari, I am not sure). So I dont know which one is more valid, this or the claim mentioned by u/ZoWakaki above me.  Now, the most interesting part is that Buddhists also worship this image as Nilakantha Lokesvara, a form of Avalokitesvara. Avalokiteshvara is considered to be a form of Shiva in Buddhism or vise-a-versa, which can be one way where the Shiva/Vishnu connection in Budhanilkantha comes in place. In fact, if you look closely, you can almost see the Buddha’s forehead in the face of the sleeping Vishnu. Even the long ears of the statue are very reminiscent of Buddhist iconography we see around the valley.  As for the name Budhanilakantha, there’s a story about Shiva drinking poison during the Samudra Manthan. His throat was burning, so he struck the mountain with his trishul and created Gosaikunda Lake. The water from that lake is said to flow down to the pond at Budhanilakantha, and since Shiva’s called Nilakantha, that might be how the place got its name.

What about the Dhanraj Gurung sahakari case?  - You were part of the Government Efficiency team when the recent UML–Congress coalition government was formed. Will you question or take responsibility for the recent GenZ killings? Your party member Ramesh Lekhak was also the Home Minister at that time—have you questioned him about this?  - You have been a Member of Parliament four times, and during your tenure, the Congress has formed the government multiple times. Can you point to any concrete, policy-level achievements you delivered during your party’s time in government?  - What about Aftab Alam case during your party's government was he rightfully being prosecuted or your party's government have him impunity from jail, what about that case?",

Deuba, as an individual, may once have been a true leader—but over time, the gang culture around him is what turned everything rotten and made him look bhrasta.  From this point onward, Gagan is free.  Free from:  All blame linked to Arzu  All accusations about money in Deuba’s house  All baggage related to Bhutani saranarthi  All the kandas, Teramox, and backroom deals  All blame connected to Lekhaks and their networks  These were never Gagan’s sins to carry.  So why should he keep answering for other people’s cults? Why should a reformist voice be held hostage by the corruption, compromises, and power games of an old guard that refuses to let go?  If anyone needs to answer, it’s the system that protected those networks for decades—not the one who finally challenged them.  Gagan doesn’t need to answer anymore. The Mahadibesan already did.|||He can give you wai wai, not sure about answers.

Don't get me wrong there are shortcomings from him and nobody is perfect but most of the questions you raised here are poor attempt to make him look bad.  You have to realize that even though Gagan is a prominient member of Nepali Congress, he was never the executive. Every decision the party makes as a whole, the chairman (Deuba) has the supreme authority and he is little to no say in any of the decisions.  Even then, he has clearly spoken against all wrongdoings. And you say \"just speak\". But that's the problem of not being in executive power, he can only speak.  You trying to  make the money burnt in Deuba's house somehow a crime by Gagan Thapa clearly tells me that you are just trying to hate. Otherwise as everyone else has said, there is a special probe commission formed to specifically study the burnt money case and all we can do is wait for their report and the government will file the case if there is wrongdoing (which we all believe there is). And Gagan has clearly affirmed this, as any sane person would. You should read him and listen his many public interviews/videos and not just assume he didn't say anything.  He has clearly said multiple times that any and all involved in sahakari kanda should be investigated including naming people from his own party by name, again multiple times in multiple of his public appearences and writings, you should read/watch/listen those. The government should file cases. I don't understand how this would be his fault.  If you again watch his comments in good faith and listen to his parliament speeches, he as said multiple times that  the public is angry, they need delivery. He said he opposed the coalition and publicly opposed it multiple times. But he is not the executive, deuba is. When there is coaliation, he has the moral responsibility to make the government successful. He was indeed in the efficiency team and he said he tried is best to make the government successful because he knew people needed delivery even though he opposed the coalition. He publicly told long before the Gen-Z protest that he couldn't get the government to do what the efficiency team was supposed to do, and he left it. So I don't think that makes him culpable for the massacre during gen-z protest.  But still he has taken moral responsibility for what happened during the protest. He has apologized multiple times for any moral culpability he has. He said he immediately asked the party leadership to break coaliation in the first day of protest and asked Lekhak to resign. Lekhak did resign but the party didn't leave coalition because again Deuba is executive and makes the decision.  He has been parliament member four times. The first time and he failed to deliver the constitution as promised which he was elected for. The second tenure was again the CA election, which delivered the constitution and you can't deny he played crucial role in making the constitution, and he (among all others) delivered the constitution. The next term he went to the parliament again and became health minister and people say he delivered some reforms in health sector (again refer to public catalogues of his works during this tenure). And you have to grant that he has been constant voice in the parliament on various issues, which the MP is sent for. This last time was a short tenure, but as everyone he has played crucial role in voicing concerns in the parliament. Ironically he strongly demanded there be independent probe in sahakari case and there have been multiple arrests and cases filed against some major fraudsters. You should grant that this was successfull. But we can always demand more. I am not his prabakta but to me seems like he could have definitely done more here and I am sure he agrees.  Yeah what about the case? Alam was a proven convict. But congress did dirty by lobbying to release him. I haven't seen him support Alam's release. Again, I am not sure the details of his release but how is Gagan culpable for the crime Alam committed?  Again I am not his prabakta. I try to speak with reason. You could certainly question that he didn't do enough at policy level as MP to propose new laws and pass them. You could ask him that he could not do enough to break Deuba stronghold. But he precisely did that recently.  Now I am watching him closely, he is now in the position to deliver at least from his party level. Make him accountable ask him tough questions. But the aforementioned questions seemed more like an attempt to make him bad (except may be how many policy changed did he make in 1 1/2 tenure as MP except CA MP which they delivered constitution).

Lets assume what oli said is true, he said 8-10 years of pre planning for the destruction, oli has been in government for the most time in the last decade, what did his intelligence gather.

            "comments": "Much of what we call national Nepal today was shaped by the effort of King Mahendra. Before his time, even school textbooks were in Hindi, children literally had to read “हमारा देशका नाम नेपाल है”. That alone shows how fragile our national identity once was.  Ask yourself, why can’t we clearly distinguish Amar Singh Thapa from Bhimsen Thapa? Because most of the portraits we rely on were painted by the same court artists during King Mahendra’s era. The same question applies to Divya Upadesh, where was it for all those years? Why did it suddenly surface and gain prominence later?  Maybe some things were rediscovered, maybe some were reconstructed, we may never know for sure. But what is certain is this, King Mahendra played a decisive role in nationalising Nepal’s identity, language, history, and sense of self. Fabricated or rediscovered, those efforts unified a fragmented country. And that, undeniably, was a great deed.|||Because this painting was made during the reign of King Mahendra to show brave king Prithvi Narayan Shah as there was no proper art of King Prithvi Narayan.|||Well that's art not history.|||Glad you are exploring this topic. Feels like you are also curious about history and socio-political anthropology.  Mahendra was driven by political consolidation and a single national narrative. His reign coincided with serious regional instability. To the north, Mao’s Cultural Revolution was unfolding in China. To the down   East Pakistan was breaking away to form Bangladesh. In that context, there was a real fear that Nepal’s sovereignty and internal cohesion could be threatened.  As a result, many reforms and symbols were manufactured or standardized during his tenure to construct a unified national identity. This included the bringing of civil service  (bureaucracy, police, army), the national anthem, the national dress (daura suruwal and dakha topi), the national curriculum (mahendra mala), and the formalization of historical narratives and political doctrine.  Much of what is presented as *Divya Upadesh* guidence book from Prithvi Narayan Shah was entirely manufactured and institutionalized during Mahendra’s rule. From the iconic image of Prithvi Narayan Shah, including his gestures of index finger pointing upward direction (we are one unity symbolism), facial features, dress, and artistic representations, to the moral and political messages attributed to him, these were part of a deliberate political project rather than an untouched historical inheritance.  It is also important to remember that during Prithvi Narayan Shah’s time, there was no modern India or China as nation-states. Phrases like “dui dhunga ko tarul” were reframed as geopolitical doctrine. The *Divya Upadesh* attributed to him was manufactured, published, and promoted during Mahendra’s tenure, much like the Mahendra mala national curriculum that emphasizes narratives such as the Nepal–Anglo war was fought bravely and Nepal being “second richest in water resources.” These were not neutral historical facts but components of a deliberate nation-building strategy.|||It’s kind of a propaganda painting. It’s not that uncommon in the world . Look at that Khukuri thing next to his throne. What even is that lol 😂? Even that pose was created for the purpose of propaganda. That one finger pointing upwards saying we are one ☝️. We don’t even know what he actually looked like. No description even exists. It was all created during Mahendra’s reign. Most people before probably didn’t even know who he was except for the people of Kirtipur who have had a grudge against him for a long time.|||The painting was commissioned by Kind Mahendra and was done by Amar Chitrakar in the 60s. I find this essay quite informative on the modern retelling of the Shah dynasty’s history.   https://www.tasveergharindia.net/essay/nepal-visual-prithvinarayan.html|||This makes sense because it is not a photo but a painting.|||yeslai art bhanxa|||The hand gesture showing unity is also made during mahendra period. Before this the painting or sketch was unidentifiable from malla kings.|||AI ho Ai .|||This painting was painted after 1962. There.|||Read somewhere, this painting was also interpretive, commissioned by Mahendra. That commission included ‘Dibya Upadesh’ as well. There was a discussion on Twitter some time ago and some one posted a Mithila style portait if PNS and said thats the only known portrait of him from his time.|||\"who rules the present, rules the past.\"|||Doesnt Prithvi Narayan Shah looks like Mahendra even though they are 7 generations apart. Maybe thats the answer.|||If u want to talk specifically about the falg. Hamro falg kinda of old and much of tantric symbol. It predates Prithivi himself.

The painting was done by Amar Chitrakar, here in Kathmandu. Noone actually knew how Prithivi Narayan Shah looked like, so it was an assumption. The unity finger was also kind of an assumption.|||Who gives a f()ck, the artist took creative freedom, jay nepal !!!   Nepal’s true identity is in the future, not the past.

Honestly had Gagan not done his bisesh mahadivesh, the 3 parties already had plans to form a coalition and fight the election as one alliance. And it is his stance of not forming any coalition that we have such a strong competition now. But I’m not gonna lie, nothing is fundamentally going to change whoever comes to power. There doesn’t seem to be any proposal for institutional change in Nepal. RSP is basically running on “Out with the old and In with the new” but not new policies (case in point Balen’s Socialist tilt, his post about that cement factory etc).  It seems they just mean out with old people and in with the younger people. Gagan talks about institutional change, how he is going to be the Tony Blair of Nepal and bring about the “Third Way” and revise Nepal’s economy back to the 90’s era of liberalism.

This election is the by-product of a major revolution which overthrew the government. The opposition has won every single election following revolutions - Jana Andolan I (Nepal Congress won the elections after the dissolution of Panchayat) - Jana Andolan II (CPN Maoist won the 2008 constituent assembly). RSP is the radical opposition as most of the influential figureheads of the revolution have now joined the party.  And you can clearly see the hype behind Balen and how RSP became a top 4 party in just 6 months of formation in the last election.   Oli might have won numerous elections in Jhapa-5, but I would put my money on Balen from a statistical perspective. Most importantly, he won with a 55.7% share in the 2022 elections. Why do you think it’s so hard to topple him over? And with Balen out of all the people|||Oli is not going to get defeated that easily. I want Balen to win but truth is Jhapa ma he is strong.

There were fewer Indian tourists, and the ones I did see were mostly honeymoon couples who genuinely came to enjoy their time and respect the place.Nowadays, when I see videos on TikTok, Pokhara feels very different. There seems to be a sudden surge of tourists who come only to make content, create mess, and show no respect for the city. It doesn’t feel like tourism anymore it feels careless.On top of that, the local leadership has also disappointed me.

            "body": "I and two of my friends (they both abroad now) had once planned to open a Chhyang Factory in Nepal.   Before anything, I did thorough research, budget allocation, finding international markets, our cultural ties to the drink, even learnt to craft it with help of my Newar Friend circle and their families. For the extension of the project I went to Ilam in search of world class millet and spices. Got few leads, came back bought equipments and started making it. Everything was precise, the ferns and ferments, batch tested almost died drinking the first batch, created and recreated again to make a perfect batch. I had documented every single activity.   Now just to be sure, I first went to IRO, the main office of revenue, Lazimpat to check if the laws of Nepal permits Chhyang; and the officials were quite helpful about it, they turned the pages, pointed out Chhyang as rice beer and mentioned it was taxed 10/- NPR per liter as per the laws of Nepal.   Quite hopeful, we set up a meeting with the director of DOI for the next day, stayed all night to give final touch to our documentations, confident that we will be able to establish one.   Next day, both technical and general directors were in the room during our appointment. We presented our plan, applications and the available resources we had for the establishment.   “Bhanne bittikai tesari paincha?” The first words from the reputed officials. It might not be simple but we had our budget, the land lease requirements, technical scheme, and everything intact.   Our point was, “Nepal ko identity drink Korea bata import huncha, with hefty taxes, but if we do it here instead, we would be able to minimize import, provide employment opportunities and possibly export it too!”  I know Korea has it there as their drink as Makgeolli, but merely importing it instead of making chhyang here makes no sense.   After long discussion, the directors came to the conclusion that we submit our proposal with all the schemes, technicalities and budget and then have a meeting with the industry board lead by then minster for Industry, Mahesh Basnet.  We shook our heads, submitted our file, told that we will be called someday for this matter, could be tomorrow or 10 years from now.   We almost gave up at that point. Now both my friends are abroad, promising to return back if they call, but no one calls.   I don’t expect them to call, but sometimes I go to various chatpate stalls just to check if I find the pages of our documentation wrapping those 20/- or 50/- ko chatpate.   TL;DR  1. Nepal imports korean makgeolli as Chhyang, full of preservatives to keep it alive for a ling time.   2. Thoroughly researched-made documentations, technical schemes, budget allocations for establishing Chhyang as a well-lived Nepali Drink.  3. Visited IRO, the main revenue office and got a green flag from them for the establishment.   4. DOI doesn’t give a f\\*ck, instead implied that this is not possible as their books doesn’t recognize Chhyang, so asked us to submit the proposal documents and their classic “pachi aaunu”.  5. Friends gave up moved abroad. I still check if I can find the pages of the proposal wrapped in Chatpates or Badams.",

I know why he is liked by so many given how dysfunctional your political system as been lately, but Balen's performance during his stint wasn't that great either. Sadly, no culture of constructive criticism in Nepal.|||I am satisfied with his work because I know it’s not easy. The system itself is messed up, so obviously one person alone can’t fix everything on their own. There will be tons of hurdles, especially in the capital city of the country. Not just the capital, honestly, you can even say Kathmandu as Nepal itself, because it has become the center for everything. No matter what work you have, you somehow have to come to Kathmandu for it. So yeah, I understand his situation.  The one thing I really criticize him for is his lack of communication. That is something I am very disappointed about. During his entire campaign, he kept saying that he wouldn’t be like previous mayors and that he would stay in constant communication with the public. But after winning, he almost completely stopped connecting with people. There is no proper accountability, just one-sided Facebook status updates. This is the part where I am extremely disappointed in him and openly criticize him.  Other than that, I think he has actually shown that work can be done. He has also given inspiration to young people to enter politics.|||Done In some ways  . Even non Exciting programs .Some Jhara tareko type. Some Unfeasible .. some better options appear and done.

It didn’t took me long to understand that he was just overhyped.   After he joined RSP where each members are opportunistic and work in Nepal for western interests it’s clear that he is not good candidate for prime minister.  He was voted to serve as a mayor, He could have waited until next election but for him misusing people’s trust and make them go against government by burning the Nation was easiest way to experience power.

I was hooked on it for two things. It had a monthly satirical column from Manoj Gajurel and childhood memoirs of Khagendra Sangraula. And their cover stories were also always interesting. On one issue, the cover story was a biography of \"Che Guevara\". I really liked him from then.   And when I was in college I used to dislike this one guy from our class. He low key used to irritate me. He was like ali dherai pose dekhauna parne, sir le padai rako bela taai na tui ko question sodhne, remarks dina parne. One day during a gap period we were talking with classmates and somehow the topic of Che Guevara came. Apparently he also admired Che Guevara. He told me about Che's book \"The motorcycle diaries\". He was also surprised that I knew about Che. From then on we got along quite well and became very good friends. He is one of my best friends now.   When I was 21 I got my first tattoo, this same photo of Che on my arm. When I turned 30, I did a world tour. I started in South America and spent 3 months there. And traveled further and made one circle around the world. If I hadn't read \"The motorcycle diaries\" then I wouldn't have got the inspiration to go to South America.  I think reading his biography had a really big impact on me. I like the guy a lot for what he fought for. He inspired me to make a courageous decision to travel around the world.

(Should I personally ask them to deduct 5% TDS?)  I also receive USD payments from an EU-based company. In that case, tax is deducted twice: first by the platform itself (approximately 3.5%), and then another 5% TDS is deducted here. When the funds arrive, my bank automatically converts the USD to NPR based on the prevailing exchange rate and credits it to my account in Npr.  I opened a USD account (dollar card) using my PAN.

Is it possible to increase this limit or ask the bank to keep incoming USD directly in that USD account instead of converting it to NPR?

There aren’t many good options in my country to receive international payments, so I used Binance P2P to convert USDT to local currency and send it to my bank account. This money is my salary, not trading profits or third-party funds.  This morning my bank froze my account without warning. These were my hard-earned savings that I was slowly building to someday build a home, so this hit me really hard mentally.  Tomorrow I’m going to the bank in person, but I’m unsure:  What exactly should I say to them?  What should I not say?  What documents usually help in these cases?  Has anyone here gone through something similar and successfully unfrozen their account?  Is there a real risk of losing the money, or is this usually just a compliance review?  I’m not trying to avoid laws or do anything shady. I just didn’t have a better way to receive my income.  Any advice or shared experiences would really help right now. Thanks for reading.",

            "body": "It’s high time that students should start thinking about alternate career options instead of blindly chasing IT jobs.      First, you’re told to learn:   HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, Python, C, C++, SQL, React, Angular, Vue, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL.      Then comes the mandatory grind:   DSA, LeetCode, CodeChef, Codeforces, System Design, OOPs, OS, DBMS, Computer Networks.      Then tools & cloud pressure:   Git, GitHub, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, GCP, CI/CD, Jenkins, Terraform.      Then frameworks & buzzwords:   Next.js, Spring Boot, Django, Microservices, REST API, GraphQL, WebSockets.      And now the new wave:   AI, ML, Deep Learning, GenAI, ChatGPT, LLMs, Prompt Engineering, LangChain, Vector Databases.      After all this…   You might get a job.   But there’s no guarantee you’ll survive in the long run.      AI is evolving faster than most people can upskill.   Tech stacks change. Roles disappear. Expectations keep increasing.      IT is no longer a “safe” career.   It’s a constant race with uncertainty.      This isn’t fear-mongering...it’s reality.   Students should seriously explore alternate paths where AI supports you, not replaces you.      Think long-term.   Don’t just follow the crowd.     Found on X",

            "comments": "This narrative of \"Software Engineering is done\" isn't new. This happens every time a revolutionary milestone in the technology space is achieved. Sure, it is not realistic to overlook the economy or the job scarcity that is so prevalant now, maybe for the longest time yet but it doesn't adjucate to the premise of Software Engineering isn't feasible as a career anymore, at least to the degree people are making it out to be. AI-driven development may very well be a 'bubble', and when it pops and the dust settles, the next big thing will provoke a similar reaction. While it is evident that people with years of experience are at a loss right now, and even more so for students trying to make it in tech, undergrads or young aspirants.  I believe it was never about how greatly any technology overshadows the current technology even if it transforms areas of it by overwhelming amounts but the ability to use it to your advantage. That is how you thrive here. You embrace, and not reject. AI cannot replace engineering but it does accelerate aspects of it that if you don't keep up, you get left behind. I mean, with AI-driven development so rampant right now, startups are at an all time high. People adapt and make it work. That mindset is obligatory now more than ever. Well, I could be speaking regardless of facts that I have yet to know, but I stand firmly on my grounds of not rejecting engineering as it has never been easier than now.|||I have 4 YOE. I don't expect to have a job in 2-3 years. I am not a people person. I don't know what else I can do besides this.

I don't know where I'll end up.|||I'm not sure why people are surprised. An industry can only take so many people before saturation, especially in face of disruption / paradigm shift as is the case now. As with any other field, you have to dedicate time and effort to be good and stay good. If you are a computer engineer worth your salt, you know it's a lot more about structured and critical thinking, problem solving skills and architecting solutions than coding in the field, and if you have the basics right, tech stack changing shouldn't scare you as much.  As with any other field, only the most committed, knowledgeable and competent people will remain in the industry and that should always be the case. The gold rush is over.|||Difficult times? Yes.  First time? No.   I really want to see what time has. Best wishes.  Best will have the best.|||Not only in Nepal. If you want to compete anywhere development is kind of fading out (especially if you are a fresher and just joining the market).

Hamlai uni ma kaile pani research based vayera kaam garna sikayena, or maybe Malai Testo feel vayena. Tara the best way to develop skills nowadays is that you could be creating projects written on someone's research papers.   For example: Visual transformers haru ko progress sangai there have been numerous researches using ViTs in the field of Medicine, so if you want to work in the field of AI/ML kunai pani euta research linus, if they are using free dataset, use that ani replicate the process foe which you can use the same Language models to write code but it would be entirely different than all the projects your competitors have.   Similarly, development field ma pani tei hola, I am not into development more ajkal but things like using ORMs for databases is something I found ekdamai helpful. if you could find solutions to some genuine problems that the team might be facing you instantly will have their attention. Plus enjoy the grind. It'll be fruitful.|||The big picture is the barrier to entry has risen but all the things mentioned above are not required to get a entry role. You will be adding more skills as you go, as your project requires it.   Yes its a challenging job but so are other jobs. If you enjoy learning/working in this field then its good for you else people can and should look for other carrier option. Do what feels natural to you.   Regarding AI, its here to stay wear we like it ir not. We don't need to me AI/ML experts we just have to learn how to use it, or embrace it, and not reject it. Its on the hype but it will die down and come back to its default.|||Jack of all with understanding of Ai tools and how to implement wins. Be the jack of all. Don’t try to master one thing. That’s what I suggest.   Decent apps can be build in a day if you know the requirements, understand system design and  logic needed. You need to understand things like how apps are build, deployed etc.  At least in US, Ai replacing engineerings is not exactly false.   With Automated workflows and Ai agents, team needing 100 members could only need couple members. That does mean Ai replaced 98 people among 100. That’s how I see.",

Another developer, may be someone in your network, or may be me if I am qualified😆 Train s/he and leave for another opportunity.. this is a huge jump, if you were lead in my company, I would understand, in fact I would prefer if you take the new offer. But I would be grateful if you gave new lead some support during transition.|||I am working for foreign company for around 3 years now. I too felt the same as you are feeling now when I switched my job. 1800 USD is really good offer. Don't miss this opportunity !! Foreign job comes with remote is the best. U only have to pay 5% tax flat. You will have more money which will motivate you !!|||if the start up heavily depend on you then ask for big equity and if you belive the startup's  scope and future than stay here with company and family with the equity else begin new journey|||if 2x then switch. i would have said don't switch if it is just 25% more.|||Handle the local company as a consultant (part time ) if they agree because they heavily depend on on you. Keep the relationship on good terms. So during the time help them transition so it works both ways.   Since the other offer is remote, you can easily manage time with both, if you can handle both good for you or leave the local and continue with the foreign one.|||Switch switch. No second thoughts needed , better pay probably better technology, flexibility of working from home and international exposure. Communicate properly that you've gotten a better opportunity and will take that.

MY ADVICE:      1) Ask for reasonable equity in the startup (long-term vesting schedule can be a good option) and stay if you believe in the product / company direction.  OR      2) If no equity, just leave ASAP!!! you don't have to feel bad for your boss / seniors / company / friends who don't value your labour and contribution (assuming you are the tech lead taking big decisions that make or break the company's future)     DM me if you or the company or both want to negotiate an equity vesting plan that justifies the contribution for both parties.

Say you can work as a consultant for the startup but can't do full time.|||I switched rightway tbh, I had two years contract, they didn't pay my PF  I didnt care.  I am very happy with my decision back then.|||Just make the switch. You current company will fire your without thinking twice if it suited their needs so why should you care about the company.

This is already happening, and it will accelerate rapidly over the next 12–24 months as AI tools get mass-adopted inside companies.  That said, the outcome isn’t as simple as “developers are done.”  What’s actually happening is a restructuring of value.  As companies begin laying off junior and mid-level developers, they won’t eliminate development teams entirely. Instead, they’ll rely on fewer, highly reliable developers who can handle much more work with the help of AI. This creates a paradoxical situation: layoffs on one side, high demand on the other, but only for the right people.    If you come from a development background, the smartest move right now is simple:  * Become exceptional at using AI as a force multiplier. * Just knowing how to code won’t be enough anymore. That used to be the differentiator; now it’s table stakes.    **What matters now is:**  * Knowing how to think in systems * Translating vague requirements into clear specs * Using AI to generate, refactor, test, debug, and ship faster * Understanding architecture well enough to spot what AI gets wrong * Owning a specific niche deeply enough to solve high-value problems quickly    Companies won’t pay top dollar for someone who can “do everything moderately well.”  They will pay very well for someone who can fix a very specific, painful problem reliably.  And let’s be honest: saying “AI won’t replace humans” is already outdated. It has started replacing roles; not because AI is perfect, but because it’s good enough when paired with the right person.  If a non-technical person, like myself, someone who loves tech but never formally learned coding, can now build a full-fledged system using tools like ChatGPT and Replit, then the competitive bar has fundamentally shifted.  AI isn’t coming for jobs.   It’s coming for generic skill sets.    **So the choice is clear:**  * Either level up into a top-tier senior developer who designs systems, makes decisions, and leads execution * Or become a highly specialized mid-level developer with deep expertise in one niche and excellent AI leverage  Anything in between is the danger zone.  This isn’t a threat, it’s an opportunity.  But only for those who adapt early and intentionally.  Cheers!|||Lmao CRUD/landing page ta garihaalxa ni.

This has now gotten out of hand, and this type of behavior will surely spread to other tourist areas, especially those closer to the border like Sauraha and others. I have seen these 'tourists' in Thars and other SUVs riding recklessly on our highways, mocking our rules and laws. In my local area in the Terai, there have been a couple of incidents where such SUVs have hit locals, including traffic police, and fled to India.

Influencers from Pokhara need to raise their voices collectively on other popular social media channels like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Local influencers need to unite and raise this issue from their platforms in their individual capacities. Otherwise, we might be just one incident away from breaking news.  I will share this thread with a popular Indian YouTube journalist-The Deshbhakt. I have been following him, and he has made videos on such stupidity by Indian tourists.

We talk about decentralization, Federal system, we claim to have provincial capitals, yet when it comes to real power, real identity, and real rights, we are still forced to knock on Kathmandu’s doors. Why should that be? Kathmandu should be a place we visit by choice to walk its Streets, to bow our heads at Pashupatinath, Swayambhnath... not a place we are compelled to go just to be heard.|||I have seen his public speeches, they have never sounded as good as he does here.

Minor improvements to streets and basic municipal actions are being celebrated as extraordinary achievements, while far more serious national issues are at stake.  Nepal is a country with a deep-rooted identity, culture, and values that have existed for centuries. Yet today, we seem to be losing our sense of judgment, influenced heavily by social media popularity rather than thoughtful evaluation. In the process, we are slowly drifting away from our ethics, integrity, and understanding of how we should act as citizens and how we should choose to be governed.  Governance should not be reduced to visibility and viral moments. Appreciation must be based on substance, responsibility, and long-term impact, not hype.

Padhe lekheko anpad haru. Stephen Hawking ko contribution kati xa physics ma bujya xau? Like wtf is wrong with you guys?|||People usually miscalculate the complexity of human beings, even if those people are globe-renowned scientists or thinkers. We tend to reduce individuals into neat categories of \"good\" or \"bad,\" when in reality most human lives exist somewhere in a moral gray space.  The figures are indeed contributions to modern society, having shaped our understanding of the universe in the case of Stephen Hawking and the overwhelming propagation of personal computing that underpins everyday life, thanks to Bill Gates. Their contributions are objective in nature, measured, and historically significant.  The Epstein case has indeed cast a sinister shadow on the reputations and personal integrity of those associated with it. Any wrongdoing ought to be investigated, prosecuted, and judged on its merits. Accountability counts.  Yet, it is quite dangerous to erase or dismiss intellectual and scientific contributions on the basis of particular personal moral failures; by doing so, it is an effort to distort history. If we were to get rid of every successful idea that had come from flawed individuals, much of human progress would disappear along with those who themselves were flawed.  We can—and should—condemn bad behavior without discarding valuable, valid contributions to knowledge and society.  Scientists are more likely to value human progress, curiosity, and long-term thinking—but they are not immune to moral failure. Their work can be noble even when their personal lives are flawed. Judgment must be based on evidence, not archetypes.|||Not remove but edit by keeping his bad pedophilic side in the chapter.Let the readers decide what to think of him by reading his biography.|||He did biggest contribution for science.

However, his contributions to the physics community are unimaginable. As a physics student, I was inspired by his book A Brief History of Time. When it comes to moral responsibility, I believe we should take such matters seriously. However, removing his biography from textbooks is not justified. As far as I know, he was never convicted; he was only accused, largely based on a photograph. If we consider that he was a famous person known for his intellect, it is also possible that people simply wanted to take a picture with him. It could have been anything, but jumping to conclusions is not fair. The mindset of “guilty until proven innocent,” which is common in Nepali society, can seriously damage someone’s reputation, whether they are living or deceased. I also saw someone arguing that other scientists went to that island as well. Yes, that could be possible. They may have gone there for donations or funding. People should also understand how research and experiments work. Many scientists attend seminars, conferences, and even social events to secure funding from wealthy donors for their research projects. That is part of how scientific funding operates. It may sound unpleasant, but it is often the reality. However, concluding that they raped minors without concrete evidence is unreasonable. From my perspective, why don’t we conduct our own research before forming judgments? We know he was famous. We can consult medical professionals or simply search the internet regarding his medical condition after paralysis—you understand what I mean….|||Does his contribution to the science and the world will be false because his name was in epstein file?

One day - in long work day - i proposed - lets have lunch together - they hesitated, i understood and insisted them - Ma baun ho - I didnt mind and wanted to make them easy. That day - we had lunch together and later - it was normal - majjale basera khanthem. We worked for a year or so.    I left that job - after 6 months or so, I happened to go to one of my co-worker's village. it was dirty, village was dirty okay, with nasty odour, we were there for a NGO and had to do work.  He offered me meal, there,- I declined citing that I don't want to have now, also  because the area was dirty and I am such a prick in such cases, I have problems.       A year later - I was in town nearby one of the villages in terai - and there were similar coworkers - I was stationed there so had to take meals in office / around office. I called coworkers - but they hesitated  and never came to eat together.    So - slowly there is change happening but. economic standards are changing and with that cleanliness and other things associated with money are also changing.    Kathmandu ma kam garne colleague - they were open to mingle/ eat with me but not terai ko sano town ma kam garne sathi.    And with increasing education and increasing wealth - confidence of so called \"untouchables \" will change.    for that- I feel only solution is to have strong economic policies to uplift.

They really do under estimate Balen at every step. During KTM mayoral run, UML were advertising for Balen, thinking they're pulling him down by going personal at every event. Balen always kept quiet & kept going, ended winning the election convincingly. Then Oli came around in power and absolutely chokeslammed Balen as mayor because Oli was heading central government.  I feel like the tenure under Oli was why Balen is hell bent on uprooting Oli from his root itself & I'm so so so here for it.

Communism is really stupid if you look back at humanity now.|||This should be categorised as fictional book|||some deep shit ! ... op is not asking for superficial answer|||Technically, yes, he wrote the manual. But, Marx was a man who saw a disease but prescribed a medicine that was more toxic than the sickness. He wanted to fix the world by changing who owns the \"stuff\" without changing the \"human being\" who uses the stuff.  ​When you try to enforce \"equality\" through a state, you don't get a paradise; you get a prison. This is why Marxism has failed wherever it was tried as a rigid political tool.  ​Why \"Harkabad\" is the Antidote TODAY:  ​The reason we look toward a philosophy like Harkabad (Prakriti, Samskriti, Pravidhi) instead of Marxism or Western Capitalism is because it addresses the foundation, not just the \"economics.\" Harka Smapang has time and again said it has nothing to do with his name. He is suggesting a solution that isn't a western copy but suitable to the soil we stand on.   ​Marxism says: \"Who owns the factory?\" ​Capitalism says: \"How much can the factory produce?\" ​Harkabad says: \"Do we even need the factory if it kills the river (Prakriti) and destroys the community's soul (Samskriti)?\"  If you ask me if we need \"Harkabad,\" I would say we need Consciousness.  ​Harka Sampang is essentially bringing consciousness to governance. When he goes out and carries stones with his own hands (Shramadaan), he is moving from the \"ugly\" socialism (taking from others) to the \"wonderful\" socialism (giving of oneself).  ​We don't need a \"Communist\" revolution where blood is spilled to change the law. We need a \"Harkabad\" style evolution where sweat is spilled to restore the land. ​You don't need a book from 19th-century Germany to tell you how to live. You just need to look at the earth beneath your feet and the people around you.",

Which generally provides Bachelor Hons program in BBA, BSc IT And BHM. which all of them are equivalent to TU but, I’m worried about whether foreign universities will accept this degree if I want to do a Master’s later.",

The feeling of my heart having faster and my stomach twisting like an eel holding it's prey is not new to me but still it's not wholly mine.   The feeling of lying in the bed with inherent thoughts of disperse happiness and the want to be able to understand if that happiness is as true as it seems is not new and it's also not wholly mine   I look at all these motion picture hoping to find something. And what that might be is as ananomus to me as it is to you. I look at these things, listen as they talk, but the existence of this feeling of watching doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm lying on this virgin earth, unmolested and untouched, devoid of any feeling of any sort except for one; consciousness. The consciousness reigns supreme within and without all within the vicinity of my existence.  At this point, life as you call it feels not a moments passing by or time flowing like my thoughts.  My head feels particularly heavy, as if I'm thinking but a thought is yet to process. But how can this be? Without a thought, how can you think? How can one live, without knowing the value of death? But that's not right either. For one to know the value of death,.one must first know of its qualities, it's feature in all it's dimensions. The inherent idea of a thought being, and to think not sounds stupid as if not funny enough. But you can't overlook the idea behind such ponder.   I take very long breaths as I think. My heart beats loud enough for me to hear it. And all my bodily functions seems very much obvious to me. This isn't new but it's not wholly mine.   Ahh now my head hurts a little to. But this shall too pass.   Theres this lingering feeling of solitude that I feel very sensationally. For solitude has been my friend far longer then any. The silence that made me feel alone after some years felt not pleasing but good enough to make me feel a bit stingy if it got disturbed.  But now this solitude engulfs me, strangles me so that I choke these thoughts out of me which are yet to be. But it was this very solitude that made me form a thought but now it want it back. Like how death waits right Infront of you, lingers above you with it's hands around neck, and then takes you through the stairs of lifelessness while you climb oblivious. Similar is the solitude that I experience right now, but instead of lifelessness, I climb and climb but towards nothing, I climb and climb but climb on empty thoughts.   My agitated muscles ache in the silence of my breath while my breath gets shorter and heavier each micro instant.",

What might be the reason??? Can anyone guess??",
