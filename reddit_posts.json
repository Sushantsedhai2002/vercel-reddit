The Koteshwor traffic jam finally started moving, and I was riding slowly when I noticed three people inside the car infront of me were staring and gesturing aggressively at me and fellow vehicles.  ​Then, the high beams flickered from the car behind me. I realized it was a VIP or a politician's vehicle.  They wanted us to move, but we didn't. Why should we? Why should we give way to them when the pace of the traffic is slow, we didn't have enough space to let them pass.   ​I don't know who was in that car, but I am tired of this. It is disappointing to see someone enjoy \"special facilities\" while ignoring the basic infrastructure the rest of us struggle with every day. If they want a clear road, they should use our tax money to fix the roads for everyone, not just for their own convoys.

I'm assuming you'll have to stay the night somewhere. If you stay in a hotel (any hotel) for a night, they'll let you park there. Ask you're traveling even further and   can leave the bike for a few days. Basically just look for a hotel that agrees with you.   The roads are pretty bad but the problem isn't that. Four wheelers get stuck at uphills. One car almost slipped and hit me, so be careful. Buses get stuck at narrow passes, had to wait too long. I reached the bus park when it was almost dark.

            "body": "As it says, I recently got this and was hoping for some help, especially on the markings. There isn’t a ton of info on these in English so I figured I’d do to the source. My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6. This is probably the longest shot of them all, but any ideas what species of critter might have eaten up the stock at one point?

During the Rana regime (1846–1951), gun manufacturing in Nepal was driven largely by the innovative efforts of Gehendra Shumsher, the eldest son of Prime Minister Bir Shumsher, who is widely regarded as Nepal's first scientist and modernizer of the military.   Key Manufacturing Factories  The Ranas established several sites for arms and ammunition production, primarily centered in the Kathmandu Valley and some regional hubs:   Nakkhu (Lalitpur): Notable for producing copies of the Martini-Henry rifle, specifically the \"De-Rifle\" in the late 1880s.  Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.  Jangi Megjin: Originally founded in 1793, it continued to function during the Rana period as a government foundry for manufacturing cannons and military equipment.|||You need someone from the Hanuman Dhoka Museum in Kathmandu. They’ll be able to clarify for you. Your next best bet is if you can convince one these redditors (or they do it out of sheer curiosity) and visit the museum to see if they can glean more info about your gun.   Most of the folks that come here are students and a majority of the population has no interest in guns.   All the best!

It covers things like   • where companies in Nepal usually source candidates, and what works better than expected   • common mistakes during screening and shortlisting   • how interviews are typically structured and where they often fail   • challenges around hiring speed vs quality   • retention issues and why many hires do not last long term  If you are hiring, planning to hire, or just curious about how recruitment works in the Nepal market, this might be a useful read.

            "body": "I completed my bachelor’s degree(bbs) in 2025, but to be honest, I graduated with very little practical knowledge or real-world skills. Most of my education was theory-based, and I didn’t get proper exposure to internships or hands-on work during my studies.  Now that I’ve graduated, I’m going through a really difficult phase. I’ve been applying for jobs and internships, but I keep facing rejection, mainly because I don’t have experience. It’s frustrating and mentally exhausting, especially when I genuinely want to work, learn, and become independent.  At this point, I’m confused about what to do next. I really want to stay in Nepal and build my career here, but I’m unsure if that’s the right decision given the current job market and my lack of skills. I’m trying to understand whether I should continue searching for opportunities in Nepal or if there are specific entry-level jobs or paths that would make more sense for someone in my position.  I’m not afraid of starting small, learning from scratch, or even taking low-paying roles if they help me gain experience and skills. I just want to move forward instead of feeling stuck.  I would genuinely appreciate any advice, suggestions, or personal experiences from people who have been in a similar situation or know how to navigate this phase.

It is only required to enter to US & it is stamped on the passport which US immigration use to verify that you're a legal alien entering the country. If your visa stamp is expired but your visa status is not expired, you can legally be within the US but you cannot enter US if you travel outside the country. For most of the country, visa stamping needs to be done from their own home country. It can done from US as well but it's a very lengthy process, so most H1B holders prefer stamping in their own country. Yes, Nepalese also need to do this from US Embassy in Kathmandu. The reason why we don't see such thing in Nepal is because 70% of H1B holders are from India and Trump is now cracking down on immigration and making it harder for non-US citizen to live and work.|||Usually people from Nepal have shorter wait times for EB based green cards.

These days i just feel hollow like I'm lost. I don't want to waste my prime years without pursuing what i really love. So As I am working i am can manage my expenses on my own but i am not able to manage the time to play cricket as the office timings are absurd(8:30 am-4:30 pm). Because of these absurd timing i can only afford to train for about an hour in the morning .So i feel like i am stuck like i cannot leave a job and just play cricket as i have to ask my parents for money. Also I couldn't leave cricket as well . I have been looking for remote job but couldn't find any as it will help me to manage both of the things. So can any one help me in getting a remote night-shift job . I know this is not the right platform to ask, but i genuinely want to be financially independent and not be burden for my parents at this age. I don't want a lot of money as well just the basic stipend to cover my basic expenses would be enough. I am fully willing to give interviews, technical tests, or anything else that is required. Also any kind of suggestion, advice would honestly mean a lot.",

It's gentle, non-judgmental, and designed to help you gain clarity about your relationship with smoking.  Before releasing it on the Play Store, I need 12 testers to try it for 14 days. You don't have to quit completely - just explore the app, observe your habits, and give me honest feedback.  If you're interested, please leave a comment below, and I'll send you the testing link. Your input will help make the app truly useful for women like us.  Thank you so much for helping me bring this to life  Test link: https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.dhuwa.twa",

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NepalSocial) if you have any questions or concerns.*|||2nd is bullshit|||As a regular member of this sub, here are my humble feedback. This is not and isn't supposed to be any sort of personal or accusational message to anyone, just a humble feedback with due consideration to the nature of the subreddit and reddit as whole.  Pahilo, What post stays should be defined.   My suggestion is to discard absolutely low tier low effort post like ig tiktok and reel ss unless they're of unique nature to avoid a boring feed. I mean general question should be allowed like typical address, location, how to file return, my neighbor doesn't pickup his dog poo, I am tired from work, padna manlaunna etc etc you get it. It also includes those My gf/bf doesn't love react my story, gm/gn texts etc etc  too, you get it.  Second is on the topic of serious or sensitive matter like feminism, patriarchy, social problems and all. Post with good enough body text as opinion of the OP should be made mandatory, tyo 1 liner title garne haru kamm kaaj buddhi chaina, feed wahighat matra huncha plus it creates unnecessary & misunderstanding led arguments and debates. It was fun but now it's boring as hell. Okay like make a post calling out whatever you like but avoid to title it horrendously & ultra vaguely and insensitive as to deem you as jackass. This rule will make the discussion fair and not hinder freedom of speech either, freedom of speech doesn't recommend being stupid, insensitive and jackass.  Third is to totally not allowing use of swears in TITLE, do whatever in body text just don't be Hitler. Ani typical swears like sale, gadha, yk, murdar etc other than those of heinous or demeaning nature should be allowed. Like come on these are needed to make funny and snarky comments. A little bit of fun, considering majority of the sub is of goofy, unsrs, causal nature: casual 'off words' should be let it be 😭  Fourth, Strong moderation of Serious and help flair. I see people using it as shitpost alternative. These two flair should be limited to very very serious matter. Unnecessary use will make people less sensitive to these flair, leading to increased ignorance and loss of that feeling i describe as 'alertness factor' like the feeling or alertness you get when you hear a ambulance siren. Punishment too, ipso facto, Immediate 2 day ban.  Fifth, more mods, in a way atleast one is active at all timestamp of the day. Should be of neutral nature for objectivity, or someone that isn't too deep into his position in compass, is capable of gauging both side appropriately, keep the bias (of any kind) aside when in the role or position or to exercise as moderator.  Six, to create a kinda fashion for post, making people used to the rules of sub without being a dickhead like r/nipples, in short consistency.  Seven, for any international or nationwide event, no post other than those that are well written in a manner it's seems the writer actually knows what he/she/rest is speaking, isn't generic repetitive mess like just typing the event title and saying thing like 'that is good/bad' yeahhh this gotta go. Rest of those just rewriting the title without anything strong or aren't well opinionated should be discarded too. No more of the spams. It doesn't have to be accurate or u being a Martin Luther King to get posted. Just put effort in your opinion or thing you want to say. It's much more fun to engage in such post. This will be crucial to construct the subject mention in point six.  While I respect the mods, moderation and the growth this sub saw, We're a quite the big boy sub yet the state of is little disorganized and inconsistent by moderation & feed standards, the above mention QOL changes should be enforced. In coming months or so people and users will adapt. And for the way it is written was intented and to make it little off to ensure it feels little entertaining for regular viewers. I really wanted to use the word ipso facto, fitting place and sentence nei bhetina.|||![gif](giphy|ZztgXZ5UhbKZTbPPSU)|||Would be better if second one wasn't there IMO|||Accept only female post if she got that curry cannon|||I dont like that flairs are now mandatory. When I used to post in r/Nepal, where flairs are mandatory, I was usually torn between which flair to choose as sometimes what you want to post does not fit into a specific category. For example, I want to post about a news, but I also want a discussion but the news is related to politics, which flair should I choose? Politics? News? Discussion? I had to try to guess which flair mods would have least problem with and would be less likely to delete my post. This was hard. My posts used to be deleted even after most of the community interacted well and didnt compain about the flair. So, I have a problem with this rule|||less rule more chaos garau hunna ra?🥹|||None.|||it is good the way it is 🤷‍♀️|||We need new mods old are just shit,|||Ban old mods",

I would fokkin love mao zedong style cultural cleansing but u fokkin hindu and Christians and muslims and fokkin buddhists wont let that happen because u stupidos love your gods so much and all of u would call it blasphemy|||Hindu gods chai different jasto lmao 🤣|||And if he was Nepali today people would defend him by saying that he increased or GDP and harassed the victims and would honor him with malas and a parade if he ever got out. Your point?  Religious leaders have always been predatory. If Epstien was born 1500 years ago, he wouldnt have been the prophet of Islam but rather his own religion that wouldve leagalized sex slavely of marginalized children. Also, Epstien was a European Jewish, not a middle eastern muslim. This makes more sense as he is reported to have been meeting leaders from a genocidial regime where a lot of sex offenders flee to when they're caught for their crimes. (People call it is not real)  The thing is, people would make any man who said, \"God visited me in my dreams\" or \"I am the son of God,\" their prophet and women who said it, they would treat her as a schizophrenic. Just look at what they did to Joan of Arc when she said that Gkd told her to.lead an army. Theres also the origin of Mormanism. If you look into it, the dude bullshitted out of being caught about bullshitting. And that religion itself is so fucking predatory and oppressive that Christians dont even view them as Christians but like a cult. Do you know how bad you have to be if no branch of Christianity considers you to be Christian? Really fucking bad. Jahovah's witness ko ta kurai nagarm. If religion was made for community, then Jahovah's witness was made to isolate people and remove happiness from the world.  Don't get me wrong, I have my own issues with Islams (the way bangladeshi killed that hindu man was uncalled for even if their allegation was true) Infact, I have my issues with all the Abrahamic religions as they all treat other religions the same way: with contempt and a sense of arrogance. They have destryoed a lot of cultures and history all around the world because, \"God wills it.\" And they still continue to fight amongst each other because they dont realize that they serve the same god.  This doesnt mean that the Hindu religion is perfect. Aata ni bhagawan ko naam ma kati dherai atrocities committ bhaeko xha, especially against women ra \"lower\" caste ka manxhe haru, and even homosexual ra transgender manxhe haru (but that was most likely the result of EIC meddling in Nepal ko politics and that turned into religion) and all that. Mero bua ko phupu didi was widowed at 16 because she got married to an old man at a very young age, you know why? \"Means huno bhanda aagadi chori ko bihe bhayo bhane chori pakkai swarga ma janxhe.\" Sounds like making a way for a pedophile to marry a young girl to me.  You can critisize Islam for having a pedophile for a prophet and how it doesn't condem pedophilia. I do too. Tara you cannot act like every other religion isnt the same when it comes to protecting and enabaling pedophilia kinaki every religion has had a pedophile and predators leading their place of worship, and even hinduism, because the title comes wirh protection for their crimes and devotion from the people, and LOTS and LOTS of money. Catholicism ko ta kura nai nagaram cause Catholic priests haru le bhurabhuri haru lai molest gareko ta sterotype nai bhaisakyo.  Dont make this thing with Epstien a religion issue, its a politics, pedophilia, and a money issue. I am sure ki there are many richer than the world muslims who visited the Island, but the key word here is RICH. Epstien would let anybody in the island as long as they were rich, or a child they can exploit.|||https://preview.redd.it/x1ggfjp2tx8g1.jpeg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=82125feb5bddc6ce4ed16da83c20523a2baec97b|||You don't have to go that far back.

            "body": "**Read this first:** Y*es I am not very well with my english writing skills ( got 6.5 on IELTS ), hence i've used a bit of help from AI tools but this is my real story with the same ideas and experience. This was supposed to be a reply for a post on Nepal Social asking people abroad if it was a good idea to go abroad to study, when replying it got a bit long, so i decided to have it as post instead, maybe it could help somebody who is in a dillema if they should jump on the abroad boat or not. Sorry, Go ahead.*     To everyone back home dreaming of the \"abroad life,\" I want to share a perspective from someone who is already here. We often think the grass is greener, but once you’re on the other side, the view changes completely. I moved to Canada to pursue a Computer Science degree, fueled by the idea that it was a stable, safe economy right next to the world’s tech capital. I took out a massive loan—70 lakhs NPR—just for tuition. At the time, it felt like an investment. Now, looking at the reality of the situation, it feels like a heavy weight around my neck.  The world changed faster than I anticipated. AI disrupted the entry-level tech market, Canada’s economy hit a massive slump, and the political climate has shifted toward a \"natives vs. immigrants\" narrative regarding jobs and housing. Despite my degree, I’m currently working in a warehouse just to survive. The immigration laws here change faster than Nepal’s government, and I’m constantly haunted by the debt back home. I often wonder: what could I have done with that 70 lakhs in Nepal? Even 10 lakhs as startup capital could have built a solid business with a real ROI. Instead, I spent $70,000 to get a degree, experience some racism, feel chronically homesick, and learn that if I get sick for even a week, my entire financial foundation could crumble.  Don’t get me wrong—I’ve learned invaluable life lessons here that I wouldn’t have learned in Nepal. But would I pay $70k for those lessons again? Hell no. I’ve realized that we often take Nepal’s beauty, our culture, and our support systems for granted. I came here looking for a better life, only to realize that the time we spend away is time we can’t get back. People change, societies change, and our responsibilities grow while we’re busy chasing a \"dream\" that might be an illusion. My goal now is simple: pay back this loan and go home. I love Nepal, and I’m coming back. I’ll return to the West as a tourist one day, sure, but my life and my future belong at home. If you're thinking of leaving, just remember: \"abroad\" isn't a magic fix—it’s just a different, and often much more expensive, set of problems.",

AI and a weak economy destroyed entry-level tech job prospects.   Working in a warehouse despite having a degree just to survive.   Faces changing immigration laws and rising \"natives vs. immigrants\" tension.   Missed the chance to use that capital for a startup in Nepal.   Deals with racism, homesickness, and zero financial safety net.   Realized the \"abroad dream\" is often an expensive illusion.   Goal is to pay off the debt and return home to Nepal permanently.|||I stopped reading after the word computer science|||Where the hell did u go to clg ? 70k for some shitty university is deadass idiotic decision|||Hey OP. Thank you for your post.  I’m a Canadian, I was born in Canada and have watched this country change from a dream into a nightmare over the last 20 years.   Nepal is my second home and I just arrived back in Canada from Nepal less than 24 hours ago.   Every single Nepali I meet says how lucky I am to live here, but the reality is exactly how you describe it.   I try to suggest to people in Nepal if possible go to Canada or elsewhere abroad for a 6 month or year plan, at the most. I know this would be extremely difficult visa wise but I think there is not the concept of how hard life is here compared to Nepal in every aspect possible.   The water and clean air and infrastructure here is huge of course.. but.. everything else? What else is there here that is better than Nepal? I can’t think of anything. Maybe it’s jet lag talking buttttt this is how I see it.|||Abroad isn’t Instagram reels or a “good life” it’s mostly a struggle. If you don’t earn well you live on bare minimum  around 60% goes to expenses and the rest decides your future. So plan properly. Go with a backup plan, not a dream. Grind 5/10 years, save hard, build assets, and stay open to both options settling there or coming back. Don’t return broke and hopeful you'd just be trading countries for struggle. Being born in a developed country with a strong passport is a privilege; the rest of us grind so the next generation starts better.|||Touched by your experience and suffering. Don’t know what to say. Because im in Nepal. Doing IT job. Not in economic problems. But my friend’s abroad building home in kathmandu, buying card and luxury. So I was also thinking of going abroad (maybe Australia). Don’t know what to do|||What’s done done. Since you have a cs degree you don’t have to stick with on-site employments, look for remote jobs as well.|||70 lakhs? Going for a degree that costs 70L was a huge mistake especially if you are not financially well off.   I hope you get out of the situation you are in!|||Its not the 90s anymore..   Internet exists...

I hope things will get better and you can return safe and sound.|||I have a different story in Canada. I chosed a very cheap but reputable university spent like $16-20k for degree. Landed job right after graduation. Earning pretty well above average atm.|||I came to Canada as an international student too but I chose a diploma, not a degree. I took loans of 30k+, completed my diploma, and focused hard on skills, communication, and work ethic rather than just the certificate.  I didn’t land a white-collar job on day one. I worked my way up through retail sales, including Best Buy and Leon’s Furniture, learned how businesses actually run, how to sell, how to deal with people, and how to perform under pressure. Today, I work at Intact Financial Corporation, earning a salary good enough to clear my entire loan within a year. I’m the youngest person at my location and the only one with just a diploma, not a degree.  So yes, Canada is tough. The economy is bad. Immigration rules change. But getting stuck in a warehouse is not the country’s destiny it’s a skill ceiling. If someone stops upgrading themselves, networking, and positioning their experience properly, they stay in the same loop anywhere in the world Canada or Nepal.  Abroad is not magic, but it’s also not a scam. It rewards people who adapt, build marketable skills, and understand how the job market works. A degree alone doesn’t guarantee anything - talent, strategy, and execution do.  Same Canada. Same challenges. Different choices. Different outcomes.|||Well I am also in Canada and looks like you took out 70 lakh loan to study bachelor's degree in Canada? Well that was your mistake. Many students come to Canada to do their master's degree either course based or fully funded. Which means they have already completed bachelors back home and now they are here for higher education which is less Burden than diploma or bachelor and have better payback. Immigration bhaneko time anusar change hudai Jane ho. Nepal ko consultancy gayera brainwash handeko hola Ontario kai kunai college or kunai university ma bachelor's lagai dinchu bhanera. You should have studied in Nepal and then should have thought about going abroad. Tech industry yestai ho kaile boom huncha kaile mass layoffs huncha. You were caught up in this cycle. Now most probably you are in PGWP so you might be targeting PR but with undergraduate education you are finding difficult to crack CRS scores. 70 lakh loan liyera bahira bachelor's or diploma garna Janu is the worst decision one could ever make. Tetro internet ko jamana ma research garenau? How is Canada and all the market bhaneraw.

            "body": "My college head and a friendly botany teacher who has seen thousands of students always says just do enough to pass all subjects. Thats it. Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

How you remembered a whole 3-hour-long story you watched years ago? Treat these things the same way. Connect with them. Practice writing out the reaction yourself.

Given my science background, which one might be a better fit?  Best Colleges near Lalitpur? Could anyone recommend the top-tier management colleges located near Lalitpur/Patan?  Am I too late for admissions? I just passed out in 2025. Have admission cycles already closed for this intake?  The Abroad Factor:  My primary reason for joining a local college immediately is to avoid a gap year, just in case my visa application for abroad studies gets rejected down the line.

            "body": "Bail does not mean someone is innocent or guilty. It just means that rather than keeping a person in prison while waiting for their trial (so they don't escape), they are set free for the time being. They have to give the court a large sum of money as a \"deposit\" so they are inclined to return.  If they show up to court as promised, they get their money back. If they run away, the court keeps the cash and sends the police to find them. It isn’t a decision on whether they did the crime, it’s just a way to let someone live their life until the judge or jury makes a final decision. This is usually done if the person in question does not have a high risk of escaping or evading from police.",

So, the deposit is taken,  cannot escapse the country but can roam inside the fix territory|||In simpler terms, it is similar to a security deposit (refundable), not a fine/penalty. The person is required to follow the court orders, e.g., appearing in court on the date of hearings/schedules and not leaving a specific area or boundary, and following any other orders set by the court. If any of these orders are violated, the bail money is forfeited. Otherwise the money is returned after deducting some applicable court fees (if any) once the case is closed or a sentence is made.|||Exactly as you said if defendant is not flight risk and not risk to himself or others they can pay bail to wait for court date. Free up resources.|||In common law, right to bail or presumption of bail is based on the severity and the offense and the likelihood of accused posing an unacceptable risk to the community. Financial crime (white collar crime) usually favours bail provision once the defendants satisfy no flight risk.

Timing: Very early in HIV infection, antibodies might be undetectable by some tests but present in others.   Other Health Conditions: Autoimmune diseases (lupus), recent vaccinations, or other infections (mononucleosis, malaria, COVID-19) can cause false reactions.   Test Type/Technical Issues: Errors in lab processing, sample mix-ups, or inherent limitations of rapid tests can occur.   Acute HIV: During the first few weeks (acute phase), the body might produce HIV but not enough antibodies for some tests, or the virus levels are inconsistent.   I have Lupus and it will randomly trigger false positives when I’m in a flare up but my doctors are aware of that.

I couldn’t hone any skills because I was managing studies and work simultaneously and couldn’t manage my time properly.  Others are doing great - dentists, engineers, government officials, and so on - while I’m still stuck and can’t find a way out. I had to manage everything on my own and still do the same.

But, as far as I remember, the biggest “fish” he caught during his second tenure as Home Minister, which lasted about five months, was Kailash Sirohiya. Even that case fell apart, as Sirohiya was released after nine days due to a lack of evidence proving that his citizenship certificate was fake.

Today, a similar narrative is being built around Rabi Lamichhane, who is framed as the figure who will save the country from a corrupt, old political establishment, and the belief that this one leader will finally fix everything strongly resemble the enthusiasm once seen among UML supporters during Oli’s peak.

For the next few weeks, I’ll be out of town, and she isn’t comfortable using ride-hailing services like Pathao or inDrive. This made me think—why can’t these platforms introduce a feature where both the rider and the passenger are women? On top of that, the company could waive its commission for female drivers and passengers. Such a step would promote women empowerment, provide an added sense of safety for the women in our families, and also strengthen the company’s CSR initiatives. Taxis are an option, yes, but since we live in Budhanilkantha, using taxis regularly isn’t practical. It’s not really about affordability—I just feel the pricing is often unjustifiably high.

            "body": "Hi folks, just came to Nepal after 7 years and ride sharing apps like Pathao and InDrive seem to be making life a lot easier here these days. However, I am having a hard time in actually getting a ride through the app; and hoping if the community can suggest me ways on how to be an efficient user of the app.  So, I (M30s) created my account last week in Pathao. I have requested ride multiple times. The common trend seems to be that as soon as a driver (or a pilot) accepts the ride request, you call them to let them know exactly where you are.  However, for me, as soon as the pilot accepts the ride, they cancel the ride. This has happened multiple times. Meaning, I have not had a successful Patho ride during my 1-week of stay in Kathmandu so far. Whereas, my lady friend (F30s), gets the ride accepted all the times. Its comical that even when we are together, I request a ride just to get canceled by the driver. And we use her phone to request a ride, and voila the driver comes.  I would think its because I have a new account and no reviews and what not, but so does my lady friend (we created the account the same day).  So, if anyone knows of things or steps that I could be missing to make the Patho driver accept and actually show up for the ride, I would love to know. I do not want to jump to a conclusion, but are the drivers sexist in the sense that they only accept ride request fron females?  Also, for drivers: why even bother accepting if you want to cancel as soon as I get my hopes high?",

Pathao are very strict with misconducts and usually take immediate action to riders so there is likely less chances of them canceling the rides. They call you to cancel the ride if the pickup destination is far from them. If i remember correctly 3 cancels in a day leads to temporary ban in app.   Further download all 3 apps.  Pathao - most reliable with insurance coverage but prices are on higher side.   Yango - new app, cheaper rates, best if you want to use EV.   Indrive - unreliable amongst the three.

After 6pm most have hit their target so they move on to pathao/in drive for better rates.   Pathao is for rich people who just want to get from a to b. If you're willing to pay the price it has the best service. They even call you and recompensate if your complaint is genuine in their eyes.   In drive is a cesspool of drama and betrayal where the company doesn't give 2 shits about either driver or passenger. You both have to guess dependent on the behavior of the other whether it's worth it.  The worst is Pokhara in drive. The driver will accept your offer and not move from their taxi rank. When you call them, they ask more than double. If you don't budge, they'll sometimes come pick you up but if they find someone else on the way to your pick up address, they'll ditch you. Even bikes have started doing it in Pokhara.  TLDR: cheap before 5pm yango, reliable but expensive pathao, chaos lovers indrive.

Did anyone here do something similar recently?  Do passport offices usually allow parents to collect with an authorization letter?  Any issues with couriering the passport to India?

            "comments": "is it even late? 23 is so young, you have all the time on the earth.|||As someone who switched career and followed my passion much much later than you and is now happy with my decision, here is my advice.  1. Acknowledge that it is going to be very very very difficult. It will take its toll mentally. You'll have days/weeks/months/years of frustration where it will just be you and the piano. The audiences come later. You and your craft and the process. That is all you'll have to live with for a very long time.   2. People in your lives will constantly question your choice. Your family, your siblings, your friends, your loved ones. Almost everyone will tell that you're not being realistic. This will continue for the rest of your life. Be prepared for that.  3. Think hard what success means to you. Being rich and famous through arts is pretty rare in this country. You'll most likely never make a lot of money, have a rich lifestyle. Are you willing to change the definition of success to 'waking up every day and getting to do what you love'? It is okay if you want a more comfortable life. You'll have to decide.   4. It will take you a long time to get good at your craft. Get a formal training if you can. Once things get to a higher level, you might discover that you don't like it all that much.  5. If you want a more comfortable path to transition, you'll have to work twice as hard. Get a job and train yourself. Build savings and switch.  6. Build a good support system around you because that will be the difference between plunging into depression and staying mentally healthy.  6. Most importantly, have fun. None of this matters if you are not enjoying it, have a great set of friends around to share it with.  This is what I have for now. Cheers!|||23. How much do you watch social media? These things influence you a lot more than you realize. Planting ideas into your head about people living the live without having to give up anything. Yeah right.   I’m 45. Let me tell you. Anything worthwhile in life is going to be tough to get. A good spouse? You gotta put in a lot of work into the relationship. A nice big house? Be prepared to sink 10+ years of your life working your ass off to pay for it. A shiny degree? 2-4 years of your life being absolutely miserable learning all you can about your subject. A good physique? You guessed it. Sweat and tears at the gym for months before you see anything.   Engineering is not easy. Music is not easy. You can do the easy parts of it and feel good about it but mastery of anything is hard. Because it is mastery.  Rethink your decision. Base it on what really matters to you. Because either way you’re gonna have to put a shitload of work in.   Whatever you’re imagining putting into your engineering field imagine going through it again but for your piano. It’s not the easy way. You’ve already spent so much energy and pain into graduating in eng. think very carefully if you wanna go through the exact same thing with music cuz the grass will always look greener on the other side.   My recommendation is to do both. Work and find time for your hobbies. Focus on financial stability. You’re 23.

His books have changed the entire learning journey of school level mathematics in Nepal. That even for decades. His name used to be in every student's tongue. I am no genius in mathematics but I use it in my daily work (ML stuff) and if I have to give some credits for my skills in applying math, I can give his name. And you know what was it like back then when he started writing first book? There was literally no internet, he collected past question papers and had from like 2065. And he even categorized questions, contents based on level like basic, intermediate, advanced and so on. And he even used to add the most prominent mathematician in each chapter. That I even consider a some form of research. Not every research has to wear a PhD hat. So for me, I consider his contributions in mathematics to be highest in Nepal.   But I do not know what goes inside his head and now his fourth masters? This I find weird. May be he should have done PhD and finally become a correct Dr.?|||Stop the hate.

Both can be freshers. Who are we talking about here?|||Finding a remote job: Yes, it is definitely possible. Ease of finding one: Moderate chances.  How difficult is it to crack a remote role? It is challenging. It’s not only about how technically proficient you are; companies also evaluate how well you fit culturally. In many ways, being a good people person and collaborating effectively matters just as much as technical skills.  Is it possible for freshers? Both yes and no.  Remote roles have their own dynamics. Some established companies do offer remote positions, while many startups also hire remotely. Freshers often have better chances with startups, as they tend to prioritize cost-effective hiring. Established companies usually have higher expectations, and freshers may not yet meet those requirements.  My experience: I have been working remotely for the past 4 years—2 years with a Singapore-based startup and currently with a UK-based fintech company. LinkedIn was the source of connection for both roles. The hiring process involved 5 rounds of interviews, including both technical and behavioral rounds. My tech stack: Backend development (Python, Node.js, etc.).  My suggestion: Explore opportunities across different continents. European companies, in particular, offer excellent work culture and a healthy work–life balance. Don’t limit yourself only to US-based startups. If you’re experienced, start exploring right away. If not, gain solid experience first, build your skills, and hustle hard before targeting remote opportunities.|||In theory, yes. But that's just in theory. Remote jobs are incredibly rare, and extremely competitive when they do come out. Americans apply to hundreds of jobs, not an exaggeration, literally hundreds of jobs to land maybe a dozen interviews. And most of them aren't even freshers.  You could try if you want to, but it's extremely unlikely unless you're a prodigy with actual experience in the industry, or you nepobaby your way through.  Maybe go for other countries, I would say US is not worth the time and effort atm.|||>Does freshers even has a chance to land an interview?  Yes.  >a remote job paying around $800-$1k per month  For a fresher extremely rare.|||If you are fresher expecting that much of pay is a bit hard in today’s situation.|||Yes, I'm working at a singaporean based startup for around similar amount, the interview is quite intimidating, but it my case it went ok|||Network xa vane matra pauxa easily natra it is very hard.

I was wrong.   Yes, landing a remote job means you earn in foreign currency and enter the top 10 percent of earners in Nepal even if you earn 500 USD per month (72k).   BUT..  Without learning a proper skill  (don't expect companies abroad to take you in and teach you like a fresher cause they will have local people to do that) , you won't be hired and won't stand out.   Proper skills are like maybe software, copywriting, sales skills, tech skills, ai developers etc that allows you to work from anywhere.",

Many of us work online as freelancers, remote workers, entrepreneurs, content creators, and people whose families depend on online income. But one of the biggest barriers we face is the lack of **international payment platforms** in Nepal, such as **Stripe, Wise, and similar genuine services**.  Right now, our options are extremely limited. Some platforms charge high fees, have strict rules, or make withdrawals difficult. Over time, this doesn’t just become inconvenient; it becomes **deeply frustrating and discouraging**.  To be honest, I’m starting to feel **hopeless**. This is not a new problem for me. I’ve been facing this issue for **almost five years**, and during that time, I stayed quiet, thinking maybe things would improve on their own. They didn’t.  And I know I’m not alone. There are **many people like me,** capable, motivated, working hard, who are facing the same problem but remain silent because they don’t know where or how to speak up.  Nepal is a **landlocked country**, and opportunities within the country are limited. If we want real economic growth, entering the **global digital market** is not optional- it’s essential. Going online is one of the smartest and most realistic ways for Nepalese people to earn, build skills, and bring foreign income into the country.  With a **new revolution, government, and a changing system**, this feels like the right time to finally raise our voice. If enough of us speak up - calmly, respectfully, and together, we can push policymakers and financial regulators to take this issue seriously.  This isn’t just about individual inconvenience. Allowing global payment platforms would:  * Bring more foreign currency into Nepal * Support freelancers, startups, and small businesses * Reduce dependence on limited local options * Encourage entrepreneurship and digital employment  If you work online, plan to work online, or have family members who depend on online income, this issue affects you too.  I genuinely request everyone to share their thoughts, experiences, and ideas:  * Which platforms should Nepal prioritize? * Who should we approach - NRB, ministries, policymakers? * How can we raise awareness collectively?  Please don’t stay silent like I did for years.   If we don’t raise our voice, nothing will change.  Thank you for reading.",

Bunked almost 80% of a semester for unpaid internship. I think if they're letting you work in the capacity of an intern, it's not exactly bad per say.  However, if you're working 40 hours full time a week, you're entitled to a minimum wage of 17.5k.  Ask for a raise. Say a recruiter was offering you minimum wage, and if your job can match that.  It's not much, but it's a more livable wage. My first part time was a 10k some 8 years back, and that barely covered my hostel and maybe a movie night once per month.|||Nepal Youth council le free training khulaai raakhxa,timi Pani kunai skill based training leu.Don't loose your mental health.",

For a trillion dollar company like Huawei these projects are a drop in the sand. CIAA filed a case against 18 NTC employees but all of them have been out on bail for 6 months.  >The CIAA obtained the original documents from the 4G project tender and activated the statement after completing the investigation with the documents and technical assistance.  >A key component costing Rs 700 million for Telecom 4G quality has not been installed.  >China Communication Service International (CCSI), an international agent and representative company for Huawei, is the main culprit in Nepal Telecom’s 4G expansion.  >**The company signed an agreement to install 6,000 small cell equipment but has not done work worth Rs 700 million. The lack of installation has affected the quality of the telecom’s 4G service even in Kathmandu Valley.**  >The agreement included a study of coverage capacity and installation of small cells after completing the 4G infrastructure and other works. The preliminary study showed that around 6,000 small cells would need to be installed during the tender.  >Telecom uses frequencies from three bands for 4G: 800 MHz (low range), 1800 MHz (medium range), and 2300 MHz (2300 MHz band). Despite the agreement, small cells were installed to improve 4G coverage in urban areas, especially in the upper range band.  >High-range frequencies have low coverage, while low-range frequencies lack good coverage in underground and deep places. Small cells were installed to improve coverage in densely populated areas.  >Huawei has been working against the agreement, degrading the quality. Although the agreement mentioned using equipment from the US, Canada, Europe, Finland, and Australia, Huawei used Chinese antennas due to availability issues in the US and Europe. The CIAA is  also investigating use of  the equipment beyond the agreement.  >NTC officials say the expected quality has not been maintained due to these reasons.  >The NTA  had already warned Huawei’s weaknesses as a vendor were behind the poor 4G quality in Nepal. After research and consumer experience revealed poor performance, the NTA alerted Telecom and Huawei.  >Huawei, responsible for supplying and installing most of the equipment through Hong Kong company ‘CCSI’, repeatedly violated the agreement and installed inferior equipment. Huawei has been weakening the quality by violating standards for technology and equipment to improve and sustain quality and the agreement.

Building out the 5G network in the US has required hundreds of billions of dollars of investment.  >To cut costs, much of the early 5G infrastructure was built by tweaking existing 4G sites. This approach, known as non-standalone 5G, offers efficiency but delivers a 4G-like experience.  >Another thing that was supposed to be really different about 5G was the introduction of millimeter waves, which can theoretically provide much greater capacity. They are useful in select locations where crowds really pack in like stadiums or airports.  >But in general, the distance they travel is so short and these waves are so easily blocked that widespread use in mobile networks just hasn't made a lot of sense, and many smartphones don't even support them.  >The thing is that for most people and most purposes, 4G was already good enough.  >Coverage — not speed — is one of the biggest problems we still face.  >The Costly Reality  >The three major US phone carriers spent over $100 billion on licenses to use the frequencies.  >That doesn't include the cost of upgrading 4G sites to 5G or of building tons of new cell sites, which has required billions more dollars in investment.  >However, they have struggled to monetize 5G, with monthly phone bills decreasing because of competition. The average revenue per user has been trending downwards even as investment from carriers has risen, putting them in a difficult position.  >The Race  >Because telecommunications is of massive economic and social importance equipment vendors — those who sell the actual infrastructure like antennas — and industry trade groups can lobby government officials, telling them that the next generation will be essential and transformative — and that if they don't act quickly, they might miss out on the benefits.  >This pressure contributed to the narrative that the US and other nations were engaged in a global \"5G race.\"  >In turn, politicians who are most likely not telecoms engineering experts but might also be eager to implement new infrastructure projects see this as a no-risk position. Who wouldn't want to align themselves with the next frontier of technological innovation?  >This rush could have resulted in many of these problems, including the decision to start with non-standalone 5G networks, and the the failure of 5G to differentiate itself from 4G in the eyes of consumers.  >But 5G was also rushed in the planning phase.  >Developing a plan for a new generation usually takes about 10 years, but 5G was rushed out in just eight. This was partially because of global political pressure, and because Japan planned a splashy 5G debut for the 2020 Olympics, even though it ended up delayed a year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  NCELL probably tested NTCs 4G speed and also decided minimal 4G tower investment. ChatGPT says -  * **Real-world speeds:**    * Good networks: **50–100 Mbps**    * Excellent conditions (LTE-Advanced): **100–200 Mbps**  **100-200 Mbps on 4G** is achievable with proper spectrum allocation, carrier aggregation, and modern backhaul without needing full 5G upgrades.",

Look at Indonesia it follows Sufism mixed with agakhani sect do we hear minorities being treated badly? No. Mostly it's the south Asian Muslims who are radical because they follow a very strict islam of deubandi and wahabism school of thought which has caused problem historically it's moderate example would be creation of Taliban and extreme example is creation of Pakztan. Now contrary to that you've Indonesia which is also a majority Muslim nation but follows Sufism school of thought which is why they are much more liberal. They're okay with currency having Ganesha, okay with garuda being national symbol(coat of arms), and even okay with naming kids from Sanskrit derived names like majority of their head of the states have Sanskrit origin names there will be some ups and downs in writing because Indonesia didn't follow devanagari it followed the Brahmi script earlier, in that way it's still preserving the culture. But if you tell this to a MUSLIM.from south Asia he will say it's shirk/haram in islam and that being associated with polytheism is bad and that they are a lost tribe of Turks and Arabs who had invaded our land. So, wahabism and Deubandi unless remained will not allow for inclusivity among the people islam factor will be there no matter what|||Can't decide which is the worst religion - Islam or Hinduism.

If that is not the case here, then it's wrong and us Indians should accept that. 3. Nepal is a beautiful country. People have more civic sense and overall better sense of community and cohesion from what I have seen.  4. What Nepali people have to understand is India is a big country 1.4 billion people is a lot. So, of all the counties in the world, India is probably the only one you should never generalize. 6. Both Nepali and Indian people can have good relationship with each other, just learn to talk properly and not take things to ego. 6. Yes, India is a bigger economy, and has more resources, but it is not in competition with Nepal. Nepal has it's own strengths that it should not forget.  7. Open border has it's pros and cons. Yes, many Nepali are in India, do they get to build a life, yes. Do they get discriminated, yes, and so are Indians from other states. And Nepali also discriminate against Indian tourists and workers. 8. Always remember, most average Indians will probably only have good will towards Nepal and no hate.  9.

Firstly, I think Nepalis being able to speak Hindi is a plus point. It makes us multilingual, which makes them comfortable. We've always prided ourselves for being more tolerant than India and also hospitable. I don't see a problem in using a language that we know. If you go to Spain and you talk to people in English, are you expecting people there get offended too? And before you say English is an international language, Spanish has more speakers than English.   Secondly, Nepal is not just Kathmandu. There are communities in the south that use Hindi as their language. Even Nepali marwadis in Kathmandu use it. It is one of the 120+ languages used in Nepal. You saying Hindi bad kinda implies they are not Nepalis.   Thirdly, you make an issue with Indians assuming Nepalis are Indians, while you're similarly assuming India is just north India. South Indians generally don't speak Hindi. They speak English. South Indians have a much better impression of Nepal.   Indians generally don't think Nepal is a part of India. But we're bordered with UP and Bihar, which are not exactly places that are particularly respectful. A lot of them think Nepal is a place with similar cultures so it's a safe and beautiful place to visit where they don't have to deal with much cultural shock. It's just that they often overstep boundaries (pun intended) and try to get overly close, which kind of freaks us out because Nepalis are more reserved than Indians imo.|||Protect your language and mother tongue.|||This post has been tagged as serious.

Most Indians understand Nepali, and many of them actively try to learn it as well. One Indian colleague even speaks Nepali as fluently as we do.  Over time, you realize that people genuinely make an effort to learn each other’s languages. South Indians generally have strong English skills, but many of them don’t speak Hindi, while people from other regions may not speak English as fluently. So they talk in Hindi when they saw us.|||Hindi xodeiu sathi ma mandarin pani sikdai xu largest diaspora, you don't know how easy it will be once you able to connect with them in their language.

I was surprised to learn that China and Korea mandate all their cartoons to be in their own language and that is just one example but for me Nepali feels quiet foreign and as someone who did my entire schooling in Nepal upto +2, I don't know how to read Nepali fluently and have a terrible handwriting. I dont even think in Nepali for the most part as most of the cartoons back in my day were all in English.   So, I think what is happening now is that we are trying to rescue a building that is already burned to ashes and blaming things that have nothing to do with us. India is a massive country and just a few encounters with a few assholes shouldn't be generalized. I lived in India for 4 years for my Bachelors and I would find a few of such people that were illterate and assumed Nepal speaks Hindi but I had the vast majority that did not have that assumption. What we need now is to rebuild what has been burned as atleast I feel like I have already suffered the damages. We need to focus on teaching kids to be comfortable with Nepali just as much as Hindi and English. I think having Hindi as an additional language is almost like a superpower as you get access too all their free educational content on Youtube and its always a better thing to know a few extra languages. I think this anti Indian sentiment will really hurt us in the long run and we need to make sure we have diplomatic and peaceful ties with both our neighbors|||Yes, we should not normalize Hindi..

Well my dad is a nonchalant but he always had a healthy relationship with mom and I grew up believing women can be trusted, but yeah… it’s cruel out here 😭|||it wasn’t my parents, but i actually have seen my grandparents do this for each other, grateful :)|||Yk when friends are sharing about their home, family everytime everyone comes from a broken home, with daddy issues, mommy issues, dad living away from them and when they ask you about yours how do you reply??  I come from a really happy loving family, my grandparents love my mother more than their own daughter (something I shouldn't say but it's true and my fupus love her more than them k. my grandpa is so proud of my mother. it's so wholesome) my parents are really great. My fupus, my mamaghar they are all so great. I have really healthy family tara when someone is talking about their broken family and asks me about mine I lie.

A lil bit of my story id like to share here. My dads sorta nonchalant and doesnt really show much love to my mom every now and then but its not that he doesnt love her. Ofc he does but he has become a lil more expressive in these few years. Thats maybe cuz when i was a kid, no one would be there to guide him or at least teach him how to show love. Ani mero mumma chai ekdamai childish and clingy cuz shes the youngest and most loved. Ani as my dad didnt really like those things being all clingy, romantic stuffs and every other couple things earlier, they used to fight a lot verbally not physically. But growing up, i defended my mom, became her best friend to talk to and to visit places and also involved my dad in those things and then he started doing all those romantic and cute stuffs like bringing flowers sometimes, gifting her something sweet or like just talking to her sweetly and showing a bit more of love and affection. And to see that change on my dads behavior is something that ill cherish forever. Ani aile aba they know that im able to identify many things and they actually believe that i can teach them something, ani ma papa lai yesto garshyo mumma will like it type of advice haru and all dirakhthe ani my nonchalant and baap wala dad has become a more softer, lovable and cutiepatotie version in these years.   So, i feel like my dad just followed what my grandfather did to my grandmom. He didnt know how to show love cuz he never saw what it looks like but after these many years and with my little bit of guidance and direction, he has changed and my mumma really really likes the way he is right now and is happier than ever.|||Great that you see the great example for men and also having similar standard. But it is a 2 way street. I believe your mother is an incredible woman thus he is showing so much care and effort. You have to be that type of woman to expect that type of men.

I vote yes.|||Gaarai hunxa sustain garna. Cause not many movies are released on IMAX, only mostly Hollywood blockbusters. And few cinephiles and movie enthusiasts maybe willing to pay extra and enjoy the IMAX experience but it's a very small number.|||It is extremely difficult to have a true IMAX theater. The Imax film is insanely huge. Transporting it safely, then a team who can actually operate IMAX is needed and the cost is obviously gonna be off the charts. Plus, most people in Nepal won't even be able to afford tickets. So it's highly unlikely we'll get IMAX thetre anytime soon. Even most (if not all) the IMAX theatres in India aren't true IMAX theatres. They're all projected digitally I think. Testo khalko IMAX chahi maybe we can get sometime in the future. Idk about that. Hopefully we do.|||Nope: imax is expensive tech. License will cost millions: tickets will be in thousands. It’s impossible to achieve scale with this technology.|||Who's gonna invest? Who's gonna watch? I also think IMAX would be great and would like to watch movies there, but I don't see a big market for both investors and people who watch it. Normal Hollywood movie nai 600+ xa tickets aile. Jhan IMAX ayo vani 1800+ hunxa sure. Who's gonna watch paying that much? Maybe there are some rich people BUT not big enough market for investors to feel secure of ROI.|||IMAX ma movie herna paunu would be a dream come true. I think it’s a dream for many of us cinephiles. But to be realistic, there’s no way we’re getting IMAX here in Nepal.  As many people in the comments have already mentioned, it’s expensive, hella expensive. Bringing IMAX itself is costly. Then there’s the cost of maintenance and operation, which is huge. I don’t think any sane investor would want to take that risk.  Even the cinema halls we have right now, which I won’t say are great, but are at a decent level, aren’t able to upgrade themselves properly or even run consistently. So there’s no way IMAX is happening.  I also read some of your other comments where you said many cinephiles would be willing to come to Kathmandu to watch movies in IMAX. I agree. For any cinephile, watching their favorite movie in IMAX would be a dream come true. But IMAX isn’t a one-time thing; it needs regular footfall. No one is going to keep coming to Kathmandu every time just to watch a movie. It’s not time-feasible, money-feasible, or practical in any way.  Even in India, with such a massive population, maintaining IMAX is a big challenge. Now think about Nepal. Nepal is a small country with a relatively small population. There’s simply no way IMAX could sustain itself here.  On top of that, I recently read that many youth-focused businesses, movies, restaurants, cafes, clothing stores, are already struggling because the youth population is decreasing. Compared to decades ago, there are far fewer young people in the country now. Even these businesses are finding it hard to survive.  In a situation like this, there’s no chance anyone will invest in bringing IMAX to Nepal. Realistically, we’re never getting IMAX here because we just can’t sustain it.  That said, like you, I also wish I could watch my favorite movies in IMAX. IBut yeah I was just being realistic.|||if there was market to justify the investment, we'd have IMAX already.|||I don’t think there’s a market lol. Even regular prices are expensive, imagine double triple that.|||We don't need that shit. We just need a 4k native screens.|||It does not|||No, the maintainance cost is too high for IMAX|||No|||Skyrocket on Popcorn, and cold drinks price|||Nope.|||Noo lmao  Probably wouldn't succeed to run it|||yes we do and people worry about a their wallet. imax provides movie experience than any other cinema they use cameras used for space the quality of the is 4k from a projector the sound is ass shattering and i think a 1000rs is justifiable|||I votes yes cus I would also want those exclusive popcorn buckets and even some freebies and the most important of all those 4d seats|||Unless Nepali film industry makes 10 imax movies atleast a year, it will never happen, it’s that simple.|||No. You would be in the minority who would pay 1000+ for imax tickets. There's a reason why even places like australia, the vast majority of the population does not care about imax. Also, how many movies are actually made for imax, very few so its really not that important.|||Have you watched avatar 3 ?|||Bro these comments. 1000rs ma Imax re bro are u fr?

Atleast in sl, the tickets are double the price. If it's worth it or not is upto the individual but it's for sure a different experience. If u dont like cinema's in general then Imax won't change it. If u do, then yes it's worth it but for select movies which are almost all Hollywood ones.|||Yeahh broo Nepal ma ni auta imax theater ta hunu parni ho k manchhe haru lai India janu parchha|||Not a big enough market to sustain. Maybe during big blockbuster releases they might be able to sell a few tickets. But most of the year they'd have to endure a huge operating cost. Maybe in a few years it might be viable but as an investor better put money elsewhere|||As a movie lover, yeah.|||What is one less than imax? I think that might be better.|||the amount it would require to build one is too expensive and i don't think nepal has any malls that would be able to incorporate it.|||Not worth it|||Actual imax theater hunu paryo not that digital one.|||tbh maybe no.. cause i am in nyc rn and a regular imax goer. to function the imax screen is no joke the cost is sooo high that only few theaters can afford. even in usa these are not very common. tho there are talks about installing new screens across the country before The Odyssey but the same problem,,, it is so expensive.  and again not every movie shines better on imax screen. most of the movies looks awful.

            "body": "you like a girl a lot, but she doesn't give a fuck about you, it happens to everyone not just you so stay calm.   By the time you read this, you will understand how to win a girl.   KT pattauna vaneko point based system ho.  Australia ko PR jastai. (last funny sunincha but is true, comment ladies if you agree)   Kt euta kura le matra pattidaina, sabai kura chaincha vanna khojeko ni haina hai feri.   (its kinda complex but you will understand if you keep reading)   Each segment hits one point to your dream girl so its really important you hit as many points as possible to get the girl.   For example, there may be a really handsome guy in your circle but hes not getting his dream girl. its because he hits just one point \"handsome\" and does not hit many other.   There may be a very rich guy in your friend circle but he may be just be being used for the money, and he's still chasing after that girl.   Because usle \"money\" point matra hit garyo and very few other.   So what are the points?  - Face Card (1 point)   Face matters, but not too much, face ramro cha vane 1 point payeu.   - Hygeine and Gromming (1 point)   Not too much again, cream powder tira lagyo vane yo 1 point ni 0 huncha feri, ramro getup, good frequency ma shower, proper hair and well fitted clothes, thats all you need to capture this point.   - Athletic (1 point)  This goes down to thousands of years, if youre muscular, athletic, fit, fine, abs, toned you get 1 point.    - Confidence (1 point)   Thau ma bolna sakne, but not over confident, if you look overconfident usko agadi, she wont say wow this guy, she will say desperate muji.   - Smell ( 1 point)  Hygenine vanda seperate because if you smell good, soapy, woody, point badyo in her mind, very light subtle perfume ko smell aaos, just najikai huda matra feel hos and you will earn 1 point.   - Financially Set (1 point)  Bau ko paisa hola, wa afai kaam garera ramro paisa kamaira hola, j hos, if youre financially set, 1 point payeu.   - Communication (1 point)   Talk properly in person, dont use too many emojies online, dont act like a 5 year old infront of her, 1 point for communication.   - Respect, Boundaries and Decisions (1 point)   Respect her boundaries, not creepy, not clingy or toxic. And yes, shes just a girl but she can make her own decisions too.   - Ambitious and Career Centric (1 point)   Elon musk jasto rocket company nai kholna parena, life ma hya k garne k vanne jasto kta chai hunu vayena, girls will like you if you have a vision and plan for the future, be ambitious to earn 1 point)    - Emotional Security (1 point)   Girls are full of emotions, kaile kahi they may want to pour it all and share with you but she wont if youre jealous, psycho, or possessive.   Calm, mannerful, trusting ani supportive huna siknu paryo 1 point payeu.    - Available but not everytime (1 point)  If youre always there everytime, thats not maya, thats being bhikhari for her, be available but youre a man, you also need to have things that keep you busy and she will understand that youre busy, 1 point for this.   - And bonus point  Photos online, we meet hundreds of people every week, for a girl to like you and remember you, you need to have nice photos ideally on instagram at this age, if you have nice photos in nice clothes in nice places, you again earn a point in her heart.    Thats pretty much it, ladies if i missed anything let me know in the comments.   Maile agi vane jastai, Australia ko PR jastai ho, you need points.   And every girl is her own Australia with her own point requirements, koi kt 3/4 point mai impress huncha, koi lai 8/9 point chaincha.   The rule as a man is to maximize your points to win over the girl.   taile chai kati kt pais vandai hate comment ra downvote garne lai chai malai kei vannu chaina.   if im writing this, i may probably be hugging someone who many would consider their dream girl.   Let me know what you guys think below in the comments, im not a dating coach but ive helped men.",

And honestly, he’s doing a great job.  This has been his approach for a long time. Even when he was at the Nepal Electricity Authority, he used the same method, visiting sites and dealing directly with contractors. There are even videos of him giving direct order to them. This time as well, he’s doing a solid job. Ever since he took charge of the ministry, he’s been working tirelessly, visiting sites, reviewing the progress of projects, and staying involved in the details. The same goes for the Finance Minister and the Education Minister, they also seem to be working really hard.  Coming back to Kulman Ghising, it’s clear that he has long-term plans. He has already said that he will be contesting the election, and I’m pretty sure he’s thinking ahead. If he wins the election, he’ll likely return in full action mode, and all this groundwork will help him once he’s back in power.  Overall, I’m really satisfied with his work. Recently, I also read that the Department of Roads has restarted its road maintenance ambulance service. Now whenever there’s an issue on the road, like potholes, they’ll respond immediately. I even saw him inaugurate those Ambulance a couple of weeks ago.  So yeah, overall, he’s doing a very good job, and I’m quite satisfied with the work he’s doing right now.|||He deserves the accolades.

Be angry that the tax isn't used for anything useful.    We need strong, dependable, reliable public transit. Private cars are a bandaid. I would gladly not have a private car if it meant a strong, reliable, affordable, accessible, 24/7 public transit. It is possible now more than ever with something as simple as bus rapid transit and hopefully eventually a real metro where there is enough demand but we must start somewhere.    First thing first, we should absolutely stop bharti kendra culture. I don't see this happening. |||300 percent tax haleko ta xa but infrastructure ustai decades ago ko xa, yo dalaal haru le lutnu luteko ho yar desh ta|||finally nepali people are realizing how heavily we're taxed lol|||This needs to be discussed more and seriously. 300% tax for vehicles in this day and age is ridiculous. An average Nepali has to spend their entire life saving on one friggin car. Public transportation is a joke here. The only options left are either motorbikes or scooters. They are not safe, not appropriate for all weather conditions and fuck your back after certain age.   Tax line nai vaye, tyo utheko tax explicitly public transportation, education ra health ma invest garyo vane people will at least feel they are contributing to something.|||this is no joke & is a really big problem. Daily necessity is treated like luxury in Nepal.  Many people cannot afford to get bikes and cars even though they want to cause even the cheapest cars are seen as a luxury in Nepal due to the prices.   You often see politicians driving the Cars woth over 2crores in Nepal and the price doesn't matter to them cause it's easy money for them.  But  average under paid middle class people working their ass off barely afford a good bike.|||I am fine with this much tax if the public transport infrastructure was good enough.|||Gov should improve public transport and encourage people to use it. And the tax is way to much but it should be decrease but I don't think gov can sustain this as this is one of the source of revenue.

Simply, to put we've low forex reserves and in order to protect that gov makes sure its not incentivised as it would further decrease the forex reserve, other way to look at it is to boost the local manufacturers. Which is why a car worth 35Lakhs NPR in Australia will be 2CR in Nepal, not by choice but to not incentivise it and gov and some other important works to do.|||They are putting the tax money into their pocket.

You feel lost in those reactions and might even get out of your mind just looking at them. But listen to the tale, the story of how learning really happens. I don't know if you play games like Free Fire, PUBG, Royale, or something else. Ask yourself how you remembered all the gun names, location names, and the different things in them. How you remembered a whole 3-hour-long story you watched years ago? Treat these things the same way. Connect with them. Practice writing out the reaction yourself. Guess how they could pair up and react to give products. In the beginning, you will make mistakes, but slowly you will get used to it. Just know the reaction types: what acid-base rxns do, salts, catalysts, how oxidants and reductants work in any reaction.

            "body": "My college head and a friendly botany teacher who has seen thousands of students always says just do enough to pass all subjects. Thats it. Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

            "body": "I'm currently looking at my options for a Bachelor's degree here in Nepal. I have a 3.0 GPA (science). I'm in a bit of a dilemma and would really appreciate some advice from this community: BBA vs. BBS? I'm leaning towards a management degree, but I'm unsure about the key differences between BBA and BBS programs in Nepal, especially regarding career prospects and curriculum rigor. Given my science background, which one might be a better fit?  Best Colleges near Lalitpur? Could anyone recommend the top-tier management colleges located near Lalitpur/Patan?  Am I too late for admissions? I just passed out in 2025. Have admission cycles already closed for this intake?  The Abroad Factor:  My primary reason for joining a local college immediately is to avoid a gap year, just in case my visa application for abroad studies gets rejected down the line. I want to have a safety net and continue my education smoothly. Any insights, recommendations for colleges, or general advice on navigating admissions timelines would be incredibly helpful right now.",

At the moment, i would suggest you to keep doing your jobs and garnering your skills so you land up one job with a handsome pay. Good luck.|||dude you're just like me, but 10 years ago. i've been exactly where you are and it sucks ass. i had to maintain multiple jobs because none would pay on time, and i had to support my parents and two siblings. so when i say i know what you're going through, i mean it. and as much i appreciate people being nice here, no one (except for one) is trying to help you navigate this shituation.  the one thing that you need more of isn't money or opportunities, its time. **you need more time**. more time for proper sleep, more time to gather your thoughts, more time to pause and evaluate your current situation, more time to plan out the next few months. you're like a engine that's constantly running 24/7, and you haven't had the chance to rest for a single moment, and it sucks soooo much because as much as you want to stop, you just can't. its all on you, everything depends on you, and you have to keep moving, or else everything will fall apart. and this will only end one way, and its not good dude.  thats why you have to take your time back. you need at least 2 more hours of sleep (sleeping an hour early and waking up 30 minutes late). at least 1 hour of free time to plan your next steps. you weekends need to be for yourself, and yourself alone. whatever precious time you have, you keep it and don't let anyone or anything take it from you.   if you have college every morning, talk with the administration and ask them to let you check-in an hour late - explain your situation, tell them that you have no other option; this worked for me, and will work for you.  if you have small spare time where its not too long to start working but not too short to just sit around (like 25-40 minutes of downtime), just get to the next task/next job. baru duita day shifts ko bich ma kei downtime hunai nadeu. inform your office you'll arrive early and leave early. explain that you have a tight schedule and you don't want to waste your time. companies will try to make up some nonsense about proper timing and all that bullshit but don't let them bully you to submission. ask them to understand your situation, and make up shit like you also study and go to college everyday and do your assignments daily because you're a weak student, and normally don't get enough sleep because of that, so instead of just wasting time after college, you just come to work early - you know, make it sappy if that helps. but whatever you say, make sure that they let you leave early. take back your time.  if this helps you gather even 1-2 hours extra everyday, thats the time you can invest on yourself now. if you can get home by 5pm instead of 6:30pm, thats around 3 hours before your night shift starts. you can use that time to either plan your next move. work on your portfolio. add things to your showreels that you wish you could but weren't allowed to. talk with your parents about what you're going through and ask them to help you with planning for the future. like the other user said, actually start tracking all your expenses and see where all your money is going. excel is free in the browser, and you can search for \"excel free budget templates\". categorize all your expenses and see where the money is being wasted. do you smoke regularly? are your lunches expensive? is your electricity bill too high? not a single rupee goes untracked. you need every penny to be accounted for. if there's an unnecessary expense, cut it out completely. the more you can save, the easier it will be for you.  you can also request your night shift company to let you start early, and end early. sounds like it's a remote job, so your reasoning could be that you're already free by 6pm, and instead of waiting around, you'd like to start early when you're still feeling energized and not drained of energy by 3 in the morning. you can give your work report by 12 midnight and go to sleep 30 minutes early, even.  if you travel by bus or micros, take that time to complete errands that can be done via your phone. create a checklist for what you need to do before you can apply for better jobs. look for potential companies that have a good company culture (normally has better pay too). connect with past colleagues online just to say hi (this one might feel weird at first but its better to say hi how are you rather than hi do you have a job in your company). update your expense tracking sheet. look for templates and plugins that can help your portfolio be better than the rest.  spend every single free minute to get yourself on a better situation.  you're drowning every hour every day, but you're taking the first step towards pulling yourself out. it's going to be difficult the next few months and you may feel more drained than ever, but if you do all these for yourself, you'll be in a much better mental state in the next couple of months. here's to hoping that you update us in a few months that you got a job that pays as much as all three jobs combined 🤞  all the best. do yourself proud.|||On person told me, rather focusing making money from 2-3 small jobs. Be professional at single then! You can make more from one single job.  But right now I'm also in your situation searching for day jobs.|||I just want to add one more thing…  if anyone here knows about any freelance work, side gigs, or small online jobs, I’m more than willing to take them too. Anything that can help me earn a little extra and reduce some of this pressure would honestly mean a lot.|||Find something you can release your emotions, for me it's futsal or dota. Give 1 hour to yourself to go through and talk about it or write about. It will give you a different perspective on life. And yeah kudos to you. You are doing great. In future turn your 3 jobs to 1 and keep money consistent.|||The first thing that matters is mental peace, I know its easy to say but once you figure that out.  Everything will be same but you will be different  Try meditating, clearing your mind. Once you have a clear mind you can think.  The more you panic, the more it gets worse. Thinking about the future and trying to make life better is good but when you over think the same thing over and over, that thought is what making you demotivated not the situation. If you can’t change the situation, don’t over think it.  I know its hard, but don’t loose the hope.  Stay calm, plan and proceed and will be a matter of time you see the changes.  It is a process not an immediate action. At the end its you and I know someone who is handling everything as you said can do lot better in life. Don’t forget, Some people dream to be in your place. Be positive. You got this.|||I hear you can make more with pathao or similar ride services as a rider.|||Keep the hustle going. Peace 🙏|||i am not the sole earner    but similar situations   i feel you bro|||Try putting all your income and expenses into an Excel sheet. It really helps to see where your money goes. If you have any debts, create a small, steady repayment plan so they don’t keep snowballing.      Separate essential and non-essential expenses, even small adjustments can make a difference. And try to save at least a tiny amount each month. Even a symbolic sum gives a bit of control and stability.      Look at how much free time you have outside of work and try to set aside a small, consistent window to learn skills that are in demand. Little steps add up and can help you increase your income over time.      I’ve been in a similar situation myself, and I know how heavy it can feel. But it is possible to climb out of it slowly, with small steady actions. You’re already doing an incredible amount, don’t be too hard on yourself. You’re stronger than you think, and you’re not alone.|||You are a legend for doing that, god will bless you and open your path|||Good luck 👍 |||Is it just you and your parents ?

The person is required to follow the court orders, e.g., appearing in court on the date of hearings/schedules and not leaving a specific area or boundary, and following any other orders set by the court. If any of these orders are violated, the bail money is forfeited.

            "body": "As it says, I recently got this and was hoping for some help, especially on the markings. There isn’t a ton of info on these in English so I figured I’d do to the source. My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6. This is probably the longest shot of them all, but any ideas what species of critter might have eaten up the stock at one point?

During the Rana regime (1846–1951), gun manufacturing in Nepal was driven largely by the innovative efforts of Gehendra Shumsher, the eldest son of Prime Minister Bir Shumsher, who is widely regarded as Nepal's first scientist and modernizer of the military.   Key Manufacturing Factories  The Ranas established several sites for arms and ammunition production, primarily centered in the Kathmandu Valley and some regional hubs:   Nakkhu (Lalitpur): Notable for producing copies of the Martini-Henry rifle, specifically the \"De-Rifle\" in the late 1880s.  Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.  Jangi Megjin: Originally founded in 1793, it continued to function during the Rana period as a government foundry for manufacturing cannons and military equipment.|||You need someone from the Hanuman Dhoka Museum in Kathmandu.

I used to wish I could just be “normal.”  But after my S.E.E., something changed. That 3-month break gave me a new life. I had my “aha” moment. Somehow, I finally started understanding things. Maybe it was the silence, maybe it was being away from all the noise, maybe it was just loneliness giving me space to think. But everything shifted.  I taught myself how to code. I got a job as a software developer. I didn’t finish my degree because my college wouldn’t let me work while studying, so I said “forget it” and focused on work. It was well paid, and nobody asked for a degree anyway. So yeah, I’m a dropout who made it this far.  I’m still not “super smart,” but I’m definitely smarter than the version of me back then. I still have tics, they still distract me sometimes, but I’m living with it.  I just needed to get this off my chest. I’ve kept it inside for too long.  **And to anyone reading this who feels like they’re slow, or not smart, or different:**   I hope you find your moment too. I hope you realize that you’re not broken. Sometimes loneliness or silence gives you a new life. You grow in ways you don’t even notice at first. You don’t have to be a genius to make it. You just have to keep going. If I can do it, anyone can.  Stay strong. You’ll get your moment too.      ***Note: Yes, I did use ChatGPT to improve this text, mainly to fix grammar mistakes. I hope that’s alright.***",

And he even categorized questions, contents based on level like basic, intermediate, advanced and so on. And he even used to add the most prominent mathematician in each chapter. That I even consider a some form of research. Not every research has to wear a PhD hat. So for me, I consider his contributions in mathematics to be highest in Nepal.

But when it comes to GTM, growth, marketing, or just figuring out how to actually sell and scale a product… there’s a huge gap.  Most startups here are run by tech engineers, and naturally, the focus is on building the product perfectly. That’s great, but then things like growth strategy, customer acquisition, positioning, and distribution get ignored. People just assume if you build it, users will come. Spoiler: they don’t.  Most of the startups here in Nepal fail less because the product is bad, but instead because the distribution/game-plan is weak.   Here in Nepal, GTM skills aren’t really taught, nor are they considered “cool” compared to coding. Most people in IT industrychase programming jobs, freelancing gigs, or outsourcing contracts because that’s a safer bet financially.  I think this is actually a huge opportunity. Someone who can master GTM skis here like: user research, acquisition channels, funnel optimization, sales psychology could easily dominate the startup scene.   Instead of just learning yet another JS framework, you should also learn GTM skills.   What do you guys think?",

            "comments": "Distinguish between these freshers:  \\- One who has contributed a lot to github projects or has something that they have built.  \\- One who is out of college, can do some easy leetcode but have no experience working with large codebases.     Both can be freshers. Who are we talking about here?|||Finding a remote job: Yes, it is definitely possible. Ease of finding one: Moderate chances.  How difficult is it to crack a remote role? It is challenging. It’s not only about how technically proficient you are; companies also evaluate how well you fit culturally. In many ways, being a good people person and collaborating effectively matters just as much as technical skills.  Is it possible for freshers? Both yes and no.  Remote roles have their own dynamics. Some established companies do offer remote positions, while many startups also hire remotely. Freshers often have better chances with startups, as they tend to prioritize cost-effective hiring. Established companies usually have higher expectations, and freshers may not yet meet those requirements.  My experience: I have been working remotely for the past 4 years—2 years with a Singapore-based startup and currently with a UK-based fintech company. LinkedIn was the source of connection for both roles. The hiring process involved 5 rounds of interviews, including both technical and behavioral rounds. My tech stack: Backend development (Python, Node.js, etc.).  My suggestion: Explore opportunities across different continents. European companies, in particular, offer excellent work culture and a healthy work–life balance. Don’t limit yourself only to US-based startups. If you’re experienced, start exploring right away. If not, gain solid experience first, build your skills, and hustle hard before targeting remote opportunities.|||In theory, yes. But that's just in theory. Remote jobs are incredibly rare, and extremely competitive when they do come out. Americans apply to hundreds of jobs, not an exaggeration, literally hundreds of jobs to land maybe a dozen interviews. And most of them aren't even freshers.  You could try if you want to, but it's extremely unlikely unless you're a prodigy with actual experience in the industry, or you nepobaby your way through.  Maybe go for other countries, I would say US is not worth the time and effort atm.|||>Does freshers even has a chance to land an interview?  Yes.  >a remote job paying around $800-$1k per month  For a fresher extremely rare.|||If you are fresher expecting that much of pay is a bit hard in today’s situation.|||Yes, I'm working at a singaporean based startup for around similar amount, the interview is quite intimidating, but it my case it went ok|||Network xa vane matra pauxa easily natra it is very hard.

I was wrong.   Yes, landing a remote job means you earn in foreign currency and enter the top 10 percent of earners in Nepal even if you earn 500 USD per month (72k).   BUT..  Without learning a proper skill  (don't expect companies abroad to take you in and teach you like a fresher cause they will have local people to do that) , you won't be hired and won't stand out.   Proper skills are like maybe software, copywriting, sales skills, tech skills, ai developers etc that allows you to work from anywhere.",

Look at Indonesia it follows Sufism mixed with agakhani sect do we hear minorities being treated badly? No. Mostly it's the south Asian Muslims who are radical because they follow a very strict islam of deubandi and wahabism school of thought which has caused problem historically it's moderate example would be creation of Taliban and extreme example is creation of Pakztan. Now contrary to that you've Indonesia which is also a majority Muslim nation but follows Sufism school of thought which is why they are much more liberal. They're okay with currency having Ganesha, okay with garuda being national symbol(coat of arms), and even okay with naming kids from Sanskrit derived names like majority of their head of the states have Sanskrit origin names there will be some ups and downs in writing because Indonesia didn't follow devanagari it followed the Brahmi script earlier, in that way it's still preserving the culture. But if you tell this to a MUSLIM.from south Asia he will say it's shirk/haram in islam and that being associated with polytheism is bad and that they are a lost tribe of Turks and Arabs who had invaded our land. So, wahabism and Deubandi unless remained will not allow for inclusivity among the people islam factor will be there no matter what|||Can't decide which is the worst religion - Islam or Hinduism.

If that is not the case here, then it's wrong and us Indians should accept that. 3. Nepal is a beautiful country. People have more civic sense and overall better sense of community and cohesion from what I have seen.  4. What Nepali people have to understand is India is a big country 1.4 billion people is a lot. So, of all the counties in the world, India is probably the only one you should never generalize. 6. Both Nepali and Indian people can have good relationship with each other, just learn to talk properly and not take things to ego. 6. Yes, India is a bigger economy, and has more resources, but it is not in competition with Nepal. Nepal has it's own strengths that it should not forget.  7. Open border has it's pros and cons. Yes, many Nepali are in India, do they get to build a life, yes. Do they get discriminated, yes, and so are Indians from other states. And Nepali also discriminate against Indian tourists and workers. 8. Always remember, most average Indians will probably only have good will towards Nepal and no hate.  9.

My name is … Khadka, and I’ve been doing an Ausbildung at a Hofladen for the past 7 months. My chef treats me really well, like family.  Last week, I was at an Indian roadside café with my sister and some German friends, waiting for my chef to pick me up before visiting the Weihnachtsmarkt. We were waiting , suddenly two indian boys came to us and we had a short conversation . They were annoying so we started ignoring but they soon started making disrespectful comments like calling me MOMO and then mocking Nepal, our size, economy, and poverty. I didn’t respond with racism, though the conversation got heated.  Coincidentally, my chef was nearby, noticed something was wrong, and later asked if I was okay. I explained everything to him. He took it seriously and suggested legal action.  With the help of my chef’s lawyer, a legal letter was sent demanding an apology and €270 from the men. After a few days, they agreed to pay the money and apologized so the case would not go further.  Fun Fact : I and my sister literally eat MOMO after getting that 270 euro 😭😆  So reason of writing this post was just to sharing the possibility of what wrong can happened and how to handle this things.

No doubt we live in social media bubble and think that people will overwhelming vote UML and maoists out, but if you go to the rural areas(and I have), you see that they still have strong roots there. This is further emboldened by the recent strong statements UML has put out.  The old parties have their base established, and the more the new parties run for election, the more they dilute their own votes. Furthermore, they aren't organized yet to be a major national party and to compete in 165 different constituencies . Most people outside KTM actually hate the protests as they've seen the burning images of government properties.|||It's necessary that they unite and they must too.

RSP will be the second-largest party after CPN-UML, with Congress coming in third. They won’t agree on many decisions, but a new government will still be formed. Congress and UML will form a coalition government with RSP, telling Ravi that failing to do so could mean the death of “democracy” in Nepal and urging him to put aside his ego for the greater good. Ravi will feel suffocated every single night, unable to do anything within yet another coalition government with Congress and UML. Rise and fall.

            "body": "So I (27M) went to India for the first time. I was traveling solo turns out it was a bad idea. It was for work related events. After the event, I decided to explore a few places.   Until the work event, everything was fine. It was great learning and networking in the event. I actually speak Hindi very fluently so communication wasn’t an issue at all. After the event, I wanted to travel and explore.   I had booked a pretty average room for my accommodation. Nothing fancy, just the most budget friendly one I could find. There were a couple of people in the lobby and they greeted me nicely and asked for my ID. I showed them my passport and their faces instantly changed after seeing my Nepali passport. The guy said oh you’re from Nepal. I said yes and the another man said, this doesn’t work, we need to see an Indian ID. They weren’t smiling anymore and were giving me very skeptical looks. I tried not to overthink it. He kept insisting for an Indian ID and I explained to him that I am not from India, it’s my first time here so it’s not possible for me to have an Indian ID. Then they asked me for my contact number and I gave my phone number (didn’t have Indian number). Once again, they kept on asking for an Indian number. I was really surprised seeing their hospitality instantly changed after learning about my identity. Not sure if they did that because I was a foreigner to them or because I was specifically a Nepali guy.   While I was exploring the local market, I went to buy some souvenirs. One shop guy asked me where I was from and I said Nepal. He then started lecturing me saying don’t be close with China. They will do the same to you what Pakistan is doing to us. He kept yapping about how Nepal is a small part of India and that we should be grateful that we have a “bada bhai” like India. I left the shop without saying anything.    I wanted to travel by train but had absolutely zero idea about it. The people weren’t helpful there either. I was asking the various staff in the train station saying I wanna go here where can I find a ticket. They just vaguely pointed go there, it’s over there. Finally one guy at the ticket counter helped me get tickets after nearly couple of hours of running frantically here and there. I told him I’m not from India, traveling by train for the first time. The counter guy gave me a ticket saying this is for general class, it’s not safe to travel there..very crowded and chaotic, after your train arrives, meet the ticket guy and ask him to upgrade to AC compartment. I thanked him and went to the platform. There was a police officer whom I asked about upgrading the ticket. He too said the same thing i.e. meet the ticket guy once your train arrives and he will help you.   I still had about 3-4 hours before my train arrived. I just stayed in the platform watching movie. After the train arrived, I was frantically searching for the ticket guy. One police officer came near me charging with his baton. I was shit scared. He almost charged me saying why are you in the AC compartment with a general ticket in your hand. I was literally shaking at this point and with a shaky voice, I explained him my situation. He said haven’t you been in a train before where are you from. I said I’m from Nepal and he laughed saying oh you guys don’t even have trains there haha. Are you really from Nepal, your eyes don’t look like Nepalese. (I think he was referring to Mongolian eyes). I saw the ticket guy and went to him. He said me go to this seat and I’ll come. Later, he came to me and upgraded my ticket. The journey was a little over an hour long. And I was constantly replaying the entire experience from the hotel to the local market to the train station police guy.    Not sure if I just happened to meet all the wrong people or that everyone is the same there. Either way, I’m not going back to India for a long time. And I haven’t even mentioned the kids constantly following you begging for money, the dirt and litter everywhere, people peeing and even pooping in the open, unnecessary horns, air pollution.   PS: not trying to spread hate— just sharing my personal experience.",

Which cities did you visit, by the way? and as far as I know, many hotels in India especially smaller ones usually avoid foreigners because of paperwork and FRRO/police registration requirements. It’s better to stay at big hotels or resorts while traveling. I personally mostly stay at resorts, especially Club Mahindra ones they’re quite good, with solid service.  Also, try to do everything online in India train bookings, hotels, cabs. That way you’re much less likely to get scammed or harsh treated. Offline train ticket booking is honestly very hectic, even for Indians, so always book train tickets online. Use the official IRCTC website or authorized partners like MakeMyTrip, ConfirmTkt, or Paytm then you won’t face these problems.  And if you remember the time, location, duration, or the office name, you can also register a complaint on the Rail Madad portal or app. Lastly, there’s a huge generation gap in India you’ll mostly hear such racist things from older people or those in the 30–40 age group, but the younger generation is usually nicer and more helpful .You can even see this generation gap while speaking English. If you start speaking English in front of older people, they often treat you like some different person almost a ‘raja sahab’ type. But with the younger generation, it usually doesn’t make much of a difference. Anyway, I hope your journey was safe.|||Ik it might not be feasible, but my go to rule is, when visiting a country, get someone to guide you. A local friend is a must for visit to anywhere.  My grandfather was admitted to the top hospital in Delhi, back in 2017 when we met Ms. A, she was there for her mother from Nepal. Times at hospitals are grey, so we looked out for each other's family while we were there.

My mum had ever gone to Nepal once when she was a teen, as part of a trip under scout guide or something, so when she expressed her wish to go another time, I booked tickets(we had never travelled in an airplane). On regular calls, we had mentioned about this trip, and she insisted we do not stay at hotels but stay with her. She had us visit many places, the one that made a somewhat great impression to me (they all were beautiful) was, I forogt the name, but the riverside place whre they burn as funeral rites, at the bank of the river... that starts with a b...

So after my +2, my family started going full \"bihe gar, bihe gar\" mode. Every morning felt like a marriage proposal interview. I kept saying I wanted to study bachelor’s first, but nobody took me seriously. Typical Nepali parent combo attack.  Then one day, boom they tell me, “We found a good boy.” I hadn't even seen his face; they were like, “Ramro chhora ho.” Girl, I didn’t even know his name.  Fast-forward to the wedding day: Whole gaun dancing, kids running everywhere, DJ blasting Sani Nani. Everyone vibing except me, the bride, who’s just like “ what is happening.”  I finally saw my husband at mandap and yeah, he looked decent but BRO DIDN’T EVEN LOOK at me properly. I swear he stared at the floor more than my face.  Then suhagraat… I was in the room crying like an idiot because I was stressed and scared. But instead of comforting me, man walked in, looked shocked like he saw a ghost, and LEFT. NO WORDS. ZERO. ZILCH.  For the next few days, our communication level = Bluetooth off.  After that, he escaped to KTM faster than a last bench student during assembly. I thought maybe he’d text? Call? Smoke signal? ANYTHING? Nope. Silence.  Dashain time comes, he returns home. I tried walking near him; man literally walked behind us like we're bodyguards. Even then, no talking. I don’t think he even knew my name until his mom spilled it   And the chocolate incident… His sister gave me a packet, so I ate it (obviously). Later I found out it was for gifting the village kids. Bro looked at me like I ate their future   Months passed. Not a single conversation. I started avoiding him too because at this point it's just awkward both sides.  Then post-Dashain, he shows up at my maita to take me back. Whole family treating him like king jwai. He looked scared of the respect   My little sister tagged along with us, thank god, because otherwise we’d walk one hour in complete silence. My man STILL didn’t talk directly to me. He literally whispered to my sister, “Ask what didi wants to eat.” SIR??? HELLO??? I CAN HEAR YOU???  8 months married. 0 conversations. 0 eye contact. 0 progress.  We communicate through: • my sister • awkward glances • chowmein orders • pure telepathy failure  Anyway, idk what this relationship is but at this point we’re basically two NPCs living separately but married by system default 😭",

I thought I had at least 5–7 years to mentally prepare… apparently not.  One random Tuesday, Ama goes, “Babu, we found a girl for you.” I nearly dropped my phone. Girl? For ME? Why?  I saw one tiny photo of you for 0.3 seconds before my dad covered it like it was a government secret. I was like, “Wait— but— who—?” Too late. Wedding prep started.  Wedding Day  Everyone’s dancing, drinking, screaming, having the time of their lives. Meanwhile me = statue mode.  Then I saw you at the mandap.  My brain: “She’s… pretty.” Also my brain: “Don’t look. If you look she’ll know you exist.”  So yes, I stared at the floor like it owed me money. I was SO nervous I forgot how to blink.  Suhagraat  I walked into the room and saw you crying and my entire soul left my body.  I panicked so hard I thought I’d faint. My mind went: “What do I do?? Comfort??? Talk??? DIE???”  So I did the only thing my socially anxious caveman instincts allowed: I LEFT.  First Few Days  Every time I tried to say something, my throat said, “Haha no.” You looked as scared as I felt.  So… Bluetooth off.  Then I got sent to Kathmandu for work and honestly I was relieved because I had no idea how to function around you. I rehearsed texting you like 20 times but never sent anything. If silence was a sport, I was winning gold.  Dashain  I came home thinking, “Okay, this time I’ll talk.” Then I saw you.  Brain: buffering…  I wanted to walk next to you but I didn't want to be creepy or weird, so I walked behind. Like a bodyguard with performance issues.  Then the chocolate incident— I gave that packet to my sister to distribute to kids. When I saw you eating it I didn’t get mad— I got SCARED. Because I didn’t know if I should tell you or just pretend gifting chocolate to villagers was never my plan in life.  After Dashain  My parents forced me to go pick you up from your maita. I was SO nervous I practiced “Let’s go” in front of the mirror like 14 times.  Your family treated me like royalty and I had no idea how to respond except freeze.  Your little sister tagging along was the best thing ever because if it was just us two… That hour of walking would’ve sent me to the hospital.  I DID want to talk to you. Genuinely. But my voice refused to come out whenever I faced you directly.  That’s why I whispered through your sister. “Ask what didi wants to eat” = the bravest sentence I said that day.  Now  8 months married. I still haven’t had the courage to properly talk to you.  Not because I don’t like you— I actually really like you.  I’m just… Terrified. Awkward. Zero experience. And overwhelmed by the fact that I suddenly have a whole wife.  Every day I think: “Tomorrow, I’ll talk to her.” Then you walk into the room and my brain blue-screens.  So yes, we are two NPCs married by system auto-fill. But trust me— I’m trying.  My heart is ready. My mouth is not.|||Xya yesto lamo kasle padhxa ho|||Yeutai manxey le made up scenario post garira cha yo ta.

You feel lost in those reactions and might even get out of your mind just looking at them. But listen to the tale, the story of how learning really happens. I don't know if you play games like Free Fire, PUBG, Royale, or something else. Ask yourself how you remembered all the gun names, location names, and the different things in them. How you remembered a whole 3-hour-long story you watched years ago? Treat these things the same way. Connect with them. Practice writing out the reaction yourself. Guess how they could pair up and react to give products. In the beginning, you will make mistakes, but slowly you will get used to it. Just know the reaction types: what acid-base rxns do, salts, catalysts, how oxidants and reductants work in any reaction.

            "body": "My college head and a friendly botany teacher who has seen thousands of students always says just do enough to pass all subjects. Thats it. Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

I'm in a bit of a dilemma and would really appreciate some advice from this community: BBA vs. BBS? I'm leaning towards a management degree, but I'm unsure about the key differences between BBA and BBS programs in Nepal, especially regarding career prospects and curriculum rigor. Given my science background, which one might be a better fit?  Best Colleges near Lalitpur? Could anyone recommend the top-tier management colleges located near Lalitpur/Patan?  Am I too late for admissions? I just passed out in 2025. Have admission cycles already closed for this intake?  The Abroad Factor:  My primary reason for joining a local college immediately is to avoid a gap year, just in case my visa application for abroad studies gets rejected down the line. I want to have a safety net and continue my education smoothly. Any insights, recommendations for colleges, or general advice on navigating admissions timelines would be incredibly helpful right now.",

My father has been diagnosed with metastatic gallbladder cancer, which is a very aggressive form of cancer. Since the diagnosis, our days have been filled with hospital visits, tests, medicines and treatment plans. On 30 November, he completed another round of chemotherapy. He is fighting bravely, but the side effects and the emotional strain have been extremely difficult for him and for all of us.  we come from very lower middle class family but with a dream to make me engineer and a good human my dad put all his life and sacrificed everything. He worked as a security guard in india din vari ubhiyar kaam garnu vo , hamro sapna pura garna lai and  i still  wonder \"why us\" ? He never consumed alcohol,cigarette, tombakhu or anything that is said to cause cancer now when he is admitted at hospital the main head of the family and i have to lookafter all the expenses i understand why all it happen. the burden of money to manage for studies, run family and survive was really hard for us but he never show us. That dherai chintaa about managing money became the cause for the cancer ig , chintaa le ni cancer hudo raicha. My dad is now ,, he's a cancer patient god!! I was a guy learning and doing everything to pass exams nthg more than that and still use to feel sometime \"life kati garo cha yrr,, Yo sem  ma pass vaidiana and all,,  and suddenly life put me in a place where I had to become the pillar of the family. being student and not even earning it's being extremly hard for us.  I am doing everything possible  via writing, reaching out, asking for help — because I don't want to lose my father. He is still hopeful. He still smiles even on the hardest days.  We have already used all our savings and borrowed money to continue his treatment. The cost of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, scans, tests and medicines has become overwhelming for our family. With the help of kind people, we have managed to raise a little over NPR 3 Lakhs so far, which helped cover the initial cycles, but we still have many more ahead.  I am sharing this post to provide a clear and honest update about our situation. I am not asking anyone to do work on my behalf. Anyone who wishes to support us in any form may do so if they feel comfortable. Even reading this and keeping my father in your thoughts means a lot to us.

Cholangiocarcinoma aka gall bladder cancer. He was 3rd stage when we received the diagnosis. Fortunately, the treatments worked and he's in total remission. He's recovered and cancer free for 4th year running.   He had lesions best the duct, with initial spread to lymph nodes.   We got treatment at Nepal Cancer Research Hospital, Chemo and radiation. And surgery at Teaching Hospital.   I don't remember the exact chemo meds, the radiation was about 17 18 cycles and the surgery went decently well.   There is hope brother, the financial strain was absolutely tough. I don't know if you can it lucky or not but my old man was a civil servant and this was right during COVID-19. I was studying, so had free time and he also didn't have to go to work. Everyone was supportive. I guess we spent close to 15 20 lakhs over all, some of which were covered by insurance and some were donations collected by kins and friends.  So, don't lose hope man. And idk but I would like to suggest consulting Dr Sudip at NCHRC hattiban if you decide to continue here in Nepal since it worked in my case. And it's a specialized facility, and they have a lotta data and experience with this stuff. Also, state of the art equipment.|||I don’t know how you’ll take this advice, because most people only follow mainstream chemo treatment for cancer. But I’ve read many testimonies on X about treating cancer with protocol using ivermectin, fenbendazole and other medicines. Which in most cases treated completely 4th stage cancer after following through the medications for 6 months +. Just letting you know these aren’t that expensive medicines, may be available in Nepal as well if not they’re easily available in India. And can be taken parallel to the current treatment. Found this guy on X “Dr William Makis”. Just sharing what I came across, it’s upto you to make the judgement though. Do your own research. Best Wishes.|||Commenting for better reach and boost to this.. wishing for his speedy recovery 🙏|||Recently, my big sister passed away because of aml (acute myeloid leukemia).

I realized that whenever I spoke Hindi around some Indians, they treated me differently. One employer even started talking to me like I was some “inferior Indian” they could insult anytime. That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.  Growing up in Nepal, almost all TV channels were in Hindi. Indian serials and movies basically forced Hindi onto us. Now I’m choosing to learn Newari and other Nepali ethnic languages instead. I want to promote my own culture, not get mistaken as part of another country.  I don’t want foreigners thinking Nepal = India just because we speak Hindi in movies or daily life. We have our own languages, our own culture, our own identity.  Speaking English abroad and promoting our own languages at home feels like the right direction",

What really gets me is the fact them Indians start speaking in Hindi with fellow south Asians. I see that as them being arrogant and ignorant.|||Never reply in hindi always answer in English, tell them you can understand hindi but cannot speak.|||I tell them I understand but don’t speak. Also most of my Indian colleagues are South Indian and they don’t understand Hindi either.|||Why’d we speak a language we don’t even know well? Just because we can understand some of it, doesn’t mean we have learnt it in the right way. We’ve learnt Nepali and English since childhood and those are the only languages we feel confident in.|||Agree completely. I never entertain anyone who assumes I speak Hindi and doesn't see a difference between our cultures and languages. I never willingly consume Indian media and always try to give Nepali content more of my attention. I think it's high time we did something about the rampant encroachment of not just Indian but also Western culture into our collective psyche.|||Bro, why did you even start speaking hindi ????   Your language is your weapon. Since hindi is not your identity, you have a disadvantage. They look down on you if you speak their language with them. That’s literally saying: you are my master, i will follow you.   You will only be a sidekick on someone else’s story.   You have more control and power over your own language. You can say anything in Nepali and no one can correct you cus you are the native speaker. You are fluent and can express yourself better. That gives you the leverage to take a stand for yourself.   I am surprised, that you used to speak hindi man. You compromised your language for their convenience. Ofcourse they will treat you like their follower.   But i am glad you realised your mistake.|||Lived in the states for 18 yrs, never responded in Hindi. In fact, respond them with English, which for most Nepalese, is better in terms pronunciation than theirs.|||I have true blooded Nepali family (I am also true blooded Nepali myself) and they say it’s the same thing. I say why wouldn’t you speak Hindi to communicate with these guys and they say it’s an identity thing. We are not Hindi, we are Nepali. it’s like a kinda stand on business kinda thing. “we are not just an offshoot of India we are better” kinda thing, and I get it lol|||Well most Indians don't speak Hindi anyway. I live in Delhi and even I speak more English than Hindi. Anyway, like some guy here said language is just a medium of exchange. I doubt the people who are making you feel inferior will automatically stop doing so if you stop communicating in Hindi. You should search other remedies.|||I've faced the same at an apple care Tokyo. Seeing us the technician request another to guide us. One indian man arrived with loud tone \"Kya Problem hai Bhaiya ?\". I said I don't understand Hindi can we communicate in English ? He went back and the previous technician came to guide us again. The problem with my iPad remain unsolved though.  But if somebody (Normally senior citizens) asks for help in Hindi, I help them with my broken hindi.|||It’s been 10 years since I watched Indian movies or listened to hindi songs. I can’t even name a single post 2015 actor, singer or celebrity. I haven’t seen Indian content except for a few educational or academic contents and even that is rare.|||Agreed.

I was talking to the owner he asked me where are you from? I told him I’m from Nepal. He then said Toh Phir Hindi Bolo Na Ek Hi toh bhasa hai. I told him do you speak Nepali cuz I don’t speak Hindi. So from that day I have stopped speaking in Hindi to Indians and other people I only speak in English.|||Exactly.  Most Nepalis think it shows intelligence or something by speaking Hindi or broken hindi.  Speaking hindi as a Nepali is the best way to show that we are somehow part of India.   I have also seen firsthand that that some Indians will treat you shittier if you speak their language. Its not all indians, but there are too many.   Cmon people have some self respect. |||Yes, either speak Nepali or English, no other language|||wtf even talk in hindi|||I don’t really hang around Indians that much and whenever I do I just say I don’t understand Hindi at all. Which forces them to talk to me in English. Also whenever I mention I’m Hindu they’re like we have the same religion and all. I like to tell them that even tho we have the same religion our practices are different and I am not familiar with their practices and beliefs. I just try to separate myself and our country from them as much as I can, cause we’re not the same. I don’t like those who try to be like them in terms of everything. Like please have your own identity.|||Yaar ma hindi YouTube channel kholnu lako I'm Nepali but Indian audience is large 😭🙏💔🥀|||[deleted]|||It's unfortunate you had that experience, but Hindi is the 3rd most spoken language in the world, right behind English and Mandarin.   To tell someone to stop speaking that language isn't going to fix the issue. You should be confident and talk to the people who make you feel this way that Hindi is not your native language and you can only converse in a limited way. Any person who insults you by considering you \"inferior\" is stupid and arrogant. You have to call them out on it.   Since you are in Canada, there are many people who speak French. And French is the 6th most spoken language in the world. If you can learn it and speak, that'd give you a boost in talking to more people. It doesn't always have to be English.   Language is just a medium to communicate. It doesn't belong to any particular nation or a group of people. Don't be afraid to speak out your thoughts.   In Nepal, if you can't speak English well, the people consider you illiterate. It doesn't matter how good you can speak Nepali or a native language.  It's the behaviour and expectations of people in language that's judged.|||Bruh you need job application|||I dont think hindi is the problem here,instead that emploer.|||We should tell that to Nepali wanna be Bollywood’s artists also.|||This but speaking in hindi for indian tourist, why do we do that?|||It always depends on personal experience.

I used to say no, i am from nepal. But i started straight up saying i am not indian instead of nepal. Cuz the more i said nepal as a answer to they \"which state are you from\" question, i found them interpreting it as something like nepal is a part of india🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ and if someone asks me 'Are you from india?' I just say 'No' and that's the end of my answer. 😆😆😆 it bugs people so much and unless people ask me 'where are you from' i just avoid that question after 'No'|||Speak whatever the f you want and don't make it a national issue.

Most of the people in brazil speak Portuguese, does that change their identity? Most of the people in nigeria speaks english, does that change their identity?   Also just to let you know we share almost exactly the same culture, there is no difference.  No one is forcing you to speak hindi, even in india, many people can't even understand a word of it.   No need to hide the hate behind the words like 'our own identity's or ' our culture' or anything else. You directly say you hate indians, why? it's a trend now days to hate indian culture, skin colour, language or anything that comes from india.  You can google how much india has contributed in the development of nepal and also how nepal has contributed to the development of India. You will see the clear difference in how much India has helped  your country, but still if you want to fall for a trend then go on, we won't care cause we won't be affected.|||If we look at the Fact,  Nepali language is derived from Hindi and Urdu. We use same devnagiri script. Whereas many local languages are marginalised.|||Whenever I’ve switched from English and then spoken to someone in Hindi, I’ve felt a commonness and even respect. Being tri-lingual is a skill, not a downgrade.   I go to small family owned grocery store, I greet them in Hindi and they say namastey, and my usual the liquor store guy asks me how I’ve been doing and gives me discount.   Language was invented by humans to make connections. Rather than saying dont speak a particular language, maybe saying something about how to develop relationships would have been better.|||This post and the comments just reek of inferiority complex.|||Learning any language is good not speaking them in front of them is your choice.  If you don't want to speak in Hindi, that's fine, although Hindi and Nepali words are so much similar just the structure of sentences is what makes the difference between them(These similarities  made me understand the language more , listen to the song and even sing them as if I were an native speaker) .   If you show some love to the language outside of the valley will be even more meaningful as most of the language spoken out of the Valley is at a decreasing rate.  It will help save the culture and language, I would like you to focus on that.  Hey, just to be cleared I'm not trying to force you here. It's your choice at the end.|||I speak Hindi to my Nepali family for fun. but with exaggeration|||After reading all the comments I got to know that nepalis hate indians to the core just one bad instinct is enough to rage them against indian.

            "comments": "At 22 years, it is commendable with what you are doing. A big salute to you. I also had my struggles but did not have to support my family. At the moment, i would suggest you to keep doing your jobs and garnering your skills so you land up one job with a handsome pay. Good luck.|||dude you're just like me, but 10 years ago. i've been exactly where you are and it sucks ass. i had to maintain multiple jobs because none would pay on time, and i had to support my parents and two siblings. so when i say i know what you're going through, i mean it. and as much i appreciate people being nice here, no one (except for one) is trying to help you navigate this shituation.  the one thing that you need more of isn't money or opportunities, its time. **you need more time**. more time for proper sleep, more time to gather your thoughts, more time to pause and evaluate your current situation, more time to plan out the next few months. you're like a engine that's constantly running 24/7, and you haven't had the chance to rest for a single moment, and it sucks soooo much because as much as you want to stop, you just can't. its all on you, everything depends on you, and you have to keep moving, or else everything will fall apart. and this will only end one way, and its not good dude.  thats why you have to take your time back. you need at least 2 more hours of sleep (sleeping an hour early and waking up 30 minutes late). at least 1 hour of free time to plan your next steps. you weekends need to be for yourself, and yourself alone. whatever precious time you have, you keep it and don't let anyone or anything take it from you.   if you have college every morning, talk with the administration and ask them to let you check-in an hour late - explain your situation, tell them that you have no other option; this worked for me, and will work for you.  if you have small spare time where its not too long to start working but not too short to just sit around (like 25-40 minutes of downtime), just get to the next task/next job. baru duita day shifts ko bich ma kei downtime hunai nadeu. inform your office you'll arrive early and leave early. explain that you have a tight schedule and you don't want to waste your time. companies will try to make up some nonsense about proper timing and all that bullshit but don't let them bully you to submission. ask them to understand your situation, and make up shit like you also study and go to college everyday and do your assignments daily because you're a weak student, and normally don't get enough sleep because of that, so instead of just wasting time after college, you just come to work early - you know, make it sappy if that helps. but whatever you say, make sure that they let you leave early. take back your time.  if this helps you gather even 1-2 hours extra everyday, thats the time you can invest on yourself now. if you can get home by 5pm instead of 6:30pm, thats around 3 hours before your night shift starts. you can use that time to either plan your next move. work on your portfolio. add things to your showreels that you wish you could but weren't allowed to. talk with your parents about what you're going through and ask them to help you with planning for the future. like the other user said, actually start tracking all your expenses and see where all your money is going. excel is free in the browser, and you can search for \"excel free budget templates\". categorize all your expenses and see where the money is being wasted. do you smoke regularly? are your lunches expensive? is your electricity bill too high? not a single rupee goes untracked. you need every penny to be accounted for. if there's an unnecessary expense, cut it out completely. the more you can save, the easier it will be for you.  you can also request your night shift company to let you start early, and end early. sounds like it's a remote job, so your reasoning could be that you're already free by 6pm, and instead of waiting around, you'd like to start early when you're still feeling energized and not drained of energy by 3 in the morning. you can give your work report by 12 midnight and go to sleep 30 minutes early, even.  if you travel by bus or micros, take that time to complete errands that can be done via your phone. create a checklist for what you need to do before you can apply for better jobs. look for potential companies that have a good company culture (normally has better pay too). connect with past colleagues online just to say hi (this one might feel weird at first but its better to say hi how are you rather than hi do you have a job in your company). update your expense tracking sheet. look for templates and plugins that can help your portfolio be better than the rest.  spend every single free minute to get yourself on a better situation.  you're drowning every hour every day, but you're taking the first step towards pulling yourself out. it's going to be difficult the next few months and you may feel more drained than ever, but if you do all these for yourself, you'll be in a much better mental state in the next couple of months. here's to hoping that you update us in a few months that you got a job that pays as much as all three jobs combined 🤞  all the best. do yourself proud.|||On person told me, rather focusing making money from 2-3 small jobs. Be professional at single then! You can make more from one single job.  But right now I'm also in your situation searching for day jobs.|||I just want to add one more thing…  if anyone here knows about any freelance work, side gigs, or small online jobs, I’m more than willing to take them too. Anything that can help me earn a little extra and reduce some of this pressure would honestly mean a lot.|||Find something you can release your emotions, for me it's futsal or dota. Give 1 hour to yourself to go through and talk about it or write about. It will give you a different perspective on life. And yeah kudos to you. You are doing great. In future turn your 3 jobs to 1 and keep money consistent.|||The first thing that matters is mental peace, I know its easy to say but once you figure that out.  Everything will be same but you will be different  Try meditating, clearing your mind. Once you have a clear mind you can think.  The more you panic, the more it gets worse. Thinking about the future and trying to make life better is good but when you over think the same thing over and over, that thought is what making you demotivated not the situation. If you can’t change the situation, don’t over think it.  I know its hard, but don’t loose the hope.  Stay calm, plan and proceed and will be a matter of time you see the changes.  It is a process not an immediate action. At the end its you and I know someone who is handling everything as you said can do lot better in life. Don’t forget, Some people dream to be in your place. Be positive. You got this.|||I hear you can make more with pathao or similar ride services as a rider.|||Keep the hustle going. Peace 🙏|||i am not the sole earner    but similar situations   i feel you bro|||Try putting all your income and expenses into an Excel sheet. It really helps to see where your money goes. If you have any debts, create a small, steady repayment plan so they don’t keep snowballing.      Separate essential and non-essential expenses, even small adjustments can make a difference. And try to save at least a tiny amount each month. Even a symbolic sum gives a bit of control and stability.      Look at how much free time you have outside of work and try to set aside a small, consistent window to learn skills that are in demand. Little steps add up and can help you increase your income over time.      I’ve been in a similar situation myself, and I know how heavy it can feel. But it is possible to climb out of it slowly, with small steady actions. You’re already doing an incredible amount, don’t be too hard on yourself. You’re stronger than you think, and you’re not alone.|||You are a legend for doing that, god will bless you and open your path|||Good luck 👍 |||Is it just you and your parents ?

The person is required to follow the court orders, e.g., appearing in court on the date of hearings/schedules and not leaving a specific area or boundary, and following any other orders set by the court.

My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6.

During the Rana regime (1846–1951), gun manufacturing in Nepal was driven largely by the innovative efforts of Gehendra Shumsher, the eldest son of Prime Minister Bir Shumsher, who is widely regarded as Nepal's first scientist and modernizer of the military.   Key Manufacturing Factories  The Ranas established several sites for arms and ammunition production, primarily centered in the Kathmandu Valley and some regional hubs:   Nakkhu (Lalitpur): Notable for producing copies of the Martini-Henry rifle, specifically the \"De-Rifle\" in the late 1880s.  Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.

Seasonal shedding, telogen effluvium from stress, illness, or nutritional changes can all contribute. Since you’re using minoxidil, that can help maintain and even regrow hair in many cases, but results vary based on genetics and treatment consistency.

            "body": "I’ve been holding this inside for a long time, and I just want to let it out.  I wasn’t a “smart kid” in school. I never understood things as fast as my friends did. I struggled even to read a paragraph and find the right answer, even in class 10. I used to feel dumb every single day. Some of my friends got things so quickly, but I didn’t. I still feel cringe thinking about it.  I also had tics. I don’t know if it was Tourette’s or something else, because I never checked. When I get excited or angry, my eyes blink hard and my back twists. It was embarrassing, and it distracted me so much in school. I used to wish I could just be “normal.”  But after my S.E.E., something changed. That 3-month break gave me a new life. I had my “aha” moment. Somehow, I finally started understanding things. Maybe it was the silence, maybe it was being away from all the noise, maybe it was just loneliness giving me space to think. But everything shifted.  I taught myself how to code. I got a job as a software developer. I didn’t finish my degree because my college wouldn’t let me work while studying, so I said “forget it” and focused on work. It was well paid, and nobody asked for a degree anyway. So yeah, I’m a dropout who made it this far.  I’m still not “super smart,” but I’m definitely smarter than the version of me back then. I still have tics, they still distract me sometimes, but I’m living with it.  I just needed to get this off my chest. I’ve kept it inside for too long.  **And to anyone reading this who feels like they’re slow, or not smart, or different:**   I hope you find your moment too. I hope you realize that you’re not broken. Sometimes loneliness or silence gives you a new life. You grow in ways you don’t even notice at first. You don’t have to be a genius to make it. You just have to keep going. If I can do it, anyone can.  Stay strong. You’ll get your moment too.      ***Note: Yes, I did use ChatGPT to improve this text, mainly to fix grammar mistakes.

And he even categorized questions, contents based on level like basic, intermediate, advanced and so on. And he even used to add the most prominent mathematician in each chapter. That I even consider a some form of research. Not every research has to wear a PhD hat. So for me, I consider his contributions in mathematics to be highest in Nepal.

But when it comes to GTM, growth, marketing, or just figuring out how to actually sell and scale a product… there’s a huge gap.  Most startups here are run by tech engineers, and naturally, the focus is on building the product perfectly. That’s great, but then things like growth strategy, customer acquisition, positioning, and distribution get ignored. People just assume if you build it, users will come. Spoiler: they don’t.  Most of the startups here in Nepal fail less because the product is bad, but instead because the distribution/game-plan is weak.   Here in Nepal, GTM skills aren’t really taught, nor are they considered “cool” compared to coding. Most people in IT industrychase programming jobs, freelancing gigs, or outsourcing contracts because that’s a safer bet financially.  I think this is actually a huge opportunity. Someone who can master GTM skis here like: user research, acquisition channels, funnel optimization, sales psychology could easily dominate the startup scene.   Instead of just learning yet another JS framework, you should also learn GTM skills.   What do you guys think?",

I took the same course purely out of passion, but I only landed better jobs because of my creativity,not because of a certificate. None of the companies I’ve worked with ever asked about my educational title; only some uncreative Nepali companies did, and they couldn’t even afford my salary.  My 6 years of experience have taught me a lot. I’ve worked with foreign clients, accepted low pay in the beginning just to learn more, and over time those skills paid off. I was even offered a position at a major tech company in Nepal, but I chose to join an AI company with a bigger vision and at double the salary.  The motto “Think Different” truly matters but listen it took me 6 years of constant sacrifices just to Learn not to Earn.|||Yesko matra valeu ta chhaina tara you got solid skills and projects then has valeu|||You need a showreel and that certificate won't get you much.|||एक समय थियो MAYA को, अहिले त खासै छैन । Course हरु पनि निक्कै Basic छन् समयको माग धान्‍न सक्दैन ।|||3D kun software ma garayo, ani compositing ?|||Oh I have one too. It's DDAVE instead of CAVE like yours.  Is there a value? Sure. The value of a certificate is just telling people that someone taught you something. You still need a portfolio to show what you learned.  Edit: Just so you know, I think having a certificate is better than not having one. It shows at least you spent some time learning something. That's what it is supposed to do. Now make a portfolio. Having both cert + portfolio is good.    But then again, a lot of companies only hire someone they know so all the rules go out the window..|||How much did the course cost ??|||Yes and no, I suggest pick one field u want to specialize in and try to make some portfolio out of it and maybe try for some internship.... Skills matters most in these fields so.... Goodluck.... and if wanna specialize in 3d character animation, I can give u some ideas....😉 hit me up.....|||Look for traineeship rather than doing certifications.|||I am not promoting the Maya animation academy, but you have to go to an institute to learn for base support. If you are thinking about learning from YouTube, you can also do that, but with the basic support and ideas which are provided by the institute, you can't get to learn properly & fast way. ",

What did those first few months feel like — mentally, financially, emotionally? * Do you ever regret your decision to move? If yes, what moments made you feel that way? And if no, what kept you motivated? * What was the reality from day one? Did you struggle to find part-time work? Was balancing study and work harder than you expected? How lonely was it, if at all? * Did your journey turn out the way you had imagined? Or did things change once you arrived? * Are you still working in IT now? If not, what pulled you away from the field? Did you find your way back eventually? * Looking back, was the move worth it for you — personally, professionally, and financially? * What would you genuinely tell someone in Nepal who is earning decently in IT and is thinking of coming to Australia as a student? Should they do it? Should they wait? Should they stay? And what should they prepare for? * How did this move impact your mental health? Did you feel lost, homesick, or confused about your career at any point? * What was the biggest shock you faced after coming here? (job market, rent, workload, lack of time, loneliness, culture, etc.) * Do you feel you’ve grown as a person after moving — or do you feel stuck? * If you could talk to your “old self” back in Nepal before coming, what advice would you give?",

I don't know what your job is: maybe it might be IT related or so but listen, find another job with a Good Leader First, Stable Environment and a Field where you get excited to learn the most and importantly with those who appreciate your effort.      When I felt the exact same thing that you are facing, I did the same, it took some time, but the patience was worth it. I used to be a Multimedia Designer, I shifted to a better foreign company who appreciated my creativity, Nepalese companies doesn't even understand the \"C\" of creativity.|||To be honest, the working environment in Nepal feels messed up to me. I’ve worked in India as well, and the difference is huge. There, people respect your ideas, give you support, and actually let you try new things. You learn a lot in that process, and there’s real accountability for your work  and that’s what makes the job interesting. But in Nepal, most companies are full of office politics. People focus more on chilling than building something meaningful. Then suddenly, one day, all the “fun” stops and you’re expected to show results overnight. That’s when everything turns into chaos. I personally feel Nepal’s IT sector is not growing the way it should because of this mindset. Management hesitates to try new ideas, and most companies are still following the same blueprint they’ve been using for the past 10 years. No innovation, no mindset shift.  In my opinion, work becomes fun and challenging only when you are given responsibility and the freedom to try new things. Otherwise, it’s just the same rat race, the same routine, and the same day repeating again and again.|||I do get bored tara month ko end ma paune salary relieves that slog, I guess.|||Finalize na vayesamma kam nai avoid garxu ma ta.

The same boring schedule is real but try to enjoy the weekends to reset. And take out 25 - 60 mins of time everyday to practice interview questions and maybe some personal projects that interests you. With 1 YOE the only way to overcome what you are describing is switching the job itself which should increase your salary, network and confidence to have a kinda fresh new start. About finalizing the whole thing, most companies don't research or even have time to do so ig. Also the requirements changing are frustrating af but i think we learn something at least. So i highly recommend start making a proper portfolio with proofs of work in GitHub and CV, apply to new jobs and prep for interviews and try to switch the job.   My current life is also same as yours rn ( 3 YOE ) Clg - work - learn - sleep - repeat. I kind of have passion for coding though. I admit it gets boring but there is always a small excitement that keeps me going. And my only formulae is i try to enjoy the weekends to my fullest so that the whole week becomes worth it. And final suggestion which are just fundamentals ig.. take proper breaks, hydrate throughout the day, workout and have proper sleep schedule. I hope this helps a little.

Both can be freshers. Who are we talking about here?|||Finding a remote job: Yes, it is definitely possible. Ease of finding one: Moderate chances.  How difficult is it to crack a remote role? It is challenging. It’s not only about how technically proficient you are; companies also evaluate how well you fit culturally. In many ways, being a good people person and collaborating effectively matters just as much as technical skills.  Is it possible for freshers? Both yes and no.  Remote roles have their own dynamics. Some established companies do offer remote positions, while many startups also hire remotely. Freshers often have better chances with startups, as they tend to prioritize cost-effective hiring. Established companies usually have higher expectations, and freshers may not yet meet those requirements.  My experience: I have been working remotely for the past 4 years—2 years with a Singapore-based startup and currently with a UK-based fintech company. LinkedIn was the source of connection for both roles. The hiring process involved 5 rounds of interviews, including both technical and behavioral rounds. My tech stack: Backend development (Python, Node.js, etc.).  My suggestion: Explore opportunities across different continents. European companies, in particular, offer excellent work culture and a healthy work–life balance. Don’t limit yourself only to US-based startups. If you’re experienced, start exploring right away. If not, gain solid experience first, build your skills, and hustle hard before targeting remote opportunities.|||In theory, yes. But that's just in theory. Remote jobs are incredibly rare, and extremely competitive when they do come out. Americans apply to hundreds of jobs, not an exaggeration, literally hundreds of jobs to land maybe a dozen interviews. And most of them aren't even freshers.  You could try if you want to, but it's extremely unlikely unless you're a prodigy with actual experience in the industry, or you nepobaby your way through.  Maybe go for other countries, I would say US is not worth the time and effort atm.|||>Does freshers even has a chance to land an interview?  Yes.  >a remote job paying around $800-$1k per month  For a fresher extremely rare.|||If you are fresher expecting that much of pay is a bit hard in today’s situation.|||Yes, I'm working at a singaporean based startup for around similar amount, the interview is quite intimidating, but it my case it went ok|||Network xa vane matra pauxa easily natra it is very hard.

I was wrong.   Yes, landing a remote job means you earn in foreign currency and enter the top 10 percent of earners in Nepal even if you earn 500 USD per month (72k).   BUT..  Without learning a proper skill  (don't expect companies abroad to take you in and teach you like a fresher cause they will have local people to do that) , you won't be hired and won't stand out.   Proper skills are like maybe software, copywriting, sales skills, tech skills, ai developers etc that allows you to work from anywhere.",

I agree.|||First thing I do is I ask them if they can speak English.

The thing was, he switched code. I understood him and could have communicated well in Hindi with him, but my friend doesn't really understand Hindi, so I had to keep it in a language everyone understood, and I just told him I am not very good in Hindi.    I would happily speak Nepali in places like Darjeeling, where they speak Nepali, because I am most comfortable in it, and I know most people there would be more than comfortable in that. I assume that it is a comfort thing for them as well.  They're just more comfortable with Hindi than English, and I am accommodating, and fluent enough in Hindi, to extend the courtesy of speaking in their language.    I have come across Indians who look down on Nepal and Nepalis, and unfortunately, that attitude is more common among Indians than it should've been. It is not a pleasant experience, I admit. But, I refrain from putting all of them in a single box. I've met some wonderful Indians as well.   What I have to say is, we are individuals first, I, you, and anyone else, regardless of our nationality, or the languages we speak. Treat each individual on their merit, not their national identity. In fact, the shittiest person I've ever met is a fellow Nepali, and for obvious reasons—I live in Nepal.   The people who treated you bad were shitty people. The same attitude could very well be found in an Englishman, a Frenchman, or even a Nepali. That doesn't mean every Nepali, or Englishman, or Frenchman, is like that.    We are individuals first, in our lived experiences, not just a nationality, and in essence, expressions of existence, far greater than just a nationality. Treat people for who they are in that moment, not a label attached to them.    This is exactly the kind of subtle hate and/or prejudice I am against, whether it is based on lived experiences or influenced by rhetoric.   Use all the languages you know, as much as possible, I say. It is much better to open one's horizons than be insular. And no, I am not just a Nepali. My nationality is just one aspect of who I am, one which is more happenstance than chosen and curated with careful thought.

I’m here in the US and I speak Spanish with folks who speak Spanish and obviously when there is a language barrier people will banter by saying things that can feel personal. Even greetings come down to culture like cunado (sala) in Nepali.  Most of our generation I am 27 years old watches anime Korean series and picks up words the same way we grew up with Hindi serials. It’s not about speaking Hindi being inappropriate but about the mindset and stigma attached to it. While speaking Japanese Spanish Korean Chinese or French gives you brownie points Hindi often doesn’t and that’s a failure in how Indian people and Hindi have been framed.  I relate to your concern and I have seen firsthand what you’re saying where it can make someone feel inferior and I believe that comes from perception not the language itself.

I actually have problems speaking to Nepali people in Australia as they'll cross every boundary and think I'm liable for them just because we're from the same country.. Its a regional issue.

They are too busy with their own lives and the immediate world around them to specifically think anything about Nepal. India is a country of 1.3 billion people. And even in India, many people don't speak Hindi. Yeah, many in older generation are more racist, but they are racist to each other too. Many people fight over language in different Indian states, and discriminate with people of different states. But as I said, there are 1.3 billion people and a large majority will be as friendly to Nepali people. No, they don't think of Nepal as their little bro, but if asked, would actually hold some affinity towards Nepal in comparison to what they think of other nations.  Feel free to learn Hindi, feel free to forget, it's every one's personal choice. I honestly almost never need to learn it, but I like Nepali songs so much that I'm picking up on Nepali words now. (Kasari Bhanu, Bardali, Sarangi, Timi ra ma are among my favourite)  Lastly, this sub is quite Anti Indian, just saying,  generalizing India and Indians is ridiculous as the population is much more than most people can think of. And bad will always be highlighted more than good.|||It's not just Nepalis. North Indians act like this towards south Indians too. I know Hindi, but I would never speak it unless I was physically in north India. Talk to me in my own language, or in English is my rule.

I get that we have pride, but look at the situation of our country. since i faced alot of indians too they think we are super poor.

( This usually happens in brampton area)|||I can understand this feeling. I’ve noticed something similar in myself. When an Indian person asks me for directions, I automatically respond in Hindi without really meaning to. Then the whole conversation continues in Hindi, and afterward I feel a bit uncomfortable, wishing I had replied in English instead.       But I also hesitate because I’m not sure if they would understand me clearly in English, and I genuinely want to help. It’s something I’m still figuring out.|||I had a Mexican friend who kind of looks like South Asian and he told me that he used to get misjudged as an Indian by them and he used to hate when Indians used to come to him and stsrt talking to him in hindi thinking he's indian and he would be there just looking at them confused ... 🙃🙃.. like wtf. .. they didn't even ask him if he was Indian or not .. just because he looked like South Indian they started talking to him in Hindi ..|||Yes same!

I openly say that I understand it but don’t speak it, and I’ve never been treated like garbage because of that. I’m guessing you’re a man, because Nepalese men constantly put themselves in an inferior position, always with the “bhai, bhai” nonsense. That alone tells people how to treat you. I’m a 22-year-old woman in Canada, and there are two other Nepalese girls where I work. We carry ourselves with confidence. Our Indian manager can’t talk down to us, and neither can any coworker. But the Nepalese guys? They’re always talked down to like kids. They’re 27 and 28 years old and still get called “sala Nepali.” That never happens to us and it’s not a coincidence. We have more filipino co workers than Indians but they always hangout with Indians and say sh like , “ chalo bhai daru pitey hai aj “ in worse hindi accent possible.  This has nothing to do with language. It’s about presence. It’s about how you carry yourself. When you look unsure, dress badly, and act small, people treat you that way. Respect isn’t begged for , it’s taken.|||Guys why so much hatred for India.. I'm unable to understand...saw three post of similar kind..we indians treat or consider Nepalis as our brothers..what has happened to Nepal...we don't have any issues rather connected through religion, culture and tourism too... it's perfectly fine to save ur indigenous culture and languages but there should be no hate ...|||I agree. As a Bangladeshi growing up i also learned hindi. After coming aboard I realised whenever i spoke hindi with Indian they started behaving differently. Then I completely stopped talking in hindi and still continue to do so. I only speak hindi to my close Indian friend and no one else.   Also from my experiences I don’t consider people from punjab indian. They’re very different and welcoming people. I love them.

And Have deicided to tell everyone that I can understand Hindi(little little) but I don't know how to speak because of much grammatical and syntax differences between my mother tongue and hindi. So, Indians in my class talk in hindi and think I don't know but in reality I know but am hiding the stuff|||India supported Nepal a lot and now these Nepali trying to think they are better than us wow.India should stop free aids immediately.No need to throw food at dog that bite it's own feeding hands|||What kind of delusion are some Nepalese living in?

Just look at Patan, Bhaktapur and Basantapur. But every Mandir that are newly built are dogshite trash. The design sucks. They use cement and metal frames as building material as if there is a shortage of stones, bricks, wood and clay. The statues look like it was made by a 5 year old. Completely soulless. No intricate carvings. The land surrounding the temple is also poorly planned. I just hate the metal benches. You know what type of benches I am talking about. Compare a Temple in the hill to any Gumba / Monastery and you will realize exactly what I mean.   We need to be Mandirmaxxing as a country. We need grand architecture. We need culture. The least we can do is mandate all government offices to be built with traditional architecture in mind.|||Ganesha is actually inspired by Mahayana and Vajryan Buddhism Elephant God.  Bahrut stup - 2300 years old.   Buddha's story is  sculpted in this Stup. Mahamaya (Buddha's mother) is seen protected by Elephant. Another art shows her dreaming an elephant. There is also a story where buddha tamed Mad Elephant. So elephant holds importance in buddhism. You can google it.   As the time fly, scholars began their own narration and interpretation.  Mahavairocana tantra -7th/8th century. One of the foundational texts of esoteric buddhism. Here Ganesha appears as Vinayaka, often portrayed as an obstacle creating diety sub dued by the buddha's mantra. Yet once pacified. He becomes a protector.  Kanguyar - the tibetan buddhism canon, preserves several tantric texts where Ganapati is invoked. Toh 666, Toh 665 heart of mantra appears here.  Sadhanmala -a vast collection of tantric sadhanas compiled between 10th to 11th centuries include detailed rituals of Maha rakta Ganapati and other ganesha forms. These practice invoke Ganesha as a wealth bestowing and obstacle clearing diety.  In buddhism, the ganapati hridaya sutra also known as the arya maha ganapati hridaya dharani, is a sacred mantra given by shakyamuni buddha to his desciple Ananda.  Mostly Ganesha is seen in Tibetan and Vajryan with more than 4 hands.  All the buddhist countries as Japan, Thailand , indonesia (former), China see elephant head diety as buddhist god.  Ganesha images in China occur between 6th to 7th century.  Lets see where Ganesha appears in Brahmin religion (hindu).  Rigveda - 1464AD is the oldest surviving manuscripts (30 pages or folios of birch bark) submitted by Indian Governmet to UNESCO.  Ganesha does not appear in it.  And in later rigveda version also, Ganesha vagueley appears. In short, hindu Ganesha does not exist.  They may claim Veda is million years old, but we must stick with history not theories.  Ganesha Purana - 13 to 17 th century. It explains the story of Ganesha.  However , it seems the ganesha cult started form 9th/11th century.|||“Kaaaaa yesto Kura gareko hera,   Yo tah hamro Saan ani dharma ho ni ,  Hami ajhai every tourist destination ma religious sites banau parcha ,  Nepal and its natural beauty jawos Kholai khola .tyo ek dui Jana tourist naayera k huncha Hami Lai.”|||Desh tikekai India ra Indian tourists le ho ta saathi.

Most of the tourists that these places receive are mostly internal tourist, which is Nepalese, and majority of Indians, and buddhist. These places aren't attracting any secular tourists as such, plus just because they suddenly declared Nepal is a secular country, doesn't erase it's civilizational history, any western tourist when he thinks of Nepal, the things that comes in his mind are mountains, buddha, temples, monastries and stuffs, that's what they expect.  So, when there is already enough reason, Temples are automatically going to be built.  Plus, we have more and enough evidences that after building temples or statues in such places, the tourism has actually gone up.  So, it makes no sense why you are mad here.  Regarding the shoes, except the main area of Temple, it's wrong to just dictate to open shoes, that's something we all can raise voice.  Regarding Bhajan, that's definitely wrong, no one can just blast any Bhajan in such open place whenever they like it. And, this issue is also solvable.  It's sad that just because of these two issue of shoes and Bhajan, you went on to attack the existence of Mandir and statues themselves without actually understanding the overall context.|||I was there this summer, they never said to take off my shoes and there wasn't any bhajan and stuff.|||What’s the meaning behind this is Pokhara not Janakpur?|||keta keti haru jun thau pani romanticize garne lul.

I saw videos of Indian youths crying in pokhara for help when some group of protesters came to beat them because they were indians. Now I guess after doing all this Nepal will surpass india and germany, china, japan etc right? A politicians wife was burnt alive in her house and she died while going to the hospital.  I am not blaming the people who did nothing like this, and if you didn't then congrats 👏🏻 you hold a special place in my heart. My comment is for those who did these things not for those who didn't.  ![gif](giphy|iNPNqI81MvDQ4D4n6D)  Don't be a fool, I know truth is harsh and you can't accept it.  For some people let me clear that; I belong to a Hindu family but I am an atheist so I can see from logic, I don't support Bangladesh nor what happened in this video. But the irony of the protesters is hilarious.|||It's not muslims the problem but the hanafi, wahabism and Deubandi school of thought which makes them radical. Look at Indonesia it follows Sufism mixed with agakhani sect do we hear minorities being treated badly? No. Mostly it's the south Asian Muslims who are radical because they follow a very strict islam of deubandi and wahabism school of thought which has caused problem historically it's moderate example would be creation of Taliban and extreme example is creation of Pakztan. Now contrary to that you've Indonesia which is also a majority Muslim nation but follows Sufism school of thought which is why they are much more liberal. They're okay with currency having Ganesha, okay with garuda being national symbol(coat of arms), and even okay with naming kids from Sanskrit derived names like majority of their head of the states have Sanskrit origin names there will be some ups and downs in writing because Indonesia didn't follow devanagari it followed the Brahmi script earlier, in that way it's still preserving the culture. But if you tell this to a MUSLIM.from south Asia he will say it's shirk/haram in islam and that being associated with polytheism is bad and that they are a lost tribe of Turks and Arabs who had invaded our land. So, wahabism and Deubandi unless remained will not allow for inclusivity among the people islam factor will be there no matter what|||Can't decide which is the worst religion - Islam or Hinduism.

It had been a month since she's been taking home tuition from this one teacher. He comes to her house and teaches her. Usko chai aahiley renovation chali rako cha ghar ma so me being the nice bf that I am, told her she could come over to my house and ask the teacher to come there to teach. I would be all day in my classes as well so disturb ni hunthena(she has morning classes I have day classes)  So for few hours a day, she was getting tuition from the teacher in my room. Or so I thought. Ekdin chai mero classes haru chito sakkiyo and I went home about an hour early. Room jada it was locked from the inside so I thought bahira bata noise aayera room lock gareko hola bhanera. Tei ni I got curious and went around the window to see what was going on.  My gf was on her my bed with her teacher cuddling inside the blankets and what not like wtfff bhaira ma ta. I couldn't believe my eyes I thought I was having a nightmare. I got really furious, told her to open the door and we had a huge fight I was really heartbroken. Riss ma aayera I threw the damn blankets, comforter, duvet, even the rug. Ghar bata sabai faldiye and told them to leave.  So can you guys please tell me where can I get some good rugs and comforters in Nepal? Its winter and I cant sleep without the blankets yk. Especially Im looking for a warm fluffy white/creamy type of rug tyo fur wala. Online shops testo kei cause im not from valley. Help guyss!!",

You are the biggest fucking cuck Nepal has ever produced, bar none.  You literally heard “ghar renovate bhairacha” and your smooth brain went: “Aww baby, aaile mero room ma aaija na, teacher lai ni bolau, ma ta class ma hunchu, disturb pani hudaina.” Bro you didn’t just hand over your room, you handed over your entire bed for their afternoon fuck-session like a 5-star hotel receptionist. You set the mood, locked the door from outside and paid the electricity bill while that randi was getting railed on your own pillow.  You’re not a “nice boyfriend”, you’re a walking doormat with Wi-Fi. The moment she said “home tuition” alarm bells should’ve rung, but no, timi ta “disturb nahos” bhanera uniharulai honeymoon suite diyau. Teacher le timro girlfriend ko “syllabus” cover gardai thiyo ani timi bahira “nice guy” badge polish gardai basyo.  You came home early and still had to play detective like some Bollywood hero, peeking through the window because your own room was locked from inside. Bro even Nepali serials don’t have this level of chutiya plot.  And the cherry on top? You threw the blankets and rugs instead of throwing hands. Blanket jalaunu parne thiyo, timi chai “winter aaucha, kasari sutne” bhanera Daraz ma fluffy white rug khojdai chau. Bro your girlfriend got piped on your bed and your biggest concern is staying warm?? Priority thik cha baba.  You didn’t just get cheated on, you got professionally scammed by a third-class tutor and a third-rate girlfriend. Block her, delete everything burn the mattress and never ever say “disturb nahos” to a girl again.  You’re not heartbroken, you’re brain-dead.

What is wrong is wrong, I dunno what the procedure for BSF to enter each other countries is, with the open border and all, but I'm sure they are only able to enter after some permission from each other's authorities. If that is not the case here, then it's wrong and us Indians should accept that. 3. Nepal is a beautiful country. People have more civic sense and overall better sense of community and cohesion from what I have seen.  4. What Nepali people have to understand is India is a big country 1.4 billion people is a lot. So, of all the counties in the world, India is probably the only one you should never generalize. 6. Both Nepali and Indian people can have good relationship with each other, just learn to talk properly and not take things to ego. 6. Yes, India is a bigger economy, and has more resources, but it is not in competition with Nepal. Nepal has it's own strengths that it should not forget.  7. Open border has it's pros and cons. Yes, many Nepali are in India, do they get to build a life, yes. Do they get discriminated, yes, and so are Indians from other states. And Nepali also discriminate against Indian tourists and workers. 8. Always remember, most average Indians will probably only have good will towards Nepal and no hate.  9. It is very important that rather than spreading unnecessary generalized hate, we judge people on individual basis.

My name is … Khadka, and I’ve been doing an Ausbildung at a Hofladen for the past 7 months. My chef treats me really well, like family.  Last week, I was at an Indian roadside café with my sister and some German friends, waiting for my chef to pick me up before visiting the Weihnachtsmarkt. We were waiting , suddenly two indian boys came to us and we had a short conversation . They were annoying so we started ignoring but they soon started making disrespectful comments like calling me MOMO and then mocking Nepal, our size, economy, and poverty. I didn’t respond with racism, though the conversation got heated.  Coincidentally, my chef was nearby, noticed something was wrong, and later asked if I was okay. I explained everything to him. He took it seriously and suggested legal action.  With the help of my chef’s lawyer, a legal letter was sent demanding an apology and €270 from the men. After a few days, they agreed to pay the money and apologized so the case would not go further.  Fun Fact : I and my sister literally eat MOMO after getting that 270 euro 😭😆  So reason of writing this post was just to sharing the possibility of what wrong can happened and how to handle this things.  Edit : For OC (https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204052999996390/permalink/2475725379495816/?mibextid=rS40aB7S9Ucbxw6v)",

No doubt we live in social media bubble and think that people will overwhelming vote UML and maoists out, but if you go to the rural areas(and I have), you see that they still have strong roots there. This is further emboldened by the recent strong statements UML has put out.  The old parties have their base established, and the more the new parties run for election, the more they dilute their own votes. Furthermore, they aren't organized yet to be a major national party and to compete in 165 different constituencies .

I wanted to take a moment to share something from the heart, especially for the Gen Z community here. I’m not here to lecture, judge, or pretend that I “know better.” In fact, it’s the opposite—I’m here because I genuinely admire a lot about Gen Z, and I’d love to learn from you if you’re open to talking or sharing your perspectives.  What I really respect about your generation is the honesty. The courage to say things out loud that older generations kept buried. The way you call out what doesn’t feel right, whether it’s in society, culture, work, or even in yourselves. The world is changing fast, and you all seem to face it with a unique blend of humor, vulnerability, and resilience. And honestly, that’s inspiring.  I’m not perfect, and I don’t pretend to fully understand everything about today’s trends, language, mindset, or struggles. But I’m here with an open mind. If any Gen Z member is willing to talk—to enlighten me, challenge me, laugh with me, or even correct me—I’d sincerely appreciate it.  I’m reaching out with respect and humility. I’m here to listen, not impose. Thank you to anyone who takes a moment to respond. 🙏🏽|||yesto sanskar vaka le kasto desh banauxan hola?

            "body": "So I (27M) went to India for the first time. I was traveling solo turns out it was a bad idea. It was for work related events. After the event, I decided to explore a few places.   Until the work event, everything was fine. It was great learning and networking in the event. I actually speak Hindi very fluently so communication wasn’t an issue at all. After the event, I wanted to travel and explore.   I had booked a pretty average room for my accommodation. Nothing fancy, just the most budget friendly one I could find. There were a couple of people in the lobby and they greeted me nicely and asked for my ID. I showed them my passport and their faces instantly changed after seeing my Nepali passport. The guy said oh you’re from Nepal. I said yes and the another man said, this doesn’t work, we need to see an Indian ID. They weren’t smiling anymore and were giving me very skeptical looks. I tried not to overthink it. He kept insisting for an Indian ID and I explained to him that I am not from India, it’s my first time here so it’s not possible for me to have an Indian ID. Then they asked me for my contact number and I gave my phone number (didn’t have Indian number). Once again, they kept on asking for an Indian number. I was really surprised seeing their hospitality instantly changed after learning about my identity. Not sure if they did that because I was a foreigner to them or because I was specifically a Nepali guy.   While I was exploring the local market, I went to buy some souvenirs. One shop guy asked me where I was from and I said Nepal. He then started lecturing me saying don’t be close with China. They will do the same to you what Pakistan is doing to us. He kept yapping about how Nepal is a small part of India and that we should be grateful that we have a “bada bhai” like India. I left the shop without saying anything.    I wanted to travel by train but had absolutely zero idea about it. The people weren’t helpful there either. I was asking the various staff in the train station saying I wanna go here where can I find a ticket. They just vaguely pointed go there, it’s over there. Finally one guy at the ticket counter helped me get tickets after nearly couple of hours of running frantically here and there. I told him I’m not from India, traveling by train for the first time. The counter guy gave me a ticket saying this is for general class, it’s not safe to travel there..very crowded and chaotic, after your train arrives, meet the ticket guy and ask him to upgrade to AC compartment. I thanked him and went to the platform. There was a police officer whom I asked about upgrading the ticket. He too said the same thing i.e. meet the ticket guy once your train arrives and he will help you.   I still had about 3-4 hours before my train arrived. I just stayed in the platform watching movie. After the train arrived, I was frantically searching for the ticket guy. One police officer came near me charging with his baton. I was shit scared. He almost charged me saying why are you in the AC compartment with a general ticket in your hand. I was literally shaking at this point and with a shaky voice, I explained him my situation. He said haven’t you been in a train before where are you from. I said I’m from Nepal and he laughed saying oh you guys don’t even have trains there haha. Are you really from Nepal, your eyes don’t look like Nepalese. (I think he was referring to Mongolian eyes). I saw the ticket guy and went to him. He said me go to this seat and I’ll come. Later, he came to me and upgraded my ticket. The journey was a little over an hour long. And I was constantly replaying the entire experience from the hotel to the local market to the train station police guy.    Not sure if I just happened to meet all the wrong people or that everyone is the same there. Either way, I’m not going back to India for a long time. And I haven’t even mentioned the kids constantly following you begging for money, the dirt and litter everywhere, people peeing and even pooping in the open, unnecessary horns, air pollution.   PS: not trying to spread hate— just sharing my personal experience.",

Which cities did you visit, by the way? and as far as I know, many hotels in India especially smaller ones usually avoid foreigners because of paperwork and FRRO/police registration requirements. It’s better to stay at big hotels or resorts while traveling. I personally mostly stay at resorts, especially Club Mahindra ones they’re quite good, with solid service.  Also, try to do everything online in India train bookings, hotels, cabs. That way you’re much less likely to get scammed or harsh treated. Offline train ticket booking is honestly very hectic, even for Indians, so always book train tickets online. Use the official IRCTC website or authorized partners like MakeMyTrip, ConfirmTkt, or Paytm then you won’t face these problems.  And if you remember the time, location, duration, or the office name, you can also register a complaint on the Rail Madad portal or app. Lastly, there’s a huge generation gap in India you’ll mostly hear such racist things from older people or those in the 30–40 age group, but the younger generation is usually nicer and more helpful .You can even see this generation gap while speaking English. If you start speaking English in front of older people, they often treat you like some different person almost a ‘raja sahab’ type. But with the younger generation, it usually doesn’t make much of a difference. Anyway, I hope your journey was safe.|||Ik it might not be feasible, but my go to rule is, when visiting a country, get someone to guide you. A local friend is a must for visit to anywhere.  My grandfather was admitted to the top hospital in Delhi, back in 2017 when we met Ms. A, she was there for her mother from Nepal. Times at hospitals are grey, so we looked out for each other's family while we were there. (unfortunately, both received not good news at the end of four months after being at the hospital)  Post that, we maintained a friendship, called each other and stuff. My mum had ever gone to Nepal once when she was a teen, as part of a trip under scout guide or something, so when she expressed her wish to go another time, I booked tickets(we had never travelled in an airplane). On regular calls, we had mentioned about this trip, and she insisted we do not stay at hotels but stay with her. She had us visit many places, the one that made a somewhat great impression to me (they all were beautiful) was, I forogt the name, but the riverside place whre they burn as funeral rites, at the bank of the river... that starts with a b... It was a shiv temple if I remember it right.  Thetrip was one of my best trips, and I have travelled around some, but the experience was just something that you cannot compare.

Here are a few from my side:  1. Does RSP view kulman's party as a threat to their voter base as there seems to be a significant overlap between RSP and Kulman’s supporters. Are there any discussions or considerations about forming a coalition with them or other emerging political forces? 2. Sumana leaving brought a lot of negative light on RSP, her exit made it seem like the party was becoming more of a “Rabi supporters’ club.” Has her departure brought any internal changes within the party, or has everything remained largely the same? 3. If an opportunity arises  where you can form a coalition government together with one of the old parties are you willing to take it, for example if UML and RSP together have the numbers to form a government, would you take that opportunity? Or would the party prefer to stay in opposition rather than partner with any of the traditional major parties?

In this context, what does RSP feels about new alternative forces that have emerged after the gen z Andolan? Do you see them as a threat since they too will be contesting for the same voter base? Any internal discussions going on to work with them?  I think a good percentage of people are confused and unsure about where RSP stands on many burning issues in Nepal which has pushed Nepal into instability time and again. I’m sure you know what I’m talking about. RSP seems to tip toe around those issues and avoid discussing it overtly.   Could we see RSP take a vocal stand on those issues and make their ideological stance clear before this election? Perhaps this would help RSP clarify its position to unsure but potential voters, and strengthen its presence in villages, small towns and far districts.|||Do you think the current FPTP voting system should be replaced by Instant-runoff / Alternative voting?

I get it Rabi ko party ho but when I/we voted to RSP, it wasn’t because of Rabi but rather the young people like Sumana, Toshima, Ganesh, Sobita who joined Rabi.   Swarnim Wagle isn’t the face of alternative politics. He went to media and started saying shit about Kulman when Kulman has just stayed silent about RSP-Kulman merger. What is that if not a media trial? He is just a sad Congress member who couldn’t get ticket due to bhauju so jumped ship to RSP. Why does he get more say in RSP ko internal matters than other young faces?  So my question again - why is RSP so Rabi centric? Why should we vote for RSP when the whole party philosophy revolves around Rabi? And when Rabi retires, there’s basically no one to lead because the party has been so focused on Rabi and doing media trial against other young leaders.|||What is RSP stance in privatizing Nepal Oil Corporation, Nepal Airlines, and other state owned companies?

For example, Pierre Pollierve despite my hatred for him I can agree that he trruly opposed the policies and was there for a change which is why respecting the mandate in previous elections he chose not to form a gov despite having an opportunity to come in power via alliance with NDP, and Qubec. Why did you not stick with the principles and chose an alliance with the two heads whom Nepalese hate?  Second question, what's your party ideology, is it left wing or right wing? Based on following factors;Economics, Culture.  Third Question, the census data reveals that there's been 100% increase in the number of Christian population which clearly shows that our demographics is being destroyed, in the vietnam the missionaries have been converting the indegenous people to have a claim over the land, similar thing has happened with the Naga community of India, so its likely that Kiranti people are next, what will you do to stop this manipulative conversion, if you were in position of power?

I have some critical questions. I would be more than happy if Rabi reads these as well.  1.Why aren't you popular? ..at least upto your actual work?  Why are you guys in the shade while there's only talk of Rabi , Gagan, prasai , balen , sumana in the town. Your name is only taken collectively as \"a raswopa neta\". What are your biggest works and achievements as a member of parliament and rsp central member?  2.Why 45 lakhs signature for Rabi but 8.2 lakhs only voter id? Why can't I say that rsp prioritized a personality cult over connecting to new voters. Why is this not a catastrophic failure? Why did you guys fail to pressurize gov and commission to enable diaspora voting and even voter id registration from abroad. Nid was enabled for a brief period of time only. How can you guys exercise democracy with that slow and buggy registration process and 25 lakhs eligible citizens still unregistered?  3.Why is RSP scared to run elections independently on their own?Any plans to help gagan thapa win again?  4.Why is RSP vulnerable to propaganda by gagan thapa IT cell and 12 bhai fake news?  5.Why is rsp's communication and convincing skills so poor ? Couldn't onboard prominent figures and even chase Sumana away, how will you guarantee this doesn't deter similar newcomers again? I know it's important but is it that only the loyalist shall survive in rsp?   6. How many seats is the bibeksheel party contributing to the rsp in the upcoming election? Any projections? Or is it just a symbol?  7.Why is RSP not popular among genz , heavy backslash to Rabi and rsp being labeled as the same old parties, it being too person centric? Why do genz and youngsters hate political parties? What has rsp done and doing to make rsp popular among youngsters? Why is it so lost?   8.Why is RSP activities limited to Kathmandu valley and Chitwan only? I saw rsp doing some program recently AGAIN in chitwan instead of some new place. By being such limited to two districts how are you gonna secure the majority of seats across the country? Why are you preventing RSP from becoming big? We had hopes and still have some. Who's deciding all these?   9. Who's the youths face in rsp ? And how are they representing us? Where?   10. Why does RSP lack someone who's clear about his stance like what Mahesh basnet is for uml? Who's the spokesperson and why is he/she operating in a clinical and limited periphery.   11. Rabi Lamichhane publicly in a speech told that he lost many seats in 2079 election because he wasted his time trying to onboard popular faces instead of fostering new leadership and win more seats, but you guys seem to entertain this notion of onboarding popular faces more , forgetting the fact that you yourself aren't there due to popularity background. Why? Why can't you do something on your own rather than over-depending upon kulman or balen? I mean if you can't onboard them why waste an excessive amount of energy for that? Why such a weak mindset?  RSP central committee representatives feels incomplete and still need to cater many audiences, why don't you onboard brilliant and sharpest minds rather than just someone based on popularity or old connections? |||What are the things that you've done for Nepal?|||RSP stands for Rabi Swatantra Party?|||Remindme! 1 day|||Whats the ideology of rsp|||Hello Ganesh Nepal should enforce proper marital laws, including legally recognized prenups.

            "heading": "I’m done with Miraj Dhungana’s nonsense. This is NOT what the Gen-Z movement stood for.",
            "body": "I swear, the more I watch Miraj Dhungana’s actions after the Gen-Z protests, the more pissed off I get. This guy went from saying “I’m not the leader, this is a collective movement” to suddenly announcing a whole political party under the Garikhana Deu banner like it’s some kind of personal promotion. Do you even realize how ridiculous that looks? We were told this movement was leaderless, built on the frustration of an entire generation, and now the SAME person who said he wasn’t leading anything is stepping into politics like he’s been preparing the whole time. It feels like the movement’s energy was used as a ladder.  And don’t even get me started on the way he handled the October 9 protest confusion. When young people were panicking, waiting for clarity, ready to go to the streets again because the country is literally suffocating under corruption, what does he do? He steps back. He shrugs it off and says Gen-Z wasn’t involved. Bro, if you’re going to speak for the movement when it’s convenient, then show up when shit gets chaotic too. That’s literally what leadership is. Instead, he pops up when the cameras are rolling and disappears the moment things get risky. That kind of pick-and-choose activism makes me angry because that’s exactly the political behavior we protested against.  Then there’s the whole “our office was attacked” episode. He went public with it, made it sound serious, and then the police said there was no official complaint, and everything was calm when they arrived. What are we supposed to believe? Either be transparent or don’t dramatize it. People actually suffered during these protests. People bled. People DIED. And watching someone drag the movement into half-explained drama with zero clarity is honestly insulting.  What makes me the most furious is how he keeps talking like he represents the entire generation, giving big speeches about unity, direct elections, overseas voting, and political reform, while his actions keep zig-zagging all over the place. You don’t get to call yourself the voice of Gen-Z while making moves that look inconsistent, self-centered, and convenient. The Gen-Z protests weren’t a TikTok trend. They weren’t a branding opportunity. They were a desperate cry from a generation that’s tired of being silenced and robbed of a future.  Watching someone turn that into a messy political ambition is heartbreaking and infuriating. We didn’t risk our safety so one guy could walk around looking like a “youth politician.” We marched for real change. For accountability. For a country that doesn’t chew its future generation alive. And right now, Miraj feels like he’s drifting so far from the soul of that movement that it’s honestly painful.  If he actually wants to stand for Gen-Z, then he needs to stop playing this half-activist, half-politician game and show some damn consistency, clarity, and courage because right now, all I’m seeing is another person using the movement’s energy to put himself in the spotlight.  Anyone else feel like this? Because I’m seriously done pretending this is okay.    And here are the straight-up questions people genuinely have for him:  Who is funding your movement, your events, and now this new political party?  Why did you claim there was “no leader” during the protests but suddenly step into a political role afterward?  When exactly did you decide to form a party during the protests or after?  If you didn’t intend to be a leader, why are you acting like one now?  Why do you vanish or disengage whenever things get tense, unclear, or dangerous?  Why was the October 9 situation handled so confusingly by you?  Why talk about an attack on your office but file no clear, formal police complaint?  Who keeps you accountable? Who checks your decisions?  What gives you the right to speak on behalf of an entire generation?  Are you building a movement or building a personal political brand?",

So support those who want corruption free nation, not a certain generation|||here's my 2 cents(you can check my post history to determine the kind of person I am)  He's from a well-off family. He's been doing 'media' stuff like making videos and shit from a while ago but he hasn't been 'in the streets' as a kid and it shows. Call me backwards or whatever but if you never got into fights as a kid, or even as a teenager, you don't have that 'bite'. That's him. That softness combined with good looks and branding made him the perfect mascot for non-violent 'gen-z'. He's great as a model but as a ruthless and calculating leader that can lead hundreds of people to bring a certain outcome? Nope.. he's a weak kid inside. Aba ko political events le uslai daro banauna chai sakcha hai in that regard.  He got scared after the sep 8/9 incidents, fearing that his good life could get stripped away from him. He's someone with a lot to lose. His family and relatives probably held him back. Tespachi he probably came back to the front ali pachi with some kind of a plan. Aile chai I just think he's trying to do what he thinks and knows is right - play by the political system's rules. And since we all have severe trauma related to anything 'political party' related, we hate to see it.  Sudan is the opposite of miraj - he's been in the field, has scolded corrupt officials to their face since 2015, has had literal dirt and blood on him. But he's not an eloquent speaker like miraj, he's got 'a look' but the kind of person he has become, branding himself online is not sth he cares about. Whatever he is, is his brand.

What it demonstrates is the blood we have - thirsty for oneself, power, money, opportunity. I am particularly upset with Sudan Gurung who is hell bent at removing Home Minister and this guy called Miraj Dhungana. I will dismiss Miraj right off the bat because I don't see anything in his eyes and his face. He is a selfish person and anyone who is following him and all should think many times. Sudan Gurung - the guy is hell bent on removing home minister on such a stupid demand that he wants to arrest Oli and Lekhak. What the hell guys ? are you looking for rawanraj? we have laws and we want to enforce it fairly and strictly. Om Prakash is a lawyer and he is not trying to protect Oli or Lekhak - anyone thinks that is such a stupid Zenzee. Do you guys want to arrest someone just on a whim? without gathering sufficient proof? In western countries law enforcement officials spend years if not decades monitoring and gathering evidences against someone they think is culprit - they just don't  arrest someone and investigate - that wouldn't be rule of law. Om Prakash has that schooling. I don't care who Om Prakash is and all but he is definitely a capable guy and has proved it time and again - after all, he is chosen by PM.  Now, are you guys looking to change ministers and government leadership when we only have 4 months to go ? Its such a shame when every so called Zenzee goes to Singhadarbar and disturbs our government's actions. Just think if all the time they spend is meeting you guys.     Now listen to what Mahabir Pun said - please go to your constituencies and help new  political parties that align to your views win - why are you spending so much energies trying to meet the PM ? The Miraj Dhungana is such a scam guy - He is driven by his own ambition, I feel. I did like Sudan but he is also active childish and not a thing in near future.  Whatever everyone says and does listen and watch what Rachha Bam says and does. She is the one who walked out with Army Chief when he seemed to infer democracy was in danger. She is acting with passion and patience. I would recommend everyone to support behind Raswapa, Sagar Dhakal, Baburam, Kulman,  Sumana Shrestha. Sumana is the real deal.     Now if you believe in democracy and free and fair election, support Rabi. How can a person so beloved by people can be in jail without having an opportunity to go to people? is democracy is for the people and by the people?     I recommend please read. Watch what Swarmin Wagle said few days that Deuba was Zenzee, Oli was Zenzee and every popular leader was zenzee when they started politics. There has been tremendous progress but it was not enough. Just because you feel young and under 25 doesn't mean its your government and can do anything. Nope - no way until we have rule of law.     Now this government gotta focus on election and it has to happen. When I hear Miraj and Sudan that say it can't happen in current condition are not only naïve but foolish. They gotta go read what democracy is. Nothing happens without people's mandate which is vote.     And don't forget its not you guys who brought this change - it was a coincidence.  Someone else did on 24th so you really shouldn't overwhelmingly take any credit, especially Miraj who didn't even take part in the protest ! Hope it helps.|||Ani aaja bholi singa durbar bhitra baseka haru protocol follow garera aako hun ta ??|||miraj and party >>>>> yemale and other similar parties|||Yea the protest was headless/leaderless but we need people to lead you can't complain he gained from this protest of course he did and we want a capable leader to run office not military the argument that he was not in the protest is stupid this is exactly why we failed as national because we put fighters as leaders they can be leaders while fighting but in office we need people who lead office not mobs and arms   Not taking his side but this was a common argument against him and I disagree so this ...

They did not achieve anything despite such massive movement except toppling Government.   Miraj Dhungana came into realization. An organised group is must to move forward. The most important thing a leader should have is a clean image and clear vision. The maturity he has shown not being political figure is admirable.   One of the good thing coming out of Gen Z movement is the youth having interest on politics and stepping forward to be incharge.  We should not discourage them, in the same time help them by giving healthy and constructive criticisms.|||आज उनीहरूले गरेको माग केपी र लेखक लाई सजाए को दायरा मा ल्याउनुपर्छ भन्ने विषयमा थियो। सायद त्यो माग राख्नु गलत भयो होला है।|||Yo sub pani flip bhaira hunxa harek bela.

            "body": "Got forced into an arranged marriage, husband is shyer than a scared kitten, and now we’re 8 months deep with zero conversations lmao.  So after my +2, my family started going full \"bihe gar, bihe gar\" mode. Every morning felt like a marriage proposal interview. I kept saying I wanted to study bachelor’s first, but nobody took me seriously. Typical Nepali parent combo attack.  Then one day, boom they tell me, “We found a good boy.” I hadn't even seen his face; they were like, “Ramro chhora ho.” Girl, I didn’t even know his name.  Fast-forward to the wedding day: Whole gaun dancing, kids running everywhere, DJ blasting Sani Nani. Everyone vibing except me, the bride, who’s just like “ what is happening.”  I finally saw my husband at mandap and yeah, he looked decent but BRO DIDN’T EVEN LOOK at me properly. I swear he stared at the floor more than my face.  Then suhagraat… I was in the room crying like an idiot because I was stressed and scared. But instead of comforting me, man walked in, looked shocked like he saw a ghost, and LEFT. NO WORDS. ZERO. ZILCH.  For the next few days, our communication level = Bluetooth off.  After that, he escaped to KTM faster than a last bench student during assembly. I thought maybe he’d text? Call? Smoke signal? ANYTHING? Nope. Silence.  Dashain time comes, he returns home. I tried walking near him; man literally walked behind us like we're bodyguards. Even then, no talking. I don’t think he even knew my name until his mom spilled it   And the chocolate incident… His sister gave me a packet, so I ate it (obviously). Later I found out it was for gifting the village kids. Bro looked at me like I ate their future   Months passed. Not a single conversation. I started avoiding him too because at this point it's just awkward both sides.  Then post-Dashain, he shows up at my maita to take me back. Whole family treating him like king jwai. He looked scared of the respect   My little sister tagged along with us, thank god, because otherwise we’d walk one hour in complete silence. My man STILL didn’t talk directly to me. He literally whispered to my sister, “Ask what didi wants to eat.” SIR??? HELLO??? I CAN HEAR YOU???  8 months married. 0 conversations. 0 eye contact. 0 progress.  We communicate through: • my sister • awkward glances • chowmein orders • pure telepathy failure  Anyway, idk what this relationship is but at this point we’re basically two NPCs living separately but married by system default 😭",

I thought I had at least 5–7 years to mentally prepare… apparently not.  One random Tuesday, Ama goes, “Babu, we found a girl for you.” I nearly dropped my phone. Girl? For ME? Why?  I saw one tiny photo of you for 0.3 seconds before my dad covered it like it was a government secret. I was like, “Wait— but— who—?” Too late. Wedding prep started.  Wedding Day  Everyone’s dancing, drinking, screaming, having the time of their lives. Meanwhile me = statue mode.  Then I saw you at the mandap.  My brain: “She’s… pretty.” Also my brain: “Don’t look. If you look she’ll know you exist.”  So yes, I stared at the floor like it owed me money. I was SO nervous I forgot how to blink.  Suhagraat  I walked into the room and saw you crying and my entire soul left my body.  I panicked so hard I thought I’d faint. My mind went: “What do I do?? Comfort??? Talk??? DIE???”  So I did the only thing my socially anxious caveman instincts allowed: I LEFT.  First Few Days  Every time I tried to say something, my throat said, “Haha no.” You looked as scared as I felt.  So… Bluetooth off.  Then I got sent to Kathmandu for work and honestly I was relieved because I had no idea how to function around you. I rehearsed texting you like 20 times but never sent anything. If silence was a sport, I was winning gold.  Dashain  I came home thinking, “Okay, this time I’ll talk.” Then I saw you.  Brain: buffering…  I wanted to walk next to you but I didn't want to be creepy or weird, so I walked behind. Like a bodyguard with performance issues.  Then the chocolate incident— I gave that packet to my sister to distribute to kids. When I saw you eating it I didn’t get mad— I got SCARED. Because I didn’t know if I should tell you or just pretend gifting chocolate to villagers was never my plan in life.  After Dashain  My parents forced me to go pick you up from your maita. I was SO nervous I practiced “Let’s go” in front of the mirror like 14 times.  Your family treated me like royalty and I had no idea how to respond except freeze.  Your little sister tagging along was the best thing ever because if it was just us two… That hour of walking would’ve sent me to the hospital.  I DID want to talk to you. Genuinely. But my voice refused to come out whenever I faced you directly.  That’s why I whispered through your sister. “Ask what didi wants to eat” = the bravest sentence I said that day.  Now  8 months married. I still haven’t had the courage to properly talk to you.  Not because I don’t like you— I actually really like you.  I’m just… Terrified. Awkward. Zero experience. And overwhelmed by the fact that I suddenly have a whole wife.  Every day I think: “Tomorrow, I’ll talk to her.” Then you walk into the room and my brain blue-screens.  So yes, we are two NPCs married by system auto-fill. But trust me— I’m trying.  My heart is ready. My mouth is not.|||Xya yesto lamo kasle padhxa ho|||Yeutai manxey le made up scenario post garira cha yo ta.

Muslims of Nepal posted about their happiness when Taliban came back to power, they side with muslims be it anywhere in the world, buddhist burmese vs rohingya muslims they will take sides with muslims, indian hindus va muslims, they will pick muslims, syrian Christians vw muslimw they will pick muslims and so on… When Palestinians atatcked israel , Many musims living in Nepal celebrated it but then they never condemned the murders of 11 innocent Nepali citizens by Hamas.  They will always make reasons like we are Nepali muslims and we are different but their genetics, history is the same as that of Indian muslims as majority of musilmw living in Nepal migrated from Kashmir, UP, Bihar and Bangladesh .  For Muslims, religion comes first before nationality. Many groups within nepal have differences between them but for them the nation comes first, you will see a hindu nepali protesting against India and Buddhist protesting about illegal citizenship to Tibetan refugees. But a muslim will never say anything about illegal migration of Rohingyas .   Also, these people are real fanatics and radicals . ApM ssaid something that’s true, many arab nations don’t provide equal opportunities to women. Saudi just maid it legal for women yo obtain driver’s licenses just a year ago, many of the women can’t travel alone, islam allows mens to have multiple wives but why isn’t the same applied towards women?  Also, PM mentioned that in the past muslims women in muslims nation faced far much difficulties and there was no reason to be triggered about it.  They literally made movies about Sati practices withng some community but no one came put to protest against the release, had it been something about muslims they will flood the streets .  At the end, its upto nepali to believe that muslims of Nepal are different from rest of south asian muslims. I wonder when most of the madarsas, mosques have bangaldeshi, paksitani imams and scholars how will the teachings be any different?   I thank the Muslims tho, atleast bheda nepali got to see a hint of what’s to come when muslims make up a considerable percentage of the demographics.|||\"Ashamed of nothing, offended by everything \" community for a reason|||She ciritcized Hindus too.

You feel lost in those reactions and might even get out of your mind just looking at them. But listen to the tale, the story of how learning really happens. I don't know if you play games like Free Fire, PUBG, Royale, or something else. Ask yourself how you remembered all the gun names, location names, and the different things in them. How you remembered a whole 3-hour-long story you watched years ago? Treat these things the same way. Connect with them. Practice writing out the reaction yourself. Guess how they could pair up and react to give products. In the beginning, you will make mistakes, but slowly you will get used to it.

Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

Given my science background, which one might be a better fit?  Best Colleges near Lalitpur? Could anyone recommend the top-tier management colleges located near Lalitpur/Patan?  Am I too late for admissions? I just passed out in 2025. Have admission cycles already closed for this intake?  The Abroad Factor:  My primary reason for joining a local college immediately is to avoid a gap year, just in case my visa application for abroad studies gets rejected down the line. I want to have a safety net and continue my education smoothly. Any insights, recommendations for colleges, or general advice on navigating admissions timelines would be incredibly helpful right now.",

If you want to start your job career fast go with Bbs and if you want to increase the knowledge, soft skill and practical skill go with BBA. As of now the BBA admission has close in TU already and You have too pass Cmat too but for BBS I think there is a few time left for admission|||BBA pou affiliate college ma paucha hola|||Guess we are in similar track I am also applying for aborad but didn't want to take a gap if my visa get rejected  Aba timilai manegment sector ma nai aafno future vanaunu xa Vani dubai BBA and BBS are great opinion but according to my perspective,if  you are assure that you are going to aborad 100%(garirako country rejected vaye pani Aru kunai county try garxu Tara bidesh ta jasari ni janxu)Wala preservative xa Vani your pick is BBS here is reason  =BBS ma collage nagaye pani hunxa but taking about BBA you must complete your attendance around 75% to 80% it will be headache yeta  documents vanauxa Ani collage ko attendance pani Pura garnu xa but if you choose BBS attendance ko criteria hudaina and you don't have pressure and you can learn a skill and make your documentation that will help you in abroad but  you want to study in nepal single BBS le chai Best hudaina you have  to combine your BBS with other course like ACCA and CA(ACCA ko chai intake hudaina jaile aafu Lai thik lagxa teti bela enroll gare hunxa no pressure)  Or garirako country vayo Vani thikai xa aba Aru country ko chakar ma time rw energy waste nagarni yetai padni soch xa Vani you can combine BBS+ACCA or BBS+CA Garda pani vayo BBA Garda pani vayo it is your choice but here is my (little advice if you can give your full life,time, effort and you are 200% confident then only take CA) take BBA but I can ensure you BBA studying environment and friendcricle is much better than BBS.im conclusion if padai ramro xaina Ani visa rejected vayo Vani nepal padxu Vani your answer is BBA    And your another concern is that collage ma admissions sakyo Vani government collages and most of good collage haru ma BBA ko lagi admission haru ma sakyo aba private colleges ma matrai ho but keep in mind that if you want to study BBA in TU affiliate collage you must give CMAT exam and if you have not give CMAT exam them your options are collages that are affiliate other than TU   And if you want to study BBS then I am not comfort about the admissions in government collages but if you want to take BBS try to take in cheaper one because you will  take enrollment in CA .or ACCA and then CA or ACCA ma ni almost BBS ko content padai hunxa Ani timi CA or ACCA padxau Ani BBS ko ta exam matrai dina jani ho.    Ali lamo vayo ki kya ho 👌😂 If you have any perspective then reply de hani  ho.....|||Check AITM college Satdobato",
