            "body": "My house was vandalized in the name of \"Gen z protest.\" My dad is a civil servant, and we live in a humble 3 story house (the third story was only recently built). It was a small house when we moved in, which was 17 years ago— few months after I was born.   After working for over 25+ years for the government, this country, and its public, my dad still has a very clear history. No bribery, no corruption, no money laundering— nothing. Rising high in status and the post, he is recognized for his diligent work and highly stable work ethic.  Now, back to the present. The protestors had reached our house. I had once thought, why would anyone target our house? It's a civil servant, not some minister or anything of that sort. My father rose high due to his hard work and competitiveness, not any connection or bribery. We can all see from how my parents lived rental first (he was already a civil servant then). Only after a few months of me being born did they buy a house, not without taking loans.  I don't know why it happened because our house was aba and definitely not supposed to be a part of whatever that was. The protestors were going to burn our house, but because of it being attached to other houses, the neighbours finally calmed them down into not burning our house. Instead, they burned our bikes, went into our house, and threw things out to burn them. What's worse? When the protestors left, all the people living nearby, went in and out for 2 days straight— morning, day and night, pickng whatever things they liked amd taking it home with them as if our house was some kind of thrift store giving away our stuff for free.  We were at our relative's house, and when we saw all the black smoke coming from the direction of our house, we were devastated. \"Our house got burnt.\" That's what we thought. As i was the oldest child in the family, i couldn't let myself break down. I can still hear those devastating gut-wrenching cries and sobs from my mom, haunting me like a ghost every time i close my eyes.   I am a college student. My uniform is gone, and so are my books and copies. My sister is in middle school. Her uniform and books and copies are nowhere to be found as well.   Our money and jewelries, of course, are gone too. The same money my father earned and mind you, a civil servant's earnings isn't much. Only enough to label us as a middle-class family. The same money my sister sent us, her hard-working money(which was in dollars at that).  Our clothes, bags, and even utensils are gone, and so are our food storage(stuff). My mom is someone who saves money. However, she can just like my dad because she knows she has experienced the hardships with my dad. Because they know. Because they have experienced hardships and complications in their life. Because they have faced obstacles.  We have never wore any designers, no luxury fashion brand. All are affordable and comfortable. The only designer my mom and dad ever even had is when my big sister from abroad visited us and surprised us with some designer bags (which she also got scolded for spending so much because she is still studying and working in between only).  Our guests'clothes, laptops, phones, everything is gone. Me and my sisters' savings and my mom's little spending for managing our household— nothing is left. Not even our puja ko thaan(a small place we had to worship and pray gods).   We have tons of debts. I am old enough to learn that by now. Now that our house was totally and utterly robbed and vandalized while my dad kept on working for the same public, we have nowhere to sleep on. No clothes to wear. There is no place to shower or bathe.  We had to hide away from our own house we once called home to keep ourselves alive. My father was lucky enough to be safe because if it was even a few seconds late, it would have all been over. We were fortunate to be alive, even though we had done nothing wrong to people.  Morality? Humanity? Conscience? Guilt? Remorse? None. The same people, the same public, that my dad is working so hard to serve with his whole heart, has done this to him, to his family.  Gen z, huh? Protest against corruption, huh? My dad, having the cleanest history— no corruption, bribery, connection, whatsoever. So why our house? Why? What had we ever done to them? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.   I have no hope left. None for this country, none for the people of this country. This is now a country full of robbers and thieves. Humans are jealous. Humans are greedy. People are full of themselves, full of greediness and selfishness. In my heart, humans are creatures who have ruined any hope for more in me and my family. My father, who once poured his heart for this country and the people in this country, is on the verge of giving up on it.  You people, opportunists, and robbers who call yourselves voice of justice— I'll be watching, watching who you are going to tame to pull this country back together. People like my dad who are so wronged will be out of all this mess soon, Who are you going to pull to patch this broken country? I'll be watching. I'll be happily watching everything crumble and fall apart with your \"justice.\" You have given the opportunists a sense of win. You've let them think anything is possible, and now, everything will fall apart while you watch everything crumble in front of your eyes.  Lastly, I'd like to be a little vulgar and uncensored. If you are uncomfortable, scroll away.  Whoever has participated in vandalizing my house and robbing it empty— You are going to see hell and worse. I hope you feel yourself rotting away. I hope you don't think it's over now because whatever you stole, it will haunt you for the rest of your life and afterwards. I will forever haunt you, even in your dreams, converting it into a disastrous nightmare. You'll see hell. You are going to suffer.",

While this was an absolutely needed protest and it did bring much-needed attention and change, we also can’t deny the darker side of it. While the deaths of innocent people rightfully shook everyone and fueled the anger, more innocent lives were lost in the chaos that followed.  Gen Z cannot ignore the fact that others died in fires, or that people were looted and harmed during the unrest. It’s easy to say the movement was hijacked by goons, but the videos and reports show some protesters themselves vandalizing property and stealing from people who had nothing to do with the issue. Ironically, those who stood up against corruption ended up damaging the lives and livelihoods of ordinary citizens.   Those responsible should be held accountable for it!!!   My heart goes out to you for your loss. Please know you and your family are welcome to stay with us until you find a place to rebuild. Destiny will open new doors for you. Your family will rise again and rebuild everything you’ve lost. Wishing you strength, courage, and healing🙏|||Really sorry for your loss. The vandalism and burning of houses can never be forgiven.

You can't leave it alone, it'll need regular maintenance and you don't want your tenants going out of control. Please keep that in mind.|||Let me congratulate you for thinking ahead about retiring in Nepal.  Nepal is not right for retirement for folks from West at this time but I am very hopeful it will have   the infrastructure in next 2 decades.    Few peoples who I know have retired in Nepal are those who have started early in their life, mid 50s, they have been active there as well and have gelled well. Also know few who went there in there late 60s but ended up back: for them healthcare and difficulty navigating daily chores was a night mare.  Healthcare is catching up,   Kathmandu,Pokhara and Bharatpur will have great care.  Major issue will be the lack of like minded community. Mind you your friends back home would be different, may be you must have already noted when you go back home.  ideally, a retirement community for expat would be great. Imagine 55 plus uber retirement-adult retirement community in US.  I am a decade ahead of you folks and I am hoping to get retirement community started back home.|||Maybe selling the house and investing that in a broad-based index fund will make your financial lives easier rather than trying to be a remote landlord?  Please look up Boglehead 3 fund portfolio. You may want to compare the performance of the 3 fund portfolio with the returns you'd get from renting out your house.   Personal finance is personal. I'm personally sick of owning a house with the constant upkeep and annoying yard work. We will likely sell the house within a year or two and rent a house.|||We are also thinking about this and maybe on a similar timeline. There's not a lot of people returning to Nepal to retire now, but I think this will change in 15 years.  I think what you think is best for your child and what phase of life she is in will be a major determining factor in this. Will she have lived in Nepal at any point before this move?   I am hopeful that infrastructure, air quality, sanitation, etc will improve in the timeframe you are looking at.|||10 family can retire with this sort of wealth|||[removed]|||I would not sell the house until I spend in Nepal for few years. You never know if you want to come back after spending some time there.   But, once you are comitted to stay in Nepal, sell the house. Managing rental is a PITA. Put miney it on maeket. Live off dividens or annunity. Start investing in Roth IRA.   I think its doable with that much of money. I am assuming you make 200K a year together. Thats more than enough to retire even in USA, let alone in Nepal. You just have to save and invest.  The reason most people dont retire in Nepal has a lot to do with kids. Their kids are born in US, grew up in US, they probably will get married in US. When people age goes up, people tend to stay together with their family, people they trust. Every immediate family in US and ony two people being in Nepal might be enough for you to re-consider this in future|||Yes, you can do it!  Sell the US property and put funds in high yield CDs for management headache. Stay far away from your close relatives as well as any friends in Nepal when it comes to financial transactions. They will come with every opportunities to ask for money.  We just came back from Nepal after living there for 2 years with 3 kids.|||Let me know how will it works out planning to retire at 45.|||I'm 27M from Nepal, currently working here in US. a I've not run the numbers yet but I do plan to retire early and settle in India. I own land in Nepal and my mother is Indian, she is on board with my idea of turning the land she owns in India into a farm house. I chose India because of political stability, better infrastructure and easier access to import services.  I might be the wrong person for advice because you clearly have put much more though into it but good to know there are others with similar plans and worries.  currently I am single and enjoying my life but everything will depend on how things look if/when I get married.|||One of the most important thing that the would be  future retiring expat looking to retire in Nepal would be the lack of amenities / clean air and pollution free environment along with no nonsense politics that we are used to in the west.  Granted that most of the people living in the western world would  have home in Kathmandu/major cities, but we need to understand that there is a glaring lack of public spaces , park and recreational resources. We also need to understand that as we age, we would need those things within a walking distance. Now you know, this will never happen in Kathmandu and major cities. You would be lucky, if you can go for a decent walk in your Neighbourhood without having to pray for your dear life, and what about the God awful  pollution and terrible air quality index (AQI).  This is where, I see a real opportunity to have a dedicated retirement community somewhere in Nepal. Imagine having a good 5 km² space (that is about the size of good adult 55+ community in the US) with all the amenities, hiking trail, bike trail, swimming pools, restaurants, kitchen, sporting  facilities. It takes about an easy half 1 million dollars at the minimum to buy a home to get into this communities here in the US.  On top of that with all the cost included, the average expense per retirement to have a decent quality life in the US for a couple would be north of $5000 excluding in the medical cost.  In Nepal, this is very much doable with an investment of around $250,000 (that will get you nice well equipped does home within a community, all the amenities, and imagine having a personal home help and on site dining venue that is well stocked and served by professional staffs, I am talking about cooks/ chefs from 5 star resorts)  At the same time, there would be no dearth of lack of medical care. Qualified Nepali physicians would be lining up to serve the expats. And let us note further the fact that with 24 seven access to helicopter, air evacuation, Kathmandu/ Pokhara/ Bharatpur would be a mere half an hour away.  I do see a definite possibility of retiring in Nepal in next 15 to 20 years, if these things would come to fruition.|||I think healthcare is going to be your biggest challenge, especially as you age and start accumulating all that west and tear. Kathmandu is also not a healthy place to live. I would consider selling your Kathmandu house and buying somewhere outside of the valley where the air quality is different. You didn’t state but I assume you have Nepali citizenship?  If not then there are income requirements you need to look into in order to get a retirement visa.|||Nepal is a perfect place for retirement. Healthcare is super cheap unlike states.  People are friendly and you can earn passive income here too by becoming teacher or other jobs that are focused for expats. I know few expats here in Nepal and they are enjoying their life.  It’s not a paradise there are some problems too.  But we don’t have gun violence and environment is perfect especially in outskirts of Kathmandu.  Try thinking settling in village rather than city to truly experience Nepal.  If you have further queries then you can contact me.|||Hi,  Its a good thought. A lot changes in 16 years. Personally I think your FIRE number is low. But again, with combined annual of 220k, if you live frugally, you should be able to save a lot more in 16 years than just 300k. What you are projecting here- $3500+ npr 50k is enough for a frugal retirement of 2+1 but may be difficult if you want travel and luxury.  General health cost in Nepal is peanuts. You will need a really good insurance however to cover for something more taxing- similar to USA. Add on inflation to your FIRE number. Add on the fact that your child will have more needs in 16 years, and will have her own opinions and choices where she would want to live.|||I dont think that is a good idea. It is not safe here. And it wont be safe for another 20 I think. But if you do not mind that for yourself then this is the heaven|||I can speak to healthcare - Nepal can be good if not sometimes better for healthcare if you have money. I got a chance to spend 8 months last year in Nepal and did a surgery at a top hospital by a very reputable surgeon - my surgery, rest, recovery was much better and cheaper in Nepal than it would have been in the US. The story might have been different if I didn’t have money though.|||In a similar boat.. good luck OP|||So what I am getting at is you are planning to retire after 16yrs in Nepal?

To make this happen, we need to amend the Constitution of Nepal. Right now, it requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament to appoint a Prime Minister. To amend it, approval from both the Upper House and the National Assembly is necessary. But since Parliament is dissolved, we don’t have that. This means we need a new House of Representatives, which will only be possible after the new election scheduled for Kartik 21 (correct me if I’m wrong).  Here’s my concern. What if the same corrupt parties get elected again, maybe with new faces but the same dirty politics? What if the old leaders return? They have huge amounts of money to buy votes, and our society is also corrupted. If they come back, or even worse people take power, we will lose everything. The sacrifice of the 72 martyrs will go in vain. A directly elected Prime Minister will never happen because they will never vote for it.  I wish this doesn’t happen. I wish we get a positive outcome from our protest. But if it doesn’t, what are we going to do? I’m scared about this.",

My experience was quite bad due to time mismanagement and misunderstanding i didnt complete the reading part. I got 5 in reading and i did doulingo after destroying my ilets. The time was been shown in a t.v but it was running backwards and they didnt clearly mention the remaining time which i asked them and after the time was over the fat(fridge,truck, water tank) aunty snatched the paper from my hand, i cried at the desk ,i had prepared for the exams for atleast 4,5 months. They provide headphones and sound also could be monitored. I think they have increased the price of the test .  Make sure to monitor youre time while giving the test, i still regret about my time mismanagement.",

Right after my final semester exams, I lost my job and haven’t been able to land another job or freelance project since.

Now, after not writing a single line of code for over two months and spending most of my days watching YouTube farm tours, learning about crops, livestock, and regenerative agriculture, I’m wondering if this is just burnout talking or a genuine calling.  Has anyone here actually made the leap from tech to farming (or any completely different field)? What was it like financially and mentally? Any lessons or regrets you’d share?

Are you sure you would want to do farming full time as a job/career? If you think you have a vision and can achieve a fulfilling life then sure why not, but you probably should talk to some experts and get an idea of what it entails. Or shadow someone in the business closely first.  Also if you really want to leave tech then you can choose any field I am assuming youre still young - be it farming or some other thing. If you feel you dont have enough experience to pull yourself a job at this point or just the market is saturated, try specializing in something in tech? like AI/ML? Data? then apply for jobs. It could be online certs or a short term degree (esp if you want to do in overseas.) Remember inexperience is much as an opportunity to learn/explore  more.

This isn't just about a bad interview, it feels like a deliberate strategy to exploit job seekers for free labor.  I went through **multiple** rounds of interviews over several weeks. Everything seemed promising. The conversations were positive, and they talked about a great fit for their team. Then came the \"final\" task: to design a comprehensive digital marketing campaign.  I spent days on this. I researched their brands, analysed their competitors, and built out a full strategy, complete with campaign ideas, target audiences, content plans, and performance metrics. I treated it like a real, paid project because I genuinely wanted the job and to show my capabilities.  I submitted the work, feeling confident. Then... nothing. Total radio silence. I followed up, but no response. The most infuriating part? The reason given was a flimsy, nonsensical excuse that had nothing to do with the work I submitted.  This isn't an isolated incident. I've heard from others who have gone through the exact same process with them. They get you to design a full campaign, which they can then use or adapt, and then they ghost you or reject you on some silly pretext. It's a blatant exploitation of job seekers' time and skills.  If you're a digital marketer in Nepal and you're considering applying to IMS Group, be warned. This is not a legitimate hiring process. It's a fishing expedition for free campaign ideas. Save your time and your work for a company that respects candidates and values their professional effort.  They were still hiring 2 days ago and I gave the interview 3 months ago.",

            "body": "About fifteen years ago, many of us spent hours enjoying games on our Nokia keypad phones or other classic devices running Symbian OS (though brands like Samsung and Motorola were around, Nokia often ruled the roost!). We either frantically search the web for games or head to an electronics shop and ask, \"Dai Dai yesma(sd card) game haldinuna?\" before loading a ton of them onto our SD cards.  However, a major hassle was finding a game that actually matched our phone's screen resolution. Some games were half screen, some were overly zoomed, and the ones that fit perfectly often turned out to be, well, not so great. Despite the screen struggles, those original Java games were special many were unique, story focused, and almost entirely ad-free (Ads here, Ads there, Ads everywhere. We need nokia legacy back).  Recently, the nostalgia hit me hard, and I desperately wanted to replay them. The irony? I had exchange my old phones years ago (for indestructible chiya khaney glass that can survive metoriod strike and last for eternity). My other devices were either lost or simply not working anymore. I started searching the internet and found a great way to play these classic Symbian/Java games on Android. I am only going to share the first method because the other couple of methods I tried were quite laggy.  Some of you might already know this trick, but for others (like me until recently) who are still wondering how to play these games like back, this is for you. (Since I have an Android, this method might not work for Apple users).  Method I use:  Using J2ME Loader  Install J2ME Loader: This emulator is free and available on the Google Play Store. Download Your Java Games: Use Google to search for your favorite titles or visit dedicated sites. Some popular options are Dertz, Mobiles24, and Phoneky. Phoneky is my personal favorite because it makes browsing for the exact games you want simple and quick. (NOTE: PLEASE DOWNLOAD GAMES WITH 240×320 SCREEN RESOLUTION ONLY. IT WILL PERFECTLY STRETCH TO YOUR SMARTPHONE SCREEN)  Launch Games Using J2ME Loader:  Open the J2ME Loader app. Tap the \"+\" icon or the \"Add Game\" button. Navigate to the location where you downloaded the .jar file (this is the game file). Select the game to add it to your list in the app. Tap on the game's icon to start playing! (Pro-Tip: You can also go into the settings to configure the key mapping to suit your playing style.)",

They let loose the protestors, let them break the prohibited areas and then start with the brutal measures to provoke protestors and incite violence. Blame it on protestors, arrest many and start filing cases. Not a single media blamed the police and the build the narrative that the rajabadi group were the anarchist.  They wanted to do the same with the genz protest. They underestimated the crowd and thought it will be small enough to handle. As the day went on, the protest only grew larger and the plan backfired. The parliament was surrounded and it got worse as these cowards began shooting live ammunition to literal children. Normally in protest, police do lathi charge, take loud people to custody in vans and discourage any attempt to break beyond barricades. This never happened. Also, the government thought the media would be on their side like in the tinkune incident but that never happened.",

I always support minorities when it's right. also proud of the minority representation in parliament and government job, I think our country is one of the best in the world in that regard. and I am a supporter of federalism.

The fact that Madhesi leaders always thrived was because of it's peoples who can be easily manupulated. Also they even killed the policeman inhumanly. Did the protestors actually read the Constitution of Nepal 2072 before finding if they were treated infairly? If not why would they listen to their LALU YADAV inclied leaders. sorry but it's their own leader who lead to that fiasco.",

Then, randomly some months ago saw the same name on social media and him selling his book for helping to build industry or research center.  Then, saw his post about how he will work more for young people so he will get more votes from younger generation if another such vote occurs in the future. I was so impressed by such a positive take by this man.  But today, like many others I got to see the video of his graduation speech on Nebraska University. I searched some more on YouTube and this man has been actively saying nothing but 'my home village' and 'my country Nepal'.  His love for this nation is second to none. Even after how he has been treated by everyone including myself. Even I never bother to search online about him.  Everyone in Nepal like me need to apologize to Dr.Mahabir Pun.  His quote,\"There comes a difficult time, unusual situation that people usually don't need to go through. In that situation it is necessary to have uncommon faith and uncommon approaches to face the uncommon odds of human life.\" from the same video of graduation speech. It will never leave my brain. This man said those words on 2007 and lived by it. His uncommon faith and uncommon approaches has definitely made huge impact on me today. And hoping Nepal will follow his will of uncommon faith and uncommon approaches to face the uncommon odds of human life.  This is not a time to be wasting on excel sheets, Facebook status, conspiracy theories and on egocentric people. We won't get any better person than him to lead the change on his sector.   We've hit the jackpot with him. Let him work or cook as they say it on social media.",

They are just normal people who don't want to see more unemployment and rising prices due to an influx of people. The blame, however, should go directly to the bureaucrats and the big businesses of Australia who are exploiting the immigrants and its laws by hiring cheap wages.|||I am Australian and play tennis with some wonderful Nepalis.

Do visit when free.|||Thankyou so much(x5) for your kind and warm words. Do visit Nepal, it's beautiful and safe <333.  Much love to you all Aussies too.|||Thanks for your kind appreciation. Let me tell you our Nepalese perspective.  As a Nepalese, it's really tough for us to enter Australia, first you must pass at least high school with good marks, then get a really good English test score, then you must show a significant bank balance, so your immigration policy is already filtering only the best people from other countries.   I am a Engineer myself, it's relatively easy for someone like me to immegrate to Australia, but for students of other field, you're immigration policy already make sure only the best students come in your country, and it should be that way to be honest.   Regarding your immigration issue, well I believe any country should only allow immigration if there is net positive for the country, you don't want a bunch of liabilities to come in your country, right??  So, just look at the data, you can very easily find out what communities are contributing to Australia, and what communities are hampering the country, and simply adjust the policies that way, it's really that simple.   Regarding recent protests against Immigration, well I think that's just the coverup done by the rich and elites to brainwash common Aussies so that the blame is shifted towards immigration when in fact Australia has the best immigration compared to many Western countries.   My cousin recently returned back to Nepal, they lived in Melbourne for almost 10 years, they shared the economy isn't doing great compared to past years, and the blame is being shifted solely towards immigration.|||Appreciate it mate|||Can y'all please recommend your fav momo place?

Always up for a good yarn whenever I bump into someone from Nepal.  I know we’ve had a few grumpy old conservatives carrying on about immigration lately, but honestly, most young Aussies don’t reckon like that at all. From my point of view – and from any fair-dinkum Aussie – you’re more than welcome here. Nepalese folks add heaps of value to this country, and I hope that continues.

They will come back and try to do everything possible to regain their power.   Instead of being discouraged by their appearance we can get ourselves involved in more and more constructive dialogue and create a scenario where they will not be back again from the next election. Engage in political debate. Spread words. More intellectual discuss will help create a \"vibe\" when they will find hard to regain power. We can never demand so and so person or party should not participate in election or use their constitutional rights. So them trying to resurface and whitewash their image is normal. Unless we convict then for crime in court they are free to start doing that.  Let's keep being vigilant. Let's continue this discourse and may be, just may be, we can tip the society as a whole towards a future without the \"musical chair\".   What the jenji protest has done is create eye opening moment for a lot of the old generation people and has made the younger generation a major stakeholder in the country's governance and politics. Nothing else, this is major achievement in itself. Además, the parties also feel some sort of pressure to restructure and change.

Yet, even after all this time, I still carry deep respect and pride for the land I came from. But watching this horrific video of a mob savagely beating an elderly man and his wife left me utterly speechless. Regardless of what the couple may have been involved in or accused of, nothing justifies such cruelty.  I thought Nepali men were the descendants of the brave Gurkhas—warriors respected and admired worldwide for their courage and honor. Instead, I saw a man sucker punch a woman who wasn’t even facing him. That wasn’t bravery—it was pure cowardice. And the chaos that followed—hundreds of people raiding and looting their home under the excuse of “justice”—wasn’t justice at all. That mob was just as corrupt and criminally responsible as the very people they claimed to oppose. They were not upholding the law; they were exploiting the breakdown of law and order to terrorize and humiliate helpless individuals.  But this rot doesn’t stop with the mob. The government, too, is guilty. Innocent children were killed during the protests, yet there has been no true accountability. Those in power—the Prime Minister, the Home Minister, and the security forces—bear responsibility for those heinous crimes. They were entrusted with protecting the people, but instead, they used their authority to spill the blood of innocents.  So when I look at this situation, I see two sides of the same coin: mobs acting as judge, jury, and executioner in the streets, and leaders hiding behind power while allowing or even enabling violence against their own citizens. Both are forms of terrorism, both have destroyed public trust, and both have crippled the very soul of Nepal.  And if this mob truly represents the next generation—if this is the standard of “justice” that today’s youth believe in—then Nepal’s future is not just uncertain, it is in grave danger. Because a society that celebrates cowardice, looting, and lawlessness, while a government escapes accountability for killing its own children, is a society heading toward doom.|||Maile paila post garya ho, yo bare  https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/s/okOHZ5elMo|||https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/s/okOHZ5elMo|||It's not going to change in one day.

Plenty of sons and daughters in Nepal are grinding just to pay off family debts or keep their households afloat. For them, going abroad isn’t about “hype” but it’s about survival, opportunity, or helping their families. Even the ability to invest in NEPSE in the first place points to a cleaner starting slate than what a lot of others face.  And while you thrived staying in Nepal, not everyone has that option. Families who send their kids abroad are often taking huge risks and sacrifices, sometimes from already fragile financial situations. Even if someone goes abroad and struggles at first, starting from zero (or even from debt) can eventually set them up for long-term security that wouldn’t be possible back home.  So yes, it’s great that you’re making it work in Nepal, but framing it in a way that hints at looking down on people who go abroad ignores the complexity of their decisions and struggles.|||Simple answer for you it is not same for every one.|||I knew a guy like you who didn't go abroad when he was 22. After 5 years, when he was 27, he went abroad and is now a permanent citizen of Australia.   Moral: Buddhi palauna time lagcha.|||You are lucky, I suppose. I didn't want to leave too but had a lots of failure and lacking economic support lead ultimately to go out. I miss my country more than anything. I wish you all the best.  Going abroad was definitely worth it for me. Specially during covid, I could atleast support economically. We literally were able to save my FIL by pushing money to the hospital. Few lakhs is not a big problem for me so I always have that assurance that I can take care of my family if needed. I am also less worried about kids, as they will have better opportunity for everything. Government supports health and education, and only fooding and clothing them is what I have to worry about. They also have opportunity to grow in a better society free from caste and religion based nonsense so they can actually focus on things that matter. Its much easier for them to travel anywhere in the world because the passport is much stronger. So overall I can take care of my parents and give a better start to my kids, which makes me content. But I miss being in Nepal more than anything.|||You completely forgot there are many of us who doesn’t even get money to spend on Nepse and buy a laptop or do some extra training courses for personal development.

Even if it's just about money, I have friends who have amassed more in 5 years working here in US as a software engineer than we'd have in Nepal whole life - more than enough to comfortably retire back home.  I have friends who moved solely because they were fed up with the beurocracy of everything in Nepal - from government offices to family events.  I have friends whose primary factor was to lead a life distant from the toxicity of their family.  I have seen people pursue hobbies far beyond what Nepal could offer.   I have seen people move just to give their children better education.  There are a host of reasons. And you could debate each one individually, but it's all subjective anyway. For many including myself, it's a mix of reasons. While I know people who don't have it easy and working tirelessly as you said, I don't know anyone who'd prefer to move back unless they were forced to.|||I emigrated 25 years ago. 10 years of that was hardcore pain.

I didn't ponder in remorse, but told myself- if I have to stay here, let's try. I had a good career, I was happy even though I didn't get paid a lot of pay. I managed my finances, got two degrees, and lived a modest life. I climbed the ladder swiftly, but then hit a peak.   I anticipated rapid economic regression in Nepal, so I decided to leave the country. I am pursuing my third degree, in a subject that I absolutely love in the US.

I left Nepal when I was way past my teenage years. Even though I am not as happy or rather don't have peaceful mind as I would hope for, my decision to leave Nepal was a good call! I should have left Nepal a few years before I eventually did.   Going abroad is definitely good and I suggest everyone to do so once in their life time; however, how long to stay is up for debate. I would rather emphasize on THE purpose. I left Nepal because I couldn't stand to live in Nepal. I am poorer than the most of my old friends who stayed in Nepal. Spiritually and mentally, I am as fucked up as before, which was something I thought I would get over by moving abroad.       However, I have a hope and \"I can do\" mentality. I HIGHLY appreciate the way I think these days mixed with whatever I had learned back in Nepal and the new things in this new environment. I wouldn't give this away for any price! (well a few million dollars might do the trick :D )      Thing is, we tend to have this bias that the things that are familiar to us and we identify with always seem better and superior to others. One should come out of it to see how things actually are. Hence, staying abroad is a must! It provides options and more importantly new perspectives on everything!|||Oh my god, so much hate here. “ not everyone is like you “ , “ you are lucky “  What a bunch of bullshit.

If i could work in nepal and earn half of what i earn now, my life will still be more luxurious in Nepal.   The only challenge is, one has to be highly skilled. I don’t think i am skilled enough to secure the same kinda role back home but when i am , i will definitely return.  Most Nepalese here do degrading stuff for work. 🤢🤮. The only reason people want to go abroad is that they are not skilled enough and are willing to do anything for money.   Nepal doesn’t have a problem with brain drain, cus people with brains are not the ones going abroad to clean toilets, cus they don’t have to.  The smart ones are able to survive in Nepal.

To say RSP karyakarta are no different.... This is very true, but why do you expect it to be otherwise?

Such changes takes ages and generations. Look at the current US, Europe and other top civilized countries...they are no different either.   While they all are no different, at least the karyakarta of these 'NEW' forces had the audacity of breaking out of the chains of Major political parties and confront them, which was almost IMPOSSIBLE before the era of Ujjwal Thapa/Balen.   2.

With all due respect to Sumana, she's a much needed breath of fresh air in Nepali politics, I have to disagree with her on one major thing.  She says Rabi needs to step down as RSP leader because she thinks that the best interest of the party and that's what people/youths want. That's where I think she's misunderstood and wrong.  From genZ upto the aged ones, most of them want Rabi in the leadership. That's why he got the highest number of votes among all leaders in the last election.  What I think is that Sumana saw many youth social media activists, who doesn't know politics and are misinformed and those who doesn't represent the overall youths of Nepal at all, they made video saying \"we don't want Rabi\", \"he's same old, corrupt\" which led to Sumana thinking Rabi isn't wanted by current youths and she need to get out of that party to be the voice of the youths.|||Good going on",

            "body": "My house was vandalized in the name of \"Gen z protest.\" My dad is a civil servant, and we live in a humble 3 story house (the third story was only recently built). It was a small house when we moved in, which was 17 years ago— few months after I was born.   After working for over 25+ years for the government, this country, and its public, my dad still has a very clear history. No bribery, no corruption, no money laundering— nothing. Rising high in status and the post, he is recognized for his diligent work and highly stable work ethic.  Now, back to the present. The protestors had reached our house. I had once thought, why would anyone target our house? It's a civil servant, not some minister or anything of that sort. My father rose high due to his hard work and competitiveness, not any connection or bribery. We can all see from how my parents lived rental first (he was already a civil servant then). Only after a few months of me being born did they buy a house, not without taking loans.  I don't know why it happened because our house was aba and definitely not supposed to be a part of whatever that was. The protestors were going to burn our house, but because of it being attached to other houses, the neighbours finally calmed them down into not burning our house. Instead, they burned our bikes, went into our house, and threw things out to burn them. What's worse? When the protestors left, all the people living nearby, went in and out for 2 days straight— morning, day and night, pickng whatever things they liked amd taking it home with them as if our house was some kind of thrift store giving away our stuff for free.  We were at our relative's house, and when we saw all the black smoke coming from the direction of our house, we were devastated. \"Our house got burnt.\" That's what we thought. As i was the oldest child in the family, i couldn't let myself break down. I can still hear those devastating gut-wrenching cries and sobs from my mom, haunting me like a ghost every time i close my eyes.   I am a college student. My uniform is gone, and so are my books and copies. My sister is in middle school. Her uniform and books and copies are nowhere to be found as well.   Our money and jewelries, of course, are gone too. The same money my father earned and mind you, a civil servant's earnings isn't much. Only enough to label us as a middle-class family. The same money my sister sent us, her hard-working money(which was in dollars at that).  Our clothes, bags, and even utensils are gone, and so are our food storage(stuff). My mom is someone who saves money. However, she can just like my dad because she knows she has experienced the hardships with my dad. Because they know. Because they have experienced hardships and complications in their life. Because they have faced obstacles.  We have never wore any designers, no luxury fashion brand. All are affordable and comfortable. The only designer my mom and dad ever even had is when my big sister from abroad visited us and surprised us with some designer bags (which she also got scolded for spending so much because she is still studying and working in between only).  Our guests'clothes, laptops, phones, everything is gone. Me and my sisters' savings and my mom's little spending for managing our household— nothing is left. Not even our puja ko thaan(a small place we had to worship and pray gods).   We have tons of debts. I am old enough to learn that by now. Now that our house was totally and utterly robbed and vandalized while my dad kept on working for the same public, we have nowhere to sleep on. No clothes to wear. There is no place to shower or bathe.  We had to hide away from our own house we once called home to keep ourselves alive. My father was lucky enough to be safe because if it was even a few seconds late, it would have all been over. We were fortunate to be alive, even though we had done nothing wrong to people.  Morality? Humanity? Conscience? Guilt? Remorse? None. The same people, the same public, that my dad is working so hard to serve with his whole heart, has done this to him, to his family.  Gen z, huh? Protest against corruption, huh? My dad, having the cleanest history— no corruption, bribery, connection, whatsoever. So why our house? Why? What had we ever done to them? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.   I have no hope left. None for this country, none for the people of this country. This is now a country full of robbers and thieves. Humans are jealous. Humans are greedy. People are full of themselves, full of greediness and selfishness. In my heart, humans are creatures who have ruined any hope for more in me and my family. My father, who once poured his heart for this country and the people in this country, is on the verge of giving up on it.  You people, opportunists, and robbers who call yourselves voice of justice— I'll be watching, watching who you are going to tame to pull this country back together. People like my dad who are so wronged will be out of all this mess soon, Who are you going to pull to patch this broken country? I'll be watching. I'll be happily watching everything crumble and fall apart with your \"justice.\" You have given the opportunists a sense of win. You've let them think anything is possible, and now, everything will fall apart while you watch everything crumble in front of your eyes.  Lastly, I'd like to be a little vulgar and uncensored. If you are uncomfortable, scroll away.  Whoever has participated in vandalizing my house and robbing it empty— You are going to see hell and worse. I hope you feel yourself rotting away. I hope you don't think it's over now because whatever you stole, it will haunt you for the rest of your life and afterwards. I will forever haunt you, even in your dreams, converting it into a disastrous nightmare. You'll see hell. You are going to suffer.",

While this was an absolutely needed protest and it did bring much-needed attention and change, we also can’t deny the darker side of it. While the deaths of innocent people rightfully shook everyone and fueled the anger, more innocent lives were lost in the chaos that followed.  Gen Z cannot ignore the fact that others died in fires, or that people were looted and harmed during the unrest. It’s easy to say the movement was hijacked by goons, but the videos and reports show some protesters themselves vandalizing property and stealing from people who had nothing to do with the issue. Ironically, those who stood up against corruption ended up damaging the lives and livelihoods of ordinary citizens.   Those responsible should be held accountable for it!!!   My heart goes out to you for your loss. Please know you and your family are welcome to stay with us until you find a place to rebuild. Destiny will open new doors for you. Your family will rise again and rebuild everything you’ve lost. Wishing you strength, courage, and healing🙏|||Really sorry for your loss. The vandalism and burning of houses can never be forgiven.

Being wealthy in this context basically means you're going to be perceived as someone who's undeserving.  2. Limited philanthropy: Wealthy businesses and individuals rarely invest in public works. If they do, it's a token donation. If it's actually a big sum that really makes tangible impact, the media isn't too keen on spreading the word. As an adjacent point, media can also play a pretty decisive role in inspiring people to engage in wealth generating activities. Our media outlets appear to be forever locked into the sphere of politics and immaterial commentary.  3. Corrupt political class: Let's be real. Most rich people in Nepal are rich because they have somehow benefited from being involved in political (read partisan) affairs voluntarily or otherwise (e.g. most big businesses don't have a choice). This is most especially true for full-time politicians whose actual legitimate source of income is insignificant compared to the amount of wealth they are able to accrue out of seemingly nowhere. This breeds resentment in the minds of the general populace who have no political recourse.  4. Crony communism: This is connected to point 3 above. People have been sold the dream of an egalitarian society for as long as democracy has existed in this country. However, the leaders never deliver anything remotely close to it, instead enriching themselves and their cronies any chance they get - all the while pinning the blame on the bourgeoisie.  These are just the major factors I can think of. So, of course people are going to see the rich and the privileged as the enemy regardless of how they made their fortunes.|||This is such a pathetic video if you look at it from a different perspective. Makes me see the worst of what capitalism could create. A middle class, well to do woman is crying because she fears she won't get to be a rich elite because the lower class people are angry over not getting their basic needs fulfilled because of the stark economic disparity, where there are 1/5th of the people below poverty line and many die of starvation. SHE IS CRYING SHE DOESN'T GET TO BE RICH WHILE PEOPLE ARE DYING EVERYDAY DUE TO LACK OF BASIC NEEDS. Imagine the level of ignorance you have to have to not realize this.

Thousands of people have been feeling hopeless for their entire lives.  I dont condone what happened on sept 9, but whatever happened did not happen because people are \"envious\" of rich people.

That being said the person speaking in the video raises good points and he doesn't seem to be spreading misinformation intentionally its just that the door he thinks are closed are not necessarily closed it is entirely possible that next election will choose directly elected PM but for that president has to support it. The provisions mentioned in the constitution can be bypassed because this is an extraordinary circumstance and legality of ignoring constitutional provision comes from revolution itself it's the will of people.   After election the courts can legitimize it after the fact on basis of doctorine of necessity as those procedure/unconstitutional changes although not allowed as per constitution were the needed to protect sovereignty vested in people and was the demand of people. There is precedent and this has been done.   The big problem there is obviously possible foreign interference.   Another strong point this person makes is that an agreement should have been made. even now with interim PM an agreement summarizing demand and demanded changes can be made that agreement will have legality by revolution.   It's my opinion based on my knowledge feel free to add on/criticize especially if you are a scholar of law/history.|||Yo pani Congress (Gagan Pakshya) ko jhole ho bhanne dherai Lai thaha nahola.

This was never our agenda. We had many agendas we fought for but the two major ones were a directly elected PM/President and the dissolution of state governments. Yes the bills have to go through the House for the President to pass and what he said is correct. I am not a constitutional expert and while I agree with part of what he said my question is, if the whole directly elected PM/President bill and the dissolution of state governments require a two-thirds majority in both the Upper and Lower House how would that even be possible? Why would the hon ones ever agree to that?  The voice reached there through the protests so can’t the President directly pass an ordinance or bill to amend these rules? Because the honorable members are never going to do that through the House and that has already become clear at this point. Does that mean the voice from the streets has no value? There must be something to it. At the very least it is us who get to elect our leaders and after all this facade if we still vote for the same ones again then that would be a shame on all of us.|||Sahi kura ho ekdum.. every word..!!

This report should be made available to the akhtiyar at all times. A simple net worth figure and a list of their investments should be available to general public. * for elected folks, document every issue that they're taking a stand on and what work is being done.

Most Nepali parents, except financially secure ones, are human traffickers and they traffic what they love and cherish the most; THEIR CHILDREN.   Nepali parents push their kids to leave Nepal under the banner of a “better future.” Sure, it can lead to a more secure life, but it’s not the whole truth.  This prejudice eludes parents into FOMO , worried that their child—their future cash cow—might miss the golden ticket to success. In trying to break free from poverty, they end up chaining their children to a new kind of slavery. Some kids walk into it willingly. Most don’t even realize what’s happening until they’re already too deep to turn back.  A few break free with raw talent, hard work, or rare skills. But the rest? They’re stuck grinding in the rat race. Meanwhile the parents gets addicted to their children’s income to sustain the newfound luxury, they could never afford on their own.

Stop acting like they’re a perfect beacon of virtue. You can love them better accepting the flaws not ignoring them.   And people preaching “bau ama le etro sacrifice garyo ani hurkayo badhayo..”. So, does that mean your love for parents is transactional? and if they were terrible parents would you not love them or take care of them?",

            "comments": "While I understand the emotions and frustrations that may have inspired the original post, I humbly offer a different lens—one rooted in empathy, context, and lived reality.  In Nepal, many parents encourage their children to seek opportunities abroad not out of greed or exploitation, but out of love and hope. For countless families, this is a sacrifice born of necessity. They send their children away with heavy hearts, praying for a future brighter than the one they themselves endured.  To label these parents as \"human traffickers\" is deeply painful and unfair. It disregards the emotional toll, the cultural values, and the economic hardships that shape such decisions. Yes, the system is flawed. Yes, the government must do more. But to reduce this complex reality to accusations of slavery and addiction to income is to ignore the dignity and struggle of ordinary Nepali families.  Let us not confuse desperation with malice. Let us not judge without walking in their shoes. Instead, let’s advocate for better policies, stronger support systems, and a future where no parent feels forced to choose between love and livelihood.|||[deleted]|||This is next level whining. If you think parents are “human traffickers” and you believe it’s all for their interest, why not leave them and stay somewhere else. You always have the choice of being independent or saying goodbye if someone doesn’t value your vision.|||some parents, when asked why they have children, just proudly reply \"budo bhayesi kasley palcha ta?\"   i am just leaving it here. if you got a bit of anti-natalism out of this, do what you will with it.|||i am so tired of watching parents' obsession with their children's success. you brought theminto this world, so do what you can to raise them well. then just dont expect much from them. my parents are so excessively obsessed with my grades etc. that it hurts. we have never had a parents child talk, always about studies and grades and blah blah. i cannot wait to move out and not give them a single penny lol.|||Honestly, this is a very sick post and undermines the true victims of human trafficking. Please go educate yourself on the effects of human trafficking, how prevalent it is even in today's world and the stories from victims that have \"escaped\". Nepal has been, historically, and even today a hot bed for human traffickers. I do not have the context nor the desire to dive into your family trauma, \"newsflash: most families have them\", but your post is very immature and you should be more conscious about how you think and how you perceive the world.|||Hmm, this is actually very true and valid observation, my father, along with many others have fell for this trap. It doesnt happen only with those going abroad, but with those living in Nepal as well. I have seen it happen to teachers mainly. Majority of the secondary school teachers are a clear victim of such traps as majority of them wanted to do something else, be someone better like an engineer, doctor however since their parents forced them to earn money and not leave the sustainable source of income.   And obviously it happens to the lower manpower as well. Welp, whom can we blame for this though. This is a system, a deeply rooted system/mindset, sickening yet integral.|||View so controversial you had to make an AI write it.  If you had an original thought, at least present it to the world yourself.|||They are not human trafficking, those thave have lived in this country longer know the country better, if they want better life for themselves and their families what's wrong?|||I know many parents, who have given up their dreams and survived on bare minimum just to make sure their children get better life. These parents send their kids abroad in hope that their kids don't suffer as they have suffered. Some even take huge loans just to give their kids education and/ send them abroad. While writing this comment, I remember the video of this one mother crying when the social media banned happened saying \"sarkar ma Mero bachha haru sanga bolna payena vaney marchu\". I don't know what background you come from and I don't want to assume but I know for a fact that the parents just want the best for their kids and being poor, they know suffering better than the people who are well off and they don't want their kids to inherit their suffering.|||Kun insta influnecer ko gideo herera aeu LMAO..|||There is surely some truth to it. In my view the whole family structure we have, lack of education in our household and blindly leading the life causes parents to support the slavery you are describing here. Since parents devote all their life for kids to be able to afford a better education they rationalize the kids should be supporting them or their aspirations. While most Nepalese parents are just parents and poor people, they are definitely struggling with basic stuff and it’s humane for a kid to help them. However to kids I suggest them to do it in moderation and make sure they are not doing a lot and making their own life tougher. Please break the chains but with love, patience, kindness and courage|||Ya Sara sansar ko bacha bidesh kamauna garisakyo ta yeta I used to get this a lot when I didn’t get a job, but it continued even after I finally got one with an okay salary. That broke my confidence — I lost 10 years of my life trying to prove that I’m better and capable. Now I feel like I have nothing left. I don’t talk to my family properly, I have no relationship, no friends, no social life, and even at work — where I gave my everything — I’m no longer appreciated, because I’ve become too expensive for them.|||OP Lowkey testing the open-minded thinking capacity of nepali redditors. Somewhat hopeful(on lower side) on the open to discussion and opinions of the community (socalled genZ labelled users)|||By using the term human traffickers you are giving a free pass to the real meaning behind it.

Some want to be leaders, some bureaucrats, some actors, and some businessmen. Dr. KC is a great person and he care a lot about the nation and its people no doubt. I think he's good at what he's doing, holding the people at helm responsible by staying outside the radius of influence. He's also finicky, easily agitated, set in his ways and maybe a bit off his prime to take a minister role. I think if the next minister (and the ministry) would work on the agendas he's raised with his advisory role, that would be optimal.

Nepal might be one of the few countries where you have such flexibility of spending.    Be honest, if you can't even spend few hundred in a month (which you spend in chiya churot in a day), why do you subscribe to service?

Right after my final semester exams, I lost my job and haven’t been able to land another job or freelance project since.

Has anyone here actually made the leap from tech to farming (or any completely different field)? What was it like financially and mentally? Any lessons or regrets you’d share?

Are you sure you would want to do farming full time as a job/career? If you think you have a vision and can achieve a fulfilling life then sure why not, but you probably should talk to some experts and get an idea of what it entails. Or shadow someone in the business closely first.  Also if you really want to leave tech then you can choose any field I am assuming youre still young - be it farming or some other thing.

It could be online certs or a short term degree (esp if you want to do in overseas.) Remember inexperience is much as an opportunity to learn/explore  more.

The best investment I see as of right now is cold storage for fruits and vegetables. There are enough farmers who will work to produce but the hardship for them has been for timely rearing and storage during the season so this can be offloaded into the market during off season. This is how off season fruits are made available even during off season abroad. This concept is relatively new to Nepal, if you move into this market first, you will have competitive edge.

            "body": "I need to vent and warn others about IMS Group's incredibly unethical hiring process, specifically for digital marketing roles. This isn't just about a bad interview, it feels like a deliberate strategy to exploit job seekers for free labor.  I went through **multiple** rounds of interviews over several weeks. Everything seemed promising. The conversations were positive, and they talked about a great fit for their team. Then came the \"final\" task: to design a comprehensive digital marketing campaign.  I spent days on this. I researched their brands, analysed their competitors, and built out a full strategy, complete with campaign ideas, target audiences, content plans, and performance metrics. I treated it like a real, paid project because I genuinely wanted the job and to show my capabilities.  I submitted the work, feeling confident. Then... nothing. Total radio silence. I followed up, but no response. The most infuriating part? The reason given was a flimsy, nonsensical excuse that had nothing to do with the work I submitted.  This isn't an isolated incident. I've heard from others who have gone through the exact same process with them. They get you to design a full campaign, which they can then use or adapt, and then they ghost you or reject you on some silly pretext. It's a blatant exploitation of job seekers' time and skills.  If you're a digital marketer in Nepal and you're considering applying to IMS Group, be warned. This is not a legitimate hiring process. It's a fishing expedition for free campaign ideas. Save your time and your work for a company that respects candidates and values their professional effort.  They were still hiring 2 days ago and I gave the interview 3 months ago.",

Using mainly just the 17% of the land (Terai) to feed the entire population is a problem in making.   Yes, I know we also farm in hills but it was an expression. Westerners use all that fancy technologies such as combines and auto-harvesters while majority of Nepalese hilly areas still rely on bulls and cows or not even those at all.   Could we make a small compact motor that a farmer dai can sling on his back and carry all the way up to a terrace, unload it and start farming and tilling the soil with it?   Could we make drones that will help spray fertilize the top hard to rich areas so the farmers don't have to go up and down the elevations constantly?   Another technology we desperately need is imo nationalizing 3D printers. I am very inspired by the Big Hero 6 movie where every household has a 3D printer and they can print their own solutions rather than having to go to the store constantly.

In the case absent such a request, the festival expense shall be provided at the time of Dashain festival every year.  37(3): A labor who has not completed one year of service period on or before the day of payment of the festival expense shall be entitled to such expense in proportion to the period of service he or she has completed.   दफा ३७: चार्डपर्व खर्च पाउने  ३७(१): आफ्नो धर्म, संस्कृति तथा परम्परा अनुसार मनाइने चाडपर्वको लागि प्रत्येक श्रमिकले खाईपाई आएको एक महिनाको आधारभूत पारिश्रमिक बराबरको रकम प्रत्येक वर्ष चाडपर्व खर्चको रूपमा पाउनेछ ।  ३७(२): उपदफा (१) बमोजिमको चाडपर्व खर्च श्रमिकले एक आर्थिक वर्षमा एकपटक आफ्नो धर्म, संस्कृति, परम्परा अनुसार मनाइने मुख्य चाडपर्वको अवसरमा भुक्तानी लिन रोजगारदाता समक्ष लिखित अनुरोध गर्न सक्नेछ । त्यस्तो अनुरोध नगरेको अवस्थामा प्रत्येक वर्षको बडादशैंमा चाडपर्व खर्च भुक्तानी दिनु पर्नेछ ।  ३७(३): चाडपर्व खर्च भुक्तानी दिइने दिनसम्ममा एक वर्ष सेवा अवधि पूरा नभएको श्रमिकले निजले गरेको सेवा अवधिको अनुपातमा चाडपर्व खर्च पाउनेछ ।|||Yes it should be but muji conpany le regular monthy salary nai deko chaina.

Company/employee performance base ma chai company profit bonus ho dine which is not mandatory and depends on the prodfit.|||Even if you haven’t completed full year, the company should give as per the months you have worked well at least the companies I worked for used to give tesari but Nepal ko companies haru ali chor cha so na dina ni ber chaina|||Hamro ma chai 1 year complete vaye pachi matra paucha 1 month ko basic salary|||Yes it's mandatory as per Nepal Labor Act. All organizations must follow this rule else they will be fined and held liable. If your organization or others are not providing festival bonus, you can file a official complaint. Not sure how to do that but I am sure you can get that info very easily.|||It's not a bonus, it's an allowance. Bonus is dependent on company performance, allowance is not. All employees are entitled to the festival allowance. It's not specific to just Dashain and not even called Dashain allowance. If you are not a Hindu or do not celebrate Dashain you can ask the company to provide you the allowance at other times of the year.|||Practically chai  The rationality of giving Dashain bonus is not on projection of years you will work, rather than its on the duration you have worked, so if you have resigned from company and your last day is after festival disbursement, you are eligible to bonus. But if you have your last day before disbursement, sad but company usually don't provide you bonus, this might be due to legal hassle of disbursing after employee is no longer company's employee but anyways it saves company money so they won't. Whereas performance bonus or company bonus or project bonus is different, mostly they are used in reference to each other for disbursement calculation. eg. your performance can be used for calculating how much company's profit bonus you will get, or even for project bonus.  Yes, company do give festival allowance, but they do manage it in optimal way, instead of calling it bonus, they do 13 months of pay coz bonus will deduct flat tax (maybe 25%). With 13 months of pay, you will get it along your yearly tax bracket.  But things might change when employee worked less than 1 year, some company require you to work at least 6 months for any bonus eligibility, some based on number of months worked, some just gives you bonus despite your working month, or some of you can negotiate in advance to get bonus while joining which will override any rule otherwise. So, before you join, make sure you clear this eligibility as this is more based on company.  And some company does this bonus calculation based on basic salary rather than your regular salary, this also needs to be cleared in advance.  My experience so far has been good, it was either based on number of months or full bonus but never had calculation done based on basic salary rather than on regular salary, which I cleared it prior to joining. Also on one company, I did join 3 months prior to Dashain and asked for full bonus during negotiation which they agreed and received accordingly. The reason I put forward was, as I was eligible to Dashain bonus on company which I was leaving, I would either have joining date after Dashain or join earlier and receive bonus.|||Is this only for Nepali companies or foreign branches Nepali company too?|||Yess, dinai parchha.

            "body": "About fifteen years ago, many of us spent hours enjoying games on our Nokia keypad phones or other classic devices running Symbian OS (though brands like Samsung and Motorola were around, Nokia often ruled the roost!). We either frantically search the web for games or head to an electronics shop and ask, \"Dai Dai yesma(sd card) game haldinuna?\" before loading a ton of them onto our SD cards.  However, a major hassle was finding a game that actually matched our phone's screen resolution. Some games were half screen, some were overly zoomed, and the ones that fit perfectly often turned out to be, well, not so great. Despite the screen struggles, those original Java games were special many were unique, story focused, and almost entirely ad-free (Ads here, Ads there, Ads everywhere. We need nokia legacy back).  Recently, the nostalgia hit me hard, and I desperately wanted to replay them. The irony? I had exchange my old phones years ago (for indestructible chiya khaney glass that can survive metoriod strike and last for eternity). My other devices were either lost or simply not working anymore. I started searching the internet and found a great way to play these classic Symbian/Java games on Android. I am only going to share the first method because the other couple of methods I tried were quite laggy.  Some of you might already know this trick, but for others (like me until recently) who are still wondering how to play these games like back, this is for you. (Since I have an Android, this method might not work for Apple users).  Method I use:  Using J2ME Loader  Install J2ME Loader: This emulator is free and available on the Google Play Store. Download Your Java Games: Use Google to search for your favorite titles or visit dedicated sites. Some popular options are Dertz, Mobiles24, and Phoneky. Phoneky is my personal favorite because it makes browsing for the exact games you want simple and quick. (NOTE: PLEASE DOWNLOAD GAMES WITH 240×320 SCREEN RESOLUTION ONLY. IT WILL PERFECTLY STRETCH TO YOUR SMARTPHONE SCREEN)  Launch Games Using J2ME Loader:  Open the J2ME Loader app. Tap the \"+\" icon or the \"Add Game\" button. Navigate to the location where you downloaded the .jar file (this is the game file). Select the game to add it to your list in the app. Tap on the game's icon to start playing! (Pro-Tip: You can also go into the settings to configure the key mapping to suit your playing style.)",

For example, if you’re unhappy with Ncell’s network but don’t want the hassle of updating your number everywhere, you could port it to NTC.  **Benefits of SIM porting:**   - Keep the same number while moving to a better provider   - Choose based on network quality and cheaper plans   - Push telecoms to give better service through real competition    Right now, we face problems when one network provider fails to give proper service. They don’t listen to us, and we have no option but to stay stuck with them.    Many countries already have this system. Nepal has been talking about it for years, but nothing has happened.    We should **pressure the government and regulators** to make it a reality. Number portability protects users, not companies, and it’s time Nepal moved forward with it.",

            "body": "In Nepal, a major share of the import and distribution sector is controlled by a few powerful groups, mostly led by families of Indian origin.  For instance,  Vishal Group and United Distributors Nepal under the Agrawal family dominate FMCG distribution;  Nepal Overseas Marketing, owned by Pawan Kumar Agrawal, handles Johnson & Johnson and Unicharm; DV Group, established by the Shah family, runs large FMCG and cosmetics portfolios; Pragati Group under Jitendra Kumaar Lohia imports multiple international food brands; and Reliance Group, led by the Todi and Chainwala families, manages electronics and appliances.  These companies, often valued in the hundreds to thousands of crores, operate with a core team of only about 20–25 people — many of whom are also brought from India. Holding exclusive import rights for global brands, they compel Nepali businesses to work under their systems, where we employ bigger teams but operate with thinner margins. This concentration of power and reliance on foreign-origin networks is a structural weakness of our economy and one of the key reasons why Nepali-owned enterprises struggle to scale.   I know dirty game of these people.     🚨 Wake up, Nepal! 🚨  A handful of families (Agrawals, Shahs, Todis, Lohias) run hundreds–thousands of crores in Nepal with just 25 people brought from India, while Nepali entrepreneurs work under them for thin margins.  If we raise our voice — like we did against nepo and jholey — international brands will rethink this monopoly. It’s time to share the power with Nepali businesses! ✊🇳🇵  Let’s have a broad discussion on it, after all business is what will shape our country.  Above details are well verified by AI.",

Make sure Linux goes on the SSD and set it as the first boot option in BIOS. Use GRUB as the bootloader, and I’d recommend Ubuntu or Linux Mint since they’re very beginner friendly. Don’t stress about Linux, it’s pretty easy to get used to, and honestly, once you do, you might not even go back to Window. You can find multiple tutorials on YouTube for Linux installation. Search for \" How to dual boot Windows and (your preferred linux distro)\". You can remove Windows once you are comfortable with Linux, if you want.  3. If you can spend a bit more, upgrade the RAM. Use two sticks of the same size to take advantage of dual channel.  With this setup, you’ll have a solid dual-boot laptop running both Linux and Windows.

Vote make prime minister of our own party we will have power and then we will get the budget. actually many people can relate this. These brothers and thulbaba are the those who have huge money. My father is in gulf and sending money to us meanwhile this have more money than us. When i need help, they will help me i know but has not ask yet.

So all her friends who worked with her who called her out were true. Engineering ma naam na niskeko ani Architecture ma 3rd list ma naam niskeko. Her Pulchowk project being paid and done by someone else, asking for help from classmates here and at Harvard, not a single thing was done by her and having the audacity to take credit for other’s teamwork.   Topper hoina one semester ko project ma aru ko kaam present garera winner bhaeko ho. Always knew she is faking being an intellectual but this is diabolical. Everyone needs to watch this! She emphasized she is a topper at Miss Nepal or Miss World platform. Unbelievably embarrassing!  Her entire family sees nothing wrong with recalculating board exam. Harek exam ma kasari fail huncha ani recalculate garauda high scores tyo ni 91 lyaera Engineering ma kasari naam na niskeko ta?

If normal kids pull off this kind of shit, our parents would have been the first ones to straighten us out. Hamlay bidroh gareko bhaye dui jhapad khaisakthyau.  This needs to go viral for accountability. Her words and actions don’t match at all and she is playing with people’s future since she was young. Imagine the people who actually deserved the seat but were denied because of her. This is so unfair and worry some!

She really is not as intellectually gifted as she portrays herself to be. She seems to surrounds herself with people who are actually intelligent (and hence pass off their work as her own) and her family is well connected and powerful enough to give her things she could never earn by merit. OR 2. Her family is CORRUPT enough for certain people to have a personal vendetta against her and deliberately tried to ensure her results are tempered with. Eventually her family had to do some private investigations and ensure her career is not impacted by such dirty political games...which just proves her family is corrupt and had immense political influence.   Either way, there is no winning here. She is still a liar, a hypocrite and a narcissist.|||do u mean she inflated her results misusing parent's political power? |||Shrinkhala took \"Fake it till you make it\" way too seriously|||Now i can confirm the earlier reddit post of one of her classmates of Harvard, she exposed how shrinkhala is not as intelligent as she presents to be.|||She was not batch topper usle final project ra thesis ma top gareko ho.my friend was studying architecture in pulchowk at that time and she told me she was not batch topper.

If we continue to leg pull , gossip and stop questioning the system we are very much alike the generation you are pointing fingers at. There is a quote that states \" Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people\". I really hope Nepal does not end up being the country full of small minds.

Many students do this alongside studies. Also, there are free resources online (YouTube, Khan Academy, NMC prep channels) that can help you push your score higher without paying for classes. Even I worked as a part time waiter after my SEE and I was working plus studying +2 to make some extra cash to support my family.. No job is small or big, try to work wherever you can for some extra cash.. start seeking for job, go to nearest restaurants, coffee shops, other businesses, someone would definitely be hiring..  If scholarship doesn’t work out this year, remember MBBS is not the only path, Loksewa and many other options can still give you a secure future. But for now, your priority should be your safety and health. Please reach out to a close friend, a teacher, or even counseling services if you ever feel like giving up. You don’t deserve to carry this pain alone.  You’ve already proved you have the talent and resilience, just keep going step by step. Things can change and will definitely change|||Proof me maximum as you mentioned here , if you do so I will help you atleast NPR 10K|||Not to demotivate you bahini, but I think Loksewa is the best option for you now. MBBS padhera saknai 5 years lagchha, teti bela samma kei kamai nai hudaina. Aile nai financial condition yesto chha, 5 years samma mental stress ni atiii badchha.  Ani, timile tuition padhayera bhaye ni garchhu ta sochauli, but it’s quite hard to manage time. My parents are providing me money for my expenses, but I am still mentally fked up because of MBBS.  Anyway, it’s your future. Do what feels best for you. Good luck!|||Dear baini, I am a doctor myself and seeing your financial conditions and no support system it will be very hard for you to pursue an MBBS journey even if you get a scholarship. MBBS is a long and tough journey and requires a good support system from your family for at least 6 years if you do well. And trust me it is not as lucrative as it seems from outside. A lot of your youth and family money goes into it even in scholarship. From my perspective, It's better for you to do some income earning work and take your study side by side( which is not possible in MBBS ,kapal njharunjel dedicated vayera padnu parcha to be a doctor). Euta part time job khojihala. Kaam lai thulo sano navana. Right now the main issue you have is economic. Ali Ali paisa kamauna thalesi, indipendent huna thalesi you will feel confident and not even your mom can look down upon you. Tara career growth hune gari padhai chai aghi badhaunuparyo hai. Don't lose hope! You can do it. Yo sansar estai ho. Don't expect anyone to help you. If they help, kindly accept. But tmi eklai vayepani garna sakchau. Haar namana. Baru pachi ramro vayo life ma vaane aaile tmi jasto condition vakolai help gara.

If you don’t have any possible way entrance samma survive garna vaney. Please every one who are down for helping let’s support 5-7K nai vayo vaney ni she might just go through this. I am down for support.|||Sorry if this sounds a bit harsh, but I don't think you can afford MBBS at this moment, neither financially nor mentally. Sometimes we just have to accept the situation, ghati herera had nilnu bhaneko jastai. Right now your focus needs to be on finding a job and probably a roommate that you can share your rent expenses with. And just cut off all the contacts with your mother asap. She has mental issues probably bipolar or something, it's not your job to fix it. She brought you into this mess and it was her responsibility to take care of you, not yours to take care of her. So just cut off all the contacts and find a job.

Since you know your financial situation and your overall situation padhna vanda ni kaam khojna important xa hola ni hai, ani since you are a bright student you can give home tution, and earn some money. 5yr mbbs garera last ma you will get internship ma 15 20k, ani tespaxi MO ma 30 40k 6th year ma. You see time it will take for you to just get started even then? On the other side what you can do is, start working, and may be start applying to US universities since you have a story and good academics you can get scholarship with stipend.  I know its easier said than done, but apply garna paisa lagdaina ani decision auda samma if you give some tution or start teaching you can collect some money for visa interview. Scholarship payeko manxe ko visa khasai reject hudaina.  Arko option would be join any other stream that you get scholarship but keep teaching, bihana ko classes vayeko college join garera. I think there are multiple colleges in ktm that gives scholarships to needy.  Ani jasari timle vandai xau mbbs ma naam niske paxi jaso taso garera ni survive garxu vanera, its not that easy. It is going to be hell of a journey. I am not trying to demotivate you, tara for now i think you need to think about your financial situation rather than what you want to study. Ani Mbbs nai garne vaye you have a lifetime to study that if you are mentally stable.|||Bahini, from my experience, I would say don’t choose MBBS. Instead, try for Loksewa.  MBBS is a really hectic field and it’s not like you imagine it to be. Aile timro financial condition herda, it’s better if you try for Loksewa, as you’ll get results and earn money way faster than MBBS. MBBS takes at least 4 and a half years , teti bela samma you won’t even earn a penny. You’ll start to earn a bit of money during internship as a stipend.  Also, the mental pressure in these 4 and a half years is too much. Endless classes, practicals, weekly exams sabai le stress dincha. If you’re thinking of taking tuition classes or doing a side job, then it’s really hard to do so for straight 4 and a half years.  Unless someone else is helping you out financially, it’s really hard. Ki ta timile IOM ma naam nikalnu parcha, natra it’s quite hard without any financial support.  It’s your future, so make the decision wisely. I'm always rooting for you! Take care.❤️|||You are wayyy too strong girll, wayyy too strong. yettiko mentality vako manche le testo jhundine sundine kura gareko suhaudaina, just a rough patch phase.   dherai le yo gar tyo gar vanirachan. ignore for now, 130 score is not a small thing, its very good marks ra distract navayera ali focus vayera marks badhaunu tira efforts gara.

I thought I had a tough situation but yours shattered me. Please do not let it break you. Please don't let yourself be broken by this. You may cry but don't let it take you any unfortunate action.   I suggest you pursue something else instead of MBBS as MBBS is very draining and as much as I've heard very stressful study and also the job you get from it is believed to be very stressing. I am aware it is a noble job but you have to care about yourself. Know that there is always a very good chance of being loved. Don't lose hope. You would get specific advices from other fellows here but pls don't let it all break you. Loneliness decays a person from inside I understand. Focus on getting independent enough to live a decent enough lifestyle for now. Food, shelter, clothes, walk.  MBBS will take too much from your mental strength.  If you ever feel like it is getting too heavy. Know that you are open to cry but not break. It is not a permanent rut. You will get through this. Have trust in yourself. Never lose that trust. Even if you do, seek it back. Snatch it back. Get it back again. I really wish for your better.  - An anonymous brother|||Please don’t give up on life like that… Tapai kehi din endure garnus ani it’s all going to be alright..

I am not in favor of anyone in particular, but if we look at things rationally, none of them are truly as good as they appear. We need to stop idolizing individuals blindly. We did the same with Shrinkhala, first lifting her up and later trying to bring her down. Similarly, let’s not put Sisan on a pedestal either. At this moment, these individuals are not important enough to deserve so much attention. Instead, we should be focusing on posts and discussions that demand transparency from the current government. Leaders like K.P. Oli and Sher Bahadur Deuba were once elected in a time when people were desperate for hope. Many believed that by collapsing the monarchy and restoring democracy, everything would improve. People trusted them blindly, thinking they would lead like one of us. But history shows us how that trust turned into disappointment, largely because nobody asked for accountability and transparency. Let’s not fall into the same trap again. Rather than getting distracted by opportunistic figures, let’s talk about the government, demand justice for the young martyrs, and focus on the truly important issues.|||Aba dear brother vanney response chahiyo, 😃😀|||He thinks she's the greatest minds!

His stories clearly reflect how miserable he has become as a person. A lot of this seems rooted in an inferiority complex—about his looks, his status—and he has milked his heartbreak for public sympathy. Shrinkhala and Sambhav may not be perfect either, but Sisan’s reactions clearly reveal the kind of person he is as well.|||People are defending him with lines like, *“Sisan is too innocent or naïve,”* *“Sisan dai lai taha tiyena hola,”* or *“How would Sisan dada know when Shrinkhala herself was speaking against corruption at that time?”* But honestly, this whole case of Sisan and Shrinkhala shows just how easy it is to fool Nepali people.  When it was time to enjoy the benefits (eat ghee), Sisan did so. But later, when someone else started eating the same ghee, he began criticising it. That’s exactly what you call being opportunistic.  In short, Sisan is nothing but an opportunistic person.|||This one time..way back in 2019. Sisan chahi Shrinkhala lai pick up garna domestic arrival ma aayeko thiyo.

The way he spoke — the tone, the dominance, the subtle undermining — made it obvious that Shrinkhala was often submissive in that dynamic.  No matter how popular a woman is, she wants to feel safe and loved. Shrinkhala stood by Sisan even when Michael Kobold came after him, but it’s clear Sisan has some deep resentment. His ego took a hit. Maybe if she had married someone self-made like him, it wouldn’t have stung so much. Instead, she married Sambhav — the “typical brat rich guy with a questionable past” — and that burned people even more because they actually looked genuinely happy together. And if you’ve worked with Sambhav, you’ll hear people say Shrinkhala got the best out of him.  Sisan, on the other hand, lacks self-confidence and thrives on external validation. He’s the one who kept the breakup alive in public while Shrinkhala stayed quiet. I’m sure she felt bad too, but because she moved on first, she looks like the villain and Sisan’s loyal fans went after her.  When Shrinkhala finally spoke out with excelshitzzz, yes, some of it came off bizarre, but you can’t deny there’s been a witch hunt against her. What’s wild is Sambhav didn’t even jump to share his wife’s side — he seemed more invested in his ex Niti Shah's narrative. Heard Niti gets called a drama queen too, but honestly… Sisan just needs to stop milking this. Bro really needs to move on.  If Michael Kobold ever decides to spill Sisan’s dirt all over again, things would get ugly real quick for him. Karma goes in the loop, BROTHER. And remember the Sambhav car incident? Nobody at KMG said a word, not because they couldn’t, but because everyone was scared of losing their jobs. This whole saga is just a power play.  At the end of the day: Shrinkhala needs mental health support, Sisan does too, and probably everyone else tangled in this drama. Sambhav and Shrinkhala may be show-offs or even corrupt in their own ways — but Sisan, you’re coming off as the real power-hungry manipulator here. BROTHER seriously needs to get laid. Don't milk this anymore and it's time we focus on Prachandey and where the fuck is Pratibhaa? Go catch the sharks now.|||That's why I avoid sons and daughters of corrupted and Indian nationals like Madhesi Bihari and Marwadi Indians.

It’s simple.|||Disclaimer: I am not a Balen supporter or cultist.  This post is conflicting for me. But, the post is characterizing the man based on:  1. What the man didn’t do or didn’t say. 2. What people expected him to do.  The man himself has said enough in his posts.   It’s what, he DIDN’T do that impresses me the most about him. Saying “No” is harder than saying “Yes”, when everyone wanted him to say “Yes”.  (Think about this.)  He put out only a couple of posts, which I think served as guide posts during the revolution.   1. He was the first widely known public figure (that I know) who defined who Gen Z was and gave his support to the protest. 2. When the tempo rose, he clarified that Gen Z should lead, he accepted Sushila even when all of his cultists were going crazy about making him the interim PM.  Removing himself from the picture, brought focus back on the revolution and the task ahead, rather than turn the confusion situation, even more confusing with a popularity contest as a side gig.   There is a lot of things to think about and I think in time we can all make sense of it all.   That’s my two paisa about him.|||Leading KTM municipality vs leading the nation are totally different. The followers of Balen urging and rushing him to lead 'right now' and come out by 2PM are the same people who will criticize him within one year if he were to be them PM someday. They don't have patience and want to see changes immediately.  Personally, I would like to see him running in the upcoming election as deputy/vice roles first and not immediate PM role...assuming how parties will be formed and if there are any good lead independent candidate who will run with him. He's one of those few worthy to be PM but this is not his peak yet. He just became a mayor like 3 years ago and he still has a lot to show to the general public. If and when he wins to the election, it will be his peak and he has high chances of being a two term PM...assuming two term limit will be in place hopefully. Time will tell.|||GenZ aren't immune to celeb worship culture.|||Hami Nepal has already stated it was part of a plan and they want balen for 5 years.

Yes it is definitely an opportunistic behaviour by balen. But how is this behaviour wrong and how is taking over PM position now and securing interim govt now and not taking part in politics for next 5 years do any good to the country.    He is practicing patience to achieve the goal he desires and what people actually wants from a young leader like him. Look throughout the history of world politics, paitence has always been the key factor to shape the world politics.|||Having trusted by many even me,In the moment of national threat, he could do nothing. That’s the reason I doubt him.  i think he is not completely responsible for being the Prime Minister. Sure, he is a great person. He’s doing such a great thing in the valley, but being a Prime Minister is very responsible post, his way up talking to seniors, saying I will put fire to SinghaDurbar, I will bury everyone if you’re in tudinkhel, getting carried away by emotions, being Prime Minister means you should not be carried away by any emotions and none of the factors should affect your judgment which you believe to be true and is lawful, Hopefully he will make such changes and we can finally see him in the top, as much as I want him to be the Prime Minister I do think he is inexperienced and immature in this field,|||We are so far behind that criticizing political leader sounds like a hater. We are not even to the point where we could say “This person is bad/clueless , country isn’t safe with them”. For the past decade, the corrupted 3 have been playing nothing but tato aloo with us so its natural to be sticking nail to current situation. Give it some time and our voices will get echoed.|||If there’s one thing old political leaders never learned, it was how to handle criticism. The moment anyone spoke up, they tried to shut it down and let’s not even start on the behavior of their hardcore supporters(jholey as we call them).  Even leaders like Balen need to address this with their own supporters, as do all the new representatives entering the upcoming elections. They must say publicly that they welcome criticism, will reflect on it, and use it as a tool for improvement. Leaders should make it clear to their base: don’t bully or silence people for simply asking questions or raising concerns. Do not perform character assassination against someone just for criticizing. After all, in a democracy, freedom of speech is our right.  At the same time, we the general public also carry responsibility. We need to recognize the difference between constructive criticism and defamation. What we must not do is fall for propaganda, spread rumors, or engage in baseless character assassination.  And if we realize that our criticism or questioning was wrong, we should have the courage to apologize in the same way we raised the question. After all, apologizing will never make you small. It’s just a simple five letter word: “Sorry.” A word that can and should be spoken from both sides.|||Just because you’re against the system, doesn’t make you Balen-Supporters. Balen has no experience. Balen should wait and gain some experience. Criticism is a backbone of democracy and one must welcome it.|||EXACTLY. They lack this ability to critically analyse any action of any leader. Like no one is perfect and no one is a good. Let's be honest. Let's criticize people for their actions. People should be held accountable for their actions. Most importantly, leaders who run our nation. If we don't point out their wrongdoings, will they ever stop? Nepalese have such a bheda mindset, istg. Let's be more aware and let's know how to discern leaders and their actions.   By criticizing these leaders, we aren't hating on them. We're trying to bring awareness so that they won't repeat the same thing again and can do things better for the country.|||They need to be aware party KO jhole become jhole because they were andabhakt of party leader ( just like they are blind follower of balen rn)|||I think holding politicians accountable is crucial. I hope people realize we don’t need  more devotees and followers. We need critical, educated thinkers. Support the good work, appreciate your favorite leader but don’t forget to question often. People change. Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Need to always stay cautious. |||Agreed|||Thanks man, you speaked my words. I see people thanking Balen for this movement and saying he was the reason this movement happened and succeeded and all after Sushila Karki became interim PM, and this made me very sad for actual people who started the movement and also faced the consequences and this was even more big realization for me for how blind youth and supporters these days are and this concerns me even more for future|||This. This is what I’ve been saying for some time. Like the post says, I’ve also been labeled as a party ko jhole and what not. Even here in this sub, people have called me jhole lol just because I questioned him.  I am a Balen supporter. I supported him and did my part by sharing about his campaign on social media and making everyone aware about it. And I was super happy when he won, I still am. But I’ve been criticizing him on various points that I find valid. The top one is communication.  During the election, he constantly criticized Bidya Sundar (the previous mayor) for not communicating publicly. He even said that once he became mayor, he wouldn’t be like that and would stay in constant touch. He proposed starting a ‘Mayor with the Public’ TV program and even set aside a budget for it, but nothing has happened. He hasn’t given a single interview.  And then come his jhole supporters who always argue with the same line: ‘Pailai kei chaieko ho.’ With that logic, we should never question anyone. Just look at how Balen has become now, he just posts one-sided, no-context Facebook statuses and nothing else.|||Balen is a hypocrite in my opinion, like he encouraged the protest and even promised to provide a safe and secure environment for the protest but when things turned south he vanished like horn from a donkeys head|||Finally someone spoke about this, belun has literally become a god complex among some people out there, which is kinda concerning, the only time he speaks is to not let his adhabhatka interfere in every other stuff out there. If he just sits in his office chair waiting mindlessly while everybody is reaching him out to take a step then its alarming, is he really a possible prime minister candidate?? doubt huna thalchha, veda harlai feri yo bhanda pachdaina, he has some done good things too as a mayor but idk has he not abandon us when we needed him most? Aba desh ko yo awasta ma he is not a good leader anyways, pachhi aba j hunchha dekha jayega. Hope we rise again from the ashes.|||Balen is just a hype, he has never been a mayor of citizens; he is mayor of RONB; if there was no RONB, he would never have existed!|||Ony the strong system maketh the county!

I personally don't think he has the temperament (though if there's a choice between any big parties' leader and Balen, I'd choose Balen every time).|||Aru kura thik ho, but can’t say he abandoned. It’s not 100% sure he will be the next PM so can’t call him opportunist.|||Yes ,|||Very well said|||While I am unsure on balen and his move, yes! To select a leader, you do have to question. Even the one you support. That is transparency. That is the trust that has foundation|||You’re right. In Nepal, many people tend to follow leaders without much critical thought, even when those leaders don’t necessarily act in their favor. Unfortunately, this habit seems to persist across generations. If the younger generation continues with the same mindset, there’s a real risk that the country could end up facing the same challenges in the future that we are experiencing today.|||You can make your own assumptions and narratives. If Balen had taken the post of PM, you would have said that he is opportunistic, that he enraged protestors just to get the position. I saw somewhere on Facebook, even before Balen’s official post on sushila karki that balen played dirty game for the sake of pm position. As far as I know, Balen is a farsighted person. He only comes forward when he feels fully prepared.|||That's my whole point, but again..vanepachi manche lai jholey nai lagcha. 😅 Guy's, learn to ask questions yourself too.

But ever since I saw him become mayor, I have always seen him wearing Nepali dress most of the time and consistently working to conserve our heritage and culture.  You know what? He is still better than most of the people there. Whatever he does, he has never done anything wrong. Stop pretending to be so-called critics for useless reasons. What is your academic background, and what makes you think that way? Have you ever felt the difference between past and present Kathmandu? I have a friend from the core area of Kathmandu, do you know what his opinion about Balen Shah is? No!  Even Harka Sampang is a very good person. Moreover, Sagar Dhakal’s brother has been working actively to eradicate the dictatorship of these political parties. Maybe your parents are bootlicking those rotten political parties, so you only see what Balen has never done and will never do. Just because he supported the movement does not mean he said he wants to become prime minister. You must understand that he posts only a few things because his words are weapons. One word from him has many consequences in such a movement. He is very clever and very wise; unlike Harka Sampang, though I like Harka as a person. But you need to give Balen full power to unlock his full potential. He wants change, he wants revolution, and he wants to remove corrupt politicians.

If Balen had come out saying he’s ready to lead, a lot of people would’ve jumped in claiming he planned the whole movement and just used Gen Z for his own benefit. That’s probably why in his statements, he keeps stressing that this is Gen Z’s movement and that the government will be formed by them. imo, staying out of it was the smartest move he could have made.  I’m all for questioning and criticizing leaders. I agree that its a problem if you dont want to do it. But when someone has shown that they are dedicated, not corrupt, and actually get things done, you’ve got to give them some benefit of the doubt. Save the tough questions for real concerns. Dont critise just because you think no one can ever be good enough.|||Yes Balen has fallen badly as he didnt seem to care about the youths when they needed him the most. But, when we are talking about selection of interim PM, he did the right thing by not coming out. If he had come out, more number of the youngsters would have gone to Army Headquarters causing a ruckus. Thankfully, that didnt happen. It could have been worse than Harka dai case.

He increased women’s participation in politics and society, with many ex-fighters now active in leadership roles.   In western hills and Madhesh, state institutions were weak or absent. Villagers depended on landlords for loans, justice, and protection, which kept exploitation unchallenged (Kamaiya, Haruwa-Charuwa, Haliya systems).

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not “revolution,” it’s not “justice,” and it sure as hell isn’t “the voice of the people.” It’s mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn’t make you brave—it makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that—surrounded by a wave of so-called “youths” who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let’s not sugarcoat it—the so-called Gen Z “warriors” hiding in the mob weren’t heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country’s social fabric. He still can’t step foot in certain countries because he’s internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he’s propped up as a “leader.”  Let’s be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn’t an accident—it was a setup. While Deuba’s family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don’t get it twisted—those sharpshooters in the crowd weren’t just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres—former insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let’s stop pretending this was “the people rising up.” It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist—the one who drowned this nation in blood—walks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don’t for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn’t that Deuba suffered humiliation—the real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn’t a flower; he’s a weed choking the soil of Nepal’s democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too naïve to realize they’re being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||Prachanda and Baburam are India's puppet.

This has been ongoing for more than two decades. Behind the few visible figures, there are countless others who have either assisted them or benefitted through their association—ranging from major brands in Nepal to traders. For example, Sher Bahadur Deuba’s son and his sanitary pad importing company stand as an illustration.  They have institutionalized corruption by appointing foreign ambassadors based on party loyalty and financial gains, extending even to the transfer of bureaucrats to preferred locations in exchange for bribes and other undue benefits. The problem is not limited to the political system alone; bureaucrats, too, require checks and balances. A mechanism must be established to regulate the power of bureaucrats over politicians. Since bureaucrats are permanent stakeholders, their influence is even greater. One effective way to mitigate this is to appoint domain experts as ministers—for instance, a professional civil engineer as a minister cannot be misled about the cost estimates of a construction project.  There remains much to be done. Moreover, these political parties will attempt to form alliances before elections, bringing forward the same candidates and restoring the same exploitative system. Therefore, the first and most meaningful reform must be a change in the electoral process, with the inclusion of a “NOTA” (None of the Above) option.  Further accountability can be ensured by eliminating political appointments to certain positions. At present, even temporary (karar) appointments are made based on party affiliation rather than merit. As a result, even highly qualified experts are compelled to seek political approval. The recent appointments of Vice-Chancellors at B.P. Koirala Institute in Dharan and Gangalal Hospital are prime examples.  In addition to these issues, several other structural flaws persist.

            "subreddit": "NepalSocial",
            "heading": "The Shrinkhala Khatiwada I knew at Harvard",
            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada’s classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.   We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking–much to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in  Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate - the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala’s approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.   Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn’t mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‘help’. One time, she even said airily, “I wash my own dishes, you know.” She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala–a beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth–lingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don’t intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‘nepo babies’ who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).   Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It’s a troubling idea to think that despite what’s happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

And a few after she became miss nepal... I can somewhat vouch for the \"I'm busy with this and that... Can you help me with this\" part...

I never liked her naak ma singan adke jasto boli.. And always felt she has a cunning personality that clings over you until she can no more use you for her advantage..  Sisan literally dodged a  bullet.. all thanks to her greed though..|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn’t some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was “beneficial” for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake “beauty with brains” narrative. Do you guys remember Niti’s big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let’s not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala’s prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it’s her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let’s be real- Sisan wasn’t perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they’d known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn’t even exist. This just proves it- they weren’t just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can’t just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala’s career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav’s narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What’s the lesson we can learn from here ?  Karma is real af & money can’t give you lifelong happiness, night Redditors|||Wish we had more tea like this on all nepo babies.|||She didn't get any fucking scholarship from the Nepali government. She was funded by her corrupt father.||| Damn I strictly feel its true|||I  never cared for her but hated her when she said ‘ we were not well off I had to share room with my house help ‘ and tried to relate to poor people like bro fuck off .|||Thanks for sharing. Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don’t even make sense to begin with. Don’t know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don’t even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It’s so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It’s astounding what the world has come to and it’s deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can’t be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn’t she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It’s better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has. It’s disheartening!|||[deleted]|||Correct my if I’m wrong guys, but shrinkhala father was health minister covid time, I heard tyo time ma vaccine ma ra health sector ma eka dum corruption bhaykeo thiyo.

Every move, every word, every connection seems like part of a bigger calculation. While most people get dragged through the mud on social media, she somehow stays a step ahead. Of all platforms, she was clever enough to pull the LinkedIn card first. That’s not by accident, it’s calculation. She knows the bashing on Tiktok or Instagram doesn’t matter as long as her professional side stays spotless, especially where she might work with people internationally who will never know the side of her life in Nepal that’s been exposed and torn apart ever since the truth came out.  It’s like she’s playing this endless game of Ludo, always climbing the ladder, polishing her image as she goes. But at the same time, you can’t help but feel she’s only ever a roll away from hitting 98 and sliding right back down the snake.|||We wont know if what you claim is true. But I wouldn't be surprised if its true either or even worse. I would assume that she was in her best behavior since she was not in Nepal and probably wanted to portray the best of her image.  My moment of disdain for her came about when her father one of the members of the parliament who were on monthly housing allowance along with the monthly pay. The beinfit is probably meant for the MPs who had to move temprorarily to the capital or who didn't have their own residence. Iirc, they had to manually opt in to get that added housing allowance. When the news published, her father's reaction was something along the line of \"I didn't know, I was getting it. I am happy to return it.\"  Question for her, how come you dont know the source of wealth and your parent's ethics?

These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!! And the way she's silent when the country is bleeding says alottt too!!!!!!  And about the Nepal's government scholarship for harvard,this is not true, she is telling an entire different story about harvard scholarsip & how she paid fees there. She said she got 30% scholarship at harvard and the remaining 70% is paid through her brand endorsements money as she is brand ambassador to few company. We didnt buy that story, she tried hardest to sell it though and still fools people with this shitty madeup script about harvard's 30% scholarship & 70% funding through brand endorsement's money lmao. And lately she's being questioned on 50,000USD she got during miss world competition after winning \"beauty with the purpose\" title. Her ex exposed & questioned her in a very shady way and because of him we all knew this new layer of truth and i highly doubt it went on harvard's funding rather than for actual purpose|||One buy Harvard degree with that 50K and another one became a MAKUSE owner .

Continue on --|||Thanks for sharing your raw and real experience, thoughts and opinion. This is valuable for those of us who were shocked and skeptical about her success right from the day she got into limelight. I watched her view on Youtube yesterday and couldn't get past a minute of that video, she is clearly playing victim and trying to play the game.  Nope! she doesn't deserve any chance at all.  The students that I know personally who went to Harvard, MIT and many other prestigious institutions had grit, determination, belief in hard-work, may be little bit of luck but most of all they had \"humility\". They NEVER used their \"Harvard degree\" or Ivy league label to show off. It's those who want to fame and fake pride that put up social media posts to show off their diplomas. Honestly, it was very very clear even before she went to Harvard that she was on the wrong side of fame game.  For the longest time I thought it was a generational difference, since there are many other Harvard students who have publicized themselves in several Youtube videos and they are all Gen Z, and as a Gen Y (Millennial) observing this trend seemed justifiable.  However, Shrinkhala was building a house of cards and the fact that she had the audacity to publicize and put Sambhav Sirohiya in the limelight using Harvard freebies was just laughable a few years ago.  Like you pointed out, the fact that she still has 900K followers is troubling for sure but let's hope those are just her fake followers (some % are bought/in-organic followers, some her closest elite allies like \"Other Miss Nepals/ Businessmen/political affiliates etc. and some her enemies) as they say, **keep your friends close and enemies closer.**|||I heard that B.arch is the easiest subject to get at Pulchowk and that too for a girl as they have separate reservations for women. Yes she must be smart because to get that you need to work hard.  But the image she tries to portray being you know the perfect, hardworking,real and independent girl always sounded fishy to me.  Miss World organization saw through her, so didn't let her go to the final round. There is no substance in her words and it  sounds exactly like a politician speech. Idealistic statements with no action. Look at the legacy of previous Miss Nepal winners. Most of them marry rich businessman and secure a rich, lavish life.

Talking about her Nepal bachelor’s days, my friends studied with her in KU in nepal in b. arch, and so many said she cheated on exams (A LOT) just to pass. later she worked for the nepal government and came to US for conferences and presentations 🤡. now she has started her master’s at UT austin, funded by corrupted money. she removed her instagram posts about her prior foreign visits and her recent UT Austin orientation day, and even deactivated her linkedin account.

One for the 165 candidates who are elected directly (first-past-the-post), other for the party. The votes that party gets determine the remaining 110 members via proportional representation.  so aba either we need new political parties to replace the existing ones by Falgun 21, or we have to vote for the same parties again. This is more complicated because Nepal is not just Kathmandu. The political players which we have termed jholey will be active outside Kathmandu.   So if we need the change in constitution, we have to be more careful. The mandates of the movement are more at risk now than before.",

That doesn’t mean he is wrong always but sometimes yes! It is not just Indian media it is international media but most of them are correcting themselves now which is good.

Nepal can be a smaller country, but they are much more older nation state than us with full of brilliant souls and whatever Nepalis choose for their country, we respect that from core.

Even we don't entertain them. Each passing day their credibility is decreasing in India. 3. Dhruv rathi is also shit. Even his credibility is decreasing each passing day. One hypocrisy at a time. 4.

But that doesn't mean I have direct ties with them. JHOLEY and BHEDA is a noun that defines people who blindly believe in a person or a political party.      Talking about myself, I am already 36, a father and I am thinking of raising my family here in Nepal. I was totally against going abroad as a student when there was trend to do so. But the political system was never stable here. However, This current GenZ revolution happened against corruption. We indeed got a good progress against these corrupt leaders. But things turned out to be different and here is my roller coaster of emotions. Please let me know if you can relate to this.  Day 0: Social Media Ban - Mixed feelings. Hopeful that social medias will proceed further with registration.  Day 1: GenZ revolution and killing - Lots of anger. Disappointment and discontent.  Day 2: Revolution, excited and happy till 4 PM, until we destroyed the party system. Once the public started destroying Singha Durbar, I came to realize what I had done. I started a fire that I can't extinguish.  Day 3: Realization of the revolution being hijacked. We were just against corruption, regime change was not our motto. The revolution gradually turned into a COLOR REVOLUTION.  Day 4: Worried about who will lead the country. Started mentally supporting Balen/Rabi or any young leader. Furious, since the army asked GenZ to come up with a leader. Finally Hami Nepal, some guys funded by Deep state along with Sanduk Ruit and Swarnim Wagle came into light. They started talking about regime change and Constitution change. They said they directly want to select Zelensky as their prime minister.   Day 5: Much more disappointed as some kids who are aiming to go abroad for future study is electing prime minister through Discord. Sushila Karki elected as PM. Which is some sort of relief. I feared a autocrat.  Day 6 - Day 7: China is yet to acknowledge PM Sushila Karki. China is suspecting foul play as KP Oli had been to SCO and all of this happened just after that.      Now I am very much in distress. I feel that, Nepal is Ukraine. Balen is the new Zelensky and China is the new Russia. I dont want to think negatively but the situation ahead seems to be very dark and we will have to take steps cautiously. There are a lot of hatred here and Social medias are fueling it. None of the GenZ were born during the writing of the constitution. There were lots of revolution that was endured by current revolution Maoist Revolution, Madesh Revolution etc. But now it seems everything has gone to waste and there is no constitution here in the country. Is this PTSD?|||Its not true narrative this is all funded by cia|||Ye Media bik chuka hai|||[removed]|||Nepal, you are dealing with dangerous, insecure, violent crybullies who don't care about reasons and motives because they'll just come up with fake news and use that is their motive.

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not “revolution,” it’s not “justice,” and it sure as hell isn’t “the voice of the people.” It’s mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn’t make you brave—it makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that—surrounded by a wave of so-called “youths” who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let’s not sugarcoat it—the so-called Gen Z “warriors” hiding in the mob weren’t heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country’s social fabric. He still can’t step foot in certain countries because he’s internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he’s propped up as a “leader.”  Let’s be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn’t an accident—it was a setup. While Deuba’s family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don’t get it twisted—those sharpshooters in the crowd weren’t just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres—former insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let’s stop pretending this was “the people rising up.” It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist—the one who drowned this nation in blood—walks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don’t for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn’t that Deuba suffered humiliation—the real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn’t a flower; he’s a weed choking the soil of Nepal’s democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too naïve to realize they’re being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||CIA & India Agents involved in chaos!

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4. Retirement age and term limits: This is a must, we need a clear retirement age for the public positions just like other jobs.     These sort of things are fundamental of any country, without getting the fundamentals right we cannot expect our country to do better. We have a chance to make things better, lets take this chance.|||also i think! what lessons can be learned from Bangladesh last year?|||Garni nai ho vani presidency system lyauni.

Constitutional legitimacy + protester acceptance = only viable option.  # 2. PROTESTER LEADERSHIP PIVOT  Gen Z groups must **immediately shift messaging**:  * \"Our revolution is being hijacked\" * \"Military rule = permanent corruption\" * **Name specific civilian demands**: New constitution, elections in 1 year  # 3. ARMY FACE-SAVING EXIT  New interim government must **publicly thank Army Chief Sigdel** for \"preserving democracy\" and **offer ceremonial role** in transition (advisory only, no executive power).  # 4. EMERGENCY UNITY GOVERNMENT  * Sumana Shrestha as PM * Balen Shah as Deputy PM * **3 Gen Z representatives** in cabinet * **Clear 12-month timeline** to new elections  # 5. INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION BLITZ  India, China, UN must **immediately recognize** any civilian arrangement. Every hour of delay gives military justification for intervention.  **THE WINDOW IS 6-8 HOURS MAX**. After that, the army's 10 PM ultimatum becomes permanent control.  **Key insight**: Don't fight the chaos - channel it into civilian transition before military \"restores order\" permanently.  **Act NOW or lose democracy for decades.**|||Is birgunj safe to visit today?

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

Congratulations to all and Thank you to Nepal Army|||He should be in social book|||I believe work is not done yet. Giddhe najar laaune haru dherai chan ajhai. Election is next big challenge. People should remain vigilant, because power vacuums can attract opportunists and old interests looking for a way back. Sushila Karki’s reputation for integrity is promising, but all eyes must stay on the process ahead—the appointments, the investigations she has promised, and the preparations for free and fair elections.  If we relax now, those who thrive on chaos and corruption will try to regain ground. Vigilance, regular citizen oversight, and strong pressure for transparency are needed at every step. The sacrifices made in this movement must be honored by making sure accountability and reform actually reach every corner of the new system.    This is our chance to set a new standard in Nepali politics—let’s not waste it for a second.|||Huge Respect with how they handled the situation while maintaining peace.

But are we seriously going to ignore the fact that the upper echelons of the army are also as corrupt as Oli, Deuba and Prachanda? They embezzle a lot of funds that are allocated for the army!

I know that indian media is misreporting the revolution as silly protests to reinstate scrapy social media and belittle the ambition of GenZ. Media wants the status quo in India forever. They belittled the Bangladesh protests similarly and painted it as Muslims vs Hindus in Bangladesh. They paint a high opinion of the fugitive Shaik Hasina but curse Nobel laureate Mohammed Yunus. Indian media is the judge, jury and executioner of all the happenings in Nepal, Bangladesh, Srilanka and Pakistan. According to them, India is Ramarajya but others were Raavan rajya. India has become a dead democracy in the past decade. We have no jobs, extremely costly education and no health. We are just scrapping by but nothing to show as the media paints cooked up Indian GDP. Baba's have become politicians, industrialists and millionaires. Politicians just encourage the industry of religion. Their children reap the benefits and others' children subsist on rationed rice.

A shift to a fully directly elected system for every seat would ensure greater accountability and public representation. 2. **Establish a Directly Elected Executive Head:** Instead of the parliament choosing the Prime Minister, the call is for a directly elected President or Prime Minister with full executive powers.

It’s tragic, because they also have families back home and face the same struggles as the rest of us. They should be victims of this system too, yet they show little compassion or critical thought about what’s happening around them. Why are there protests in the first place? I refuse to believe they're blind to people's frustration and the direction the country is heading.  I still remember when we joined a protest 14–15 years ago. The police confronted us aggressively, and as kids we were too confused to react. Fortunately, we just stood there processing and visibly confused, and they left — but I still shudder to think, *what if our reaction had been different?* Today’s young protestors are in the same position, pure in their intentions, simply voicing frustration without wanting harm.  And honestly, credit must go to these protestors. They know exactly what they are standing for, unlike us back then who needed adults to organise us. I don’t see how demonstrations could be any more peaceful than they already are — especially when the very leaders being protested against have blood on their hands from before this generation was even born.|||Yo bhatey haru kahi gayera sitcha holani|||randi baan machikne haru|||I mean this tracks, they only like when you're corrupt|||Its not andolan anymore its war|||We want death or at lease exile of KP Oli and other taukes.|||Randi haruko photo, name, address patta lagau.|||shamelss dogs of government|||Machikne radi harlai lakhetdai marnaparne|||Thuiyaa police vanauda haruuu|||you radiko ban harulai agolauno man xa|||ma sanga pani ganhune bhaye, kassam mardinthe radieekko ban|||Mathi bata aako order re ????

Most people don't know the perspectives of one event and they believe only what is potrayed.

Honestly speaking they are playing with young people’s emotions and future… they are burning our country and feeling the warmth… and we are happy at the time being because youth are so blinded by this madness they don’t see right from wrong!! Just look at the way they incite violence like it’s nothing!! Talking about burning down houses and people is nothing!! This is not a right foundation. We must make all these Gen-Z representatives accountable. Especially, Sudhan Gurung. He needs to stop acting like some filmy hero and step back for people with capabilities to step in and do their job. He is distracting the revolution in many way by his hot headed attitude. And stop with this Balen nonsense. He is just a populist who is just an experienced cringe wannabe… atleast for now he has not shown his worth to Nepali people.

Also what happens if he wins election he managed? Would everyone trust he won fair election?   I think what did is best for him and country. If people choose him, he will be pm if not he wont. It’s simple.|||Disclaimer: I am not a Balen supporter or cultist.  This post is conflicting for me. But, the post is characterizing the man based on:  1. What the man didn’t do or didn’t say. 2. What people expected him to do.  The man himself has said enough in his posts.   It’s what, he DIDN’T do that impresses me the most about him. Saying “No” is harder than saying “Yes”, when everyone wanted him to say “Yes”.  (Think about this.)  He put out only a couple of posts, which I think served as guide posts during the revolution.   1. He was the first widely known public figure (that I know) who defined who Gen Z was and gave his support to the protest. 2. When the tempo rose, he clarified that Gen Z should lead, he accepted Sushila even when all of his cultists were going crazy about making him the interim PM.  Removing himself from the picture, brought focus back on the revolution and the task ahead, rather than turn the confusion situation, even more confusing with a popularity contest as a side gig.   There is a lot of things to think about and I think in time we can all make sense of it all.   That’s my two paisa about him.|||Leading KTM municipality vs leading the nation are totally different. The followers of Balen urging and rushing him to lead 'right now' and come out by 2PM are the same people who will criticize him within one year if he were to be them PM someday. They don't have patience and want to see changes immediately.  Personally, I would like to see him running in the upcoming election as deputy/vice roles first and not immediate PM role...assuming how parties will be formed and if there are any good lead independent candidate who will run with him. He's one of those few worthy to be PM but this is not his peak yet. He just became a mayor like 3 years ago and he still has a lot to show to the general public. If and when he wins to the election, it will be his peak and he has high chances of being a two term PM...assuming two term limit will be in place hopefully. Time will tell.|||GenZ aren't immune to celeb worship culture.|||Hami Nepal has already stated it was part of a plan and they want balen for 5 years.

Yes it is definitely an opportunistic behaviour by balen. But how is this behaviour wrong and how is taking over PM position now and securing interim govt now and not taking part in politics for next 5 years do any good to the country.    He is practicing patience to achieve the goal he desires and what people actually wants from a young leader like him. Look throughout the history of world politics, paitence has always been the key factor to shape the world politics.|||Having trusted by many even me,In the moment of national threat, he could do nothing. That’s the reason I doubt him.  i think he is not completely responsible for being the Prime Minister. Sure, he is a great person. He’s doing such a great thing in the valley, but being a Prime Minister is very responsible post, his way up talking to seniors, saying I will put fire to SinghaDurbar, I will bury everyone if you’re in tudinkhel, getting carried away by emotions, being Prime Minister means you should not be carried away by any emotions and none of the factors should affect your judgment which you believe to be true and is lawful, Hopefully he will make such changes and we can finally see him in the top, as much as I want him to be the Prime Minister I do think he is inexperienced and immature in this field,|||We are so far behind that criticizing political leader sounds like a hater. We are not even to the point where we could say “This person is bad/clueless , country isn’t safe with them”. For the past decade, the corrupted 3 have been playing nothing but tato aloo with us so its natural to be sticking nail to current situation. Give it some time and our voices will get echoed.|||If there’s one thing old political leaders never learned, it was how to handle criticism. The moment anyone spoke up, they tried to shut it down and let’s not even start on the behavior of their hardcore supporters(jholey as we call them).  Even leaders like Balen need to address this with their own supporters, as do all the new representatives entering the upcoming elections. They must say publicly that they welcome criticism, will reflect on it, and use it as a tool for improvement. Leaders should make it clear to their base: don’t bully or silence people for simply asking questions or raising concerns. Do not perform character assassination against someone just for criticizing. After all, in a democracy, freedom of speech is our right.  At the same time, we the general public also carry responsibility. We need to recognize the difference between constructive criticism and defamation. What we must not do is fall for propaganda, spread rumors, or engage in baseless character assassination.  And if we realize that our criticism or questioning was wrong, we should have the courage to apologize in the same way we raised the question. After all, apologizing will never make you small. It’s just a simple five letter word: “Sorry.” A word that can and should be spoken from both sides.|||Just because you’re against the system, doesn’t make you Balen-Supporters. Balen has no experience. Balen should wait and gain some experience. Criticism is a backbone of democracy and one must welcome it.|||EXACTLY. They lack this ability to critically analyse any action of any leader. Like no one is perfect and no one is a good. Let's be honest. Let's criticize people for their actions. People should be held accountable for their actions. Most importantly, leaders who run our nation. If we don't point out their wrongdoings, will they ever stop? Nepalese have such a bheda mindset, istg. Let's be more aware and let's know how to discern leaders and their actions.   By criticizing these leaders, we aren't hating on them. We're trying to bring awareness so that they won't repeat the same thing again and can do things better for the country.|||They need to be aware party KO jhole become jhole because they were andabhakt of party leader ( just like they are blind follower of balen rn)|||I think holding politicians accountable is crucial. I hope people realize we don’t need  more devotees and followers. We need critical, educated thinkers. Support the good work, appreciate your favorite leader but don’t forget to question often. People change. Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Need to always stay cautious. |||Agreed|||Thanks man, you speaked my words. I see people thanking Balen for this movement and saying he was the reason this movement happened and succeeded and all after Sushila Karki became interim PM, and this made me very sad for actual people who started the movement and also faced the consequences and this was even more big realization for me for how blind youth and supporters these days are and this concerns me even more for future|||This. This is what I’ve been saying for some time. Like the post says, I’ve also been labeled as a party ko jhole and what not. Even here in this sub, people have called me jhole lol just because I questioned him.  I am a Balen supporter. I supported him and did my part by sharing about his campaign on social media and making everyone aware about it. And I was super happy when he won, I still am. But I’ve been criticizing him on various points that I find valid. The top one is communication.  During the election, he constantly criticized Bidya Sundar (the previous mayor) for not communicating publicly. He even said that once he became mayor, he wouldn’t be like that and would stay in constant touch. He proposed starting a ‘Mayor with the Public’ TV program and even set aside a budget for it, but nothing has happened. He hasn’t given a single interview.  And then come his jhole supporters who always argue with the same line: ‘Pailai kei chaieko ho.’ With that logic, we should never question anyone. Just look at how Balen has become now, he just posts one-sided, no-context Facebook statuses and nothing else.|||Balen is a hypocrite in my opinion, like he encouraged the protest and even promised to provide a safe and secure environment for the protest but when things turned south he vanished like horn from a donkeys head|||Finally someone spoke about this, belun has literally become a god complex among some people out there, which is kinda concerning, the only time he speaks is to not let his adhabhatka interfere in every other stuff out there.

I personally don't think he has the temperament (though if there's a choice between any big parties' leader and Balen, I'd choose Balen every time).|||Aru kura thik ho, but can’t say he abandoned. It’s not 100% sure he will be the next PM so can’t call him opportunist.|||Yes ,|||Very well said|||While I am unsure on balen and his move, yes! To select a leader, you do have to question. Even the one you support. That is transparency. That is the trust that has foundation|||You’re right. In Nepal, many people tend to follow leaders without much critical thought, even when those leaders don’t necessarily act in their favor. Unfortunately, this habit seems to persist across generations. If the younger generation continues with the same mindset, there’s a real risk that the country could end up facing the same challenges in the future that we are experiencing today.|||You can make your own assumptions and narratives. If Balen had taken the post of PM, you would have said that he is opportunistic, that he enraged protestors just to get the position. I saw somewhere on Facebook, even before Balen’s official post on sushila karki that balen played dirty game for the sake of pm position. As far as I know, Balen is a farsighted person. He only comes forward when he feels fully prepared.|||That's my whole point, but again..vanepachi manche lai jholey nai lagcha. 😅 Guy's, learn to ask questions yourself too.

But ever since I saw him become mayor, I have always seen him wearing Nepali dress most of the time and consistently working to conserve our heritage and culture.  You know what? He is still better than most of the people there. Whatever he does, he has never done anything wrong. Stop pretending to be so-called critics for useless reasons. What is your academic background, and what makes you think that way? Have you ever felt the difference between past and present Kathmandu? I have a friend from the core area of Kathmandu, do you know what his opinion about Balen Shah is? No!  Even Harka Sampang is a very good person. Moreover, Sagar Dhakal’s brother has been working actively to eradicate the dictatorship of these political parties. Maybe your parents are bootlicking those rotten political parties, so you only see what Balen has never done and will never do. Just because he supported the movement does not mean he said he wants to become prime minister. You must understand that he posts only a few things because his words are weapons. One word from him has many consequences in such a movement. He is very clever and very wise; unlike Harka Sampang, though I like Harka as a person. But you need to give Balen full power to unlock his full potential. He wants change, he wants revolution, and he wants to remove corrupt politicians.

If Balen had come out saying he’s ready to lead, a lot of people would’ve jumped in claiming he planned the whole movement and just used Gen Z for his own benefit. That’s probably why in his statements, he keeps stressing that this is Gen Z’s movement and that the government will be formed by them. imo, staying out of it was the smartest move he could have made.  I’m all for questioning and criticizing leaders. I agree that its a problem if you dont want to do it. But when someone has shown that they are dedicated, not corrupt, and actually get things done, you’ve got to give them some benefit of the doubt. Save the tough questions for real concerns. Dont critise just because you think no one can ever be good enough.|||Yes Balen has fallen badly as he didnt seem to care about the youths when they needed him the most. But, when we are talking about selection of interim PM, he did the right thing by not coming out. If he had come out, more number of the youngsters would have gone to Army Headquarters causing a ruckus. Thankfully, that didnt happen. It could have been worse than Harka dai case.

They couldnt select a group of representatives to talk to the army for over 12 hours.  There was also no verification process on who was talking.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):** The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):** If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):** If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):** If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

He pushed Nepal towards democracy and republicanism.   He gave poor villagers and lower-caste groups a voice in national politics.   He increased women’s participation in politics and society, with many ex-fighters now active in leadership roles.   In western hills and Madhesh, state institutions were weak or absent. Villagers depended on landlords for loans, justice, and protection, which kept exploitation unchallenged (Kamaiya, Haruwa-Charuwa, Haliya systems). His movement gave villagers confidence to defy landlords for the first time.

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not “revolution,” it’s not “justice,” and it sure as hell isn’t “the voice of the people.” It’s mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn’t make you brave—it makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that—surrounded by a wave of so-called “youths” who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let’s not sugarcoat it—the so-called Gen Z “warriors” hiding in the mob weren’t heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country’s social fabric. He still can’t step foot in certain countries because he’s internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he’s propped up as a “leader.”  Let’s be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn’t an accident—it was a setup. While Deuba’s family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don’t get it twisted—those sharpshooters in the crowd weren’t just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres—former insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let’s stop pretending this was “the people rising up.” It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist—the one who drowned this nation in blood—walks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don’t for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn’t that Deuba suffered humiliation—the real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn’t a flower; he’s a weed choking the soil of Nepal’s democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too naïve to realize they’re being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||Prachanda and Baburam are India's puppet.

This has been ongoing for more than two decades. Behind the few visible figures, there are countless others who have either assisted them or benefitted through their association—ranging from major brands in Nepal to traders. For example, Sher Bahadur Deuba’s son and his sanitary pad importing company stand as an illustration.  They have institutionalized corruption by appointing foreign ambassadors based on party loyalty and financial gains, extending even to the transfer of bureaucrats to preferred locations in exchange for bribes and other undue benefits. The problem is not limited to the political system alone; bureaucrats, too, require checks and balances. A mechanism must be established to regulate the power of bureaucrats over politicians. Since bureaucrats are permanent stakeholders, their influence is even greater. One effective way to mitigate this is to appoint domain experts as ministers—for instance, a professional civil engineer as a minister cannot be misled about the cost estimates of a construction project.  There remains much to be done. Moreover, these political parties will attempt to form alliances before elections, bringing forward the same candidates and restoring the same exploitative system. Therefore, the first and most meaningful reform must be a change in the electoral process, with the inclusion of a “NOTA” (None of the Above) option.  Further accountability can be ensured by eliminating political appointments to certain positions. At present, even temporary (karar) appointments are made based on party affiliation rather than merit. As a result, even highly qualified experts are compelled to seek political approval. The recent appointments of Vice-Chancellors at B.P. Koirala Institute in Dharan and Gangalal Hospital are prime examples.  In addition to these issues, several other structural flaws persist. What we urgently require is a comprehensive systemic reform|||Gen Z laid them in the grave, and now they're shoveling the dirt themselves.|||# How to make Gen Z movement bullet proof ?

People watched her speech where she said stuff like, “What’s my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?”  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still don’t have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we don’t have the right connections.  We don’t get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, it’s still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? That’s probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  We’re out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor people’s kids not boil?  On top of that, there’s already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent. Because this have  been suppressed for so long, and now the mindset is like — “If we can’t reach anywhere through the system, then we might as well destroy it.”  And even if some third party tries to trigger people, the truth is, it was already there deep down in their subconscious. This is just it coming out. Right now it feels new, but honestly, it was bound to happen sooner or later.|||No Shit Sherlock (You guys got  manipulated into doing the wrong thing) 😔|||Sherey ko choro lai dhulai diye ki nai ?|||Each Hilton hotel employees 400+ Nepalese nationals 😂 what about the people that lost their jobs?|||https://preview.redd.it/muoumzxh6eof1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63da78ae8b2a74c1f669dc95f01e062ff9e299b0|||https://preview.redd.it/rjynwvrk6eof1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04a5f8cbe1243c2dfca73c29dea57aa5425243bf|||We could’ve turned this into Hospital but Nope|||This is an absolutely great work revolution.|||Aur Karo money money wali gand masti|||if you make a good system and government now that‘s important!

We need people elected leader not mob selected leader and think of it when any of these guys go to foreign countries for visit will anyone take them seriously they won't because mob selected leaders are ignored just like Md.Yunus is ignored by major world leaders(except China).  Considering we're in a democratic system with democratic framework, I suggest Chief Justice of Supreme Court of Nepal should be given the interim power because Legislature-Executive-Judiciary are the head of country, since President is said to be planning to resign and PM has resigned best would be to get Judicial head. You might say he's corrupt but hear me out, his only job should be to conduct fair elections and fulfill the demands of us(youth) as he's the only guy who knows about constitution more than any of us. I see only him as the one with intellect right now  According to me, Sushila Karki being former Chief Justice should held interim gov, and add the presidential style election, and the elections should be within 15days-1month. for which we gen-z's should help if we can destroy we should show we can also be a help|||Tiyo post ma garw chi chi chi chi Thu Thu Thu Thu chi chi chi chi Thu Thu Thu Thu gardi bascha 😂😂|||https://preview.redd.it/dlrjv8jm1gof1.jpeg?width=442&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97c0337eb5a438e5909e840f83db267f87a0b99a  found this making rounds in fb|||Mai hu malie sab aoucha vanne wana ego wala manchey ho  Ani yo kirati haru afno jaat vayera dherai furkirako ho  Muji haru lai tha chai kei chqina pachi k huncha vanera Dhunga bokera matra desh bandaina gu haru dimak ka cha ta haru ko|||Her keta ho.

Dr Baburam is also a good candidate. But he can lean towards Prachanda.|||Yeah, bro!  Now, the nation is seeing the true colors of the Harka.  There have been big changes since 2047, up to 2062-2063.  Public property and individuals were not targeted.  But this time, to suppress the voices, he used his goons to burn down the homes of the people who rose up against him.  He left the DRN to be PM, taking his so-called \"jhole.\"|||I'm from Dharan.   I know Harka from close, I voted for him. He isn't even capable of being the mayor. The position of Prime Minister is far beyond his dreams.He should have been elected as a ward member first, and then he should have practiced for a higher-level position.However, due to the frustration of the people, voters chose him. It wasn't because of his popularity, but because of that frustration.Look at his recent activity, he cannot coordinate with the 20 members and bring the budget in on time   And so called the Sharaman, it's the illusion, of the corruption|||Not being a racist, but most people who are blindly supporting him are from Mongolian ethnicity ( mostly Rai and Kirati) .|||Even Kulman is a corrupt person.

He is asking people that he can bring the change so what the bid deal in that. So people need a leader who is just become a puppet of other, no transparency. The nation need a leader who can proudly say yes this is my country I will die or live for it. He is the one. My suggestion is do not judge based  on sentiments.|||His position is great till the mayor, no need to drag him any further.|||This needs to spread forward, he is a narcissist, somebody who has no sense of how to speak , god complex.  publicity stunt doesnot makes person a great leader.|||We’re falling into the same trap again. Don’t buy into the smooth talk and fake charm — check their track record instead. Balen and Harka might be moody, but at least they’ve been tested in real battles. I’m done with sugar-coated leaders; give me someone who spits facts and takes action. Doing the right thing in a rotten system is never easy, and that’s why tried-and-tested leaders matter. Supporting Rajesh Hamal? That’s just a fantasy.|||Harka Sampang? you guys cant handle now i am sure|||तिमीहरुको कुरा सुन्दा अचम्म लाग्यो ।प्रकृया के हो , कसरी चल्छ केहि थाहा रहेनछ । देश जोक हो? चुनाव गराउनलाई सम्रचना छैन , चुनाव सजिलो कुरा सोच्या छौं ?? भोली चुनावको बैधताको को कुरा आउँछ , देश बिदेश बाट inspection हुन्छ । हल्का रुपमा नलेउ है । जति चाडो डिसिजन गर्यौ बुझेर त्यति फाइदा हो अलिक पछि त यो पाराले पानी पनि भन्न पाउँदैनौं , बर्षौदेखि राज गरेका पार्टि र तिनका कार्यकर्ता निक्लन्छन नै, उनिहरुसँग नेक तिकडम हुन्छन जुन तिमिहरुले बुझ्न पनि सक्दैनौ । if you need right suggestion and whole process i can help to brief.|||Constituion should be ammended so politicians are no longer called leaders and they cannot enjoy a career.|||He would make a good dictator and actually do good for the country. But unfortunately for him, the public is educated. 100 years ago and this guy would have started the Sampang regime 😂|||Anyone who actively seeks power does so because they want to be seen and heard. That drive inevitably brings with it shades of narcissism and opportunism. So rather than fixating on intentions, it makes more sense to judge politicians by their results. On that front, Harka has proven he can deliver. His rough almost mobster-like style may be off-putting to some but in a city like Dharan which is home to hotheaded Kirati / Hill Janajati majority that kind of toughness isn’t just useful, it’s necessary.  That said, he is neither qualified nor capable enough to be considered an ‘ideal’ Prime Minister. Nonetheless, when compared to Rabi Lamichhane Harka represents a comparatively more credible alternative. Personally not a fan of either.|||Tei ta Mayor ko pani layak xaina veda janta lai pm chaiyo re|||Dherai yo jaat ko haru furkirako cha muji haru K hi pachi k huncha kei tha chaina gu bhareko muji haru ko|||Guys Primeminister is not joke role. It is representative of country. He must have some internal support and dealing capacity.|||The common thing between Harka and Balen is that both are independent and hardworking, and that is what people recognize and that is what the revolution wants. If a person has done good work, both of them will be appreciated hands down. You have to look at the picture from both sides. Secondly, please ask your senior citizens or elders from a different generation. They have seen history and faced the consequences. The real issue is bringing change in the constitution, i.e., a representative should not be above a certain age and should be allowed to seek votes only for one term. Take that in writing from the concerned representative, live, and show it to the world clearly. Also, please do not discriminate by saying someone is from the “Stone Age,” as such remarks can hurt the sentiments of people who are not from cities.|||Yes, I don't know what to. It feels like waste of my taxes. Now even democracy is undermined. I think this will repeat again in 10 to 15 year|||He is not educated, he does not have the capabilities of being head of government.

Even he ignored and disagree with the Loan to be used from ADB ( Asian Development Bank ) . 6) He speaks and protest on his own way BUT still he has some flaws unlike us even the moon has flaws then he is still human . ra usko flaws we can ignore .

U all r pretty blinded by jealousy and his popularity. Only in a lifetime we get such leader.

(**Bank run** is a situation where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a bank simultaneously, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or financial stability. This can lead to liquidity problems for the bank, as it may not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands. Bank runs can create a cycle of panic, potentially leading to the bank's failure.)  The real pain starts after the protests have calmed. Economic crash is certain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh both went through it. Stock market/real estate crash, inflation and what not.  Whoever takes charge next, likely Balen, will need to address the pointless 'Greater Nepal' rhetoric and become a moderate on this issue. Thanks to Trump, India-China relationship is stable for the first time in ages. The only way Nepal has a future is pledge allegiance to both neighbour's.  Bangladesh under Yunus has been a pain in the ass for India. Nepal cannot make the same mistake. Any wrong steps and a free floating Nepali rupee against the dollar would go from 140 now to 25,000 like similar countries in our GDP range. Probably worse since our economy is in much worse shape.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.   Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.   Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||How credible is this info?|||Use bitchat for conversation.

            "comments": "We are living in a moment where anger is boiling over. People are tired of corruption, censorship, and being silenced. Many of us are ready to take to the streets on Sept 8. But before we move forward, we must stop and think carefully.  History has shown us what happens when we rush in without preparation. In Bangladesh last year, in Sri Lanka not long ago, ordinary people gave their lives while corrupt leaders fled the country with protection and comfort. Their deaths were forgotten within weeks, while the guilty walked free. If we are not careful, Nepal risks becoming the next chapter in that same tragic story.  That is why this movement must be different. We cannot afford to be reckless. We must protect our people, keep our voices peaceful, and make sure the world is watching every step so that accountability cannot be erased.  Here is what we need to do before Sept 8:  * Get international human rights groups, UN observers, and peace monitors involved beforehand so there are eyes on the ground. * Publish clear and peaceful agendas so nobody can label us as rioters or mobs. * Document everything with photos, videos, and testimonies. Every arrest and every injury must be recorded and shared. * Avoid following local leaders who are affiliated with political parties. Big parties will try to infiltrate, hijack, and twist this movement for their own gain. * Know who is truly standing beside you. Trust matters because infiltrators can turn peaceful protests into chaos.  This movement is about dignity, rights, and accountability. It is not about violence. It is not about revenge. If we lose focus, if we let anger replace strategy, then we risk repeating the same cycle where the powerful walk free and ordinary people pay with their lives.  Nepal deserves better. The world must see us not as mobs, but as citizens united for freedom and justice. If we do this right, our voices will be impossible to silence. If we do this wrong, we risk being forgotten like so many before us.  Stay safe. Stay peaceful. Stay smart.",

Emails: grad@uci.edu reportfraudtips@uscis.dhs.gov Subject: Urgent Concern Regarding Sweta Rijal’s Status Dear Graduate Office/USCIS/ICE, I am writing about Sweta Rijal, a political science student at your university. She is the daughter of Chabi Rijal, a communist leader and Chief District Officer in Nepal, who recently ordered a shoot-on-sight against youth peacefully protesting corruption in Nepal. His orders have killed over 18 innocent people, injured more than 100 students, and more deaths are expected. This is pure fascism and a gross misuse of power. Young people in a peaceful protest were shot dead, which is totally unacceptable. While our brothers and sisters die in Nepal, Sweta Rijal has no right to study in the US with money from corruption. Her entire funding is from the money from corruption. The US, as a democratic country and a voice for the UN, stands for freedom and justice. Allowing her to stay contradicts everything the US represents. We are struggling to fight this battle in Nepal, and she must be held accountable. I urge you to investigate her visa and take necessary action to send her back to Nepal. Regards, Concerned Citizen from Nepal",

Even the people who are getting inspired and speaking in favour of your protest are getting back lash (and recently a person has been charged under the law by the police)because this protest turned violent but ik that wasn't intended. We can argue about the pros and cons but the fact that you stood up against the system is a big achievement and inspiration. I wish you great luck guys and hope you find a better system than the one you fought against and draw a milestone for us.

This isn't time for fighting.   And about destroying properties, there are theories that the protest were hijacked by other political parties. Like wise, about governments offices, they wanted to destroy the proofs of corruptions. And public building and properties was collateral damages for those fake protesters to look it real.

I am just a sincere, hardworking youth who remained silent because too many opinions create a ruckus. That's what I believed till September 8. When I went to the protest, it was all fine until they started firing. When you're in the battleground, all moralities go out the window. Yet, I did not throw a single stone at anyone and I am proud of that. I remained with the group who were peacefully protesting infront of the army van, I helped people with water to wash their face, tried picking up litters. The main point is I tried being a responsible person. But the moment I saw people being carried to the hospital with their blood spattering the streets, I fucking lost it. In retaliation, my protests became more louder. I came home late at night, tried my best to repost as many information I could. At one point, I felt like people should burn down the entire ministry down, all these nepo-babies should be brought to the streets to teach their parents how it feels to kill someone's child. I was furious, the word being an understatement. But seeing this people getting mob justice was what I never wanted. They don't deserve the least of anyone's sympathies, but we still have humanity in our hearts. That's what differs us from them.  I'm trying my best to control the narrative of why the protests happened, so that the opportunistic Indians, Chinese and the entire West may not take undue advantage of us.

            "subreddit": "NepalSocial",
            "heading": "The Shrinkhala Khatiwada I knew at Harvard",
            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada’s classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.   We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking–much to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in  Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate - the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala’s approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.   Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn’t mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‘help’. One time, she even said airily, “I wash my own dishes, you know.” She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala–a beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth–lingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don’t intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‘nepo babies’ who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).   Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It’s a troubling idea to think that despite what’s happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

I never liked her naak ma singan adke jasto boli.. And always felt she has a cunning personality that clings over you until she can no more use you for her advantage..  Sisan literally dodged a  bullet.. all thanks to her greed though..|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn’t some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was “beneficial” for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake “beauty with brains” narrative. Do you guys remember Niti’s big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let’s not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala’s prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it’s her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let’s be real- Sisan wasn’t perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they’d known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn’t even exist. This just proves it- they weren’t just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can’t just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala’s career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav’s narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What’s the lesson we can learn from here ?  Karma is real af & money can’t give you lifelong happiness, night Redditors|||Wish we had more tea like this on all nepo babies.|||She didn't get any fucking scholarship from the Nepali government. She was funded by her corrupt father.||| Damn I strictly feel its true|||I  never cared for her but hated her when she said ‘ we were not well off I had to share room with my house help ‘ and tried to relate to poor people like bro fuck off .|||Thanks for sharing. Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don’t even make sense to begin with. Don’t know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don’t even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It’s so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It’s astounding what the world has come to and it’s deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can’t be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn’t she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It’s better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has. It’s disheartening!|||[deleted]|||Correct my if I’m wrong guys, but shrinkhala father was health minister covid time, I heard tyo time ma vaccine ma ra health sector ma eka dum corruption bhaykeo thiyo.

Every move, every word, every connection seems like part of a bigger calculation. While most people get dragged through the mud on social media, she somehow stays a step ahead. Of all platforms, she was clever enough to pull the LinkedIn card first. That’s not by accident, it’s calculation. She knows the bashing on Tiktok or Instagram doesn’t matter as long as her professional side stays spotless, especially where she might work with people internationally who will never know the side of her life in Nepal that’s been exposed and torn apart ever since the truth came out.  It’s like she’s playing this endless game of Ludo, always climbing the ladder, polishing her image as she goes. But at the same time, you can’t help but feel she’s only ever a roll away from hitting 98 and sliding right back down the snake.|||We wont know if what you claim is true. But I wouldn't be surprised if its true either or even worse. I would assume that she was in her best behavior since she was not in Nepal and probably wanted to portray the best of her image.  My moment of disdain for her came about when her father one of the members of the parliament who were on monthly housing allowance along with the monthly pay. The beinfit is probably meant for the MPs who had to move temprorarily to the capital or who didn't have their own residence. Iirc, they had to manually opt in to get that added housing allowance. When the news published, her father's reaction was something along the line of \"I didn't know, I was getting it. I am happy to return it.\"  Question for her, how come you dont know the source of wealth and your parent's ethics?

It highlights how Shrinkhala, despite her public image and privileges, was not as collaborative or hardworking in academic settings as she appeared to be. It also touches on the contrast between her image and reality, as well as some concerns about nepotism and entitlement.|||there was a podcast recently, shrinkhala & 3 other women sittng down to talk with, his name may be anil shah.

I’m saying this as a Nepali because there are so many kids that have the potential to study there and even get into the school but can’t even afford it.

These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!! And the way she's silent when the country is bleeding says alottt too!!!!!!  And about the Nepal's government scholarship for harvard,this is not true, she is telling an entire different story about harvard scholarsip & how she paid fees there. She said she got 30% scholarship at harvard and the remaining 70% is paid through her brand endorsements money as she is brand ambassador to few company. We didnt buy that story, she tried hardest to sell it though and still fools people with this shitty madeup script about harvard's 30% scholarship & 70% funding through brand endorsement's money lmao. And lately she's being questioned on 50,000USD she got during miss world competition after winning \"beauty with the purpose\" title. Her ex exposed & questioned her in a very shady way and because of him we all knew this new layer of truth and i highly doubt it went on harvard's funding rather than for actual purpose|||One buy Harvard degree with that 50K and another one became a MAKUSE owner .

Continue on --|||Thanks for sharing your raw and real experience, thoughts and opinion. This is valuable for those of us who were shocked and skeptical about her success right from the day she got into limelight. I watched her view on Youtube yesterday and couldn't get past a minute of that video, she is clearly playing victim and trying to play the game.  Nope! she doesn't deserve any chance at all.  The students that I know personally who went to Harvard, MIT and many other prestigious institutions had grit, determination, belief in hard-work, may be little bit of luck but most of all they had \"humility\". They NEVER used their \"Harvard degree\" or Ivy league label to show off. It's those who want to fame and fake pride that put up social media posts to show off their diplomas. Honestly, it was very very clear even before she went to Harvard that she was on the wrong side of fame game.  For the longest time I thought it was a generational difference, since there are many other Harvard students who have publicized themselves in several Youtube videos and they are all Gen Z, and as a Gen Y (Millennial) observing this trend seemed justifiable.  However, Shrinkhala was building a house of cards and the fact that she had the audacity to publicize and put Sambhav Sirohiya in the limelight using Harvard freebies was just laughable a few years ago.  Like you pointed out, the fact that she still has 900K followers is troubling for sure but let's hope those are just her fake followers (some % are bought/in-organic followers, some her closest elite allies like \"Other Miss Nepals/ Businessmen/political affiliates etc. and some her enemies) as they say, **keep your friends close and enemies closer.**|||I heard that B.arch is the easiest subject to get at Pulchowk and that too for a girl as they have separate reservations for women. Yes she must be smart because to get that you need to work hard.  But the image she tries to portray being you know the perfect, hardworking,real and independent girl always sounded fishy to me.  Miss World organization saw through her, so didn't let her go to the final round. There is no substance in her words and it  sounds exactly like a politician speech. Idealistic statements with no action. Look at the legacy of previous Miss Nepal winners. Most of them marry rich businessman and secure a rich, lavish life.

Its not easy to get in there and even if you do its one of the expensive schools there. Talking about her Nepal bachelor’s days, my friends studied with her in KU in nepal in b. arch, and so many said she cheated on exams (A LOT) just to pass. later she worked for the nepal government and came to US for conferences and presentations 🤡. now she has started her master’s at UT austin, funded by corrupted money. she removed her instagram posts about her prior foreign visits and her recent UT Austin orientation day, and even deactivated her linkedin account.

Gen z never planned to burn or destroy public property and jails. I believe this happened due to the presence of other opportunistic groups.  Gen z’s true motive was to overthrow the government and that was achieved. they never intended to take up guns or engage in vandalism and that was not their goal. but many other people, parties or elements took advantage of the moment to cause destruction for their own selfish interests like Looting, hiding behind the anonymity of the crowd.  Because of this, even their own people are now suffering from security issues like the release of 1200 prisoners due to prison breaks.

You say their work has benefited generations “like me” but what about the millions still without quality education, clean water, jobs, or justice? If that legacy was truly built for the people, then why does inequality keep growing? Why is access to opportunity still limited to a select few families like yours?  No one is attacking your elders for their hard work but using that work to claim political or social superiority today is exactly the kind of dynastic thinking that holds progress back. Legacies don’t entitle children to power. Competence, accountability, and public trust do.  You’re not being attacked, you’re being questioned. And if your only answer is to call others “small-minded” and “ungrateful,” then maybe you’re not as prepared to face criticism as you think. Respect is earned in every generation, not inherited like land or a business.  The days of hiding behind the achievements of the past are over. If you want respect for your family, prove it through your own actions, not by silencing criticism or demanding loyalty based on history.|||French revolution Bata sikna paryo kei|||I fwwww it.

I mean gross national happiness instead of gross national product. I believe every single country on this planet should take Bhutan as a role model a little bit more. Where else in the world are citizens asked what their main problems are and what they want from the government? And later, citizens are asked how satisfied they were with the government's performance. I know it's a bit naive of me to make such a suggestion from afar, as a sheltered European who is not really familiar with the form of government in Nepal. But it seems to be similar in many, many countries. Those in power often hold office and positions of honor for decades through their family ties. And they are similar in their decadence. The most expensive clothes, the biggest cars, houses, and palaces. Flying to New York for dinner in a private jet, or to Monaco for F1, or around the globe in a yacht as long as a soccer field. And in the media, they try to appear close to the people, to be there for them, to advance the country by investing in infrastructure or new hospitals, etc. But no, a large part of your taxes ends up with the rulers themselves. The rich and powerful acquire more wealth and more power. Money rules the world!

Experience isn’t a flaw, it’s literally the one thing that tells you someone can handle the chaos.

We keep repeating the same mistakes because people get blinded by shiny new faces and ignore anyone who actually knows what they’re doing. Experience doesn’t mean someone is corrupt it means they’ve been in the trenches and survived. Throwing it away just to see if a “fresh face” can magically save everything is how you crash a country.  Nepal isn’t a playground. Leadership isn’t about hype, popularity, or being young and “green.” It’s about surviving the chaos, making tough decisions, and knowing where the landmines are.

Most of the youths want to change countries I understand but they really don't know how. I fully support her for the interim one until further steps are taken.|||Absolutely agree. Sushila Karki is the perfect candidate for interim leadership. As Nepal’s first female Chief Justice, she has already proven her ability to lead with integrity and impartiality under immense political pressure. Her reputation for upholding the rule of law and fairness makes her uniquely qualified at a time when credibility is everything. Most importantly, she understands the mechanics and urgency of holding a fair election which is the single most crucial step to stabilizing the country right now. If we want an interim leader who is both capable and trusted by the public, there’s no better choice.|||people saying balen shoud be PM but in my opinion he is not suited for PM, not saying he is bad guy but i doubt he is good at making good relation with other countries, especially one we depend on the most.   she might be a good choice but as people says we need youth to lead the country so i cant say the otherwise,    but as a temporary PM i believe in her, at this time we need someone who can stablize the current situation, development is not the first priority for now,|||I agree for her.

Jalaide|||Yes thus is TRUE LOOK AT MY MOST RECENT POST|||please do this email to UN and OHCHR   To: registry@ohchr.org        info@ihrcworld.org        petitions@ohchr.org   Subject: Urgent Appeal: Violation of Human Rights in Nepal – Police Shooting School Studentsj   Dear United Nations Human Rights Council, I am writing to raise an urgent appeal regarding the grave human rights violations currently occurring in Nepal. Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.   Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.   Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||Jaha Bhetyo tehi thok saley madarchod lai...|||Aaos na india ma ni nepali xan birsyo kya|||Bro timro yo pic use garey haii Tiktok ma vid halchu|||kun desh jala teta bebasta garnu parxa|||yo machikne lai samatna paryo jasari bhaye ni yellai bachne kunai adhikar xaina|||Bhagey ra canada nai ja la, canada ma nee xodnu hudaina.

Lets first make sure state security, tax, bureaucracy and banking system be under central government. Then every other remaining ministry which needs localization be under province government.    Let there be 1 president directly elected by everyone to handle state security and 7 governor to handle province security, and 1 premier and 7 Magistrate to handle state & province tax, banking and bureaucracy. This way we will have clean central government in which no one can capture state function and minimize corruption.    Since we don't have any functioning people in power, either let lower house to vote for temporary governor and magistrate. No minister, let bureaucracy handle them under strict scrutiny of Governor and Magistrate.    Then start a fresh election, 1 President, 7 Governors, 1 Premier, 7 Magistrates, Lower House or Province Parliament member, then from each Province send 10 representative in Upper House/Federal Parliament 3 voted by Lower House/Province Parliament, 5 directly elected in Upper House and 2 votes each from Province Governor and Province Magistrate. Let the bill for Upper House be registered by directly elected member of Upper House. Upper house will vote for foreign minister, ambassadors and diplomats.   For now, either make Mayor and Deputy Mayor of each capital of Province to be interim Governor and Magistrate to bring law and order in state-province security and function. After election they will go back to be Mayor and Deputy Mayor.     Why all this?

I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both.

BTW, Gen Z doesn’t just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didn’t exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who weren’t even present for the protests claim we don’t know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldn’t even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, ‘We have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server you’re all listening to is just for public discussion’. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal. Now that it’s been confirmed everywhere and with Balen posting that the Gen Z’s choice former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Sushila Karki is the right choice for interim prime minister of Nepal, we look forward to what comes next.|||https://new-nepal-voting.vercel.app/  Vote here or suggest names I can add|||For interim formation CJ Sushila Karki would be the perfect choice.

It’s rotting because everything: government, institutions and society itself is rotten to the core. There is no genetic psychopathy; there’s generations of: neglect, corruption, and betrayal. People aren’t spreading hate for fun, they’re bleeding from a system that chews them up and spits them out.  Your little moral lectures about “empathy” and “fairness”? Irrelevant. The world doesn’t run on kindness. It runs on power, survival, and who’s willing to fight or cheat to stay alive. Sitting there whining online, hoping people will listen, makes you irrelevant. You aren’t warning anyone, you’re screaming into a void while real fkin problems eat the country alive.  Get over your illusions man. The country doesn’t owe you, me or anyone morality.

Nothing was going to change if things didn’t go south. Personally, I didn’t see the government making any changes with a peaceful protest. Even when we look at history of the world, majority of peaceful protest start peaceful and end violently. No entity in power ever gives it up easily.  Change was what we asked for and change is what we are getting. Not exactly the way we wanted things to go but seems clear from the comments that we all knew, in the back of our minds, it was never going to be a straight road to Rome.  So I believe it’s high time we look ahead and bring the same energy we did to the protests to ensure that we see the change we want to see happen and bring in leaders we believe in. Easier said than done but accountability starts from us now. Let’s not settle for less than what we envision Nepal to be.|||Who are you telling this?

They are hot blooded. They can do anything with teen minds.  Look at your genZ, destroying their own land...  GenZ is a popular word on the internet.  Now whenever you talk about GenZ people will remember this amount of brutalism and rage against their own land own assets.|||**What next? thoughts from a fellow Gen Z**    The motherland burns, my heart aches, my mind ponders, is all hope lost? My soul hurts to see violence, arson, anarchy, and the loot and burning of our national properties. We, Gen-Z, seem to have won, yet feel lost. Hope feels lost. Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? I’ve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we can’t let our nation fail.** We can’t let our nation burn. We can’t let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**     **1) We lay down our weapons.**   We came in peace, we protested in peace, and we’ve always wanted peace. We shall end this in peace. Be it known that anybody inciting violence isn’t part of our movement.     **2) We extend love.**   Love towards our brothers and sisters, love towards our nation, love towards our neighbours, our society, and the opposing side. The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.     **3) We wear white.**   White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that we’ve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.     **4) We have hope.**   Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.     Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.     Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.     Sincerely,   Pantji, a Gen-Z |||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger.

People have Short term memory most of you are gonna forget about today's anger 🤬 and will mostly be happy by the development that has been done in 6 month or a year before election.

Most people will likely vote for the same party again because most people think they are obligated to vote for the same party cause in the time of need or having some legal problems they will help to solve that problem and give special favor and priority to party members.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Why not sagar Dhakal?|||Yesss|||Just promote it in your social media handle|||K bhairacha yarr discord ma pm choose bhairacha|||Ahile non political manxe thik huncha...her or Dr सन्दुक Ruit.

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen.

Its grand architecture and historical importance make it a true pride of Nepal.The news of Singha Durbar burning yesterday is more than just the loss of a structure it feels like the loss of a piece of our soul. This tragedy is a blow to our heritage, to our economy, and to our sense of unity as a nation. The damage cannot be measured only in money, but also in the irreplaceable cultural and historical value that has been destroyed.  I feel deeply saddened by this loss. Singha Durbar was more than walls and pillars it was a living monument of Nepal’s journey, struggles, and achievements.

Millions of us depend on YouTube every day  for learning, for jobs, for communication with the world. Blocking it just because of some paperwork is such a backwards move.  If the government wants registration, fine — negotiate with Google, set up rules, whatever. But don’t cut off an entire nation from one of the most important platforms on the internet. This hurts students, creators, and businesses way more than it helps anyone.  Instead of solving the issue, they’ve basically told Nepali people: “too bad, no YouTube for you.” That’s not regulation that’s censorship.",

            "body": "Let me get straight to the point.  Nepal has a multy-party parliamentary system, which means it is a mixed election system. Which means when we vote, we vote for two things. One for the 165 candidates who are elected directly (first-past-the-post), other for the party. The votes that party gets determine the remaining 110 members via proportional representation.  so aba either we need new political parties to replace the existing ones by Falgun 21, or we have to vote for the same parties again. This is more complicated because Nepal is not just Kathmandu. The political players which we have termed jholey will be active outside Kathmandu.   So if we need the change in constitution, we have to be more careful. The mandates of the movement are more at risk now than before.",
