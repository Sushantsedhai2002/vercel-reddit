If people don’t vote or don’t make their voter card, Nepal could face several problems in the future, especially given the current situation.   1. Weak Leadership – When responsible citizens don’t vote, unqualified or corrupt leaders can easily win. This weakens governance and slows down development.  2. Unaccountable Government – If voter participation is low, leaders feel less pressure to listen to the public. They may misuse power, waste resources, or ignore public needs.  3. Corruption and Poor Policy – Without active voters, there’s little demand for transparency. Corrupt practices can increase, and policies might only benefit a small group instead of the whole nation.  4. Slow Progress and Development – When citizens don’t take part in elections, issues like unemployment, inflation, and poor infrastructure remain unsolved because leaders aren’t held accountable.  5. Loss of Voice and Representation – Not voting means letting others decide for you. Your district, community, or age group may not get proper attention in national decisions.  6. Public Frustration and Division – People may keep complaining about the system but forget that change starts with voting. This creates frustration and political instability.  Not voting weakens democracy.",

Until and unless, government shifts the source of its revenue to something else, we have to carry the burden.  The government have to penetrate the production market itself and compete with the general corporations and earn the revenue.  Another source of income can be charging less tax to foreign nationals  who fulfill the residential critera but for this to happen Nepal should be one of target destinations for Nomads experts. Minimal revenue but still something.  Simply reducing the tax burden will lead to less revenue in government funds.

Acclimatize yourself with gain in altitude and use it as an opportunity to explore the food and culture of the place you'll be staying. Make sure you have proper gear, emergency plan and some extra food. And always remember, you can always come back later if your body starts feeling unwell.  Take back nothing but memories. Leave nothing but footprints.||| Take a guide it’s easy to be lost while trekking. I don’t advise without agency.|||Would advise you to take extra days and extra money and not rush the trek. Start walking from Chame or pisang and explore manang to properly acclimatize at that altitude. Do not go to Khangsar directly like many people do. You are likely to get altitude sickness. Take your time and go slow. Treks are not enjoyable if it becomes demanding for your body.|||Take your time and don’t rush. Altitude can be a serious issue. The elevation difference from Besisahar around 760 meters to 3,519 meters Manag in just one day is huge. Tilicho Base Camp is at 4,150 meters, and Tilicho Lake itself is at 4,919 meters. I’ve seen many people suffer from altitude sickness even at Manang, so it’s important to go slowly. Stay at Manang to acclimatize properly, and spend some time in Khangsar as well to adjust to the higher altitude before starting your trek to Tilicho Lake. Take it slow, there’s no need to rush. I also don’t recommend Tilicho Lake as a beginner’s trek. Start walking and training a few weeks in advance, and make sure to carry electrolyte drinks. Drink them every day before and after trekking to stay hydrated and maintain your energy levels.",

For example, my old Sony Vaio can handle up to 8GB, while an older Dell model only supports a maximum of 4GB. You can easily check online by searching your laptop model to find out if it supports SSD upgrades and the maximum RAM capacity.  Also note that in Nepal the shop are asking upward of 2-3,000 NPR for each 4gb RAM module, claiming a 6-month warranty.

            "body": "I want to share my wife’s story because I hope it helps someone who might be going through something similar. It's been a tough two years for us, and I’ve learned a lot the hard way.  After 2 years of getting married to my wife. In December 2023, we got the news no one ever wants to hear. My wife had a tumor near her pituitary gland (large lobulated heterogeneously and vividly enhancing mass). The MRI came back showing it was about 33x29x26 mm basically, the size of a small egg. I don’t think I’ll ever forget that moment. The world felt like it stopped spinning, and I had no idea what to do.  I immediately went into panic mode and started researching everything I could. We were ready to go to Delhi and see the top neurosurgeons, but then a relative suggested we see Dr. Gopal Raman Sharma at Nepal Mediciti for suggestion and consultation. Honestly, we were skeptical, but we decided to give it a shot.  When we met Dr. Sharma, it felt different from the start. There was no sugarcoating it, he was very serious, and made it clear that the tumor was dangerous. He kept saying it had to come out immediately, that something could happen to my wife *right now* if we didn’t do anything. I won’t lie, his words hit hard. He made it sound like we didn’t have time to think.  So, without really questioning much, we agreed. We trusted him. The surgery was scheduled for the very next day, and everything moved so fast. We didn’t even have time to breathe.  The surgery took around 2 hours. When he came out, Dr. Sharma told me, “We removed what we could, but there was a lot of blood loss. It was complicated.” And that was it. There was no explanation beyond that. When I tried asking how much of the tumor had been removed, he didn’t really answer me. At that point, I should’ve pressed more, but I was just in shock. My wife was kept in the ICU for two days, and we just had to wait.  A few weeks later, she came home, but we were still uneasy. He dragged us for an year saying there was nothing that can be done. We just wait and watch. \"Wait and watch\" thats all we heard from him for an year. It didn’t feel like it was over, not by a long shot. So, we did another MRI in December 2024, and when we got the results, I couldn’t believe my eyes. The tumor hadn’t shrunk. At all. It was still about 34x26x25 mm.  I was furious. I felt like we’d just been taken for a ride. All that money, all that stress, all that hope, and nothing had changed. I was angry at Dr. Gopal Raman Sharma and his assistant Prashant for not being more upfront, and angry at myself for not questioning more. But, as much as I wanted to blame someone, I knew anger wasn’t going to fix anything. So, I decided to take a step back, calm down, and get a second opinion.  That’s when we decided to go to AIIMS in India. We met with a neurosurgeon there who really took the time to explain everything. He did MRI and looked into everything in detail. He told us that the diagnosis was wrongly done by Dr. Gopal Raman Sharma at mediciti. That was a tough pill to swallow, but it also gave us some clarity. He told us that the tumor is made up of nerves and its jelly like. At least now we understood why things hadn’t gone as planned. The second surgery was scheduled right away. It was a long one, about 8-10 hours. My wife lost almost 5 liters of blood, but the team handled it. They managed to remove 97% of the tumor.  After the surgery, Neurosurgeon at AIIMS told us that the first surgery didn’t work because Dr. Sharma had tried to remove the tumor from wrong place and also tried three different places, but couldn’t reach it properly. In fact, the repeated attempts had damaged the tumor, making it harder to remove. The tumor was now scattered, which is why it was so difficult to get rid of.  It wasn’t easy. She was in the ICU for 7 hours after the surgery, but eventually, she was moved to a private room, and after 3 days, we were able to go home. It was a huge relief, but there was still the small matter of the remaining 3% of the tumor.  We had to come back to India for gamma knife radiation to get rid of the rest. The procedure took about 5 hours, but in the end, it was successful. The last of the tumor was gone. We just returned to kathmandu today.  Now, my wife is doing well. She’s back to her normal self, and for the first time in over two years, I feel like we can finally breathe easy. It’s been an incredibly tough journey. I’ve never felt so much responsibility in my life. As the eldest son, you carry that weight, and it can take a toll on you in ways you don’t expect.  But looking back, there are a few things I’ve learned that I wish I’d known from the start:  1. **Don’t rush decisions**. We let urgency take over in the beginning, and that clouded our judgment. Don’t be afraid to take a step back and think things through. 2. **Get a second opinion**. I can’t stress this enough. Don’t just trust the first doctor you see, no matter how confident they sound. If something doesn’t feel right, ask around. get **Get third and forth opinion** too. 3. **Trust yourself and your instincts**. In those early days, I didn’t trust my gut as much as I should have. Trust your intuition and don’t be afraid to ask questions—even when the doctor seems like they’re the expert. 4. **It’s okay to be angry, but don’t let it control you**. I was angry at Dr. Sharma, and I still feel that way sometimes. But holding onto that anger didn’t do anyone any good. It’s better to focus on moving forward. 5. **Life is unpredictable**. You never know what’s around the corner. But even in the toughest times, there’s always hope.  We’re finally able to move forward with our lives. I’m grateful my wife is healthy again, and I’m thankful for the lessons this journey has taught me. I just want to share this so that anyone who’s in a similar situation knows that they’re not alone. Keep fighting, keep questioning, and trust that things can get better.",

A Nepali doctor rushed us into surgery, which didn’t remove the tumor and gave us only “wait and watch” for a year. The tumor didn’t shrink. We went to AIIMS India, where we learned the first diagnosis and surgical approach were incorrect. AIIMS surgeons did an 8–10 hour surgery, removed \\~97% of the tumor, and then gamma-knife radiation cleared the remaining 3%.

Some meds and she was perfectly fine. Btw this was more than a decade ago. She's healthy as an ox. Not saying that all doctors are bad here but anecdotes like OPs are more common than I realised.|||I read the whole story and im glad that she has recovered and now you both are relieved and have normal life once again. I cant imagine how frustrated and stressed you must've been in those two years. Thank you for sharing your story and experience.|||wishing for a happy life of your family my brother. काली माता को कृपा रहोस् ॥ |||glad it was recovered |||Hope you both are well right now|||How much did the entire ordeal cost you? Lack of proper insurance in Nepal is really a pita for most families.|||I think I had very similar case like your wife. A bit long but you can read. When I was 17 I had tumor in my right eye, I noticed my eye was diff. sometimes in mirror/photos so I went to Tilganga then did diagnosis then dr.Rohit Saiju of Tilganga said we need to do surgery and cut your bone of upper part, it is critical, if tumor turns to be malignant then it will be sad news, and there is risk of Vision loss, etc. they scared me, told everything that will help them to escape if things don’t go right later. But I said ok fine, there is no option, I have to do, I have another eye if sth goes bad. Looking back now, I can only salute that 17 yrs old brave guy. And operation happened, I was unconscious, they even showed tumor mass taken out. And thankfully, tumor was benign. Then slowly I focused on recovery, for 3 yrs I found nothing strange, but slowly I saw that same eye a bit different/strange, during this whole 3 yrs during follow-up with same doctor he did basic eye checks, and said it’s fine, you can come after 3 months like that. I mean he didn’t know or didn’t tell that I had tumor recurrence again. I went to diagnosis again and mri showed tumor again, I was shocked/speechless. That doc said we need to redo surgery, and said like this kinda tumor comes again, but I asked question like should I then again come back in few years to again do, that is hard, I had no idea at this time that operation could have been better, I just cried like why me god? Why did tumor reoccur? I thought enough, I am not doing operation here, I am going India, then researched then went to Aiims Delhi, there same as yours case, doctors said that it could have been success in first surgery, it’s a capsule kinda tumor and you can easily take out, how did that doc fail, kinda like that, only then I knew Dr. Saiju could have done better or could have recommended to India if he couldn’t, or could have diagnosed faster in second time, he failed in all this, I was more shocked than angry as it was my decision to do surgery with him, and mistakes could happen from any doctor so I thought like that. Then I discussed with many doctors, researched so much on that area that one doc even said did you also study medicine? So I dig deep, analyzed experience/capacity of all possible surgeons, as I knew only one thing: The only thing I have under control is to choose best surgeon, as after surgery they can do nothing, they will only tell it happens because of this case/surgery, so only that 2-3 hrs of surgery matters. I was so daring that once I asked to one so reputed doctor in face that, how many such my case kinda operations did you do till now? How confident are you, what are your thinkings, etc. because it’s my right, my life. I finally thought to do surgery with one reputed doctor dr.A.K. Grover , then he did operate. And i am 24 now, it’s 3 yrs after that second surgery, till now going good after that surgery, much sincere thanks to dr. Grover from my heart. Hopefully, I will be fine. Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies.|||I'm happy for you sire.

Sure, let’s just keep launching new parties every day and confuse the public even more, so they end up voting for the same old corrupt faces again.  Sumana, Balen, Rabi, Kulman...whoever you are, if the country truly comes before your ego or ambition, you’ll find common ground and work together. If not, you’re all just chasing your own slice of the pie.|||Sabhapati maa bargaining garne manchhe bata k aas garnu ra khai🥱|||Yes kulman is the best options now. He’ll be backed by balen, sudan, sagar, sumana. Also I think he’s party will be filled with professionals.   I think this will be the best alternative politics party of Nepal.  They were bound to open a party because RSP didn’t compromise with their God. They have somewhat become like old (not completely). Voices of toshima ganesh pukar are suppressed. All old congressi and UML people flocking into RSP. I hope this new balen’s party has a mechanism to stop that.  Btw it’s not the face of kulman we are voting. It’s party a party where there is no supreme leader like others.|||it’s time to support him…lets give him one chance to make a difference 👍|||Better than  Sherya, KP chor and parchendey and rabi|||I'd be very very surprised if they can even get 1-2 seats...  New party formation and the movement are not easy. You need excellent support base prior to it, in-depth understanding of politics, unweavering political will, charisma to gather followers, gather and lead like-minded and excellent candidates, have an excellent PR network...etc..etc...  What Ravi/RSP pulled off in 2079 was a miracle. And that doesn't happen frequently and easily. I honestly believe only RSP or RSP-led coalition has a realistic chance to challenge the established parties.   So I am going to: - Vote RSP for Samanupatik - Vote RSP if good/strong RSP candidtaes - Vote Balen/Kulman/Sumana/Sagar/Harka personally only over weak/unknown RSP candidates.|||My personal vote for Kulman party.|||[deleted]|||Yo hamley kasto manchhe lai support garirachham bhanera reflect garni mauka pani ho.

Why are youths so easily manipulated by the old parties'propaganda against RSP? Why would anyone trust the lies spread by corrupt leaders against Rabi and the party? There’s nothing wrong with RSP it’s the hope for real change.

It might be harsh but there isn't much use for terrorists to terrorize Nepal. The only angle I can see is religious but it seems doubtful that they are going to spend so much money and resources just for that.  What the terrorists will be far more attracted by is open border with India. If there is any high-profile attack and it is found that they have any base in Nepal, you can say that we will be in a diplomatic crisis where we will either need to allow India to investigate in Nepal's territory or have ourselves screwed of half our export/import.  Same with any potential spy/state terror activities against China operating in Nepal.  If they decide to go \"war against terror\" on us, then yea. We r gone.",

            "body": "Captions on the posts -  Ward chair must have a very good salary for such a luxurious lifestyle. They are the son and daughter in law of narayan subedi of gokarna 5. This is an insane lifestyle, nothing less than Dahal family. If a local ward chairperson can amass such wealth, those at the level of IGP and mantri have looted us taxpayers a hundred times higher.   This guy is apparently the son of nepal’s most corrupt chief justice Gopal Parajuli, btw he had to resign because of fake citizenship. Openly flexing luxury cars and watches on social media. Arent we tired of them by now?  The poor doesnt have access to proper ambulances, meanwhile ankit khand the son of nepali citizenship seller balkrishna khand takes helicopters, everywhere he goes! Manju Khand ko chorra.  Shaniddhya Shaudharya Khanal, son of Ex IGP of APF, Shailendra Khanal. What is the salary of these officers to be able to afford these lifestyles?  Garima Paudel daughter of ex minister devendra paudel proudly faunting her international lifestyle. International tours, comfortable international lifestyle, business class travels while the poor are forced to use tuins for daily commute. Are we not tired of this? This is why we are exposing corruption in nepal  Sangita Pahadi has recently been sued by CIAA for 3 arba scam. Their children have been living a lavish lifestyle since ages. No shame. 30 hajar ko talab, 30 ota gharbari. Finish them all.  We found another generational corruption run. Khushi Pandey is the granddaughter of Ramesh Nath Pandey, he was the FORMER MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, INDUSTRY, TOURISM, ENVIRONMENT and COMMUNICATIONS. She is also the daughter of Nischal Nath Pandey, who served as a government employee during ramesh nath pandey’s long ministerial run. Look at this damn lifestyle. How is it possible to afford all of this when the family has nothing except civil service for the past 50 years?  Supriya Bohora, granddaughter of Deepak Bohora, former member of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and the House of Representatives, has recently come under the spotlight. Deepak Bohora was known for his strong hand in the Panchayat system and his unwavering support for the monarchy. His political journey is remembered not only for his allegiance to authoritarian structures but also for allegations of corruption. One of the most prominent accusations linked to Deepak Bohora is the illegal consumption of land where the Fun Park ice rink in Bhadrakali Road now stands. What was once a symbol of political maneuvering and alleged misappropriation of public assets is now being flaunted by his granddaughter as a mark of achievement, raising questions about how the spoils of corruption are normalized across generations.  Anusandhan khai ta comrade? Granddaughter living in europe to protect all the money stored in swiss bank. EXPOSE THEM ALL!  Most corrupted ones are the generals from police special dsp and upwards.👮 I have seen them using massive funds to get their sons n daughters abroad or in prestigious schools by paying hefty fees. their home looks like that of a king , literally narayanhiti jastai same and their sons n daughters are living the life of luxuries carrying iphones and designer dresses and bags . Actually what these officer do is they heavily launder money and budgets which comes to their department . They practice “milijuli khane” . They also take funds from criminals to manage cases. Then they use these funds to bribe politicians for getting higher post like dsp to dig , from DIG to IG and so on . They conduct massive weddings and ceremonies spending crore of rupees. this is same with army generals as well.  `-`  **TLDR - REGISTER AND CONVINCE YOUR FRIENDS, COUSINS IF THEY STILL HAVE NOT MADE VOTER ID**  Read an interesting blog on this. Hamro lato politician le k bujhla esto. Chorra chorri lai instagram delete garna chai layo dhanna teti chai buddhi raicha.  >The corrupt ruling elites of the Third World, who used to steal everything, destroy economies, and create hell for their own populations, have now added one more thing: they openly allow their children to flaunt the spoils of corruption on Instagram, right in front of their starving people. Something previous generations never witnessed.  >The new rich have never gone through a revolution so they don't understand not to flaunt their wealth like the old bourgeoisie who have witnessed multiple revolutions throughout history. It's ironic that the Maoists instigated a revolution yet the children of said Maoists are now living the luxurious lives posting everything not knowing whats simmering in society. It looks like at least the kids have understood not to flaunt their stolen wealth to avoid angering the masses.  >In any ways what happened in Nepal highlights a trend I’ve discussed on here before, which is how Instagram utterly radicalizes youth heavy developing societies.  >Suddenly you as a poor but striving young man or woman have full visibility to how the elite/upper class of your country + diaspora live, but you have little access or hope of ever living the same for the most part. The impact of this on mental health, societal stability, and also fertility rates cannot be underestimated.  >Imagine going from a society with five state channels and a few cable options in the 2000s to Instagram in just five years. That’s what happened to all of South Asia + Africa + a lot of Latin America.  These guys were being exposed to the lifestyles of the baddie daughters and Chad sons of the fucktards ruling their country,  >You see their trip to Japan and London for the summer. See their parties at their elite mansions in the most posh suburbs and neighborhoods and you realize you’re just fucked and not getting there ever, your country simply does not have the mechanism to enable that for you, you’re unemployed even despite a college degree.  >**Upward mobility is like a pressure valve. Nepal never had that. The elites taxed people, slapped tariffs on imports & ignored building institutions that foster upward mobility. Instead, they assumed that sending their populace to the Middle East would be sufficient.**  >What’s surprising is how the corrupt politicians allow their kids to flaunt stolen wealth so brazenly. Kids of politicians in developing countries flaunting their extravagant lifestyles on public Instagram accounts is so foolhardy. Exposure to social media and bragging about your luxurious lifestyle risks fuelling resentment and envy.  >It's how uprisings have always been. Old bourgeoisie don't show off their wealth like those Nepali elites did. This behavior is what got both the iranian and russian noble families killed. This also happened in Mongolia earlier this year, although less dramatically. The Prime Minister had to step down due to protests that kicked off because his son was showing off his luxury holidays and clothes too much on Instagram.",

And for, writing section. I think there are three section. 7,8 and 10 marks question . For 7 and 8 marks writing write 150-200 words with right content. If the content is good you will get marks And for 10 marks 250-300 is recommended. But this doesnot imply everywhere. Its totally up to teachers how they veiw . Some prefer good writing and content while others just give marks based on how long you write. I would suggest you to mix both. Focus on good writing skills and also consider the  ideal word range...|||Not answering the question directly writing off-topic. Ignoring part of the question e.g., explaining causes but forgetting solutions. Unclear position, not showing your opinion when required. Rewriting the question instead of giving your own ideas. Weak support ideas without explanation or examples. Coherence and Cohesion Poor paragraphing  no clear introduction, body, or conclusion. Overusing connectors like “Firstly, Secondly” without logic. Limited variety of linking words  repeating “However” or “Moreover.” Abrupt transitions  jumping between ideas with no smooth link.  Lexical Resource (Vocabulary) Repetition using the same word many times. Wrong word choice  word doesn’t fit the context. Misused “fancy words”  using dictionary words incorrectly. Incorrect collocations e.g., do a crime instead of commit a crime. Too informal words like kids, Grammatical Range and Accuracy Trying to impress with big words but using them wrongly.|||question answer ki essay type??|||from teacher's mark giving scheme, I saw marking for using transition words.",

At the end of the day, even though I scored 3.97 GPA, In the Kathmandu Metro Scholarship exam, I choked. I barely made it onto the second nomination list and ended up in a college that’s just “okay.” But honestly, I don’t blame the college I blame myself. There were others who got into better colleges than me, even though they had lower grades. So, I can’t say grades don’t matter, but the first term really showed me how tough things can get. I know I need to improve, and I’m determined to do so. I got an A+ in Computer Science, even though I didn’t study as much as I should have. I love Computer Science and building a lot of skills in the field. Right now, though, I’ve decided to take a break from everything every extracurricular activity, including learning JavaScript, React, and other things. I know I probably shouldn’t, but I feel like it’s necessary for now. Starting today, I’ll be locking my phone and using my laptop strictly for studying. I need to focus on my second terminal exams, and it’s time to set boundaries.If I’ve said anything wrong, I apologize. I don’t blame anyone or anything but myself, even though I studied harder than I ever have. My lack of proper note-taking has cost me. Right now, I’m just looking for advice from seniors who have gone through this and come back stronger, getting good results in the end.",

But it turned out none of it actually mattered.   Last year I gave CEE exams for MBBS ug , I couldn't get a scholarship and it felt like the end of the world especially because people expected a lot from me. I used to avoid talking to anyone.

I understand it looks a lot worse to you (and maybe your guardians) coming from 3.97 to 3.10 and your feelings are very valid. I have seen toppers with dead end jobs and barely first class pass having a stellar careers. I'm somewhat middle of the lot myself.  You've got a lot going for you, you got a 4.0 in the subject you love and sounds like you're pretty proactive with it and fairly competent too. All the B's and B+'s  could have been A's with a little discipline and bit of a good luck, and most of all hopefully this has given you a wake up call.

The college kept my original migration certificate, so I went to NEB and got another one issued.  Now I’m planning to join a new BBS program. Will this new migration certificate (or what they call a “copy”) be accepted by a TU-affiliated college?  Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Also, does anyone know when BBS first-year registration starts at NCC College? I’ve already done my admission, but I might need to sort out my migration before proceeding.",

            "body": "Hello! Myself (20M), along with two of my friends and our families, visited Nepal during the Diwali holidays. We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8. Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)  (used chatgpt to refine my text)  (attached a video of sarangkot as i was mesmerised by the view)",

            "comments": "First of all, commendations for such well written and structured post, that too with all the additional info at the end. (For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".  During off season, it's easily manageable & fun because less people & no need to queue to get a selfie with some peculiar rock or a waterfall, butttttt, it's called off season for a reason, the majestic views might be compromised or not, it's a gamble.|||Dhulikhel rock view point, man why would they take you there! 🤦  Are you speaking 'Bangla'?|||Bhaktapur is the jewel 🙏|||kudos to camera work- given the health condition of your mum- i recommend you sepnd more time in chitwan- janakpur and lumbini-- may be 3 days each city- it covers pilgrimage and cultural aspect-|||Others have already suggested you some places to visit, so I just want to give you one important piece of advice. I have a relative who works as a travel agent, and he told me that many agents and shopkeepers tend to focus more on foreign tourists than on Indians, because they believe they can overcharge them easily. So, bro, be careful  there are many thugs and dishonest agents who might try to charge you extra. **Bargaining is the key.**  In almost every corner, if a hotel recommends you a place or a service, remember that the hotel usually gets a commission from it. The entire system in tourist areas like Thamel often runs on commission-based deals. So it’s always better to ask genuine locals for suggestions rather than agents pretending to be locals. In Thamel, you’ll find many such people who act friendly but are just trying to make money off tourists.  If you have Nepali friends, you can travel cheaply and safely otherwise, just be a bit cautious and smart while dealing with people. To be honest, a few uneducated people here may dislike Indian tourists, and that’s an unfortunate reality. But overall, we Nepalese are known to be **very hospitable, kind, and friendly**, and most people will treat you with respect and warmth. Just stay alert, bargain wisely, and you’ll have a wonderful time in Nepal.|||Bro, timi Darjeeling bata vayae taa, yo sabai Normal hola ni taa timro laagi taa?? 🤔|||where did u take that video bro? was it in pokhara?|||You skipped Bandipur en route Pokhara from Kathmandu.

Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||Have a great time here, enjoy it and after you go back to your home just think is it fair to take land of the country who provided you with such great hospitality?|||[deleted]",

I'm no expert but I  do come with a few facts . The actual knowledge I feel like I know it better than anyone here. Not bragging .  So take it as a means of education. I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it.

            "subreddit": "Nepal",
            "heading": "A Night in Kathmandu — The Unexpected Bar Scam Experience",
            "body": "After completing our last destination in Kathmandu, our Nepal trip was almost coming to an end. We had planned to spend the evening shopping around local markets before heading back home.  But as luck would have it, the weather had other plans. It started raining heavily, and most of us decided to cancel the shopping plan and stay inside the bus, waiting for the rain to stop.  While we were sitting there, a Nepali guy — sort of an agent — climbed onto the bus. He started chatting with my friend, talking about dance bars, attractive girls, and fun nightlife in Kathmandu. My friends, curious and excited to explore something different, agreed to check it out. So, we went along with him from Gaushala Chowk.  ⸻  The Arrival  We reached around 7 PM. The place looked more like a small pub or lounge — dim lights, loud music, and barely anyone inside. There were just two Indian guys with a few Nepali girls, sitting at a corner table, smoking hukka and drinking.  We were a group of 12 people, so we took two tables (6 on each). I sat on the other table, while two Nepali girls from the bar joined my friends’ table. They were friendly, laughing, and talking in Hindi — chit chat, masti, jokes — sab Hindi mein.  After a few minutes, the girls said they wanted to have a drink. The same agent who brought us there told my friend, “Sir, bas 400 Rs ka juice hai.” They wrote the order on a small paper chit, took my friend’s signature, and soon two juices were served.  That’s how their system worked — write on paper, take a sign, and serve the order.  We also ordered 4 beers for ourselves. Out of 12, only 4 were drinking — the rest were just watching the dance show.  ⸻  The Show Begins  Soon, Nepali girls started dancing on Hindi songs, followed by a couple of male dancers and another girl joining the floor. The vibe felt okay at first — typical dance bar scene, music, lights, drinks.  But after the girls finished their drinks, a waiter brought a hukka pot to our table without even asking. We immediately told him to take it away. The girls got off from our table soon after that.  ⸻  Something Felt Off  After finishing the beer, me and my friend went to the washroom. There we saw those same two Indian guys who were sitting earlier — looked like North Indians (maybe Delhi or Haryana). They seemed tense, arguing with the bar staff.  Out of curiosity, I asked one of them, “Bhai kya hua?” He said, “Dekho na bhai, kuch khaya nahi, thoda piya sirf — aur bill 32,000 Nepali bana diya!”  That one line was enough to send chills down my spine.  I quickly went back to my table and told my friend what had happened. We immediately asked for our bill — but the damage was already done.  ⸻  The Shocking Bill  The bill came in Nepali currency: \t•\t4 Beers = 4000 \t•\t2 Drinks for girls = 8000 \t•\t23% Service charge = 2760 Total = 14,760 NRS (≈ 9,840 INR)  My friend was shocked. He said, “Ladies drink price to 400 bola tha,” but by then, the agent who brought us there had vanished.  There was no point arguing — the staff was large in number, and the situation didn’t look safe. Finally, we settled the bill for 9,500 INR and left the place quietly.  ⸻  What Happened Next  As we were leaving, I noticed those two Indian guys being locked in a small office, surrounded by bar staff demanding they hand over their mobiles or belongings to pay off the bill.  I felt genuinely bad for them — and guilty for not sitting at my friend’s table earlier, or checking the price list before signing that paper chit.  But at the same time, I was thankful that we escaped early — with just a 4-beer loss instead of a full-blown scam.  ⸻  The Reality Behind the Glamour  While we were stepping out, a few more Nepali guys entered, and immediately all the bar girls — including those who had been at our table — went to join them, smoking hukka and ordering drinks.  Just watching that, I could only think: “Isko to aaj 40,000–50,000 ka chuna lagne wala hai.”  ⸻  Final Thoughts  Our Nepal trip overall was beautiful — from Pokhara’s serenity to the spiritual vibe of Pashupatinath. But this one Kathmandu nightlife experience was a reminder that not everything that glitters is gold.  If you ever plan to explore nightlife in Kathmandu, be cautious: \t•\tNever sign anything you don’t understand. \t•\tAlways ask for the price upfront. \t•\tAnd if something feels shady — walk away.  This experience became a story to remember — not for the fun, but for the lesson it taught us.",

We have already raised significant funding and we are working on a \"risk sharing\" basis (core team of director, writer, cinematographer are not taking our salaries and will work on % share). Already generated around NPR 80 lakhs and need to generate the final 20 lakhs. If any of you or your friends or colleagues are interested in becoming an investor in a film, DM me and we can chat.

If you have solid proof that you were at home during that time and hour, maybe photos with the date and time, or an alibi, it can help. But it does not hurt you to go to the police station and check. Maybe the scooter involved in the accident had the same number, but a different lot, which does happen. Take your parents, a friend or relative, preferably someone who can speak to the police, it helps. Ask for them to provide you with the CCTV footage or record it yourself. Take your scooter with you, maybe the original scooter is of a different color, or has some difference with yours (maybe noticeable scratches or dents, or stickers that sets your scooter apart) - which can help dispute the claim, zoom and look carefully to find any of the differences mentioned.|||If nobody took your scooter and you know that, Why tf are you scared ?|||In Most of such cases, high profile manxe involve hunxa and they will try hard to frame one.

But for future-proofing this type of incident, I highly recommend a vehicle tracker. You gan get cheap ones from Daraz. If you get a Sinohero device, you don't have to pay the yearly subscription. It's free for life, will just cost you higher upfront (mine cost 8k). I recharged Rs.500 and it ran for 2 years. For advanced features(that require internet or calls), you will need to recharge often, maybe like 1500/year. But for basic tracking, Rs.500 will basically run the GPS until your validity expires, I think. You could even recharge lower - just upto the point where you maximize your validity.  Personal use ko lagi cost may be unjustified. I use it non-personal expenses. But as a personal expense pani it could be worth it, if 1 in a 1000 chance of running into a scenario like yours, where you need go prove your innocence with an alibi.",

I'll handle the bills and expenses monthly, leading the household, and moving to a better 3bhk apartment, but my parents are scared and want to live in a comfort zone. I feel like they're holding my goals and work. I had a big argument with my parents; they just won't listen to me. I told them I wanna move alone and work in peace, but they said no because people will think I'm leaving my parents alone. What should I do now?",

They worry that losing your job could make managing daily life difficult. I suggest buying a small home, as big luxury homes are overrated, either through financing or with cash, without discussing it with your parents. Ensure you pay the EMIs regularly. This will achieve two things: first, it will show your parents that these kinds of jobs are stable and genuine; second, it will help build their trust in you.|||Move to KTM saying you are going there for study.

It might sound rude towards the parent but them apologizing you in the future will give you worse experience than achieving your goals.   You are their son.

When looking at a car, ask yourself where you can find someone who knows how to fix your type of car.  Also ask if the car has ever been in any crashes.|||Good Choice .  Better value than BYD Atto 2 .   On EV there is no hassle , Just take care of the battery .  Full charge 100% every 15 day or so , every few month try to bring the battery to around 10% .    Highway travel , City use , they are now perfect for all situation due to availability of charging stations .|||Money in the pocket!|||Pedestrian|||I was also looking at a car around the same range.Let me share you my experience and how I came to decide between different options.  I was looking for something around 35-45 lakhs. Options were 1. Byd Atto 2 2. Nammi box 3. Nammi Vigo 4. Byd Dolphin 5. Icaur v23 6. Tata Nexon k3 7. MG s5  TLDR: I chose atto 2 because of ground clearance and I trusted byd's interior and battery quality. Rejected NAAMI because of suspension.  One of my relatives has a DOLPHIN and I have done around 700 kms long tour on the highway. It was around 30k odo and no sound inside cabin no rattling. I was impressed with byd's quality.  NAAMI BOX I test drove NAAMI BOX 2 times, everytime I felt the suspension wasn't good enough, it made a thud unpleasant sound. Plus I could hear the motor spinning as well. A faint one but it was there. Plus the ventilated seats weren't that good I couldn't  feel the cooling at all. So I rejected that last year.   ICAUR V23 I went to test ride the ICAUR v23, it's a little expensive but it's RWD and has high stance so I was quite interested. The vehicle drives well but the interior quality is not good at all. The plastics looks like those 5 seater plastic table we get in hotels. So I rejected that car because I don't trust it's quality and I saw a Chinese video where the cars hood flew away. I know this might be one time case but the interior plastics felt really cheap on icaur v23. I loved the way that car drives tho. Felt like I was in a quite expensive car.  TATA NEXON I recently had to travel to dharan and I rented a tata Nexon. It has 22k odo reading and was in a fairly good condition. The renting company had recently purchased it and I was the first one to rent it. It even had hospital stickers from previous owner. But the thing is, I didn't find the seats comfortable at all . I am about 6 feet and I couldn't find it comfortable. Plus the rattling noise was a bit more than what I would have liked. The main issue is it only gave me 130 km max range that too in terai. It was doing 1 km per percentage while I was travelling to hetauda via Fakhel.   NAAMI VIGO I liked what it offers, a glass roof, outdoor speakers, split tailgate perfect for travelling. I still had prejudice because of NAAMI BOX's suspension not being good enough. I went to test ride the car but as soon as I entered the car, I felt l wasn't in a 42 lakhs car. I didn't get to test drive the car but I didn't feel good about it.   BYD ATTO 2 I liked the dolphin and it's features. So I trusted Byd With quality and battery range. With atto 2 claiming 200 mm ground clearance I was happy. I was about to buy it without even a test ride and when I looked at the features I was bummed about one thing. I would have liked the glass roof but the one that bummed me was Blind Spot Detection. It's not available in Nepal, Malaysia and lower trims in Australia. The lower trims in Australia don't even get 360 camera. I don't understand what BYD is doing here. So I'm still thinking if I should wait for 2026 ATTO 2 and maybe I would get blind spot detection.  I have already booked my car tho. One of the reasons I choose ATTO 2 is also it's chassis, it has structural rigidity rated to  around 30% more than the chassis of NAAMI VIGO. I understand that VIGO offer something more at lower price but peace of mind is worth more than anything. And talking about size the dimensions of ATTO 2 and Hyundai Creta is similar. So it's not a small car at all  MG S5 In the base variant Mg doesn't offer any features, no 360 camera, just a rear camera. No ventilated seats and 175 mm ground clearance. The car is bigger than ATTO 2 but it wasn't enough.|||Pedestrians|||Nammi bhnda if you can extend your budget a little bit go for byd .

            "body": "Hi all, I’m a subscriber of WorldLink (Nepal) on a 300 Mb/s package. I recently moved and my family’s usage has dropped significantly, so I phoned them to downgrade the package to 150 or 200 Mb/s, but they told me they can’t downgrade — only upgrade or stay the same. Has anyone else experienced this?  What did you do?  Do ISPs in Nepal typically allow downgrade of packages?  Are there regulations that force ISPs to provide lower-speed options on customer request (or at least allow switch)?  Any advice on how I can enforce my rights (complaint routes, consumer forum, NTA contact, etc.)?  Thanks for any input.",

Even I don't know OP. I am sure he/she will get in because nepal ma internship pauna first hunai parxa.  Mero kati jana sathi le ni sodera hunxa to bare Bootcamp ho ki Internship nai vanera  and as I was a one of the recent one who did bootcamp last year . Bootcamp lekeni its an internship.  Ma taw bootcamp vaneko pay garna parne hola vanethe but it was free. Hybrid tiyo so I could manage my timings  And as I needed certificate for my internship for college they provided me with a internship certificate.   Best part chai they actually looked into my CV and askes relevant questions.  Its kinda competitive as many students reach out as per I know 800 students applied last year Here are some of the things you should understand to increase your chances .  Dont reach out to other developers or anyone who isnt directly in the hiring process. One of the main thing in that post Internship ma referral ko kam nai xaina and thats to the point. Paxi bujdai jada taha vayo ki as they dont get any bonus referral internship ma so they dont have to do so.  CV ma use numbers instead of full form of text ,no photos hobbies or GPA. Proshore doesnt care about those. They just want people who can show they want to learn. Mero Gpa nai dosta tiyo and Projects were also kinda average  but still I got in  because I could explain any thing they asked about my project. Drive chai huna paryo.  Always and remember always apply through Company website. Linkedin just visibility pauna use garxan derai jaso company le this included. Many dont even check those pages so always apply through companies websites and portal. Because it shows that you are actually interested and aren't mass applying. So first hunai parxa.  Yesko faeda vaneko chai Proshore uses different process to track applicant and your chances would be high.  Aja email garyo vane taw ajai ramro. This was the biggest thing that helped me the most. Ma chai apply garepaxi ni email chai garthe as Hr haru le email open rate uni haru ko manager le herxan so it helps.  And I took into into next level .

Hola you have no referral but you can write refer from linkedin or whatever platform you got the first news. I did exactly this  and body ma Refer by Linkedin lekethe and well I got a call tomorrow  had a very good laugh with hr as she said it was creative.   Kei unique nagare taw garai xa internship lai.  Post is getting long so if anyone is interested to know more let me know here and I would reply to you. Malai yo lekna taw partena as why would I do marketing of a company but I had good experience in that internship so I just wanna help my other friends jasle chai sachikkai tyo drive xa and believe to start career here as toxic companies ko list lamai xa.

Malai taw interview onsite hunxa ki vanera tension parethyo as mero clz rw tyo office alli tada xa but then got to know that interview was done through google meet.  And I joined the call Hr was on time (well already a green flag for me ) and then another senior was also on the call.  After basic convo the senior dai asked me uestion about my project. Interesting was I didnt do project on React but they didnt care becayse they say that for joining that internship you need to have drive than just knowldege of 100+ languages.  And then he started to ask me question like Why this ? Did you think of another approach ? Why or Why not ?  Now as I was confident in my project I could answer them quite easily. Then they said I was  a candidate with high probability and I woukd get response no matter my outcome.  Tespaxi I mentioned whats hybrid ? Then they say as college ko timing haru milauna garo hunxa so we dont force candidate people to come on fix time and that was such a relief as mero college alli tadai parxa and exams haru ni sochna paryo.  And the final question I asked why its called bootcamp but not internship ans they say internship vanyp vane final year ko matra auxan but this is for anyone interested wether its just student who crossed 12 or passed masters. Interested jati plus who show initiative they plan to take those.  Dar laerathyo because I thought its was a perfect fit for me. And now sigh of relief I just got an email that I was selected.

At the very least she is knowingly or unknowingly grooming kids. This is neither an isolated event nor out of context. Almost everything she has posted has a clear sexual undertone. She is trying to reach a demographic whose brains are rotted by deviant thoughts because of the constant stream of porn injected into their veins. It's attention-seeking for sure, but involving children into her bullshit is wrong. Take it up a notch and think if she was making OF content but with children next to her. It's not that making sexual content (or content in general with certain undertone) is wrong, it's wrong when you involve children into shit that they don't have the capacity to understand. Let's say she does not understand that involving children in her sexually-charged videos is wrong, is that supposed to automatically make it right? Ignorance, \"oopise, I didn't know\", \"it's not a big deal\", \"she probably doesn't know\" is not a defense.

Do you even know what does that word mean? There is something called affection and being affectionate. Timro ghar xeuma weren't there ximeki didi when you were small? Werent they affectionate with you? She didn't do a hard kiss. It was a soft kiss. For women to be close to any kids it's normal. They're emotional and affectionate towards babies. If they're not, they're mentally abnormal. I don't wanna say anything about reddit women but to my understanding most girls here in reddit already have hatred towards men or some sort of toxicity. I've never seen any healthy feminine girls in reddit from nepal. They usually join to stress out or rant or listen to rants.  ​And this thread is a perfect example of that. People are just looking for something to be outraged about.  ​Not every single interaction between an adult and a kid has to be sexualized. That's a very Western way of thinking, and everyone here is quick to import it. It's all about intent. You can clearly see from the video there was no malicious or sexual intent. It was a brief, caring gesture, exactly like an aunt or an older sister would give.  ​Besides, the context of the video itself matters. As the song and caption show, it's clearly meant to be lighthearted, a 'loke.'  People are taking a 5-second clip out of context, projecting their own dirty minds onto it, and trying to make a huge issue out of nothing. Everyone needs to get a grip and stop looking for problems where there are none.  Also, In Nepal, the level of conservativeness depends on caste/community. For brahmins even dating seems taboo but while for other it's pretty much common. Even choice of clothes, what they dress, what they reveal, everything is totally dependent on their caste. She's seems Newar and I've seen newars being way open than that.   TLDR: Video is perfectly normal as it should, it's on social media, people are projecting their own fantasies over reality. It's all about your upbringing and it reflects you didn't get enough love from your elder sisters during childhood.  PS: Even a single touch can be bad and whole bape cosplay can be beautiful.  It's all about person and intent, remember that.|||what the helllll|||nah. I thought it was mom and son tiktok|||Poor kid.

Then they use these funds to bribe politicians for getting higher post like dsp to dig , from DIG to IG and so on .

It looks like at least the kids have understood not to flaunt their stolen wealth to avoid angering the masses.  >In any ways what happened in Nepal highlights a trend I’ve discussed on here before, which is how Instagram utterly radicalizes youth heavy developing societies.  >Suddenly you as a poor but striving young man or woman have full visibility to how the elite/upper class of your country + diaspora live, but you have little access or hope of ever living the same for the most part. The impact of this on mental health, societal stability, and also fertility rates cannot be underestimated.  >Imagine going from a society with five state channels and a few cable options in the 2000s to Instagram in just five years. That’s what happened to all of South Asia + Africa + a lot of Latin America.  These guys were being exposed to the lifestyles of the baddie daughters and Chad sons of the fucktards ruling their country,  >You see their trip to Japan and London for the summer. See their parties at their elite mansions in the most posh suburbs and neighborhoods and you realize you’re just fucked and not getting there ever, your country simply does not have the mechanism to enable that for you, you’re unemployed even despite a college degree.  >**Upward mobility is like a pressure valve. Nepal never had that. The elites taxed people, slapped tariffs on imports & ignored building institutions that foster upward mobility. Instead, they assumed that sending their populace to the Middle East would be sufficient.**  >What’s surprising is how the corrupt politicians allow their kids to flaunt stolen wealth so brazenly. Kids of politicians in developing countries flaunting their extravagant lifestyles on public Instagram accounts is so foolhardy. Exposure to social media and bragging about your luxurious lifestyle risks fuelling resentment and envy.  >It's how uprisings have always been. Old bourgeoisie don't show off their wealth like those Nepali elites did. This behavior is what got both the iranian and russian noble families killed. This also happened in Mongolia earlier this year, although less dramatically. The Prime Minister had to step down due to protests that kicked off because his son was showing off his luxury holidays and clothes too much on Instagram.",

They see things online, get influenced, and start imitating behaviors they don’t really understand. It’s like skipping from grade 1 to grade 5 without learning anything in between the foundation just isn’t there.Many girls also get drawn to guys who talk like they have everything figured out confident, ambitious, “world conqueror” types. But often (not always), those guys turn out to be narcissistic and end up leaving or abandoning them. Unfortunately, most girls don’t realize it until it’s too late.So it’s important to be careful. If someone seems too good to be true, take a step back. Check their background, maybe look at their social media or talk to their close friends (without telling them). If he seems genuine, great but never rush into trust. A lot of the victims you see in those kinds of videos ended up there because they trusted the wrong person too quickly so i think this is important for every girls to not view every guys as bad guy and not trust every guy who approach like they know it all.|||nepal k*anda in big 2025? f no.|||this sub is being used to train horniest nepali ai|||Don’t go to those sites or stop watching these kind of shit bro.

What changed is a new court interpretation that looks more at who paid for what and whose name the property’s under.

Basically, it’s about clearer proof, not banning claims. Stop oversimplifying laws and for once, read past the headline before running with it.   And btw, alimony is a gender-neutral term it’s not solely “for women.” The reason most recipients are women is because many are still financially tied to their husbands.

Here's why:   * No fault divorce with no prenup laws means, at any moment, your wife can leave you and take half of your property as well as your income as alimony, without you ever doing wrong.  * Most women comes with unhealed traumas, their past relationships, their ex, how they treated them which they will show during marriage.  * Ever wanna loose faith in marriage, go to divorce court and see how heartless women are.  * Infidelity is at all time high, above 50% of women in relationship and marriage have claimed to have backup partner, and what's worse is that laws favor women cheating their husbands.  * Expectations from husbands is at all time high, they want everything but can offer nothing, (here comes salty women talking about partnerships, if relationship was partnership why is your standards 10 pages long?)  * Most women are not marriage material, I'm sorry to hurt your fragile ego but most women are just not, most are addicted to chaos, drama and uncertainty, unless you can feed them with constant drama and be okay with them micro-cheating they won't be happy and they'll accuse of you being toxic, controlling and manipulative ) * Marriage has been the easiest way to get rid of someone's terrible past, its self explanatory.  *  You're only her husband till you're useful to her, the second you're no longer useful, she'll treat you like you're worthless to her.      I've seen these happen with my own eyes to married dudes who were really good person, loved their wife to their core and in return all they got was betrayal, I'm not saying good women do not exists, they do, but the problem is every women thinks she's a good person when most aren't.   I know good women exists, is it worth to gamble everything you've achieved from hard work for a women that is almost certain to betray you?      Please don't mention \"find good women, not all women are like that\" and other excuses.",

But you need to realize where the law comes from. It doesn't seem fair that women are left without anything from their maita and their (new) ghar if they end up with nothing in case of divorce. I know they have a claim to paternal property (maita ko) but how many do you see actually getting it? In most cases, they're entitled to the half because of their contribution with the overwhelming share of homemaking role they play. Of course, the law needs updating, but you can't really do away with the provision.   2. Where are you pulling the stats from, your ass? Almost everyone has their past traumas, unhealthy attachments, mental issues and whatnot. So you're saying men are perfectly healthy and only women come in a marriage with mental and emotional baggage? That's willfully naive.  3. Ever wanna lose your faith in life? go to to Arya ghat. what kind of argument is this?   4. Again, pulling stat straight out of your ass, are you?  5. Same thing, shows your shallow understanding of the world.   6. BUllet point for the sake of it. It's an empty statement.   7. Millions who have been happily married would probably disagree.

Cruelty or violence , Desertion for 3+ years, Adultery , Mutual consent. So a wife or husband cannot just wake up one morning and file for divorce and take your property.  Nepal does not legally recognize prenup agreements . The money you earn before the marriage is all yours but the money you earn after is divided equally. There is a rule 'Property you made before marriage or inheritance you receive will remain personal property of that individual' in section 99 or 100 of muluki ain.  Alimony is based on financial condition not on gender. Both can ask for alimony if they are in bad financial condition. The courts also checks income, property before giving it. This is so that the other person does have basic necessities like food, home and clothes.  The law does not protect cheating women. It is a valid legal ground for divorce and the cheating partner legal standing is property claim is very low.    All the other thing you said Its what you think and is also not true. You do not even know the law or how  our society treats women .

I went through the whole process interview, observation class, written exam  and somehow, I actually got selected. I’m only 21, so getting hired this young felt like a big deal for me. My parents were so proud they literally cried, which honestly made me emotional too.  Yesterday was my first day there as a newly appointed teacher. Walking through those same halls where I used to be a student felt so weird  familiar, but different. What I didn’t expect was how some of my old teachers would react. A few didn’t even say hi or congratulate me. One even told a student from my neighborhood, (tero bachha ma khelne sathi, yaha teacher vaisakyo ta chaii yehiko yehi basirakh)  I laughed it off, but deep down it stung. Maybe they’re just surprised, or maybe they can’t see me as anything other than the kid I used to be. Still, it felt strange being ignored by people I once respected so much.  I thought becoming a teacher at 21 especially at the same school I grew up in . would feel amazing and easy for me. And it does, in some ways. But there’s also this quiet kind of sadness when the people who once guided you now barely acknowledge you(School ma ni dirty politics hudo rahexa).",

            "body": "So, yes, this was me the same person who got a 3.97 GPA in the SEE. I’ve always known that grades don’t define everything, and I’ll continue to believe that. At the end of the day, even though I scored 3.97 GPA, In the Kathmandu Metro Scholarship exam, I choked. I barely made it onto the second nomination list and ended up in a college that’s just “okay.” But honestly, I don’t blame the college I blame myself. There were others who got into better colleges than me, even though they had lower grades. So, I can’t say grades don’t matter, but the first term really showed me how tough things can get. I know I need to improve, and I’m determined to do so. I got an A+ in Computer Science, even though I didn’t study as much as I should have. I love Computer Science and building a lot of skills in the field. Right now, though, I’ve decided to take a break from everything every extracurricular activity, including learning JavaScript, React, and other things. I know I probably shouldn’t, but I feel like it’s necessary for now. Starting today, I’ll be locking my phone and using my laptop strictly for studying. I need to focus on my second terminal exams, and it’s time to set boundaries.If I’ve said anything wrong, I apologize. I don’t blame anyone or anything but myself, even though I studied harder than I ever have. My lack of proper note-taking has cost me. Right now, I’m just looking for advice from seniors who have gone through this and come back stronger, getting good results in the end.",

But it turned out none of it actually mattered.   Last year I gave CEE exams for MBBS ug , I couldn't get a scholarship and it felt like the end of the world especially because people expected a lot from me. I used to avoid talking to anyone.

I understand it looks a lot worse to you (and maybe your guardians) coming from 3.97 to 3.10 and your feelings are very valid. I have seen toppers with dead end jobs and barely first class pass having a stellar careers. I'm somewhat middle of the lot myself.  You've got a lot going for you, you got a 4.0 in the subject you love and sounds like you're pretty proactive with it and fairly competent too. All the B's and B+'s  could have been A's with a little discipline and bit of a good luck, and most of all hopefully this has given you a wake up call.  You got a great career and life ahead of you, so take a long breath and carry on!|||mero 3.07 aako 2 baarsa vayo, I'm still alive so this might not be the end. 😅|||From experience, just be happy you didn't fail.

And for, writing section. I think there are three section. 7,8 and 10 marks question . For 7 and 8 marks writing write 150-200 words with right content. If the content is good you will get marks And for 10 marks 250-300 is recommended. But this doesnot imply everywhere. Its totally up to teachers how they veiw .

Ignoring part of the question e.g., explaining causes but forgetting solutions. Unclear position, not showing your opinion when required. Rewriting the question instead of giving your own ideas.

Limited variety of linking words  repeating “However” or “Moreover.” Abrupt transitions  jumping between ideas with no smooth link.  Lexical Resource (Vocabulary) Repetition using the same word many times. Wrong word choice  word doesn’t fit the context. Misused “fancy words”  using dictionary words incorrectly.

Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to. If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.

I'm here for last 15years and If 40K NPR is the expenses for yourself only then ok you are living modest luxury but you say you live with your family then if you are the one earning and supporting all family expenses then I don't believe NPR 40k is making you live comfortably with families of 4 if you are renting a 2bhk flat for living. My experience in Kathmandu is, it's not the cheapest metropolis to live where 30% of your  salary goes to paying rent and rest to grocery, health,  education and EMI if you are earning around 100K NPR per month living with a 3,4 person family.|||What's yrs education qualification?

            "body": "Hello! Myself (20M), along with two of my friends and our families, visited Nepal during the Diwali holidays. We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8. Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)  (used chatgpt to refine my text)  (attached a video of sarangkot as i was mesmerised by the view)",

            "comments": "First of all, commendations for such well written and structured post, that too with all the additional info at the end. (For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".  During off season, it's easily manageable & fun because less people & no need to queue to get a selfie with some peculiar rock or a waterfall, butttttt, it's called off season for a reason, the majestic views might be compromised or not, it's a gamble.|||Dhulikhel rock view point, man why would they take you there! 🤦  Are you speaking 'Bangla'?|||Bhaktapur is the jewel 🙏|||kudos to camera work- given the health condition of your mum- i recommend you sepnd more time in chitwan- janakpur and lumbini-- may be 3 days each city- it covers pilgrimage and cultural aspect-|||Others have already suggested you some places to visit, so I just want to give you one important piece of advice. I have a relative who works as a travel agent, and he told me that many agents and shopkeepers tend to focus more on foreign tourists than on Indians, because they believe they can overcharge them easily. So, bro, be careful  there are many thugs and dishonest agents who might try to charge you extra. **Bargaining is the key.**  In almost every corner, if a hotel recommends you a place or a service, remember that the hotel usually gets a commission from it. The entire system in tourist areas like Thamel often runs on commission-based deals. So it’s always better to ask genuine locals for suggestions rather than agents pretending to be locals. In Thamel, you’ll find many such people who act friendly but are just trying to make money off tourists.  If you have Nepali friends, you can travel cheaply and safely otherwise, just be a bit cautious and smart while dealing with people. To be honest, a few uneducated people here may dislike Indian tourists, and that’s an unfortunate reality. But overall, we Nepalese are known to be **very hospitable, kind, and friendly**, and most people will treat you with respect and warmth. Just stay alert, bargain wisely, and you’ll have a wonderful time in Nepal.|||Bro, timi Darjeeling bata vayae taa, yo sabai Normal hola ni taa timro laagi taa?? 🤔|||where did u take that video bro? was it in pokhara?|||You skipped Bandipur en route Pokhara from Kathmandu.

So stunning!|||Kudos for well organized post. Go to Mustang, you can reserve scorpio or take your own vehicle. It will be worth it since you are mesmerised by Sarangkot.  Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||Have a great time here, enjoy it and after you go back to your home just think is it fair to take land of the country who provided you with such great hospitality?|||[deleted]",

I'm no expert but I  do come with a few facts . The actual knowledge I feel like I know it better than anyone here. Not bragging .  So take it as a means of education. I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it. Capitalism and communism don't antagonises each other. They coexist in a healthy modern economy.|||Ask a regular min wage worker in the US if capitalism is working for them.

            "heading": "A Night in Kathmandu — The Unexpected Bar Scam Experience",
            "body": "After completing our last destination in Kathmandu, our Nepal trip was almost coming to an end. We had planned to spend the evening shopping around local markets before heading back home.  But as luck would have it, the weather had other plans. It started raining heavily, and most of us decided to cancel the shopping plan and stay inside the bus, waiting for the rain to stop.  While we were sitting there, a Nepali guy — sort of an agent — climbed onto the bus. He started chatting with my friend, talking about dance bars, attractive girls, and fun nightlife in Kathmandu. My friends, curious and excited to explore something different, agreed to check it out. So, we went along with him from Gaushala Chowk.  ⸻  The Arrival  We reached around 7 PM. The place looked more like a small pub or lounge — dim lights, loud music, and barely anyone inside. There were just two Indian guys with a few Nepali girls, sitting at a corner table, smoking hukka and drinking.  We were a group of 12 people, so we took two tables (6 on each). I sat on the other table, while two Nepali girls from the bar joined my friends’ table. They were friendly, laughing, and talking in Hindi — chit chat, masti, jokes — sab Hindi mein.  After a few minutes, the girls said they wanted to have a drink. The same agent who brought us there told my friend, “Sir, bas 400 Rs ka juice hai.” They wrote the order on a small paper chit, took my friend’s signature, and soon two juices were served.  That’s how their system worked — write on paper, take a sign, and serve the order.  We also ordered 4 beers for ourselves. Out of 12, only 4 were drinking — the rest were just watching the dance show.  ⸻  The Show Begins  Soon, Nepali girls started dancing on Hindi songs, followed by a couple of male dancers and another girl joining the floor. The vibe felt okay at first — typical dance bar scene, music, lights, drinks.  But after the girls finished their drinks, a waiter brought a hukka pot to our table without even asking. We immediately told him to take it away. The girls got off from our table soon after that.  ⸻  Something Felt Off  After finishing the beer, me and my friend went to the washroom. There we saw those same two Indian guys who were sitting earlier — looked like North Indians (maybe Delhi or Haryana). They seemed tense, arguing with the bar staff.  Out of curiosity, I asked one of them, “Bhai kya hua?” He said, “Dekho na bhai, kuch khaya nahi, thoda piya sirf — aur bill 32,000 Nepali bana diya!”  That one line was enough to send chills down my spine.  I quickly went back to my table and told my friend what had happened. We immediately asked for our bill — but the damage was already done.  ⸻  The Shocking Bill  The bill came in Nepali currency: \t•\t4 Beers = 4000 \t•\t2 Drinks for girls = 8000 \t•\t23% Service charge = 2760 Total = 14,760 NRS (≈ 9,840 INR)  My friend was shocked. He said, “Ladies drink price to 400 bola tha,” but by then, the agent who brought us there had vanished.  There was no point arguing — the staff was large in number, and the situation didn’t look safe. Finally, we settled the bill for 9,500 INR and left the place quietly.  ⸻  What Happened Next  As we were leaving, I noticed those two Indian guys being locked in a small office, surrounded by bar staff demanding they hand over their mobiles or belongings to pay off the bill.  I felt genuinely bad for them — and guilty for not sitting at my friend’s table earlier, or checking the price list before signing that paper chit.  But at the same time, I was thankful that we escaped early — with just a 4-beer loss instead of a full-blown scam.  ⸻  The Reality Behind the Glamour  While we were stepping out, a few more Nepali guys entered, and immediately all the bar girls — including those who had been at our table — went to join them, smoking hukka and ordering drinks.  Just watching that, I could only think: “Isko to aaj 40,000–50,000 ka chuna lagne wala hai.”  ⸻  Final Thoughts  Our Nepal trip overall was beautiful — from Pokhara’s serenity to the spiritual vibe of Pashupatinath. But this one Kathmandu nightlife experience was a reminder that not everything that glitters is gold.  If you ever plan to explore nightlife in Kathmandu, be cautious: \t•\tNever sign anything you don’t understand. \t•\tAlways ask for the price upfront. \t•\tAnd if something feels shady — walk away.  This experience became a story to remember — not for the fun, but for the lesson it taught us.",

From any browser:  Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID → Find iPhone → select your Mac from All Devices and use the same options.   What each option does:  Play Sound — helps if it’s nearby.  Mark as Lost / Lock — remotely locks the Mac with a passcode and shows your message/phone number on screen. It also disables Apple Pay.  Erase Mac — wipes data. Use only if you’re sure you can’t get it back; after erasing you can no longer track it.   2) If Find My was not enabled  Tracking is much harder. Still:  Check your Google account (if Chrome was signed in) for recent device activity.  Check services you used (Dropbox, Microsoft, email) for recent logins — they sometimes reveal IP/location.  Look at any linked accounts for device lists under your Apple ID (appleid.apple.com → Devices) — it shows serial numbers and last seen info.   3) Gather identifying info (do this now)  Serial number of the Mac (found on original box/receipt, Apple invoice, or appleid.apple.com under your devices).

I used to work for a Nepali Marwari owner here in the US who had around 30 stores under one of the biggest wireless companies in the country. Dude was loaded the brand name itself brought in enough business to make him filthy rich.  But man, the micromanagement was on another level. He believed employees should always be under pressure. Two minutes late? You’d get sent home with 2–3 follow-up emails. He had cameras everywhere and watched every move if you touched your phone for even a second, you’d get an email warning.  We had to message the group chat every time we clocked in, went on break, and clocked out while doing same in an app. It was ridiculous. The managers around him were total yes-men with no real management skills or education, just doing whatever the boss said.  Most of us employees were Nepali, Indian, or other South Asians, and we just tolerated it. But eventually, they started pulling the same nonsense with the white employees constant monitoring, weird punishments, and micromanaging everything. Those folks didn’t stay quiet.  When they complained, he retaliated by transferring them to faraway locations (which, by the way, is illegal in the US I didn’t even know that back then). They ended up suing the company.  After months of legal battles, the owner lost big time. He had to settle for almost $1 million, and worst of all, he lost his business licenses. Now, he can’t make any major business decisions without approval from the state attorney.  Man had everything going for him a successful business, money, connections but greed and micromanagement destroyed it all|||Wow, the folks over at SCN really do seem to be speedrunning labor law violations.

Tech adaptations are wide and quick, but regulation and accountability are close to non-existent. There is also a steep decline in the quality and camaraderie of the developer community.   Ultimately, the possibility and goal of earning well compared to other professions is and has been the motivation for lots of young graduates getting into software/product development/design. With the field now getting more complex and overwhelming to start as a beginner, and the unstable tech-job market, it puts more pressure on newcomers to integrate.  For these kinds of companies (mostly newly started, providing services as consultants for foreign companies), there's a low probability of growing to the scale of other established tech companies in Nepal. But I'm not trying to undermine and paint a negative image here. Rather, it can be the best opportunity and environment for a motivated individual to learn and grow together with team members.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So, here are a couple of points I'd like to suggest to newcomers/students getting into this profession:  * **GROWTH**: Always keep your individual growth as the main motivator. Keep it as a core \"essence\" of being a developer. Comparing yourself with your own past self will help you a lot in the long run. Secondly, a good payslip is always great to have as a +motivator. * **Incremental & Iterative**: Anything you'll learn or want to improve upon will take time. You'll need to make mistakes/errors, analyse why and how they occurred, and do it again with the correction. * **EMPATHY**: It's what most people lack in every field, and I like to believe that people can change. An empathetic co-worker makes the working environment more pleasant just by being in the office. They will see their team members as a collaborator in their work rather than their 'juniors' or just 'people who work under their command'.  If the 'co-worker' or 'supervisor', who'll be involved with your onboarding/daily tasks, lacks any understanding of these aspects, then I believe they're not quite fit for a LEADERSHIP role, despite their years of experience and how much BETTER of a developer they are.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|||[deleted]|||\\#CompanyProfiling   noted!|||This is exactly what happens abroad lol.",

After that, you might consider upgrading the RAM. However, some older laptops have limits on how much RAM they support. For example, my old Sony Vaio can handle up to 8GB, while an older Dell model only supports a maximum of 4GB. You can easily check online by searching your laptop model to find out if it supports SSD upgrades and the maximum RAM capacity.  Also note that in Nepal the shop are asking upward of 2-3,000 NPR for each 4gb RAM module, claiming a 6-month warranty.   Since my brother studies in India, he managed to get me an 4/4gb - total of 8GB RAM for a much cheaper price, around 249 INR.

Here’s my story:  * Finished high school in 2016 with a focus on management. * Worked in tech support for a while, then did a 2 years of IT training (focused in Network and Cybersecurity) from India * After that, I worked as a Network Engineer at TCS (in India) * In 2022, I switched the field and became a Security Analyst (worked in Oracle) * Now, I’m freelancing as a Security Analyst for APAC and EMEA regions and doing well financially.  So here's the dilemma: I’m wondering if I should still go back and get a Bachelor's degree, it feels that not having a degree is dragging me behind or if my current work experience and skills are enough to keep growing in my career.  Anyone in a similar situation or have any advice? Would love to hear some honest feedback.",

He was doing well financially, working for a US-based company at 31. Now he’s 35, and honestly, age never held him back.  If you feel like getting a degree will help you in the long run, for example, if you plan to move abroad, apply for certain roles, or just want that extra credential, you can definitely manage it alongside your work. Many colleges offer morning or flexible programs like **BIT**, **BICTE**, and other IT-related degrees, so balancing both won’t be too hard.  In short, your experience already has great value, but a degree could be a good long-term investment if you can handle both without stress.|||IGNOU (ICA is their study center in Nepal) is a good institute for these kind of situations, mostly online study for those who want education + have to work.

When you cut off the expectations, you feel more happier and contained with yourself. You begin to prioritize, be selfish and learn more about people. I have the same situation. Accept that I left home 2 years back. First year was really difficult. This year also, I shifted in a new city. My aunty just bought me dry ass cookies and call it a day. I begin to hide my birthday and treat myself biryani,  ice cream and stuff. And why just birthday? I try to make my every moment special. I try to treat myself the most special person in this world. And people are getting attracted to me these days. But I don't care at all. I am just focused on my goals. People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within. And people don't understand that simple thing.🤣🤣🤣|||Yesterday it was mine birthday too but same situation.|||Happy belated birthdayyyyy|||mero nii birthday aaudai xaa wish gara la mallai on  November 4 nai birse bro . anyways dhillo bhaye Pani wish gare haii Happy birthday dai/dd|||Happy Belated Birthday <3|||Meroni thyo hijo.

At the very least she is knowingly or unknowingly grooming kids. This is neither an isolated event nor out of context. Almost everything she has posted has a clear sexual undertone. She is trying to reach a demographic whose brains are rotted by deviant thoughts because of the constant stream of porn injected into their veins. It's attention-seeking for sure, but involving children into her bullshit is wrong. Take it up a notch and think if she was making OF content but with children next to her. It's not that making sexual content (or content in general with certain undertone) is wrong, it's wrong when you involve children into shit that they don't have the capacity to understand. Let's say she does not understand that involving children in her sexually-charged videos is wrong, is that supposed to automatically make it right? Ignorance, \"oopise, I didn't know\", \"it's not a big deal\", \"she probably doesn't know\" is not a defense.

Do you even know what does that word mean? There is something called affection and being affectionate. Timro ghar xeuma weren't there ximeki didi when you were small? Werent they affectionate with you? She didn't do a hard kiss. It was a soft kiss. For women to be close to any kids it's normal. They're emotional and affectionate towards babies. If they're not, they're mentally abnormal. I don't wanna say anything about reddit women but to my understanding most girls here in reddit already have hatred towards men or some sort of toxicity. I've never seen any healthy feminine girls in reddit from nepal. They usually join to stress out or rant or listen to rants.  ​And this thread is a perfect example of that. People are just looking for something to be outraged about.  ​Not every single interaction between an adult and a kid has to be sexualized. That's a very Western way of thinking, and everyone here is quick to import it. It's all about intent. You can clearly see from the video there was no malicious or sexual intent. It was a brief, caring gesture, exactly like an aunt or an older sister would give.  ​Besides, the context of the video itself matters. As the song and caption show, it's clearly meant to be lighthearted, a 'loke.'  People are taking a 5-second clip out of context, projecting their own dirty minds onto it, and trying to make a huge issue out of nothing. Everyone needs to get a grip and stop looking for problems where there are none.  Also, In Nepal, the level of conservativeness depends on caste/community. For brahmins even dating seems taboo but while for other it's pretty much common. Even choice of clothes, what they dress, what they reveal, everything is totally dependent on their caste. She's seems Newar and I've seen newars being way open than that.   TLDR: Video is perfectly normal as it should, it's on social media, people are projecting their own fantasies over reality. It's all about your upbringing and it reflects you didn't get enough love from your elder sisters during childhood.  PS: Even a single touch can be bad and whole bape cosplay can be beautiful.  It's all about person and intent, remember that.|||what the helllll|||nah. I thought it was mom and son tiktok|||Poor kid.

No, yet most nations frown or ban them from being raised for slaughter.  The same is true here. Cows are important part of their religious or cultural identity for most Nepalese people.

No, frankly I don't care as long as it does not impact humans or the species themselves on a conservation scale.  But I don't think this can or should be implemented nation wide.

We are Hindu majority. Nepalese of all religion are already normalized to not consuming beef, this will start a conflict amongst our own majority. Us not consuming beef has kept Muslims and Christians in low numbers- they are major consumers of beef and send missionaries everywhere to increase their numbers. If there are two similarly sized groups with different people- that will create political conflict and add to our issues. We already see this play out in western countries- they have major political issues around Muslims and recently Indians (who they associate with Hinduism which they've already begun to hate in Canada, and if you a brown Nepali- you are Indian to them) Don't make moves that will drive your own group's numbers low. We have to keep the status quo in regards to issues like this.   Not eating cow has not created any issue that is worth our attention. Focus on tackling actual issues like further eradicating this baun, chettri nonsense which is the bane of Hinduism- we can and are doing it while keeping our culture, traditions and identity.|||just say chamal ko bora ta paako this , visa ni paaulas ni and move on|||So much for a secular nation|||lets eat beef guys",

She is also the daughter of Nischal Nath Pandey, who served as a government employee during ramesh nath pandey’s long ministerial run. Look at this damn lifestyle. How is it possible to afford all of this when the family has nothing except civil service for the past 50 years?  Supriya Bohora, granddaughter of Deepak Bohora, former member of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and the House of Representatives, has recently come under the spotlight. Deepak Bohora was known for his strong hand in the Panchayat system and his unwavering support for the monarchy. His political journey is remembered not only for his allegiance to authoritarian structures but also for allegations of corruption. One of the most prominent accusations linked to Deepak Bohora is the illegal consumption of land where the Fun Park ice rink in Bhadrakali Road now stands. What was once a symbol of political maneuvering and alleged misappropriation of public assets is now being flaunted by his granddaughter as a mark of achievement, raising questions about how the spoils of corruption are normalized across generations.  Anusandhan khai ta comrade? Granddaughter living in europe to protect all the money stored in swiss bank. EXPOSE THEM ALL!  Most corrupted ones are the generals from police special dsp and upwards.👮 I have seen them using massive funds to get their sons n daughters abroad or in prestigious schools by paying hefty fees. their home looks like that of a king , literally narayanhiti jastai same and their sons n daughters are living the life of luxuries carrying iphones and designer dresses and bags . Actually what these officer do is they heavily launder money and budgets which comes to their department . They practice “milijuli khane” . They also take funds from criminals to manage cases. Then they use these funds to bribe politicians for getting higher post like dsp to dig , from DIG to IG and so on . They conduct massive weddings and ceremonies spending crore of rupees. this is same with army generals as well.  `-`  **TLDR - REGISTER AND CONVINCE YOUR FRIENDS, COUSINS IF THEY STILL HAVE NOT MADE VOTER ID**  Read an interesting blog on this.

Something previous generations never witnessed.  >The new rich have never gone through a revolution so they don't understand not to flaunt their wealth like the old bourgeoisie who have witnessed multiple revolutions throughout history. It's ironic that the Maoists instigated a revolution yet the children of said Maoists are now living the luxurious lives posting everything not knowing whats simmering in society. It looks like at least the kids have understood not to flaunt their stolen wealth to avoid angering the masses.  >In any ways what happened in Nepal highlights a trend I’ve discussed on here before, which is how Instagram utterly radicalizes youth heavy developing societies.  >Suddenly you as a poor but striving young man or woman have full visibility to how the elite/upper class of your country + diaspora live, but you have little access or hope of ever living the same for the most part. The impact of this on mental health, societal stability, and also fertility rates cannot be underestimated.  >Imagine going from a society with five state channels and a few cable options in the 2000s to Instagram in just five years. That’s what happened to all of South Asia + Africa + a lot of Latin America.  These guys were being exposed to the lifestyles of the baddie daughters and Chad sons of the fucktards ruling their country,  >You see their trip to Japan and London for the summer. See their parties at their elite mansions in the most posh suburbs and neighborhoods and you realize you’re just fucked and not getting there ever, your country simply does not have the mechanism to enable that for you, you’re unemployed even despite a college degree.  >**Upward mobility is like a pressure valve. Nepal never had that. The elites taxed people, slapped tariffs on imports & ignored building institutions that foster upward mobility. Instead, they assumed that sending their populace to the Middle East would be sufficient.**  >What’s surprising is how the corrupt politicians allow their kids to flaunt stolen wealth so brazenly. Kids of politicians in developing countries flaunting their extravagant lifestyles on public Instagram accounts is so foolhardy. Exposure to social media and bragging about your luxurious lifestyle risks fuelling resentment and envy.  >It's how uprisings have always been. Old bourgeoisie don't show off their wealth like those Nepali elites did. This behavior is what got both the iranian and russian noble families killed. This also happened in Mongolia earlier this year, although less dramatically. The Prime Minister had to step down due to protests that kicked off because his son was showing off his luxury holidays and clothes too much on Instagram.",

Get up, have a goal and be driven. However, do not lie, cheat, steal or ask for money. If you are kind - you will see kindness shown back.   Of the 3 boys - one is getting deported. IRCC is the least of your worries. Its the boarder patrol services you should be concerned about if you try anything illegal - even a small one once to a kind Canadain.   Im glad I didnt turn my back but im also glad that somes awareness is bringing to light.    P.s.

People romanticize going abroad, but they don’t realize it’s a full reset! Your last name, your family status, your struggles back home, none of it matters. What counts is how disciplined and valuable you are in that new system.  I’d add, learn to manage your emotions too. It’s not just physical or financial survival — it’s mental. You’ll feel lonely, rejected, homesick, but those who turn that into fuel grow faster than anyone else. Also, you don’t have to be the smartest person, but be reliable. The world respects consistency.|||J pani overdramatic banauna parni hau Nepali harulai..

At the end of the day, even though I scored 3.97 GPA, In the Kathmandu Metro Scholarship exam, I choked. I barely made it onto the second nomination list and ended up in a college that’s just “okay.” But honestly, I don’t blame the college I blame myself. There were others who got into better colleges than me, even though they had lower grades. So, I can’t say grades don’t matter, but the first term really showed me how tough things can get. I know I need to improve, and I’m determined to do so. I got an A+ in Computer Science, even though I didn’t study as much as I should have. I love Computer Science and building a lot of skills in the field. Right now, though, I’ve decided to take a break from everything every extracurricular activity, including learning JavaScript, React, and other things. I know I probably shouldn’t, but I feel like it’s necessary for now. Starting today, I’ll be locking my phone and using my laptop strictly for studying. I need to focus on my second terminal exams, and it’s time to set boundaries.If I’ve said anything wrong, I apologize. I don’t blame anyone or anything but myself, even though I studied harder than I ever have. My lack of proper note-taking has cost me. Right now, I’m just looking for advice from seniors who have gone through this and come back stronger, getting good results in the end.",

Reasoning: ABCD is a parallelogram (from the figure). Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. That means the diagonal AC and BD intersect each other at point P such that AP = PC and BP = PD. Now, in the parallelogram, Triangles △APD and △BPQ are on the same base PD (or same diagonal portion) and they lie between the same parallel lines AD and BC. Hence, Area of △APD = Area of △BPQ.|||Trauma, dhattt|||ABD and ABQ has same area. now ABP is common triangle in both of them. Thus remaining halves i.e sodheko duita triangles should have same area 🔥😉",

            "heading": "Time-Travelling to the 90s with Notepad 😭",
            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I’ve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don’t know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

Actually Nepal despite everything and has had excellent metrics when it comes to nature and biodiversity conservation.|||Folks who grew up in the 90s may remember efforts put into forest conservation through media. Maha Jodi ko BannPale. Impressionable ads like an old woman carrying doko vari ko daura and wondering “Aja lai ta taryo voli k garne?” We have done a lot in the field of forest and wildlife conservation. Amidst all the negative things lets commend ourselves on this for once. Hamro Community based Forest Preservation program (Samudayik Bann) is a leading example in the world.|||\"Hariyo ban Nepal ko dhan\" massive initiative is Main reason. This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it. You can hear the news for development work and of NEA cannot cut down the trees easily, yup that is because of same strong protective law.|||It’s because of movement of people and reliance on gas, concrete instead of timber.|||No , it’s a result of migration of people from hills to concentrated cities and Terai .

And yet the old generation say that ‘sabai forest fadisakyo’ or say ‘paila kati hariyali thiyo’. However I’d say it needs more effort and forest fire is a serious issue.|||Here's an in-depth international piece on it from NZ's Māori television:   https://www.teaonews.co.nz/2023/04/22/re-greening-a-country-the-story-of-nepals-community-forests/|||Kehi Haina aajkal maanxe haru hills xodera flat Tira migration vaye, gas maa reliant vaye , Gai goru, bhaisi paalna xode.

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts. So, yeah definitely a result of afforestation but there is more to this and would be a great topic to delve deep into.|||what about terai ko char koshe jhadi?|||It’s meant to highlight the loss of ice and glaciers.

No confirmed sighting.   No verified proof of life.   No closure.      Two years have passed; two years of waiting, diplomatic efforts, and hope refusing to fade.      Today, reports have emerged suggesting he may no longer be alive.   But even now, there is no definitive evidence; only assessments, assumptions, and silence.      His family still holds on.   Nepal still waits.   And many of us wonder: how different might things have been?      If Bipin were from a more powerful nation, would the world have moved faster?   If he held a different passport, would there be answers by now?   If every life were valued equal, would this post even need to exist?      Bipin’s story is not just one of tragedy.   It is a reflection of how quiet lives are often overlooked,   how conflict steals not just people, but peace itself.      We continue to hope.   We continue to speak.   Because silence is not an option.",

They called the “earn and learn” program an internship, likely just to bypass foreign employment laws. In reality, it was pure exploitation. From what I’ve read, students were made to work five days a week in questionable conditions and study only one. I wouldn’t be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.  I just hope this changes with the new government.|||i thought hamas was fighting gaza right after they kill him i think they just sick isreal PM both are shit they just want control people.. fucking hate hamas|||Sad|||I'm Israeli, sadly his DNA was diagnosed and was believed to die in the first months of the war R.I.P Bipin|||Vayo vayo pugyo,  He is dead, confirmed by Israel and hamas both.

They outsource their jobs to poorer countries where people are happy to accept a meager $2800/month, whereas a domestic worker in the US would have to be paid at least double that.

Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to. If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.

Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)  (used chatgpt to refine my text)  (attached a video of sarangkot as i was mesmerised by the view)",

            "comments": "First of all, commendations for such well written and structured post, that too with all the additional info at the end. (For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".  During off season, it's easily manageable & fun because less people & no need to queue to get a selfie with some peculiar rock or a waterfall, butttttt, it's called off season for a reason, the majestic views might be compromised or not, it's a gamble.|||Dhulikhel rock view point, man why would they take you there! 🤦  Are you speaking 'Bangla'?|||Bhaktapur is the jewel 🙏|||kudos to camera work- given the health condition of your mum- i recommend you sepnd more time in chitwan- janakpur and lumbini-- may be 3 days each city- it covers pilgrimage and cultural aspect-|||Others have already suggested you some places to visit, so I just want to give you one important piece of advice. I have a relative who works as a travel agent, and he told me that many agents and shopkeepers tend to focus more on foreign tourists than on Indians, because they believe they can overcharge them easily. So, bro, be careful  there are many thugs and dishonest agents who might try to charge you extra. **Bargaining is the key.**  In almost every corner, if a hotel recommends you a place or a service, remember that the hotel usually gets a commission from it. The entire system in tourist areas like Thamel often runs on commission-based deals. So it’s always better to ask genuine locals for suggestions rather than agents pretending to be locals. In Thamel, you’ll find many such people who act friendly but are just trying to make money off tourists.  If you have Nepali friends, you can travel cheaply and safely otherwise, just be a bit cautious and smart while dealing with people. To be honest, a few uneducated people here may dislike Indian tourists, and that’s an unfortunate reality. But overall, we Nepalese are known to be **very hospitable, kind, and friendly**, and most people will treat you with respect and warmth. Just stay alert, bargain wisely, and you’ll have a wonderful time in Nepal.|||Bro, timi Darjeeling bata vayae taa, yo sabai Normal hola ni taa timro laagi taa?? 🤔|||where did u take that video bro? was it in pokhara?|||You skipped Bandipur en route Pokhara from Kathmandu.

Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||Have a great time here, enjoy it and after you go back to your home just think is it fair to take land of the country who provided you with such great hospitality?|||[deleted]",

While most countries have been struggling with deforestation, Nepal somehow managed to reverse the trend.  A few key reasons:  * **Community Forestry Program** — locals manage and protect their own forests instead of the central government. * **Rural-Urban Migration** — many farmlands were abandoned as people moved to cities or abroad for work, letting nature reclaim them. * **Alternative Energy** — more use of biogas and LPG means less dependence on firewood. * **Reforestation & Conservation** — national parks, reserves, and local planting drives helped too.  Now nearly **45% of Nepal’s total land** is covered by forests — up from around **25% in the early 1990s**.  Pretty wild, right?   What do you think — is community-led management the real key here, or did urban migration play a bigger role?

I'm no expert but I  do come with a few facts . The actual knowledge I feel like I know it better than anyone here. Not bragging .  So take it as a means of education. I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it.

            "heading": "A Night in Kathmandu — The Unexpected Bar Scam Experience",
            "body": "After completing our last destination in Kathmandu, our Nepal trip was almost coming to an end. We had planned to spend the evening shopping around local markets before heading back home.  But as luck would have it, the weather had other plans. It started raining heavily, and most of us decided to cancel the shopping plan and stay inside the bus, waiting for the rain to stop.  While we were sitting there, a Nepali guy — sort of an agent — climbed onto the bus. He started chatting with my friend, talking about dance bars, attractive girls, and fun nightlife in Kathmandu. My friends, curious and excited to explore something different, agreed to check it out. So, we went along with him from Gaushala Chowk.  ⸻  The Arrival  We reached around 7 PM. The place looked more like a small pub or lounge — dim lights, loud music, and barely anyone inside. There were just two Indian guys with a few Nepali girls, sitting at a corner table, smoking hukka and drinking.  We were a group of 12 people, so we took two tables (6 on each). I sat on the other table, while two Nepali girls from the bar joined my friends’ table. They were friendly, laughing, and talking in Hindi — chit chat, masti, jokes — sab Hindi mein.  After a few minutes, the girls said they wanted to have a drink. The same agent who brought us there told my friend, “Sir, bas 400 Rs ka juice hai.” They wrote the order on a small paper chit, took my friend’s signature, and soon two juices were served.  That’s how their system worked — write on paper, take a sign, and serve the order.  We also ordered 4 beers for ourselves. Out of 12, only 4 were drinking — the rest were just watching the dance show.  ⸻  The Show Begins  Soon, Nepali girls started dancing on Hindi songs, followed by a couple of male dancers and another girl joining the floor. The vibe felt okay at first — typical dance bar scene, music, lights, drinks.  But after the girls finished their drinks, a waiter brought a hukka pot to our table without even asking. We immediately told him to take it away. The girls got off from our table soon after that.  ⸻  Something Felt Off  After finishing the beer, me and my friend went to the washroom. There we saw those same two Indian guys who were sitting earlier — looked like North Indians (maybe Delhi or Haryana). They seemed tense, arguing with the bar staff.  Out of curiosity, I asked one of them, “Bhai kya hua?” He said, “Dekho na bhai, kuch khaya nahi, thoda piya sirf — aur bill 32,000 Nepali bana diya!”  That one line was enough to send chills down my spine.  I quickly went back to my table and told my friend what had happened. We immediately asked for our bill — but the damage was already done.  ⸻  The Shocking Bill  The bill came in Nepali currency: \t•\t4 Beers = 4000 \t•\t2 Drinks for girls = 8000 \t•\t23% Service charge = 2760 Total = 14,760 NRS (≈ 9,840 INR)  My friend was shocked. He said, “Ladies drink price to 400 bola tha,” but by then, the agent who brought us there had vanished.  There was no point arguing — the staff was large in number, and the situation didn’t look safe. Finally, we settled the bill for 9,500 INR and left the place quietly.  ⸻  What Happened Next  As we were leaving, I noticed those two Indian guys being locked in a small office, surrounded by bar staff demanding they hand over their mobiles or belongings to pay off the bill.  I felt genuinely bad for them — and guilty for not sitting at my friend’s table earlier, or checking the price list before signing that paper chit.  But at the same time, I was thankful that we escaped early — with just a 4-beer loss instead of a full-blown scam.  ⸻  The Reality Behind the Glamour  While we were stepping out, a few more Nepali guys entered, and immediately all the bar girls — including those who had been at our table — went to join them, smoking hukka and ordering drinks.  Just watching that, I could only think: “Isko to aaj 40,000–50,000 ka chuna lagne wala hai.”  ⸻  Final Thoughts  Our Nepal trip overall was beautiful — from Pokhara’s serenity to the spiritual vibe of Pashupatinath. But this one Kathmandu nightlife experience was a reminder that not everything that glitters is gold.  If you ever plan to explore nightlife in Kathmandu, be cautious: \t•\tNever sign anything you don’t understand. \t•\tAlways ask for the price upfront. \t•\tAnd if something feels shady — walk away.  This experience became a story to remember — not for the fun, but for the lesson it taught us.",

            "body": "So I’ve been following Harka Sampang for a while — and something always feels off. The guy *never* talks about KP Oli, UML’s corruption, or even the brutal killing of protesting students. Not a single strong word.  But the moment it’s about Balen or the current government, he suddenly becomes super active — posting videos, making speeches, calling everyone out. Like, where was all this energy when students were being beaten or when Oli was selling out the country’s interests?  It’s like he selectively targets whoever’s in power now, just to look “anti-establishment,” while conveniently staying silent about the past. If he really cared about truth and justice, he’d call out *all* sides — not just pick easy targets for clout.  Feels like he’s slowly turning into just another political opportunist hiding behind the “independent” tag.",

My rabbit was terrified and yesterday morning, on Laxmi Pujamy mom called crying, he was gone. The continuous sound of fireworks had stressed him so much that his little heart couldn’t take it anymore. He died scared and alone, and I wasn’t even there to hold him. I was supposed to be home in just 1.5 months. I kept imagining how happy he’d be when he’d see me again.   He wasn’t just a pet. He was family, my little brother. I don’t have siblings, and he filled that space in my life with his sweet energy and unconditional love. I can’t describe the guilt and pain I feel. I keep imagining him hiding in fear, shaking every time another pataka went off, and I hate that I couldn’t be there for me. My lil bro didn’t deserve this. None of them do.",

Try to dont play such scenarios in your head, I know its hard..  Yes, many animals experience severe distress due to fireworks and firecrackers, cows, dogs, cats etc. The smaller the animal, stronger the distress.   You can check statistics over the world, its a real issue. We humans dont respect the native habitants (animals) and this is just one of examples. Like, is the loud sound more important than a divine life (as all life is divine)?  Can that simbolism be expressed in a better way, by singing, instruments etc...  Luckily, as the world is slowly becoming aware of this, so the regulations starts to exist. In many countries there are now regulations that prohibit fireworks and firecrackers, exactly because of this reason (not to mention distress to some humans that exist too..).|||I am so so sorry.

From your iPhone / iPad:  Open Find My → Devices → tap your Mac.  Options: Play Sound, Directions (if location available), Mark as Lost (Lock), Erase This Device.   From any browser:  Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID → Find iPhone → select your Mac from All Devices and use the same options.   What each option does:  Play Sound — helps if it’s nearby.  Mark as Lost / Lock — remotely locks the Mac with a passcode and shows your message/phone number on screen. It also disables Apple Pay.  Erase Mac — wipes data. Use only if you’re sure you can’t get it back; after erasing you can no longer track it.   2) If Find My was not enabled  Tracking is much harder. Still:  Check your Google account (if Chrome was signed in) for recent device activity.  Check services you used (Dropbox, Microsoft, email) for recent logins — they sometimes reveal IP/location.  Look at any linked accounts for device lists under your Apple ID (appleid.apple.com → Devices) — it shows serial numbers and last seen info.   3) Gather identifying info (do this now)  Serial number of the Mac (found on original box/receipt, Apple invoice, or appleid.apple.com under your devices).

I used to work for a Nepali Marwari owner here in the US who had around 30 stores under one of the biggest wireless companies in the country. Dude was loaded the brand name itself brought in enough business to make him filthy rich.  But man, the micromanagement was on another level. He believed employees should always be under pressure. Two minutes late? You’d get sent home with 2–3 follow-up emails. He had cameras everywhere and watched every move if you touched your phone for even a second, you’d get an email warning.  We had to message the group chat every time we clocked in, went on break, and clocked out while doing same in an app. It was ridiculous. The managers around him were total yes-men with no real management skills or education, just doing whatever the boss said.  Most of us employees were Nepali, Indian, or other South Asians, and we just tolerated it. But eventually, they started pulling the same nonsense with the white employees constant monitoring, weird punishments, and micromanaging everything. Those folks didn’t stay quiet.  When they complained, he retaliated by transferring them to faraway locations (which, by the way, is illegal in the US I didn’t even know that back then). They ended up suing the company.  After months of legal battles, the owner lost big time. He had to settle for almost $1 million, and worst of all, he lost his business licenses. Now, he can’t make any major business decisions without approval from the state attorney.  Man had everything going for him a successful business, money, connections but greed and micromanagement destroyed it all|||Wow, the folks over at SCN really do seem to be speedrunning labor law violations.

Tech adaptations are wide and quick, but regulation and accountability are close to non-existent. There is also a steep decline in the quality and camaraderie of the developer community.   Ultimately, the possibility and goal of earning well compared to other professions is and has been the motivation for lots of young graduates getting into software/product development/design. With the field now getting more complex and overwhelming to start as a beginner, and the unstable tech-job market, it puts more pressure on newcomers to integrate.  For these kinds of companies (mostly newly started, providing services as consultants for foreign companies), there's a low probability of growing to the scale of other established tech companies in Nepal. But I'm not trying to undermine and paint a negative image here. Rather, it can be the best opportunity and environment for a motivated individual to learn and grow together with team members.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So, here are a couple of points I'd like to suggest to newcomers/students getting into this profession:  * **GROWTH**: Always keep your individual growth as the main motivator. Keep it as a core \"essence\" of being a developer. Comparing yourself with your own past self will help you a lot in the long run. Secondly, a good payslip is always great to have as a +motivator. * **Incremental & Iterative**: Anything you'll learn or want to improve upon will take time. You'll need to make mistakes/errors, analyse why and how they occurred, and do it again with the correction. * **EMPATHY**: It's what most people lack in every field, and I like to believe that people can change. An empathetic co-worker makes the working environment more pleasant just by being in the office. They will see their team members as a collaborator in their work rather than their 'juniors' or just 'people who work under their command'.  If the 'co-worker' or 'supervisor', who'll be involved with your onboarding/daily tasks, lacks any understanding of these aspects, then I believe they're not quite fit for a LEADERSHIP role, despite their years of experience and how much BETTER of a developer they are.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|||[deleted]|||\\#CompanyProfiling   noted!|||This is exactly what happens abroad lol.",

First of all, India has a 1bn population. Given the hostility between the US and china, most of the big tech have their satellite offices in India, and that gets so much of techs from India. Because, people see scope in tech, many Indians go for BTech, CS.  But - how much of tech innovation do you see from India vs China or the US?  There was a time once when you could hire 5 people in India with a budget for 1 in the US. Now that is slowly going away, so many of the tech companies are now expanding in Africa and Latin America.|||Lol I work with Indians in a US company, don't get me wrong there are a lot of quality indians software engineers but this premise about Indians being the only one who are crazy tech talented is a joke, if that was the case we'd see some innovative indian tech company comparable to the ones from China/US.|||'America Kya keheta tha' ?|||Bill Gates also said he would rather hire lazy people to his company because they would find an easier way to do difficult task.|||I once interned at one of the FAANG (now MAANG) companies, and from my experience, I can say without a doubt that Indians play a massive role in the top American tech firms. They’ve become an inseparable part of the U.S. IT industry a huge portion of the real engineering work is done by them. These companies rely heavily on Indian talent, and because of that, Indian Americans have grown to become quite influential, even in U.S. politics. It’s no surprise that they’re now the highest-earning ethnic group in the entire country.  I remember one senior engineer I worked with a German once told me, *“Indian Americans are the 21st-century Jews of America.”* That line stuck with me.  But it does make you wonder if Indians are so talented, why isn’t India as developed as the U.S.? The main issue is the lack of a strong support system and consistent government backing for innovation and startups. For a long time, India didn’t create the right environment to make full use of its skilled people.  Now, about whether India is catching up to China in tech not quite yet. Chinese engineers are incredibly skilled, and China still has a big edge in infrastructure, funding, and startup ecosystems. Right now, India sits at number three, behind the U.S. and China, in the global tech scene. But give it another 20–25 years, and India could very well take the second spot, right after China.  That said, India’s future looks bright. The liberalization policies and the country’s strong emphasis on education have built a solid foundation. Institutions like the IITs, AIIMS, and IIMs have produced some of the best minds in engineering, medicine, and business. These people are driving not just India’s growth but also global innovation. With an open economy, a thriving startup culture, and millions of ambitious young people, India is steadily moving toward becoming one of the leading technology and economic powers of the world behind China.|||Is there another Microsoft in China though?|||India chai haina China le chai banauxa arko MS    They are good at creating and that works too   India on other hand will send huge skilled resources tara banauna chai sakdaina hai   India ko IT market thulo xa    ani China ko le ta duniya nai chalya xa hai   reminded of some so called nepali techfluencers haru    Nepal lai IT hub banayera tech revolution lyaune    some dude from NASIT (shitty association of IT comanies of Nepal)|||Well Indians are great at tech that's a fact we can't deny that.

The reality is that India lacks internet giants, nor does it have widely used software applications. Even the major software applications developed domestically are from the US. While you could argue that Indians participated in the development of these applications, it's still not Indian software. This isn't entirely bad, however. The internet industry is dominated by only two major players: the US and China. Even Europe and Japan have seen their internet industries and talent drained by the US. For example, in the electric vehicle industry, Chinese electric vehicle companies are internet giants, while German electric vehicle companies are industrial giants. Germany's lack of internet talent forces it to partner with Chinese companies for technology, whereas 30 years ago, China partnered with German automakers due to a lack of technology. Before his death, Henry Kissinger expressed concern about Europe's extreme lack of long-term strategic planning. Many Europeans still fail to grasp this reality, their thinking still mired in outdated Cold War thinking, which sees a Soviet Union as the scapegoat for all their mistakes. India and many other countries haven't fared any better than Europe.|||Bro been working with Indians for last 2 years. 90% of them are \"Kaam chorr\".|||1.

But we studied together at NITR, India.  The process in India itself is top, so it's real hard to get recruited from Nepalese colleges.|||Applying to FAANG from India is not worth it bro. First thing the competition is huge and second thing the pay for FAANG position in India is like what at max 1.5 to 2 Crore if you get lucky. And I seriously believe that the stress to compensation is not worth it.  If it was in the case of USA especially in the bay area, then I would say the grind was worth it because they pay ridiculously high, like even after all the tax cuts and expenses you can save around 100-150k easily in a year given your compensation is 350-400k USD per year and the position is at the bay area.  But competition is tough there too, you need PhDs and all.  But I think it's still better than India. In India nowadays almost like minimum 10 lakhs students have already mugged up at least 300-400 leetcode questions so, chances are slim there.  My advice is target for such positions where the competition is low, grind there for 3-4 years and apply as independent contractors for remote position, you can easily make above 100k if you are sharp.  Then move to Romania applying a digital nomad visa and pay only about flat 10-11% tax for your 100k plus income. Cost of living is also affordable in Romania, soon to be included into schengen and of course after 5 years apply for PR, get the passport and travel freely for vacation. (It's passport is in top ten strongest list)  And this is the most achievable goal and path for a Nepali IT specialist. Even if you get 60k USD remote job in Nepal, it's not worth it because the progressive tax system will make the effective tax to around 30-33% and all your tax for what? Into the belly of corrupt politicians.  Actually it's a bad idea to live in Nepal, the tax is too much. You pay 25% tax and 13% vat for almost everything. Forget about buying vehicles, the added cost is like price of Vehicle(100%) and 80% flat tax + 13% vat + 10-25% profit margin + extraa whatever. You pay more than double for any vehicles.

But a lot of women don't even want that. So arranged marriage is a compromise between women who don't wanna get involved in the workforce and the men OP described.

Not referring to girls who work hard, has qualifications, they can find anyone, still they wouldnt marry any man with low income than her.|||opposite is true as well lol|||Men and women need to learn dating skills and upgrade their conversation skills. Don’t just depend on the one expecting that he or she will do everything for her/him just because they are interested. Effort needs to be applied from both sides. All i see is only men applying effort and women not giving much in return (most cases not mutual)|||All animals on earth find their partner by their own except humans (nepali,indian).|||Not every girl is like you or some TikTok influencer kind. Nepal has more women than men and many of girls are desperate to marry to any men. Also many men are abroad in gulfs and tend to return not very soon. So girls in villagers are getting short of mens so your opinion is laughable|||True af. Baau aama le milaidi halchan bhanera matra ho natra adhi Kta haru single nai marthe🤣|||For this are we to bame the social conditioning, the patriarchy, the education system, the parenting or just blame the male gender. It's not just a male flaw the problem runs deeper it's deep rooted in our culture and society. Maybe we're a flawed society. So let's create a better society where men aren't like this? But this doesn't mean we should use society as an excuse to avoid personal accountability. Every man is still responsible for unlearning harmful behavior and trying to be a better person. But we also can’t ignore why so many men think and act this way in the first place.|||Don't worry homies, it ain't just you. I'm an Indian, and the same post with just the nation changed from nepal to india has also been circulating in our subs. And it's not just us, it's other subs too.

Also, I can also see increase in bad marriages especially in lower/middle class. Why? Weak financial backgrounds being from lower/middle, and more lovestruck fools getting into marriage.|||Yea Arrange marriage is shit. You will get trap for unnecessary drama both for men as well as women and never ending fight. Better is to not marry than marry someone whom you don't like.|||There are more men than women. Also, if men don't get married, women automatically don't get married too.|||This is why I believe in dowry concept it might sound rude but this is what it is. Since, most of the people have their past life and multiple relationships even before marriage these days. And that relation sometimes seems so so deeply rooted that it becomes difficult to forget. Some are involved in extramarital affairs as well. Then there's bitterness in the present married life and relations with family of husband. Now assume if her husband was single till the marriage for a perfect wife but what he got? Nothing but mental tension afterwards.   The psychological impact a normal people can't even bear. And sometimes girls even planned to marry a rich guy just for money and then divorce and get alimony which she'll spend with her lover. Sometimes, she even plans to kill her husband to get out of that thing. This is freaking crazy how people are thinking this way. I'm not justifying that she's the only culprit here but also her ex cum present hidden lover is equally involved.   Now in this situation it's better to live unmarried or take a grand amount as collateral if you are doing an arranged marriage. So that it will be easier for alimony.   You might call me bias but the thing is different. If we alternate the situation like a groom will have to leave his home and settle with bride forever, and if alimony should be paid by the bride after getting divorced, yeah a groom should have to give dowry as the collateral.   Fun fact: Love marriages crash faster than arranged ones. It’s like 1 v 1 versus many v many, so too many players in the latter provide team support 😅 during clashes. Honestly, better to stay single… or marry someone who doesn’t try to wrestle your ego.      Nepal and India(depending upon urbanization)   Arranged marriage divorce rate: <5%  Love marriage divorce rate: 35-50%|||You can't blame just men on this. Our society did not evolve to interact with women in that way. There were already a lot of segregation on men an women. Again, nothing could help if the person does not have charm.|||I hate gender war , just get some fuckin job.|||aafno teen and adult life ma matra ho...KT haru purai delusional hunchan like they can pull anyone vanera ..yes they can pull ( only to date ) but the reality is KTA lai vanda KT haru lai marriage ekdam garo parcha because they don't want to date average MEN always looking for above their level but the competition is too high.

Most men would rather call it \"hating on men\" or talk badly about women instead of rising to the occassion and actually trying to do and be better. It's not just a Nepal thing, though. The same thing is happening everywhere. Marriage isn't a means for money or safety anymore as it used to be. Women now are independent and can handle their own finances It's not even about social standing anymore, the patriarchal lines of hierarchy are slowly but surely getting blurred.   Nowadays, marriage is about partnership, trust, companionship, love and respect. Most men haven't understood that and would rather blame women as being \"gold diggers\" than realize that it's not the money (or the lack thereof) that influences the attitudes of women towards them.  Remember that we have an ever increasing **male loneliness epidemic** and it's not for no reason.|||The reason behind me not knowing how to approach woman is because of their parents who were mostly arrangely married and never allowed/encouraged their sons to do so|||Mate who gives a shit how people marry? let em marry arranged or by falling in love, as long as both parties consent who cares how good or bad they are at getting in a relationship|||Haha kta le matra bihe garne hora both party share equal part in this|||Girl has a lot of priorities.

I begin to hide my birthday and treat myself biryani,  ice cream and stuff. And why just birthday? I try to make my every moment special. I try to treat myself the most special person in this world. And people are getting attracted to me these days. But I don't care at all. I am just focused on my goals. People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within. And people don't understand that simple thing.🤣🤣🤣|||Yesterday it was mine birthday too but same situation.|||Happy belated birthdayyyyy|||mero nii birthday aaudai xaa wish gara la mallai on  November 4 nai birse bro . anyways dhillo bhaye Pani wish gare haii Happy birthday dai/dd|||Happy Belated Birthday <3|||Meroni thyo hijo.

But let me remind you some cases : Maina Sunuwar, Rabi Lammichanne and other where everyone praised the court and claimed justice stood.Even you might know many of the cases  What I find uncomfortably troubling is that  People have been shifting their narrative about the court in whatever comforts them. Literally what Rabi did : When big politicians got GUITY from the court he said \"adalat le vaneko namanne?\"  When it was his turn he said every court is corrupt trying to get away. We are facing a same scenario here. Firstly the case was approached from a minor consent. And as far i believe the age couldn't be proven to be under 18.

When a whore and a group of manipulators ruined all his effort, talent and the career he had built for himself?   fuck off. Your post is gpt generated garbage, with no human critique or elements be a man, be a human instead of a corporate slave being paid next to nothing.|||jealousy makes ppl crazy|||All you blaming Sandeep are either girls or just boys that are sore losers in life. Aba they’ll say I’m being sexual ki rude eta uta. Okay let’s go thru facts one by one.   Firstly the whole case looks fabricated as hell. The day that couple spent the night together, next day aayera afnai room mate sanga ekdum excited bhayera Kura gareko cha. A few weeks later gayera case haleko cha. Usko roommate ko statement sunnu paila.   First ma statutory rape bhanyo, which was a massive one. Tyo case ho Bhane Sandeep should rot in jail. Tara that wasn’t the case, ani age ta 18 above cha raicha Bhanera tha paye pachi case chai rape ko ma change bhayo. Tyo pani when you go through the whole thing, it is pretty easy to make it out that the girl was trying to mint money out of Sandeep. It was a honey trap Bhanera ta sabai lai tha cha.   I don’t know Sandeep personally and don’t care if he’s arrogant or k k. It doesn’t matter. Because that’s not why he’s defamed.   Aba you’ll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re. Harek din naya bayaan and naya kahaani. Kt party ko main intention nai was to get as much of compensation as possible rather than punishing Sandeep.   And brought shame to our cricketing fraternity rey? Yo statement batai it’s easy to assume ki yo post garne eauta kti ho, ki jindagi ma lukera basne kta ho or Bharkhar ko fucche ho.  Even Cristiano Ronaldo was accused of rape numerous times. Eauta case ta it’s ekdummai severe. That girl immediately told her friends and filed lawsuit walla. Sandeep ko ta proper honeytrap thyo, Ronaldo had an actual case against him. But bail payo, where he still continued with his career. Unlike Sandeep, Ronaldo continued with his career. Pachi final verdict afnai favor ma payo.   So did he bring shame to Portugal? To Real Madrid? (at the time of the case) Ani Sandeep le chai kasari?   You put yourself in his shoes. You go out on a date with someone. Everything seems perfect, you guys kiss hug and spend an amazing time together. Belka you guys stay out ani make out. Bholi you drop her home. Then you go out for your work, ani bahira huda nai after a few weeks you find out that girl has filed a complaint for rape against you. What would you do?   I’m more than happy that our recent constitution and policies are in full support of women. Patriarchal society where girls were always oppressed, we finally have laws that protect and safeguard women. Tara yei law lai misuse Garne haru ni Chan.

At the very least she is knowingly or unknowingly grooming kids. This is neither an isolated event nor out of context. Almost everything she has posted has a clear sexual undertone. She is trying to reach a demographic whose brains are rotted by deviant thoughts because of the constant stream of porn injected into their veins. It's attention-seeking for sure, but involving children into her bullshit is wrong. Take it up a notch and think if she was making OF content but with children next to her. It's not that making sexual content (or content in general with certain undertone) is wrong, it's wrong when you involve children into shit that they don't have the capacity to understand. Let's say she does not understand that involving children in her sexually-charged videos is wrong, is that supposed to automatically make it right? Ignorance, \"oopise, I didn't know\", \"it's not a big deal\", \"she probably doesn't know\" is not a defense.

Do you even know what does that word mean? There is something called affection and being affectionate. Timro ghar xeuma weren't there ximeki didi when you were small? Werent they affectionate with you? She didn't do a hard kiss. It was a soft kiss. For women to be close to any kids it's normal. They're emotional and affectionate towards babies. If they're not, they're mentally abnormal. I don't wanna say anything about reddit women but to my understanding most girls here in reddit already have hatred towards men or some sort of toxicity. I've never seen any healthy feminine girls in reddit from nepal. They usually join to stress out or rant or listen to rants.  ​And this thread is a perfect example of that. People are just looking for something to be outraged about.  ​Not every single interaction between an adult and a kid has to be sexualized. That's a very Western way of thinking, and everyone here is quick to import it. It's all about intent. You can clearly see from the video there was no malicious or sexual intent. It was a brief, caring gesture, exactly like an aunt or an older sister would give.  ​Besides, the context of the video itself matters. As the song and caption show, it's clearly meant to be lighthearted, a 'loke.'  People are taking a 5-second clip out of context, projecting their own dirty minds onto it, and trying to make a huge issue out of nothing. Everyone needs to get a grip and stop looking for problems where there are none.  Also, In Nepal, the level of conservativeness depends on caste/community. For brahmins even dating seems taboo but while for other it's pretty much common. Even choice of clothes, what they dress, what they reveal, everything is totally dependent on their caste. She's seems Newar and I've seen newars being way open than that.   TLDR: Video is perfectly normal as it should, it's on social media, people are projecting their own fantasies over reality. It's all about your upbringing and it reflects you didn't get enough love from your elder sisters during childhood.  PS: Even a single touch can be bad and whole bape cosplay can be beautiful.  It's all about person and intent, remember that.|||what the helllll|||nah. I thought it was mom and son tiktok|||Poor kid.

We told her that we were Nepali citizen and didn’t needed visa. Then ahead rudely shouted to get the bording pass from the person who made that rule. Good thing was that there were other staff member who knew the rule and helped us out. Thr lady couldnhave just asked her senior and would have know the reason but instead decided that she isn’t there to serve but to rule. The problem ia that these people aren’t deceplined for their actions and continue to melign the name of their own country.|||As an Indian, I'm very sorry that Nepalis have to go through this in India. I have great respect for Nepal and its culture. If it were upto me, I'd support strengthening ties between India and Nepal.|||I am really sorry to hear that but the way they treat first-time visitors from Nepal in India is even more disgusting than how they treat frequent visitors. Even those who visit India often are treated as if we’re some kind of threat to the country. Sometimes, I feel it’s because of our weak passport and the way they perceive our country. I’ve heard many disrespectful remarks directed at fellow Nepali travelers, even for the smallest mistakes like something as simple as pressing a thumb incorrectly.|||Mad because they were colonised and we didn't|||Man this is infuriating. I really want those officials punished for misusing their authority and especially because their actions have cost someone an important career opportunity. It's making me angrier that there's no reason being cited. Can we lodge a complaint somewhere OP?|||Never transit in India. We tend to do it sometimes as fares are little less through that route. I would never recommend anyone to transit via Delhi. I have heard countless horror stories.|||My teacher told us incident of trip on Bahairahaw he wandered off to India's border, on duty guard took him to officer who then was trying to scoff him off so he just pretended to not speak Hindi, only answered when asked in English, he told Indian had internalized racism experienced in conolized years, the ones who speaks are seen as superior.  That was totally anecdotal but I have seen many Nepali trying to speak in Hindi when they meet an Indian person but the enthusiasm is never recipocated.|||Mad coz balaen said fuck india that day|||I had faced the same issue in Delhi airport.|||I never had any issues|||raape capital of the world bata saglo farkeko ma badhai miss  but who tf with sane mind flies thru sheethole indian airport, duniya ko most racist,sexist, xenophobic manche haru ko circus ho tyo|||Remember the time they used to label Russian Women as Rs. 6000. Yes, there is a reason the world hates them.  India is a cancer to South Asia and to the world of course. Very few indians are good.

Immigration officer are rude as fuck and on top of that, they take too much of your time.  But I also met few good people in India. And that was a relief in all those tough times.|||Please do not transit through India. They will create an issue out of nothing just out of pure spite.   Always chose Dubai, Doha or Hong Kong.

Every time, he was singled out, even though he traveled two to three times a year. They would ask about his visa, his job on the cruise, and why he was carrying money, if any. It seemed like they had never seen a Nepalese carrying dollars for travel expenses. After working on cruises for nearly 35 years and traveling extensively across the USA and Europe, he only faced this treatment at Indian airports. As a result, he now completely avoids traveling to or through India.|||Bangladesh airports are worse and their service is shit, but the it is still better.|||Very unfortunate and sorry this happened to you, traveling through India is definitely a terrible experience and I myself have experienced the worst experience of traveling through India for a NRN but just to play devils advocate, Indian government is probably trying to stop any underground routes to US and lot of people travel through South America to US, either way they should be clear on communicating to you why they stopped you and what their process are because they can’t stop someone without proper documentation of why they are stopping someone at the airport.|||Doesn't matter the whole world hates India. I live in Aus and these days the hate sentiments against Indian is too much. Sometimes even I feel bad for them. |||I heard this from my relative; they went to India. It wasn't first time. They knew a hotel used to stay there because it was known. But few weeks ago when they went there, they were told that government has said don't allow any Nepali to stay at any government hotel or lodge! Maybe the reason is recent protest and many criminals were out of jail. But The hotel manager knew that they weren't bad people, but didn't allow them. Thank god there was a Non-government hotel nearby and they stayed there.|||Well, we had faced similar incident from India, while traveling to Romania.

No, yet most nations frown or ban them from being raised for slaughter.  The same is true here. Cows are important part of their religious or cultural identity for most Nepalese people. So, I don't think such legalization will work or be treated positively.  Do I personally think Cows, or even dogs or cats should be banned? No, frankly I don't care as long as it does not impact humans or the species themselves on a conservation scale.  But I don't think this can or should be implemented nation wide.

That way, at least those poor calves would have a better chance to live a little|||  Im a hindu and I have never eated beef or plan to in the future and don't really see the problem in eating beef in Nepal, but If you eat it near me I will walk away.

We are Hindu majority. Nepalese of all religion are already normalized to not consuming beef, this will start a conflict amongst our own majority. Us not consuming beef has kept Muslims and Christians in low numbers- they are major consumers of beef and send missionaries everywhere to increase their numbers. If there are two similarly sized groups with different people- that will create political conflict and add to our issues. We already see this play out in western countries- they have major political issues around Muslims and recently Indians (who they associate with Hinduism which they've already begun to hate in Canada, and if you a brown Nepali- you are Indian to them) Don't make moves that will drive your own group's numbers low. We have to keep the status quo in regards to issues like this.   Not eating cow has not created any issue that is worth our attention. Focus on tackling actual issues like further eradicating this baun, chettri nonsense which is the bane of Hinduism- we can and are doing it while keeping our culture, traditions and identity.|||just say chamal ko bora ta paako this , visa ni paaulas ni and move on|||So much for a secular nation|||lets eat beef guys",

            "body": "Captions on the posts -  Ward chair must have a very good salary for such a luxurious lifestyle. They are the son and daughter in law of narayan subedi of gokarna 5. This is an insane lifestyle, nothing less than Dahal family. If a local ward chairperson can amass such wealth, those at the level of IGP and mantri have looted us taxpayers a hundred times higher.   This guy is apparently the son of nepal’s most corrupt chief justice Gopal Parajuli, btw he had to resign because of fake citizenship. Openly flexing luxury cars and watches on social media. Arent we tired of them by now?  The poor doesnt have access to proper ambulances, meanwhile ankit khand the son of nepali citizenship seller balkrishna khand takes helicopters, everywhere he goes! Manju Khand ko chorra.  Shaniddhya Shaudharya Khanal, son of Ex IGP of APF, Shailendra Khanal. What is the salary of these officers to be able to afford these lifestyles?  Garima Paudel daughter of ex minister devendra paudel proudly faunting her international lifestyle. International tours, comfortable international lifestyle, business class travels while the poor are forced to use tuins for daily commute. Are we not tired of this? This is why we are exposing corruption in nepal  Sangita Pahadi has recently been sued by CIAA for 3 arba scam. Their children have been living a lavish lifestyle since ages. No shame. 30 hajar ko talab, 30 ota gharbari. Finish them all.  We found another generational corruption run. Khushi Pandey is the granddaughter of Ramesh Nath Pandey, he was the FORMER MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, INDUSTRY, TOURISM, ENVIRONMENT and COMMUNICATIONS. She is also the daughter of Nischal Nath Pandey, who served as a government employee during ramesh nath pandey’s long ministerial run. Look at this damn lifestyle. How is it possible to afford all of this when the family has nothing except civil service for the past 50 years?  Supriya Bohora, granddaughter of Deepak Bohora, former member of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and the House of Representatives, has recently come under the spotlight. Deepak Bohora was known for his strong hand in the Panchayat system and his unwavering support for the monarchy. His political journey is remembered not only for his allegiance to authoritarian structures but also for allegations of corruption. One of the most prominent accusations linked to Deepak Bohora is the illegal consumption of land where the Fun Park ice rink in Bhadrakali Road now stands. What was once a symbol of political maneuvering and alleged misappropriation of public assets is now being flaunted by his granddaughter as a mark of achievement, raising questions about how the spoils of corruption are normalized across generations.  Anusandhan khai ta comrade? Granddaughter living in europe to protect all the money stored in swiss bank. EXPOSE THEM ALL!  Most corrupted ones are the generals from police special dsp and upwards.👮 I have seen them using massive funds to get their sons n daughters abroad or in prestigious schools by paying hefty fees. their home looks like that of a king , literally narayanhiti jastai same and their sons n daughters are living the life of luxuries carrying iphones and designer dresses and bags . Actually what these officer do is they heavily launder money and budgets which comes to their department . They practice “milijuli khane” . They also take funds from criminals to manage cases. Then they use these funds to bribe politicians for getting higher post like dsp to dig , from DIG to IG and so on . They conduct massive weddings and ceremonies spending crore of rupees. this is same with army generals as well.  `-`  **TLDR - REGISTER AND CONVINCE YOUR FRIENDS, COUSINS IF THEY STILL HAVE NOT MADE VOTER ID**  Read an interesting blog on this. Hamro lato politician le k bujhla esto. Chorra chorri lai instagram delete garna chai layo dhanna teti chai buddhi raicha.  >The corrupt ruling elites of the Third World, who used to steal everything, destroy economies, and create hell for their own populations, have now added one more thing: they openly allow their children to flaunt the spoils of corruption on Instagram, right in front of their starving people. Something previous generations never witnessed.  >The new rich have never gone through a revolution so they don't understand not to flaunt their wealth like the old bourgeoisie who have witnessed multiple revolutions throughout history. It's ironic that the Maoists instigated a revolution yet the children of said Maoists are now living the luxurious lives posting everything not knowing whats simmering in society. It looks like at least the kids have understood not to flaunt their stolen wealth to avoid angering the masses.  >In any ways what happened in Nepal highlights a trend I’ve discussed on here before, which is how Instagram utterly radicalizes youth heavy developing societies.  >Suddenly you as a poor but striving young man or woman have full visibility to how the elite/upper class of your country + diaspora live, but you have little access or hope of ever living the same for the most part. The impact of this on mental health, societal stability, and also fertility rates cannot be underestimated.  >Imagine going from a society with five state channels and a few cable options in the 2000s to Instagram in just five years. That’s what happened to all of South Asia + Africa + a lot of Latin America.  These guys were being exposed to the lifestyles of the baddie daughters and Chad sons of the fucktards ruling their country,  >You see their trip to Japan and London for the summer. See their parties at their elite mansions in the most posh suburbs and neighborhoods and you realize you’re just fucked and not getting there ever, your country simply does not have the mechanism to enable that for you, you’re unemployed even despite a college degree.  >**Upward mobility is like a pressure valve. Nepal never had that. The elites taxed people, slapped tariffs on imports & ignored building institutions that foster upward mobility. Instead, they assumed that sending their populace to the Middle East would be sufficient.**  >What’s surprising is how the corrupt politicians allow their kids to flaunt stolen wealth so brazenly. Kids of politicians in developing countries flaunting their extravagant lifestyles on public Instagram accounts is so foolhardy. Exposure to social media and bragging about your luxurious lifestyle risks fuelling resentment and envy.  >It's how uprisings have always been. Old bourgeoisie don't show off their wealth like those Nepali elites did. This behavior is what got both the iranian and russian noble families killed. This also happened in Mongolia earlier this year, although less dramatically. The Prime Minister had to step down due to protests that kicked off because his son was showing off his luxury holidays and clothes too much on Instagram.",

Yeah your advice is good but acting like its like a warzone everyday being abroad is crazy.|||I am 14 and this is deep. Chill out.|||Unless you're privileged, and your parents are rich..

If you ask anybody who’s moved from outside Kathmandu (especially rural areas) to Kathmandu, they will let you tell almost a similar version to what you said.|||So basically it's the same as in homecountry. I don't understand why people think life is only hard abroad. Bro you choose you choose to go abroad. So earn your choice and yes survival is hard everywhere.|||As an older Canadian brother -  I have housed 3 Nepali guys.   Each one of them tried to scam, trick, avoid and lie their way through various things.    I made connections with each and everyone of them and helped them establish understanding that things do not get handed to them.   The concept to the OP post is not far off. Get up, have a goal and be driven. However, do not lie, cheat, steal or ask for money. If you are kind - you will see kindness shown back.   Of the 3 boys - one is getting deported. IRCC is the least of your worries. Its the boarder patrol services you should be concerned about if you try anything illegal - even a small one once to a kind Canadain.   Im glad I didnt turn my back but im also glad that somes awareness is bringing to light.    P.s. Don't pretend to be gay either - thats fraudulent and also solictitaion of sex and goes against your agreement with going abroad. Be careful fellas.   also - why only is this post geared to boys ?

You can also just aim for a comfortable life. If everyone is striving to dominate instead of collaborate, imagine how awful the world would be.   Be mentally tough re lol. Like mental toughness is something one can just learn. It comes with experience, dealing with hardships. It's not something you can just build at home. \"Read and learn every single day\" LOL.   Even in Nepal bills and rent don't wait. People don't feel sorry for you anywhere, even more so in Nepal where you are actually expected to spend so much on relatives and friends.   It's just a different country. Yes, it will be hard but it isn't a warzone.|||Boys and girls, Work hard and enjoy your life too while doing that.

People romanticize going abroad, but they don’t realize it’s a full reset! Your last name, your family status, your struggles back home, none of it matters. What counts is how disciplined and valuable you are in that new system.  I’d add, learn to manage your emotions too. It’s not just physical or financial survival — it’s mental. You’ll feel lonely, rejected, homesick, but those who turn that into fuel grow faster than anyone else. Also, you don’t have to be the smartest person, but be reliable. The world respects consistency.|||J pani overdramatic banauna parni hau Nepali harulai..

            "body": "I always thought my life was done for. I was a bad son and a bad brother. I let my family down so many times that they eventually kicked me out. Fair enough, I couldn’t offer them anything except shame and duniya ko tana. I’ve heard things like “Yesto xora janmaunu vanda na janmekai thik hunthyo”. Those words used to hurt me a lot, but still I couldn’t change.  I’ve done many wrong things in life which i regrets . Been to jail a few times, have criminal charges, got rusticated from college because of fights, couldn’t complete my bachelor. Friends betrayed me too they were only there when they could use me. As time passed, I got more depressed. Most of the time, only suicidal thoughts used to come to my mind. I had no place to stay, used to sleep where I worked or sometimes on the street.  One day I finally decided I’d had enough. Bought a mouse poison, tried to take my life. But at the very last moment I was too scared to die. I cried for a long time that night. I realized how miserable I had become to even think of doing that.  But that night I also realized something  maybe I’m not done yet. Maybe there’s still a small ray of hope. I still wanted to live, and live a good life. I had only two options: either change myself completely or kill myself. I couldn’t choose the second option.  So I started working hard doing different odd jobs. Quitted smoking and drinking at once it was so hard. I used to get worst panic attacks, but I managed.   Now I’ve been clean for a year. I have my own small room to live in, my own second-hand bike, and I earn through a ride-sharing app. I also started self-studying because I couldn’t finish my bachelor. Been learning programming from YouTube for two months now. It’s tough, but I’m thinking of joining classes soon. Someone told me you don’t need a college degree to become a software developer, and that really motivated me.  I even tried to apply abroad, but because of my police record it wasn’t possible. So now I just want to become someone respectable in my own country. I want to prove my father wrong. They still don’t know where I am, but one day I’ll go to them when they can proudly call me their son.  It feels unreal sometimes that I have my own room, my own food, my own bike , own laptop(second hand😁) all this within just one year. I can’t believe it. A year ago, I wanted to die. Now I just want to live better. Even though I'm alone , It really feels like dream to live like this.   Happy Happy tihar everyone and happy  bhaitika. Aja didi ko kasto yaad aayo!! Pic 7 year ago this day.  My last bhai tika.",

There could be others, who scored 1000, 999 and 998 before you. So, competition is tough, repeating same thing multiple times doesn't mean, good score. Overtime, brain starts to saturate, hallucinate and if not taken care, gives up and become mad. The competition itself is not for light hearted. TLDR: rpeating years, doesn't equal to same amount of preparations every year. Some years are good, some are not.

            "body": "So, yes, this was me the same person who got a 3.97 GPA in the SEE. I’ve always known that grades don’t define everything, and I’ll continue to believe that. At the end of the day, even though I scored 3.97 GPA, In the Kathmandu Metro Scholarship exam, I choked. I barely made it onto the second nomination list and ended up in a college that’s just “okay.” But honestly, I don’t blame the college I blame myself. There were others who got into better colleges than me, even though they had lower grades. So, I can’t say grades don’t matter, but the first term really showed me how tough things can get. I know I need to improve, and I’m determined to do so. I got an A+ in Computer Science, even though I didn’t study as much as I should have. I love Computer Science and building a lot of skills in the field. Right now, though, I’ve decided to take a break from everything every extracurricular activity, including learning JavaScript, React, and other things. I know I probably shouldn’t, but I feel like it’s necessary for now. Starting today, I’ll be locking my phone and using my laptop strictly for studying. I need to focus on my second terminal exams, and it’s time to set boundaries.If I’ve said anything wrong, I apologize. I don’t blame anyone or anything but myself, even though I studied harder than I ever have. My lack of proper note-taking has cost me. Right now, I’m just looking for advice from seniors who have gone through this and come back stronger, getting good results in the end.",

But it turned out none of it actually mattered.

I understand it looks a lot worse to you (and maybe your guardians) coming from 3.97 to 3.10 and your feelings are very valid. I have seen toppers with dead end jobs and barely first class pass having a stellar careers. I'm somewhat middle of the lot myself.

All the B's and B+'s  could have been A's with a little discipline and bit of a good luck, and most of all hopefully this has given you a wake up call.

They are simple and have generally easy solutions that most if not all can understand. But they ask questions that often require you to interpret the asked topic in a different way. Thwy might twist a simple concept like vector addition and join it with irl examples.

            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I’ve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don’t know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

I love exploring the world, meeting people, understanding life, and actually working for society.

I also don’t want to do BSW/BASW because too many people struggle to find work after that.  I want a bachelor’s where I can study and work at the same time since my family do not earn well and I definitely have to look after my family after 12.

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can’t get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.

Go there only if you have years of experience in a particular field. And Canada, UK and  Australia are not like they used to be.  Perhaps, Germany is a good choice, but you have to learn german.  If you are fine with India, you could go there too, but only if you can spend 50-60 lakhs, so that you can get into a good private college.|||Ma tw bhanxu abroad nai try gara|||Abroad try garney vaena vaney yetai ramro course padhney.|||If you want to go for studying and make a career then don't stay in Nepal.
