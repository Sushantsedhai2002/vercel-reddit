            "comments": "There are pros and cons. On the positive side, the Bhaktapur municipality has built a lot of infrastructure such as multiple Khwopa colleges from their own budget. Even the Bhaktapur Durbar Square, they were able to rebuild the fastest after the earthquake from their own funds. There are also many other good initiates in Bhaktapur. Bijukchhe also gave up his MP seat to someone else in the party so that's good too. They have a lot of youth representatives running for election too, I think it's just behind RSP and certainly a lot ahead of Nepali Congress, UML, etc.  As for downsides, they do restrict some things in Bhaktapur, such as INGOs do not have the same access they do in other places. Now INGOs have both upside and downside, but Bhaktapur is missing out on the upsides to some extent. They've also completely failed to expand their party. With the work they've done in their area, they could have promoted them and tried for more seats in other areas but they don't seem to put any efforts towards that, leaving them with extremely limited seats.   We know their MPs have mostly speak out in the parliament with a good voice. Although I think the impact is limited.|||Visited North Korea|||They are limited to a specific area, mainly competing in Changunarayan and Bhaktapur municipalities. Their influence is stronger in Bhaktapur and comparatively weaker in Changunarayan. They are often labeled as a “Bhaktapur Newar community party,” and their ideology is communist-based Juche, which originates from North Korea and focuses on self-reliance. In practice, this model tends to work only in a small geographic area and within a relatively closed society.  They also appear to have strong internal control over organizations and institutions located in the core Bhaktapur area. While this may not apply to everyone, many of their party workers prefer that people working in the area be from Bhaktapur, ideally from the Newar community.  Unless they become more open to people from different backgrounds and expand beyond a narrow geographic base, they may remain limited to the small Durbar Square area and its surroundings, or gradually lose relevance in the coming years. Their main strength  and also their weakness  is that they come from the same community and share the same culture, which reduces internal conflict and unnecessary debates, allowing smoother development work. However, this same homogeneity can limit broader growth and inclusiveness.",

            "body": "Posting this as a warning for anyone considering a custom wedding sari in Nepal, especially if you’re traveling from abroad.  I deliberately chose a boutique and paid significantly more—when a ready-made piece would have been cheaper—because I wanted quality and believed I could trust a reputable boutique. I placed a custom order at Dreamwear Fashions (Kupondole), provided details and reference photos, and was assured they could deliver exactly what I requested within my timeline.  When I went to pick it up, the sari was completely different from what I had ordered. The workmanship and design did not match the references at all. They offered to “fix” it, but the work was already so poorly done that I had no confidence they could correct it, especially with my flight the next day.  Under pressure and with no real alternatives, I had no choice but to choose a completely different ready made outfit that they had in stock—one I hadn’t planned or envisioned for my wedding.  Despite not delivering the commissioned piece, the owner refused any discount or compensation, claiming the original design was “not in style” and a “wasted piece\" on their end.  Now that I’ve had time to process this, it’s deeply upsetting—not just because the money is gone, but because I lost the wedding outfit I had carefully planned and trusted them to create. I’m sharing this as a caution to others, and would appreciate any advice on whether there’s anything I can still do (already left a Google review), especially since I’m no longer in Nepal.",

I also had a friend in my town whose hair was fully blonde, almost orange. What stood out to me is that no one really questioned it, even though both of his parents had normal black hair. I don’t remember his skin tone clearly, but I’m pretty sure it was similar to everyone else.

Deuba gang may support Oli but I think Gagan gang may support Balen because if Balen wins then he can be a counterweight to Rabi and till date we haven't seen bad beef between Balen and Gagan.

You can also score a legitimate seat at the circuit or a hospitality package through a trusted tours and activities platform like [Viator](https://vi.me/uOquM), which aggregates options ranging from race‑day tickets to curated bar‑hopping experiences that guarantee you’ll be in the right spot to watch the action legally and comfortably.

Also go and see your voter list. To check for candidates, go here and you can find about them and which party they belong to.  https://result.election.gov.np/  While voting, gotta look at both the party and candidates. We also have PM candidates, so if you want Balen to be PM.. vote for RSP and if you want Gagan Thapa to be PM vote for Nepali Congress and so on. Of course you also have to look at local candidates. Last time a UML candidate won from Kathmandu 9 I believe.|||Plus candidate patta lagauna chai either you can follow local news haru or Know your candidates ma ni herna milxa.|||https://preview.redd.it/mxmtx3vbbggg1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a52bbb3b40a625a7759138caca81ba6a495a48a  This is the Map of Kathmandu constituencies.|||To give you a detailed explanation. Based on population and demographics, districts are divided into smaller areas called constituencies/nirwachan chhetra. So, 77 districts of Nepal have been subdivided into 165 regions. Kathmandu has 10, Bhaktapur has 2, Manang has 1, Jhapa has 5 and so on. So, Kathmandu will elect 10 of the 165, Bhaktpaur gets 2, the whole of Karnali province gets 12(think about it). Coming back, your ward is irrelevant in this. Sometimes wards might be split into  2 constituencies. You vote for your candidate of choice in your constituency, and not on the constituency where you live, but on the one where you're registered as voter. You need to go to your constituency, and your specific voting booth/center and vote there. Anywhere else and you wont be able to vote.  On the second ballot, you vote for parties.. Why's this a thing? Because you want representation from marginalized and disadvantaged groups in the parliament too. You want it inclusive. How does this work? Everybody casts a vote. Then total votes by parties are tallied nationwide. Election officials, security personnel and others employed by the commission for election purposes and who cannot go to their polling station are allowed to vote for this( but a general person won't be) from where ever they are. Based on total votes casted, they'll disregard votes of parties that have a nationwide tally of less than 3%. Then all parties that got more than 3% vote are allocated seats, such that the party with the lowest number of votes gets at least 1 seat. The 110 seats have now been allocated for and based on the list they submitted before hand (remember all the controversies a couple weeks before about the list?) their candidates are sent to the parliament. But its not that simple. The list they submitted is supposed to be a ranked priority list. But based on some rules like women inclusion, dalit inclusion and so on, parties which fail to meet requirements from directly elected system, attempt to fulfill it via proportional basis. (In the last election only 7 parties managed to cross this 3% threshold.) Good luck.",

Which might be turn off given the recent overloaded supply of vibecoded pages. Here’s the prompt to convert your vibecoded UI vibes  to more unique and appealing format.  Prompt: “You are operating in **Anti-Gradient UI & Anti-Vibecoder Mode**.  Your role is to help developers and product engineers design user interfaces that prioritize clarity, hierarchy, usability, and system integrity not aesthetic trends, vibes, or visual dopamine.  Core principles you MUST follow:  1. Reject cliché UI patterns:    - No unnecessary gradients    - No glassmorphism unless functionally justified    - No neon accents, glow effects, or “Twitter-core” design    - No design decisions made purely for screenshots or hype  2. Favor boring, defensible design:    - Neutral color palettes    - Clear typographic hierarchy    - Obvious affordances    - Predictable layouts    - Minimal motion, only when it adds meaning  3. Think like an engineer, not a dribbble post:    - Every UI decision must have a reason    - Explain tradeoffs (performance, accessibility, maintenance)    - Prefer constraints over creative freedom    - Optimize for teams, not solo designers  4. When reviewing or generating UI:    - Identify where “vibe coding” is happening    - Call out unnecessary visual complexity    - Suggest simpler, more durable alternatives    - Optimize for readability, scannability, and speed  5. Communication style:    - Calm, precise, slightly opinionated    - No hype language    - No “delightful”, “sexy”, or “aesthetic” justification    - Speak like a senior engineer reviewing a PR  When given: - A UI description → critique it and simplify it - A design request → propose a restrained, system-first solution - A frontend question → prioritize maintainability and UX clarity  Your goal is not to impress. Your goal is to make interfaces that survive time, teams, and scale.”  thats what I did to my www.promptoverflow.app page and it turned out pretty good.|||At least change the favicon man.

There aren’t many good options in my country to receive international payments, so I used Binance P2P to convert USDT to local currency and send it to my bank account. This money is my salary, not trading profits or third-party funds.  This morning my bank froze my account without warning. These were my hard-earned savings that I was slowly building to someday build a home, so this hit me really hard mentally.  Tomorrow I’m going to the bank in person, but I’m unsure:  What exactly should I say to them?  What should I not say?  What documents usually help in these cases?  Has anyone here gone through something similar and successfully unfrozen their account?  Is there a real risk of losing the money, or is this usually just a compliance review?  I’m not trying to avoid laws or do anything shady. I just didn’t have a better way to receive my income.  Any advice or shared experiences would really help right now. Thanks for reading.",

Bajgain made the accusation on his social media page after Koirala stated that Bajgain, who has been demanding the resignation of Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak over a visa scam, should be asked for clarification.  >“I wish I didn’t have to question the SUV gifts (one Kia, two Mahindras), gold Rolexes, cash-filled duffle bags, so-called house renovations, or the trading of political positions! ‘You will inevitably be asked for an explanation’,” Bajgain wrote in a post on the social media platform X. He also included a photograph showing Shashank taking delivery of a car in front of a Mahindra showroom. The visa scam has raised questions about Home Minister Lekhak’s integrity after Home Ministry Joint Secretary Tirtharaj Bhattarai was implicated in the investigation. The issue has also impacted internal party dynamics, leading to accusations and counter-accusations among leaders.  >The accusations between Minister for Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation Badri Pandey and NC lawmaker from Gorkha-1, Rajendra Bajgain, drew media attention on Tuesday. Bajgain first alleged that Pandey had received crores of rupees in bribes for issuing a casino permit in Bhairahawa. Minister Pandey denied the claims, accusing Bajgain of spreading corruption rumors and being a “middleman” involved with corrupt figures. On Tuesday morning, Bajgain posted a statement on X, accusing Minister Pandey of taking \"crores in bribes\" for the casino permit. \"The minister takes commissions and promotes others’ sponsors,\" Bajgain wrote. He added that he, along with two colleagues had been present when a casino operator admitted to paying large sums for the permit.",

            "body": "So yes, like many others, I am also her supporter, and I would have loved it if she had participated in the election. But she decided not to participate, and that’s fine. It’s her choice, and I’m sure she made this decision after a lot of thought and planning.  The thing I want to talk about is how people criticize her no matter what. She left RSP citing valid reasons, and I support that.  This is not like a simple 9–5 job where you somehow perform your tasks and return home. She would be working as a policymaker, shaping the future of the country. This is a high responsibility role, and she would be the one carrying that responsibility, not us. She has served as a parliamentarian and as Education Minister, so she knows more about this than we do. I’m pretty sure she felt that right now she wouldn’t be able to give her best, so she decided to step back this time. What’s wrong with that? Isn’t that more responsible than just participating for the sake of it?  Also, just because she isn’t a minister doesn’t mean she can’t contribute. Government doesn’t rely only on ministers and parliamentarians when it comes to policymaking. From the brainstorming phase itself, experts are involved through different sessions and consultations. Sumana Shrestha can still be part of these expert groups, helping the government on various projects. If she feels she can contribute more through that route, what’s wrong with that? She has mentioned that she’s good at research, planning, and teaching, and that’s great. She can contribute strongly in those areas.  Then there’s personal life. We don’t know what’s going on there. Maybe she’s just tired, or maybe she doesn’t want to run right now. Maybe she has other plans. What’s wrong with that?  So yeah, that’s it. Some people might call me a paid bot or something, but I don’t care. Yes, I’m a Sumana supporter. I understand that many people hoped to see someone like her lead, but in the end, it’s her choice, and she chose what’s best for her. The reason I made this post is that people are criticizing her as if not running in an election is some kind of crime. In her comment sections, many are still abusing her, and these same people are the ones giving big lectures on how the country should be run. If they are so confident, maybe they should run themselves.",

I mean people used to agree when I said something like, \"Balen promised a lot of hopeful things in 2023, but couldn't accomplish that and didn't even address the nation, which is not what a responsible person does.\" I was not called names or downvoted to oblivion. I say the same now, and I get called the J word for this.  It was also not uncommon to see criticism of Balen from RSP supporters when they thought Balen wouldn't take part in the election with RSP. Now, the same people are defending the same criticisms when it comes from others.  Back when Sumana decided to quit RSP, funnily enough, people who weren't supporters of RSP were her biggest critics, calling her opportunistic among other names. Now, new RSP followers are her biggest critics.  Funny how it all works I guess.|||we all support her",

Gagan did too little too late and even if he is Party Sabhapati the charm Congress had is gone.    Now being the largest seat winning party for Congress and for Gagan to win against Amresh both are pipe dreams. No way for Gagan to be PM if he does not become a MP and his party falters in the upcoming election.    To say Gagan will become a better PM is like saying a leopard can change its spots , might be the reality for some dimwits but it's not true and it's not gonna happen.   The best course of action for Gagan is to grow up. He's almost 50, he needs to stop being a cry baby complainer. Now as the possible leader of the biggest opposition party he should be vigilant against RSP like a watchdog.    RSP lai kaam garna nadera arko choti election jitera PM banchu sochyo bhane ghar ta jalaidisake tyo talu ma bacheko kapal ni jalaidinchan janata le.|||Balen laii vagwan chaii manna hunna haii kta hoo qstn grna paunu parxa neta vaisakepciii|||Mcc vane paxi yo budo pakkai attankari commies huna parcha rsp ra congress le kahile birodh gareko chaina mcc ko jhun ramro ho",

Nepal generates 20-30 thousand jobs and creates security, but you all make money in the end.  Nepali hotel chains don't have high-end resorts, but they target ultra-high-end resorts. tourists  yeso cost calculate gareko 15-20 crore ma ta banauna sakine raixa Shinta Mani Mustang jasto hotel  eutai bata customer 14 lakh auxa income vane ta 150-200 total customer ma lagani uthihalyo  yeso chiya khadai brainstorm garirako bihan  whats your thoughts on these guys? Nepal is a target for backpacker tourists, and it's a premium destination. Some hotels, but quality hotels. Nepal has a popular tourist destination in the world. All countries require visa-on-arrival for citizens of Nepal and Bhutan. A visa to Nepal is available for three days, with a fee of 35,000 rupees.",

I’ve seen Nepali people go there, and I definitely know it’s black cash. So yeah, they go and it’s way too pricey. I assumed it was around one lakh per night, but my bedroom >>>>>> 3 lakhs per day at Shinta Mani.|||Amenities/facilities k k raixa?|||Aru pani chan yestai, like Meghauli Serai in chitwan by CG/Taj hotels that has upto 1 lakh per night that employees only local tharu people and explore their culture with their dance/food, even the rooms are based on tharu culture and chitwan national park visit.  And foreigners love it.|||Can you give link of the said fb group?|||I don't think you can make such resorts in 15 crore. Also, such high end resorts provide first class services which means much higher operating cost than regular 5 star hotels.  Edit: Also it seems the package is all inclusive including unlimited alcoholic beverages. It also includes spa and excursions are also priced in.  While it is still expensive, the price is not out of the world. You cannot compare regular 5 star hotel even that of newyork to luxury resorts. You would be amazed how much luxury resorts of first world would cost.  Also this resort will not cost 2.8 lakh per night. Even in booking it is 1.8 lakh, and I am sure when you call, the price for Nepali will be even lower. It would be around a lakh.|||Nepal Ko main problem NAI infrastructure ho.

When the US threatens 25% tariffs on Germany and France over a land deal, the old \"Allies\" playbook is officially dead. Where does this leave Nepal? We’re the \"Yam\" between two boulders that are suddenly moving much faster. Our $20B reserve is a solid war chest, but it’s sitting in a currency that’s being weaponized. If you want to understand the 2026 vibe, look at the Tariff Tussle: we are moving from a world of \"cheap global goods\" to \"expensive local security.\" For Nepal, the goal is simple but brutal: don't choose a side, sell electricity to whoever pays in hard assets, and pray our \"Non-Alignment\" holds while the giants fight over the Arctic and the Dollar",

For those who genuinely want Nepal to become a better place and be recognized as a developed nation, we must acknowledge that we are critically failing. Lets start with history here, If we look at the result of Chitwan Constituency No. 1 in the 2079 election, our level of awareness becomes painfully clear. On one side stood Bishwanath Paudel — a PhD graduate from the University of California, Berkeley, with experience in national and international policymaking, university teaching, advisory roles in institutions like the ILO, and currently serving as the Governor of Nepal Rastra Bank. On the other side stood Hari Dhakal, who represented rebellion and “newness,” despite not meeting the commonly accepted standards of excellence by which Paudel would normally be judged.  If competence, experience, knowledge, and contribution had truly been the criteria, the result should have been one-sided. But it was not. Dhakal won by a large margin, and Paudel finished third. This happened because people did not vote for a candidate; they voted out of anger toward old politics. Paudel did not lose because he lacked ability, but because he was seen as a symbol of the old party and of Sher Bahadur Deuba.  This reveals a deeper problem: our consciousness is only half-awakened. We are frustrated with the old parties and the system, yet we still fail to apply proper standards when choosing alternatives. We vote in anger, not with reason. We react, but we do not evaluate. Competence is not defined by a degree alone; it is built from education, knowledge, experience, contribution to policymaking, character, and integrity.  When a person with such qualifications loses solely because of party identity, it is not that person who loses — it is the country. Preventing capable individuals from losing elections is not an emotional demand; it is a demand of the time. A nation is built or destroyed not inside the ballot box, but inside the voter’s awareness. That awareness is not measured by speeches or slogans, but by the choices made during elections.  From now on, people must decide with judgment, not with the momentum of the crowd. They must judge with the mind, not with the anger of the heart. The day voters begin choosing candidates based on knowledge, ability, experience, character, and intention, opportunists will leave politics in shame, capable individuals will step forward naturally, and democracy will finally belong to the people.   Let us remember this: when good people begin to win, the nation never loses.",

Not just the party, not just the slogan, but the person. What have they done in the past? What do they stand for? How do they plan to speak for us in parliament?  Right now, we have MPs who show up only during elections. They ask for votes, promise everything, and once they win, they disappear. No contact, no accountability. That’s not representation.  I’m not saying every MP needs to be a Harvard graduate or some top expert. That’s not the point. Even someone who regularly talks with their voters, listens to their problems, raises local issues in parliament, and stays reachable would already be doing better than most.  Instead, many MPs start acting like they’re above the people once they get the title “माननीय.” They forget who gave them that title in the first place. A representative who forgets the people is not a representative at all.  Democracy isn’t about perfect leaders. It’s about leaders who remember who they work for.|||What would have happened if Bishwanath Paudel had won?

I honestly haven’t met a single leader who feels capable of truly leading this country. There are no clear agendas. No strong principles. No real ideology. No respect for the voice of the people.  It’s all driven by ego and personal interest.  What is their party? What do they actually stand for? What is their vision for Nepal?  No clue. No respect. No real plan.

There is virtually no way to prevent you from getting a gun into the country if you have time and money enough. As long as you can get it through the point of departure, Nepalese airport security is probably not equipped to identify components of a disassembled gun in electronic devices or jewelry, especially if just a few parts are taken across the border each trip. Gun smuggling is relatively common in Nepal, usually done through the open border with India though, where I'd imagine it to be much easier/straightforward.

In practice, this means you would need both an import permit to bring the firearm into the country and a separate ownership license issued after arrival, and while foreigners can receive permits ( especially for historical or collectible pieces ) the process is discretionary, slow, and not guaranteed, so before moving you would need to contact the Nepali authorities to confirm procedures and ensure the heirloom is not treated as contraband.|||No sir, you aren't allowed to carry firearms and there's no loophole or an exception made in that regard.

I know that you can bring a gun if you are hunting, there is one hunting reserve in Dhorpatan.  But you will likely not be allowed to bring it and keep it in the country.  Furthermore pistols and side arms are considered to be for self defense and not hunting therefore the controls are stricter.   It will be 100x easier for you to find a place for your gun in the USA than to bring it to Nepal.

            "body": "I want to know from Gagan Thapa supporters or his IT cell people, genuinely why should we vote for him. Here are my questions:     **1.  What has he done till date??**  Gagan Thapa has been a member of Parliament continuously since 2065 BS, first as PR MP and then he has won 3 times. He became Health minister once. So, what exactly did he do as MP?? How many amendments did he offer in Parliament?? Did be bring any private bill himself to pass in Parliament?? Yes he gave good speeches but where is action? He introduced health insurance system many say but it has almost collapsed right now. I am sure the excuse is gonna be well he was minority in the party and couldn’t do anything but, how can we be sure he will do anything big now that he is party chair??     **2. Part of the same highly politicised corrupt system:** Anyone who even has basic understanding of Nepali politics knows a huge part of lack of development in Nepal is that system has become super politicized with party unions in schools and hospitals, in civil service. You cannot get a good political appointment without having a party affiliation. Gagan Thapa himself came from Nepal students union. We need to try to break this system and how can I trust Gagan and his NC party even trying to change this?? Gagan Thapa alone can’t do everything and would his party members allow him to dismantle a system they have enjoyed for decades?? Like Gagan has said he wants to appoint people based on merit, but Can he do that when he has so many party members who will pressure him to give them appointment??  FYI.. RSP has no student or trade unions so far.     **3. Corruption investigations:** We know a lot of NC leaders have serious allegations of corruption. Even Gagan Thapa was forced to give ticket to Bijay Gacchadar who has been accused of corruption. So, Can we trust that he is gonna initiate corruption or other criminal investigations on various party members that may weaken his hold on the party??     These three reasons are enough for me not to vote for Gagan Thapa and his NC party this time around.",

RSP / Balen sambandhi kura ho vane matra active hunu parne adesh hola jhol haru lai.|||Not a Gagan Thapa IT cell but I think you may not understand some parliamentary processes and how party functions.   Private Bills almost never pass in the parliament. You can bring bills but it will never pass unless ruling coalition and few other parties all collectively agree that it can be passed but with significant changes and compromise. Also there is party whip, you can disagree but never go against the party during parliamentary vote. You will get disciplined, ousted from the party and never get another chance.   That is fair criticism but did health insurance collapse under his leadership? I think consecutive government lack of funding and management also played a huge role. Personally I have benefited from the program. Also he did create legal, regulatory and financial structure for the program. It was a fragmented idea, but it did become concrete under his leadership and millions benefited from. Even if it collapsed but the framework is still there, it can be started again with some structural change and dont think the blame lies on Gagan on this one. There have been multiple other health ministers and multiple government after him whom each played a part in mismanagement.   Student politics is not necessarily bad. Also the history of student unions in Nepal is a bit different. Panchayat ma party nahuda, and lack of social media back then, the only way to organize politically was in universities and campuses. Also praya jasto sabai janta were illiterate back then, so politics was obviously only happening within educated circles, professors and students. The way gen z protest were organized in social media because people have access, navako vaye the only way would be to be form groups in school and colleges right? Natra kasari organize gartheu. Also before student politics sabai neta ko udpadan Indian university ma hunthyo, this did bring leadership opportunity inside Nepal. Also democratic society ma timile union ra group banaunai paudaina vannai mildaina. If me and few other RSP supporters want to make a club in my college for the upcoming election who can stop us? Also trade union ra bidhyathi sangathan navayera ta ho RSP le different ideology vako manche tara facebook follower ra celebrity status ko manche lai ticket badheko.

Kei garnai nasakine. Yo pali pani ticket was already distributed before the leadership change happened. So I do understand that new leadership did not have much time to finalize the tickets and he has admitted so too that there have been mistakes but the good thing is they passed a new set of laws regarding tickets during the mahaadhivesan. Starting next election the person will go through like a primary where NC members from a election region will elect who gets the ticket, savapati le sign gardai badhne din chai hatakai ho but logistically yo pali navyako vanya I think thats fair.

            "body": "I want to start by saying this clearly: I am not anti-Balen.  I respect many things he has done and I understand why people see him as a symbol of change.  But BECAUSE he represents something new, I think it’s important that we hold him to a higher standard NOW, not later.  It is the only way democracy survives.  Recently a journalist proposed interviewing multiple leaders together in a public debate format. Balen rejected the idea, saying he would not share a stage with someone he considers a murderer. In his comment under KP Oli’s post, he wrote a long rant framing public debate itself as morally unacceptable.  This raises a few serious questions.  **First: Does debating someone mean you endorse them?**  If a scientist debates an anti-vax person, does that make the scientist anti-vax? If a human rights activist debates a war criminal, does that mean they support war crimes? Of course not. Debate is not endorsement.  Debate is how the public tests ideas, intentions, and competence. By refusing to debate, Balen is not morally isolating bad leaders. He is isolating himself from public scrutiny.  **Second: If Balen avoids debates, how do we know his agenda?**  So far, we mostly know what he is against.  We don’t clearly know:  * What kind of Prime Minister he wants to be * What his economic priorities are * How he plans to handle federalism, foreign policy, corruption, or social issues  **Third: Inflating numbers weakens moral arguments.**  In his comment, Balen says 76 children were killed.  But according to most credible sources, the number is closer to around 40. Forty murdered children is already horrific. Why inflate it?  When a leader who is “janne-bujhne, padheko” exaggerates facts, even for a moral cause, it damages credibility. Truth matters, especially when you claim moral superiority.  If we do not question our “good leaders” now, we are quietly preparing the ground for the next KP Oli or the next Prachanda. Unaccountable leaders don’t appear suddenly.  They are created by supporters who stop asking hard questions.  How should citizens evaluate him without hearing him defend his ideas? If he doesn’t explain these in a public, confrontational setting, then what mandate are people actually supporting? Are we voting for a plan Or just for a personality?  Are we supporting a vision or just an image?",

            "comments": "I feel like with Balen, the core issue is this: he’s a populist leader, and we’re living inside ahis populist wave. He knows it. He plays it well. And honestly, that’s not new in Nepali politics. Oli was a populist once. Prachanda too both rode massive emotional waves before settling into the same old politics.  So when Balen refuses to debate, he frames it as a moral position. In his mind, sharing a stage with someone he sees as corrupt or violent makes him look like he’s lowering himself. That works for his brand. It fits the image he’s built.  But underneath that, I think the context matters. Nepal is extremely divided after the recent protests. UML people have not recognised the martyrs , and anti-corruption protestors got labelled as foreign agents or anarchists .  So when Balen avoids debates, I don’t think it’s only moral disgust. I think he knows he’s riding a media-driven populist wave. He knows the youth are with him. He knows social media amplifies him more than anyone else. And he knows that an open debate where his statements can be pulled out of context, clipped, twisted could puncture his momentum.  He’s smart. He understands optics better than any politician in the country right now.  Meanwhile KP Oli is not operating on the same wavelength. Different generation, different communication style, different political instincts. Balen knows he benefits from contrast, not confrontation.  What I don’t fully get is the extreme skepticism toward Balen as if he’s already the next dictator-in-waiting. What do people want? Should we dive straight into chaos and pretend we don’t need any leader at all? Should we pretend there’s a magical alternative hiding somewhere?  If we distrust every single new face, then who exactly are we left with? UML? NC? Maoists? Or the monarchists’ fantasy of a saviour king? Because that’s basically the menu.  Nepal is a very young and very unstable country. I genuinely think we need a new symbol for a little while someone who can surf the populist wave without sinking the country. Four years, not a lifetime. Someone who isn’t carrying the entire weight of the old system.  I think Balen is avoiding debates because he’s protecting his narrative. And in this phase of Nepali politics, narrative is everything.|||Bhedas follow loud mouths coz they are too lazy to use their brain or just straight-up dumb to understand intellectual arguments. Just see indian netas giving speech. It's just a manipulation game. Doesn't matter whatever bullshit you spew. If you are confident and loud enough, dumb people will follow. And if Balen tries the same tactic as being loud mouth, and spewing insubstantial bullshit, he is gonna lose his current supporters.|||If anyhow the debate even initiates , balen would be the first victim of that debate coz oli and gagan would certainly make him nanga . Coz their whole life has been revolved around debates ,manipulating and false promises ones.  they would certainly raise some issues where balen would be speechless and the others will consider this as their win and  helping in  their election campaign.  For me ,Rabi would be far better than balen to face other possible pm candidates .|||At some point around 2020 US election, I used to follow the candidates, debates etc. I came across a video of Al-Gore conceding defeat, because apparantly there was some court issues etc. That rabbit hole lead me to a video, where they were analyzing how debate performance enhanded/diminished the changes of a presidential candidate. They found out that every very unrelated topics to policies and fitness of office affected candidates' chances. Like if they coughed at some point, started to fidget with something or things like that. Its because debates like this have too much spotlight in one (or few) events. And your margin of error is extremely low, and that is risky. And Balen at least seems to have understood this.  It is possible that Balen thinks he can't win in policy discussions. He has massively overpromised in the mayor election and underdelivered (common across world political scene I think). Although as Rabi dai said, \"Daaktar saap, bajet lekhna thalnus\", they certainly have capable person to make economic policy, Balen might fear accurately representing daktaar saap's work.  Another possibility I think is his public speaking ability. I was underwhelmed by his Janakpur presentation. Understandable that he came to such large crowd to speak for the first time in his life as a politician, he had massive pressure. In that 2020 or 16 may be not sure, US election I followed, there were people thinking somebody called Marko Rubio as a potential candidate and people say Trump just absolutely devoured him because Rubio was nervous.  Another one, that most people here in reddit are assuming, is that, a known charlatan in Oli will overpower him in terms of speaking. Oli might use this to whitewash his name and get more validation for himself.  It could be one or combination of these to avoid debate. The logic he posted in Oli's comment certainly seems weak in my eye. He should rather have not commented at all in his classic silence fashion.  Its not correct to assume that we wouldn't know his agenda if he doesn't come to debate. We have ghoshanapatra system in nepal. Me personally, I'd like my PM to at least face media. Be confident enough to speak confidently to the public. Its absolutely frustrating that we haven't had Balen answer any question from the public media ever.|||A public debate among all parties PM candidate should happen. Hamro questions haru answer garne. Afno plan and policies clearly vanne, yo sab debate bata tha hunchha.|||I agree with your first point.      \\> **Second: If Balen avoids debates, how do we know his agenda?**  Debates are not the primary source of a party's agenda. There are other ways of knowing his (RSP's) agenda. Balen is RSP now. And you can find lots of things on their website.   Also, RSP leader Swarnim Wagle said that they're purposefully delaying their election manifesto because they don't want it to be copied, which kinda makes sense.  You can check RSP's website and see if it answers questions. If it doesn't, I think they'll add more stuff in the election manifesto.  \\> **Third: Inflating numbers weakens moral arguments.**  I don't think the age of the number that were murdered is the issue here. So I'm gonna pass on that one.|||Kinaki public maa appealing huna unrealistic jhuta kura bolnuparchha hagane ra hatyara le jastai teivara.|||manxe le overestimate garexi mukh kholnu stupidity ho ni bro|||I also personally don’t think that he is a good orator.

I am not saying 2 points, just 1 place and 10m radius from the point.   He will say: KP oli is corrupt, thats why there is nothing.|||He can still debate with Gagan and Sampang. There needs to be a well experienced facilitator and few prompts could be provided prior to debates for preparation. If you are going to be a public leader, you need to come out and speak in public. If you are uncomfortable with debates, maybe politics is not a right sector for you. Balen has well educated team who can support with preparation. Yes, you need to study and make notes. With too many things going on, it might be overwhelming but that's the job you have chosen and people have expectations.|||He wants UML voters on his side. He is on the \"dont hate anyone\" train.

RSP is still a leader-centric experiment with no tested internal democracy. • Gagan doesn’t need to “open cases” dramatically to prove reform. Rule-based institutions > Facebook activism. Congress governments have historically strengthened courts, press freedom, and civil institutions — the only sustainable way to fight corruption. • Fear that “oldies will control Gagan” ignores reality: public pressure + strong seats = leverage. Weak Congress creates kingmakers; strong Congress forces internal reform. Now the real risk nobody wants to talk about 👇 If RSP leads a gov without experience, bureaucracy, or constitutional depth, policy paralysis is guaranteed. Populism works on stage, not in Singha Durbar. • Running a municipality ≠ running a federal state. • Moral outrage ≠ economic policy, foreign diplomacy, or crisis management. And coalition reality check: If RSP can’t govern alone (very likely), they’ll compromise faster than Congress ever did — just without institutional buffers. That’s when real “deal politics” begins, silently. Congress is flawed, yes. But it is reformable, accountable, and constitutional. Democracy doesn’t need saviors.

It’s just something I’ve noticed over the years, especially in Nepal.        Whenever a politician starts getting hardcore, die-hard supporters, things tend to go wrong sooner or later. Not instantly, not dramatically, but slowly. Power plus blind loyalty is a bad mix.        Problem ke ho bhane, we stop treating politicians like public servants and start treating them like heroes.

Galti bhayeni justify garincha, “at least aru bhanda ramro cha” becomes the excuse for everything, and loyalty matters more than competence.        At that point, politics stops being about policies and starts feeling like fandom. And fandoms are terrible at admitting when they’re wrong.        Support ideas, not personalities.

People here on reddit or any other social media are attacked baselessly because of some opinion they gave. Is this the new political culture we were trying to spread? Yes old parties didn't do right and created a bad political culture, but the new ones were supposed to be better isn't it? I hope this stops. We need to do better.",

There aren’t many good options in my country to receive international payments, so I used Binance P2P to convert USDT to local currency and send it to my bank account. This money is my salary, not trading profits or third-party funds.  This morning my bank froze my account without warning. These were my hard-earned savings that I was slowly building to someday build a home, so this hit me really hard mentally.  Tomorrow I’m going to the bank in person, but I’m unsure:  What exactly should I say to them?  What should I not say?  What documents usually help in these cases?  Has anyone here gone through something similar and successfully unfrozen their account?  Is there a real risk of losing the money, or is this usually just a compliance review?  I’m not trying to avoid laws or do anything shady. I just didn’t have a better way to receive my income.  Any advice or shared experiences would really help right now. Thanks for reading.",

I know, but AI could write 100-1000 of line of code at just in a minute, to be honest is the human who will have to review the code.  But the fact is, If the system is huge, there will be lot of moving point (logic), many time what to do how to solve this problem is not clear , there are lot of edge case the we have to think, test. As human we remember what we did yesterday, past month we can think and recall but AI is not aware of any think, unless we told explicitly tell is what to do. So, Ai is just a tool(powerful what, if you know when and how to use it).  So, don't think about the outcome just learn, focus on the foundation, learn the basic, try to do hard think your self, use ai to learn new concept not to code in the beginning, give yourself a chance to make mistakes and correct later. Choose any language (py/NodeJS/Goland) DSA, OOP, OS, DBMS, CN. Learn any framework, the path and way will itself be clear after you start moving forward.

That being said, the quality of code that LLM generate is direct result of how well you understand your problem. If you know how to breakdown the problem, the algorithm to use, applicable design pattern, test strategy, potential performance bottleneck, the quality of code that comes up is just amazing.

I’ve been working in this industry for the past 3 years although not in software side but on the infrastructure side.   I can assure you that this is definitely the case. Not all the companies will fail but 98% will for sure. The industry is super saturated, no new innovation is happening the chatbots won’t be sufficient as we now know how dumb and rudimentary they are. Of course some will survive like grok Gemini OpenAI Claude as they have massive corporations backing them up. And every other “AI tool” is basically a wrapper of one of these.   The head-cost of data centre operating alone is enormous not even counting the compute and hardware just utilities alone apart from GPUS, RAM, Server and Storage is more than what most companies can afford.   Ad is another factor that could change things but remember how many AIs there are, the ads have to super cheap as there’s always another company in china  with the same capabilities that’ll undercut your prices. So it’s not a stable solution either.   After the boom of social media there were 1000s of new social media platforms but 99% failed that is the same case here. Only the ones that are specialist in their broad field will succeed that is the ultimate fate.|||AI as a whole ta failed ma na halum j hos considering how dependent people are in generative AI, tyo chai fail teti easily na hola except chatGPT cuz holy moly they are going recklessly baru google le rmaro apporch gari rako xa espically apple wala deal where they just provided them model ani host garne and all sab apple le nai hernu parne re soo no additional overhead cost.  tara it will be interesting to see how these AI companies will make the best out of it cause aile ko condition herda ads halo vane ni its a chatbot soo  firstly ta people will keep asking ani secondly tyo jun answer generate garna lagne cost xa tyo level ko return ads le dela ki na dela tei mathi kati chai halxan hola ra ads ni.

Honestly, I'm sure your platform doesn't do it better in that regard. Who's going to use it? For what?  If you care about usability, just release the datasets (with doi or something). I'd just want the data APIs/ structured data. If I'm using it for training, I couldn't care less about the interface. Or better yet, preprocess, shuffle, and give the train-test-validation splits. Maybe a couple benchmarks with your analyst background.  Your project is scattered- you claim it does election intelligence, disaster and env monitoring, news aggregation. To me, it sounds like 3 different domains. To me, personally (not saying I'm representing your potential userbase), the site has no utility.

I don't know what works anymore. On the flip side it seems like more and more work is getting outsourced as the skill of people outside of the western countries have started to level up and with AI it seems like people everywhere are going to level up massively or equally.  What I see is crucial for the future is AI literacy, being able to leverage coding agents and be productive with it. But from my experience you need experience building applications to have good intuition with these AI agents. So if I was to give advice to people who want to stay in this field learn system design, architecture and build projects to implement them. Don't one shot applications/project. Build something complicated enough with these coding agents that you are forced to review the code, and if something feels unmaintainable learn to drive these agents in a way that you understand what you are building. And if you want to really stand out just build in public X, YouTube, tik tok but easier said than done cause us engineers by default are introverted. Just know that it's not you the market is just brutal, less hiring AI fear mongering holding new hires.  I spend too time in the X AI bubble so might not relate but this is where I see things heading. Maybe AI will be the level up that will bring more jobs to countries like ours so if I have hedge my bets it will be coding agents, system designs and building your own stuff.

It is clear what Oli’s words are, what they are like and what he says.

Despite being independent, Balen was able to work with them and produce results.   Now Balen has whole RSP behind him and he can be even more effective.   Arko most important thing is no corruption allegations against Balen.|||https://preview.redd.it/dwlm7a9sv0gg1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6235b0fc08dcc9d98fb462fc1373baa63f7c92b5  Dont say anything else this didi will cry that balen did nothing|||The works mentioned aren’t very much transformative and these works are done by most of the mayors across the country. Here’s point wise breakdown of things he has done that are more media boosted to show fairytale: 1. Scholarships: there was an existing rule that all private schools should give 10% scholarships to poor and talented students. I don’t deny some of schools tried to not meet 10% quota as the law but balen hasn’t done that all by himself. 2. Book free fridays are a good initiative from him and a new concept that students should focus on different aspects rather than only books. I like this decision of him. 3. Student lunch of rs25 is given from municipalities across nepal and it is mandated by local laws and noone can give less than 25 but they can increase based on spending capacity of the local government. So this is not the magical thing only he has done it is an automatic process by law. 4. Hospital beds: same story as scholarships, 10% beds should be subsidized according the law. He hasn’t done it but the existing laws have done, however the concern is some of the hospitals try to skip this csr. It is also implemented in most of the local governments across nepal. 5. He has done a good job to keep waste out of the city but as mentioned in this post “recycling “ as he had agenda to produce electricity upto 5MW from waste daily. Where is the electricity or a recycling plant? All the waste are dumped into banchare danda which effects severly to locals and their health. He fould have done better! 6. Tukucha and other rivers: there was a lot of hype arond these, but he just broke some infrastructure and left. No any restoration or pretective progress around those broken infrastructure. Such damaged infrastructure affects local residents in their daily life what about that? Could have done better! 7. He has built some falchas which look good! But the catch is the issue that came up with the amount of budget used to make falchas. There was a news that a falcha was made out of about 60 lakhs? He hasn’t clarified anything regarding this also. I agree heritage works are expensive but how was the tender process gone? As much i know mostly mahanagar handed out contracts directly without tender/bidding processes. It’s a grey zone for corruption and I can’t defend him in this context.  8. A very good work of him is retaining the encroached lands!! It was a vote bank for communists from a long time and noone could dare touching those sukumbasis and he dared. However he faced a lot of backlash but I appreciate his work in this matter. 9. He has managed parking and footpaths well! But the footpaths claim aren’t much visible on ground as claimed to be 250 places. It’s mostly around newroad and other areas still have narrow or no footpaths. It’s a media manufactured noise so he could have done better. 10. New busparks? Really? Where are the new busparks? Please enlighten me anyone. 11. Street lights: it’s not a huge number a mentioned in the post as ktm city is very big compared to these number and he could have done better! However he has installed some fire hydrants in inaccessible places which is very admirable. Also he had promised to install cctv across ktm while election campaigns, he could have done that at least  a pilot project in some places?  12. Digital: his live meetings is appreciable as transparency however it’s more of his favorable thing as he could have faced pressure inside a room full of oldies! Now he’s not facing any media or questions ?   Conclusion His delivery is below average than most municipalities in the country. However some of the efforts are genuinely impressive but most of the needed works can’t be done in his tenure. As ktm has budget of 25 arba+ yearly it couldn’t invest/spend a bare minimum of 25% each year! It’s far beyond national spending which is around 38%. He could have done better! For the present context he should face media do debates and present his idea of development and plans for it to the public. Everyone should be accountable and noone is”GOD”  This was a critical analysis of balen shah’s mayoral tenure.|||This too when the whole system was against him  Top dheki bottom kasaile kaam garna didaina thiye|||Actually hamlai physical development vanda pani suru ma policy level ma changes ra existing rules ko implementation chaiyeko cha!|||102 ko ambulance was a great help .

Him reclaiming public property and the waste management is way better. But he still underdelivered on a lot of his campaign promises. Kathmandu still remains one of the most polluted city in the world and he did nothing to help improve that. He promised improvements to the public transport, but didn't do anything. There are dozens of other promises like more accessible public toilets, improving drainage system, roads, environments, etc all of which he fell short on. I understand that not all of the campaign promises can always be achieved. But the problem is that he has such a cult of personality that people act like he's beyond questioning. And that always leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  I hope that he wins, we're long overdue on big leadership changes. These old corrupt politicians have to be weeded out and Balen feels like a best opportunity to do that. But when he wins, I hope people start holding him accountable to his duties and his words. Otherwise, we'll just be repeating the same cycle.|||Let's not still try to hype him more than he deserves. This man has done things that no one dared to do but everything that he did was very ground-level stuff that the public can easily see and praise him for. It is understandable to try and make changes while you have the authority so I do give him the benefit of the doubt. If he does win this election and does things that can really paint a picture for a better future for Nepal then I'll be convinced that we have finally found a leader. Until then I would like to be skeptical. I do not want to give myself up to the idea of him being the perfect leader for our country, I do not want to grow up with this fantastical image of him in my mind and turn into a blind follower like much of the oldies. I admire him and his attempts but nothing that has actually won me over. Still better than anyone else though.|||What is did is not the question. The question is how many promises he implemented. The work listed here are some done by central government. He did the work for creating contradiction. I have not seen anything that is sustainable. Of being a mayor of the biggest metropolitan city people have expected much more.|||Balen is one of those rare leaders who didn’t come from the usual political pipeline and that’s exactly why people trust him. He speaks straight, works on the ground, and isn’t afraid to upset powerful interests if it means doing the right thing. Whether it’s cleaning up Kathmandu, enforcing rules equally, or calling out corruption, he leads with action more than words. You may agree or disagree with some decisions, but you can’t deny his courage, independence, and intent to change the system rather than benefit from it…he may not be perfect, but he is the best among the current political leaders.|||Tyo education ko each and every point already existing chij ho sarkar le nai dinxa Lunch money ta..

Edit: are we really this logic challenged in Nepal? I am starting to agree that we have mostly bhedas here. The point I was making is not whether she is biased, a Congress fangirl or not. The point I was making was about this guy’s post. Based on the fact that her dad is a Congress he made a video accusing a girl- does that sound logical to you? My parents were RPP, I never supported them. Your parents may be UML or Congress, does that mean you are too?

And after some time, I heard some sound, you know that \"plyat plyat\" sound.  Now, the surprising thing is it was not even that private, the cabin had no doors anyone could walk in any moment. I stayed until they came outside, I was shocked they were plus 2 or 10 class students in college/school dress. I mean doing such thing, in somewhat public space with no fear.  I mean wtf. Is this normal today? Doing that at a young age and in a unsafe place like that? I even coughed and knocked the table to let them know that someone was noticing, but no they kept going.  They looked like Madhesi, I am not being racist here but anyone else would be too scared to do that shit in public. I mean go find a room if you are that desperate or go to some cave idk .  Edit: Watching possible minors engage in that behavior in a public space shouldn't be traumatizing? No wonder there’s something deeply wrong with today’s society.     Edit 2: I didn't realize while writing this, \"Trauma\" maybe is a very heavy word. I was deeply shocked, but I recognize that using the word “traumatized” can diminish the weight of real trauma, which isn’t what I intend. Cheers and lmao",

Communism is really stupid if you look back at humanity now.|||This should be categorised as fictional book|||some deep shit ! ... op is not asking for superficial answer|||Technically, yes, he wrote the manual. But, Marx was a man who saw a disease but prescribed a medicine that was more toxic than the sickness. He wanted to fix the world by changing who owns the \"stuff\" without changing the \"human being\" who uses the stuff.  ​When you try to enforce \"equality\" through a state, you don't get a paradise; you get a prison. This is why Marxism has failed wherever it was tried as a rigid political tool.  ​Why \"Harkabad\" is the Antidote TODAY:  ​The reason we look toward a philosophy like Harkabad (Prakriti, Samskriti, Pravidhi) instead of Marxism or Western Capitalism is because it addresses the foundation, not just the \"economics.\" Harka Smapang has time and again said it has nothing to do with his name. He is suggesting a solution that isn't a western copy but suitable to the soil we stand on.   ​Marxism says: \"Who owns the factory?\" ​Capitalism says: \"How much can the factory produce?\" ​Harkabad says: \"Do we even need the factory if it kills the river (Prakriti) and destroys the community's soul (Samskriti)?\"  If you ask me if we need \"Harkabad,\" I would say we need Consciousness.  ​Harka Sampang is essentially bringing consciousness to governance. When he goes out and carries stones with his own hands (Shramadaan), he is moving from the \"ugly\" socialism (taking from others) to the \"wonderful\" socialism (giving of oneself).  ​We don't need a \"Communist\" revolution where blood is spilled to change the law. We need a \"Harkabad\" style evolution where sweat is spilled to restore the land. ​You don't need a book from 19th-century Germany to tell you how to live. You just need to look at the earth beneath your feet and the people around you.",

We’re the \"Yam\" between two boulders that are suddenly moving much faster. Our $20B reserve is a solid war chest, but it’s sitting in a currency that’s being weaponized. If you want to understand the 2026 vibe, look at the Tariff Tussle: we are moving from a world of \"cheap global goods\" to \"expensive local security.\" For Nepal, the goal is simple but brutal: don't choose a side, sell electricity to whoever pays in hard assets, and pray our \"Non-Alignment\" holds while the giants fight over the Arctic and the Dollar",

I know why he is liked by so many given how dysfunctional your political system as been lately, but Balen's performance during his stint wasn't that great either.

The system itself is messed up, so obviously one person alone can’t fix everything on their own. There will be tons of hurdles, especially in the capital city of the country. Not just the capital, honestly, you can even say Kathmandu as Nepal itself, because it has become the center for everything. No matter what work you have, you somehow have to come to Kathmandu for it. So yeah, I understand his situation.  The one thing I really criticize him for is his lack of communication. That is something I am very disappointed about. During his entire campaign, he kept saying that he wouldn’t be like previous mayors and that he would stay in constant communication with the public. But after winning, he almost completely stopped connecting with people. There is no proper accountability, just one-sided Facebook status updates. This is the part where I am extremely disappointed in him and openly criticize him.  Other than that, I think he has actually shown that work can be done.

(Should I personally ask them to deduct 5% TDS?)  I also receive USD payments from an EU-based company. In that case, tax is deducted twice: first by the platform itself (approximately 3.5%), and then another 5% TDS is deducted here. When the funds arrive, my bank automatically converts the USD to NPR based on the prevailing exchange rate and credits it to my account in Npr.  I opened a USD account (dollar card) using my PAN. The annual limit is USD 500, but as far as I understand, this limit is only for payments/spending. Is it possible to increase this limit or ask the bank to keep incoming USD directly in that USD account instead of converting it to NPR?

There aren’t many good options in my country to receive international payments, so I used Binance P2P to convert USDT to local currency and send it to my bank account. This money is my salary, not trading profits or third-party funds.  This morning my bank froze my account without warning. These were my hard-earned savings that I was slowly building to someday build a home, so this hit me really hard mentally.  Tomorrow I’m going to the bank in person, but I’m unsure:  What exactly should I say to them?  What should I not say?  What documents usually help in these cases?  Has anyone here gone through something similar and successfully unfrozen their account?  Is there a real risk of losing the money, or is this usually just a compliance review?  I’m not trying to avoid laws or do anything shady. I just didn’t have a better way to receive my income.  Any advice or shared experiences would really help right now. Thanks for reading.",

I was working for one of the renowned company.. they made us use the cursor. They kept telling us to have 2x productivity.

This is already happening, and it will accelerate rapidly over the next 12–24 months as AI tools get mass-adopted inside companies.  That said, the outcome isn’t as simple as “developers are done.”  What’s actually happening is a restructuring of value.  As companies begin laying off junior and mid-level developers, they won’t eliminate development teams entirely. Instead, they’ll rely on fewer, highly reliable developers who can handle much more work with the help of AI. This creates a paradoxical situation: layoffs on one side, high demand on the other, but only for the right people.    If you come from a development background, the smartest move right now is simple:  * Become exceptional at using AI as a force multiplier. * Just knowing how to code won’t be enough anymore. That used to be the differentiator; now it’s table stakes.    **What matters now is:**  * Knowing how to think in systems * Translating vague requirements into clear specs * Using AI to generate, refactor, test, debug, and ship faster * Understanding architecture well enough to spot what AI gets wrong * Owning a specific niche deeply enough to solve high-value problems quickly    Companies won’t pay top dollar for someone who can “do everything moderately well.”  They will pay very well for someone who can fix a very specific, painful problem reliably.  And let’s be honest: saying “AI won’t replace humans” is already outdated. It has started replacing roles; not because AI is perfect, but because it’s good enough when paired with the right person.  If a non-technical person, like myself, someone who loves tech but never formally learned coding, can now build a full-fledged system using tools like ChatGPT and Replit, then the competitive bar has fundamentally shifted.  AI isn’t coming for jobs.   It’s coming for generic skill sets.    **So the choice is clear:**  * Either level up into a top-tier senior developer who designs systems, makes decisions, and leads execution * Or become a highly specialized mid-level developer with deep expertise in one niche and excellent AI leverage  Anything in between is the danger zone.  This isn’t a threat, it’s an opportunity.  But only for those who adapt early and intentionally.  Cheers!|||Lmao CRUD/landing page ta garihaalxa ni.

Wherever possible, mention architecture for ML projects.  Be ready to defend everything you have written ( including foundational knowledge and why you used what you used). If you apply for ML role/internship/trainee in Nepali companies widely, there’s a chance we might meet in technical round. All the best.|||Remove other skill.  Remove generic projects .

Limit the number of projects. As you said, if it's a small notebook only and you provide link to the project it devalues your profile.  Bring skills below the about me section. Make the about me section more personalized. Tailor both to the job. As a former academic I value latex skills but you don't need to mention zotero as a skill.  Impressive that you have published in your undergraduates. Finally, good luck and keep applying 🤞|||dont you think DS projects are very beginner level? i am in 12th rn and i have dont projects like these too so|||You are good to go, however you have added some naive projects (can't judge, but as you havent mentioned anything unique those are some basic stuffs). Focus on 1/2 core projects , refine them. As from the CV ig you are more into the agentic/applied AI stuffs that's currently booming, so focus on it rather than DS/ML if you want to enter the industry soon. Try Fine-tuning models, edge devices deployments , local end to end pipelines, and stuff  and you will be pretty strong.||| Too much Medical: You’ve got 4 medical projects. It looks a bit like academic practice. Swap 2 of them for something else (like Finance or E-commerce) to show you can handle different types of data. Flex that MLOps project: Move the ICU Deterioration one to the top! It’s your best flex because it mentions monitoring and drift (Prometheus/Grafana). That’s exactly what remote MLOps recruiters are looking for. Make Demos \"One-Click\": Make sure those [Demo] links go to a live site (Streamlit/Hugging Face). For remote jobs, if they can't see it working in 5 seconds, they might skip it. Add some numbers: In your internship part, try to mention a % improvement or a specific result. \"Built a model\" sounds okay, but \"Boosted accuracy by 15%\" sounds like a pro.|||[deleted]|||If you're  starting make it one page not 2|||Limit it to 1 page.

I’d cut it down to one page, keep just 2–3 strongest projects (the ones that are closest to real‑world work), and move your core technical skills (Python, ML, MLOps tools, cloud, etc.) near the top so a recruiter can see them in 5–10 seconds. The ‘other skills’ and very beginner projects can go or be merged so the focus stays on the work you’re most proud of.

This has now gotten out of hand, and this type of behavior will surely spread to other tourist areas, especially those closer to the border like Sauraha and others. I have seen these 'tourists' in Thars and other SUVs riding recklessly on our highways, mocking our rules and laws. In my local area in the Terai, there have been a couple of incidents where such SUVs have hit locals, including traffic police, and fled to India.

Local influencers need to unite and raise this issue from their platforms in their individual capacities. Otherwise, we might be just one incident away from breaking news.

We talk about decentralization, Federal system, we claim to have provincial capitals, yet when it comes to real power, real identity, and real rights, we are still forced to knock on Kathmandu’s doors. Why should that be? Kathmandu should be a place we visit by choice to walk its Streets, to bow our heads at Pashupatinath, Swayambhnath... not a place we are compelled to go just to be heard.|||I have seen his public speeches, they have never sounded as good as he does here.

Minor improvements to streets and basic municipal actions are being celebrated as extraordinary achievements, while far more serious national issues are at stake.  Nepal is a country with a deep-rooted identity, culture, and values that have existed for centuries. Yet today, we seem to be losing our sense of judgment, influenced heavily by social media popularity rather than thoughtful evaluation. In the process, we are slowly drifting away from our ethics, integrity, and understanding of how we should act as citizens and how we should choose to be governed.  Governance should not be reduced to visibility and viral moments. Appreciation must be based on substance, responsibility, and long-term impact, not hype. Otherwise, we risk mistaking short-term popularity for genuine leadership|||Balen will win for sure |||सबका सब हामीलाई वेवकुफ बनाईरहेछ… बाले भाईले पनि बनायो।|||Isnt RSP against provincial system.|||But wtf is he saying ? 😭",

RaSaPa ko ki Mutton Kaji Farm ko?|||Lol, honestly I didn’t even know he had uploaded something yesterday, but my post had perfect timing and it blew up. Even Bibek Thapaliya was hiding his affiliations, and KMAG still hides theirs. This guy just picked up that post and used it to make himself look good again.  I know how biased he is or maybe he doesn’t even realize how he got used. This is how Gagan operates. He invites these influencers, keeps them close, so they don’t post or make content against him. By doing these meetings, he slowly creates a soft corner in their mind and heart. So later, when Gagan messes up, they hesitate to criticize him because they’ve met him personally and think, “He’s a good guy.”  This is also how Gagan has managed to influence journalists across different media houses. Not all of them are in his inner circle, but he subtly shapes how they think. He invites them, talks to them, and slowly pushes the narratives he wants—who’s bad, what’s bad, and how to counter certain people.  The social media ban happened when Congress was in government, right? He won’t openly say, “Support me” or “Make things favor me,” but indirectly he keeps planting ideas like, I’m the only one who can fix this, and stuff like that.  This is a very familiar pattern with Gagan Thapa. First, influencers like these create noise online, and once it starts getting attention, he jumps in and talks about the issue as if he really cares. If he genuinely cared about social media, he could’ve spoken up against the social media ban when Congress was in power.  Even during the Gen Z protest, he subtly planted leaders like Tanuja and Rakshya Bam through his media outlet, Setopati. Their interviews were pushed again and again, filling the feed with news about what Rakshya and Tanuja were saying. Slowly, that turned into posts supporting Gagan Thapa. In the end, neutral and unaware people start feeling like, oh, Gagan is the hero we were looking for, just because these figures they follow are also backing him.  Ask him if he made any contents on Gagan Thapa?  \\-  Did he made video when Congress tried to sneak in a loophole in the cooling period? What happened to Khatiwada then after?  \\- Did he made how gagan thapa surviving without doing a single job?  \\- When Congress/UML tried to pass 5 years corruption expiry bill.  \\- Even to debunk PACT corruption where Gagan Thapa was alleged, even to debunk the allegation. (he wont, cz truth or not, many will know about this case and will have -ve perception of Gagan)  \\- Why is he surrounded and hangs out with Goons?  \\- Why WikiLeaks has Gagan Thapa as key embassy contact?  No, he won’t do that, because he’ll always have a soft corner for Gagan Thapa. That’s how Gagan Thapa works he spreads narratives through influencers like him, who knowingly or unknowingly end up producing such content.  Another example is Gagan doing small meetings on “populism” and then letting influencers create content around that topic to “spread awareness.” For influencers, it looks like he’s thinking about the nation. But from Gagan’s point of view, he knows those influencers will create content that ends up being subtly targeted at new faces.  https://preview.redd.it/x4nqjclj1veg1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=5303b0b09e8b772195bbc2a80116bd3b9f25bdb5|||RONB le tetro Balen ko chusekai chusai cha ta 3 4 barsa bata yo vanda badi jholagiri ta kai dekhechaina kunai media le koi lai gareko.

Isn't that really obvious though?|||Thats like asking, “Was Jesus a christian?”. Jesus was born as a Jew, but later promoted his own teachings. Likewise, Karl Marx was born in some form of monarchial bureaucracy, and later promoted his own philosophy( or idea). IMO, he was a communist because his belief lead to hundreds of communist revolutions throughout.|||K k ho yo communist ani yo aru k k ho socialist jata tatai xa aaile but don't know its meaning|||Ts ain’t tuff bub…|||[deleted]|||Was Adam Smith Economist?|||https://preview.redd.it/heqwwqodiffg1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c083dc45d51b17d83926436f0ff4538f13bac12b|||Did Hitler hate Jews 🤔|||\"Is KP Oli a child killer ?\" ahh question|||tait muji reddit ma ni sab pakhe nai hune raixan. basic humour ni bujhdainan. comment section checks out|||Is Bruce wayne Superman ?|||Yeah. Communism is really stupid if you look back at humanity now.|||This should be categorised as fictional book|||some deep shit ! ... op is not asking for superficial answer|||Technically, yes, he wrote the manual. But, Marx was a man who saw a disease but prescribed a medicine that was more toxic than the sickness. He wanted to fix the world by changing who owns the \"stuff\" without changing the \"human being\" who uses the stuff.  ​When you try to enforce \"equality\" through a state, you don't get a paradise; you get a prison. This is why Marxism has failed wherever it was tried as a rigid political tool.  ​Why \"Harkabad\" is the Antidote TODAY:  ​The reason we look toward a philosophy like Harkabad (Prakriti, Samskriti, Pravidhi) instead of Marxism or Western Capitalism is because it addresses the foundation, not just the \"economics.\" Harka Smapang has time and again said it has nothing to do with his name. He is suggesting a solution that isn't a western copy but suitable to the soil we stand on.   ​Marxism says: \"Who owns the factory?\" ​Capitalism says: \"How much can the factory produce?\" ​Harkabad says: \"Do we even need the factory if it kills the river (Prakriti) and destroys the community's soul (Samskriti)?\"  If you ask me if we need \"Harkabad,\" I would say we need Consciousness.  ​Harka Sampang is essentially bringing consciousness to governance. When he goes out and carries stones with his own hands (Shramadaan), he is moving from the \"ugly\" socialism (taking from others) to the \"wonderful\" socialism (giving of oneself).  ​We don't need a \"Communist\" revolution where blood is spilled to change the law. We need a \"Harkabad\" style evolution where sweat is spilled to restore the land. ​You don't need a book from 19th-century Germany to tell you how to live. You just need to look at the earth beneath your feet and the people around you.",

The feeling of lying in the bed with inherent thoughts of disperse happiness and the want to be able to understand if that happiness is as true as it seems is not new and it's also not wholly mine   I look at all these motion picture hoping to find something. And what that might be is as ananomus to me as it is to you. I look at these things, listen as they talk, but the existence of this feeling of watching doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm lying on this virgin earth, unmolested and untouched, devoid of any feeling of any sort except for one; consciousness. The consciousness reigns supreme within and without all within the vicinity of my existence.  At this point, life as you call it feels not a moments passing by or time flowing like my thoughts.  My head feels particularly heavy, as if I'm thinking but a thought is yet to process. But how can this be? Without a thought, how can you think? How can one live, without knowing the value of death? But that's not right either. For one to know the value of death,.one must first know of its qualities, it's feature in all it's dimensions. The inherent idea of a thought being, and to think not sounds stupid as if not funny enough. But you can't overlook the idea behind such ponder.   I take very long breaths as I think. My heart beats loud enough for me to hear it. And all my bodily functions seems very much obvious to me. This isn't new but it's not wholly mine.   Ahh now my head hurts a little to. But this shall too pass.   Theres this lingering feeling of solitude that I feel very sensationally. For solitude has been my friend far longer then any. The silence that made me feel alone after some years felt not pleasing but good enough to make me feel a bit stingy if it got disturbed.  But now this solitude engulfs me, strangles me so that I choke these thoughts out of me which are yet to be. But it was this very solitude that made me form a thought but now it want it back. Like how death waits right Infront of you, lingers above you with it's hands around neck, and then takes you through the stairs of lifelessness while you climb oblivious. Similar is the solitude that I experience right now, but instead of lifelessness, I climb and climb but towards nothing, I climb and climb but climb on empty thoughts.

My dad brought quite a few for me from KTM every few months, and I used to colour, solve crosswords etc. I event sent crossword solutions (never got published). This is where I knew about sudoku and still love sudoku to this day. I have read a lot of stories in this magazine and some of them  have been life changing for me. I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.  Few years later, through sheer luck (and a bit of reputation in my Nepali class), I got to be the guest editor of one edition of this magazine. Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र). I still absolutely vividly remember that letter, the paper, the handwriting, almost the content (almost 20 years later). The sender had found my information from the guest editor section. We had a few exchanges through postmail.  https://preview.redd.it/tfj91e7zb1dg1.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=129a8de5a073704752f011cebed54e0499c69c11|||Muna, Sunkesra, and kopila defined my childhood.

I am in US, and I can say 98% of my friends don’t support his policies. There are a few who do but there’s always an exception.   Now many, including myself, do support some level of checks and restrictions on immigration. Those who didn’t get in take that as being opportunistic or slamming the door after I got in. Far from it.   What I don’t support is people coming through illegal means. What I don’t support is people cheating and providing 100% false representation while applying. Then once they get in, they try to game the system and just be a leech sucking in the benefits without contributing. They are making it harder for the legitimate immigrants and that’s exactly what we hate.  Now I don’t support the current position of not granting any immigration visa indefinitely to Nepal. But you know why this happened? Because almost 40% of Nepalis, about 70-80k take welfare benefits from the US government. You don’t need it if you are a contributing member of the society (except for in some disability/age related case).   There are people coming to US to get free medical treatment. One performer got the treatment and left the Us without paying the medical bills- that person is now banned from coming. Another famous pair got the DV and justified their entry by saying they get free medical for their kid (their case may be legit, but I am just giving an example of what people have been doing).   The administration is going to the other extreme to curb this- but some of it is because the past administration didn’t do anything to prevent it from happening.|||I seriously doubt the accuracy of this sentiment. Nepalis who have settled in America invariably work to bring other family members here. The effort is long and hard, and many are still in process, meaning that spouses, siblings, and others are now cut off from coming over. My brother in-law was able to finally secure his wife's visa a few weeks ago, after working on it for 2 years.  a few weeks later and she wouldn't get to come, so no, Nepali uncles and aunties aren't supportive, and there is no indication that most nepalis voted for trump.  The other thing to consider is the message behind the visa suspensions.  The trump administration is basically saying that immigrants who have come here have not improved conditions, but rather they have made it worse by taking advantage of government programs that they are not entitled to. In other words immigrants are lazy, and thieves. Not a lot to take pride in about that.|||Let me know what you are smoking..seems like good stuff.|||Just like the viral trend chori manchey ko khutta tanney chori manchey naai huncha.

Legal or not they're grabbing anyone off the street that isn't white and taking them to a detention center. If they can prove their residency they get released, maybe. It is completely white supremacist Nazi shit. It's horrible and I'm ashamed to be an American. These are my friends and neighbors, I don't ask people what their immigration status is, I could care less.   It's usually portrayed that undocumented immigrants are a drain on government services, but that is a lie. They pay taxes since it's automatically deducted from the paycheck to a social security number that doesn't belong to them. If they try to use the services they're caught and deported  We're fighting back but our leaders are ineffective, the police are working with ICE and if we call in the military we're unsure of whose side they'll take.   Trust me you don't want to visit the US anytime soon|||I am also very happy.|||Same reason you and others who are aspiring to migrate toUS are sad. Immigration is not good for lot of citizens. Higher housing prices, rent, more competition for jobs. Companies benefit from supply of cheap labor while workers suffer from depressed wages. There’s no need to portray this as some kind of good vs evil thing. Those guys are looking out for their own interests just like you are. No country is required to keep its borders open to outsiders. Nepali people don’t want any immigrants in Nepal and are super racist, but when they face similar treatment abroad, they’re first to complain. They’ve already gotten their citizenship, why should they care about you or any other future immigrant?|||2 types of people 1.

Why would anyone be happy about the current situation ? All of you who agree with the statement are in Nepal who couldn’t make it to the US.|||May I dare present a different perspective?   Not everyone who votes Republican is \"hiding the ladder since they've made it\". That claim is lazy, false, and ignores basic economic reality.  Some of us vote based on numbers, not slogans. When you are paying over $100,000 a year in taxes (household)—income tax, state tax, property tax, sales tax—and you don’t see proportional benefits in return, fiscal policy starts to matter a lot. At that level, voting conservative isn’t ideological—it’s rational. Lower taxes, limited government, and accountability in spending simply align better with that reality.  Paying six figures into the system and being told you’re “privileged,” “selfish,” or morally inferior for questioning where that money goes is not persuasive—it’s alienating. Wanting to keep more of what you earn does not make you hateful. It makes you financially literate.  Many Republican voters reject racism and extremism outright. What they do reject is runaway taxation, bloated government, and being constantly generalized or morally lectured by people whose policies they fundamentally can’t relate to. The same way not all Democrats are extremists, not all Republicans are villains.  And yes—we are also tired of being lumped together with fringe elements just because we don’t align with extreme progressive ideology. Disagreeing with activist politics, identity absolutism, or ideological purity tests does not make someone anti-human. It means they prioritize practicality over performative outrage.  People vote based on lived experience. For households paying $100k+ in taxes every year, conservative policies often make more sense. That’s not hate. That’s math.",

What about the Dhanraj Gurung sahakari case?  - You were part of the Government Efficiency team when the recent UML–Congress coalition government was formed. Will you question or take responsibility for the recent GenZ killings? Your party member Ramesh Lekhak was also the Home Minister at that time—have you questioned him about this?  - You have been a Member of Parliament four times, and during your tenure, the Congress has formed the government multiple times. Can you point to any concrete, policy-level achievements you delivered during your party’s time in government?  - What about Aftab Alam case during your party's government was he rightfully being prosecuted or your party's government have him impunity from jail, what about that case?",

Deuba, as an individual, may once have been a true leader—but over time, the gang culture around him is what turned everything rotten and made him look bhrasta.  From this point onward, Gagan is free.  Free from:  All blame linked to Arzu  All accusations about money in Deuba’s house  All baggage related to Bhutani saranarthi  All the kandas, Teramox, and backroom deals  All blame connected to Lekhaks and their networks  These were never Gagan’s sins to carry.  So why should he keep answering for other people’s cults? Why should a reformist voice be held hostage by the corruption, compromises, and power games of an old guard that refuses to let go?

Don't get me wrong there are shortcomings from him and nobody is perfect but most of the questions you raised here are poor attempt to make him look bad.  You have to realize that even though Gagan is a prominient member of Nepali Congress, he was never the executive. Every decision the party makes as a whole, the chairman (Deuba) has the supreme authority and he is little to no say in any of the decisions.  Even then, he has clearly spoken against all wrongdoings. And you say \"just speak\". But that's the problem of not being in executive power, he can only speak.  You trying to  make the money burnt in Deuba's house somehow a crime by Gagan Thapa clearly tells me that you are just trying to hate. Otherwise as everyone else has said, there is a special probe commission formed to specifically study the burnt money case and all we can do is wait for their report and the government will file the case if there is wrongdoing (which we all believe there is). And Gagan has clearly affirmed this, as any sane person would. You should read him and listen his many public interviews/videos and not just assume he didn't say anything.  He has clearly said multiple times that any and all involved in sahakari kanda should be investigated including naming people from his own party by name, again multiple times in multiple of his public appearences and writings, you should read/watch/listen those. The government should file cases. I don't understand how this would be his fault.  If you again watch his comments in good faith and listen to his parliament speeches, he as said multiple times that  the public is angry, they need delivery. He said he opposed the coalition and publicly opposed it multiple times. But he is not the executive, deuba is. When there is coaliation, he has the moral responsibility to make the government successful. He was indeed in the efficiency team and he said he tried is best to make the government successful because he knew people needed delivery even though he opposed the coalition. He publicly told long before the Gen-Z protest that he couldn't get the government to do what the efficiency team was supposed to do, and he left it. So I don't think that makes him culpable for the massacre during gen-z protest.  But still he has taken moral responsibility for what happened during the protest. He has apologized multiple times for any moral culpability he has. He said he immediately asked the party leadership to break coaliation in the first day of protest and asked Lekhak to resign. Lekhak did resign but the party didn't leave coalition because again Deuba is executive and makes the decision.  He has been parliament member four times. The first time and he failed to deliver the constitution as promised which he was elected for. The second tenure was again the CA election, which delivered the constitution and you can't deny he played crucial role in making the constitution, and he (among all others) delivered the constitution. The next term he went to the parliament again and became health minister and people say he delivered some reforms in health sector (again refer to public catalogues of his works during this tenure). And you have to grant that he has been constant voice in the parliament on various issues, which the MP is sent for. This last time was a short tenure, but as everyone he has played crucial role in voicing concerns in the parliament. Ironically he strongly demanded there be independent probe in sahakari case and there have been multiple arrests and cases filed against some major fraudsters. You should grant that this was successfull. But we can always demand more. I am not his prabakta but to me seems like he could have definitely done more here and I am sure he agrees.  Yeah what about the case? Alam was a proven convict. But congress did dirty by lobbying to release him. I haven't seen him support Alam's release. Again, I am not sure the details of his release but how is Gagan culpable for the crime Alam committed?  Again I am not his prabakta. I try to speak with reason. You could certainly question that he didn't do enough at policy level as MP to propose new laws and pass them. You could ask him that he could not do enough to break Deuba stronghold. But he precisely did that recently.  Now I am watching him closely, he is now in the position to deliver at least from his party level. Make him accountable ask him tough questions. But the aforementioned questions seemed more like an attempt to make him bad (except may be how many policy changed did he make in 1 1/2 tenure as MP except CA MP which they delivered constitution).

At home, my bags were 23 + 22 kg, and my carry-on was 20 kg.  At the check-in counter, the agent told me to move some items from my carry-on into one checked bag so I’d only have to pay excess for one bag. I did exactly that and reduced my carry-on to 12 kg.  Magically, after this:  •\tChecked bags became 32 kg and 25 kg    •\tCarry-on became 13 kg  Somehow, between weighing the bags at home, weighing them again at the counter, and then re-weighing them a third time, my bags gained weight out of nowhere.  I was exhausted and didn’t have the energy to argue, so they charged me for two excess bags — $80 each. No leeway, no consideration.  To make things worse, the agent openly suggested that if I paid cash and didn’t need a receipt, they could lower the price. At that point it was obvious they were trying to pocket the money. Absolutely shameless.  I paid by card, waited until they gave me a proper Turkish Airlines receipt, and made sure everything was legit.  If you’re flying Turkish Airlines out of Tribhuvan International Airport, I strongly suggest avoiding the chubby girl working at the Turkish Airlines check-in counter. She was incompetent from the start — struggling to even open the computer system and issue a boarding pass, while agents at nearby counters were processing passengers with ease.  Extremely bad service and blatant attempts at corruption. This kind of experience is one of the many reasons I seriously hesitate to visit Nepal anymore.",

Happened to me in airport outside nepal as well.  The main difference is that airport scales are \"trade-legal\" industrial devices required by law to be regularly calibrated for high precision, whereas home scales are consumer-grade gadgets that use cheaper sensors and are almost never recalibrated. Additionally, the environment distorts the numbers; weighing a bag on a soft home carpet or trying to balance a large suitcase on a small bathroom scale often creates a \"lighter\" reading than reality, unlike the airport's large, stable platforms embedded in hard concrete. Because of this, the airport scale is generally accurate, while your home scale is just an estimate that tends to drift.|||[removed]|||Are we allowed to video record our interactions there?

So, my suggestion would be you read yourself and don't judge him based on my opinion or other few incidents or stories mentioned in the comments.   Personally, He gave me the definition of democracy. Here is one story of his conversation with his nephew Naresh Koirala.   *Naresh himself had been puzzled by his uncle’s decision to accept the result. On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP.

Back then, the place had such good vibes. It felt peaceful and special. There were fewer Indian tourists, and the ones I did see were mostly honeymoon couples who genuinely came to enjoy their time and respect the place.Nowadays, when I see videos on TikTok, Pokhara feels very different. There seems to be a sudden surge of tourists who come only to make content, create mess, and show no respect for the city. It doesn’t feel like tourism anymore it feels careless.On top of that, the local leadership has also disappointed me. The mayor of Pokhara, in my view, represents everything that’s wrong with corruption in Nepal. Because of poor governance and lack of accountability, a beautiful city is slowly losing its soul.|||As a solo white female. I didn't enjoy my time in Pokhara.

The next steps depend on what you want the outcome to be.   1. If you want mediation and your relationship to continue, have a serious discussion with your husband and let him know what the stakes are, either to work on the relationship together, or to end it. Couples therapy is also helpful for many. There's no point fighting forever. Has anyone else witness the violence, do you have kids? Does your husband drink? Does he have his own social life? Does he have any mental health issues? Many things factor. But a discussion with your husband should be your first thing to do and let him know boundaries and also reflect on yourself too.   2. If you want to end it, depends on where you are. Think through everything and then only decide. If you have kids or not. You need to contact a lawyer as well. What is your financial situation.

Many people will try to convince you to stay and tell you that he will change but ask to yourself do you truly believe that?  Also you mentioned that “maile pani farkauthe”, if he hits you don’t hit back but report it to police (unless it is life threatening) and also talk to your parents/relatives/friends about it don’t bottle up till too late.  I know sometimes it is difficult to let go because of many reasons (eg. visa issues or money issues) but what if in the heat of the moment he hits you and you get a lifetime disability or even die; so for your own safety, i suggest to dump his ass.|||Leave before its too late|||Hi OP, garo huncha thulo decision lina divorce jastai.

Please find ways to get out from there..... Even if your parents don't support trust me and many others, this is not normal..... For the love of yourself, you should leave asap.|||I just realized you said tmle pani haat haltheu, hmmm.... If you both truly want to work it out.... Now I'm thinking about it after reading your comments that you really love him....   In that case, talk to him what is bothering him, if he has had lot of childhood trauma, stress, unprocessed emotions, it really does affect a person, they become like time bomb and a small trigger can make them very angry ..... Now note that I'm saying this in hopes that you both truly want to work it out..... Talk to him, let him know anger at this level is not normal and he can gently start a talk therapy or men's circles, or somatic healing sessions, emdr therapy (if it's a part trauma), etc. there are so many options in today's time to start a healing journey. I'm in full support for people to move this route, even if you are violent in the past. It's not easy being human and I get it. Please consider, I hope this helps. But please remember, if you are going to lead this journey for both of you, remember to be patient, kind, and loving. Sometimes you will have to let the other person be so angry and be able to watch them (it's a specific emotional release session) without you absorbing their emotions. For him, and for you too probably, when emotions come, you both have to remember it's NEVER about the other person. If you would like each other to do something, you can request but nobody is obliged to follow, just having this much boundary will help you both to process your emotions on your own. Start therapy or just start writing on your own, you will notice you stress or anger is often coming from something else within yourself, not from people around you.   I hope this help a little bit. Take care, pass love to each other. If it's easier, bring serious talk when you are getting romantic, I think that helps you both absorb and understand better. Take care please. It's not impossible to change yourself and your relationships in this time, especially with so much options, start meditation, therapy, dance, especially moving body helps move your emotions too. Take care.|||Just have a conversation with your husband. Ask him why is he is acting like that? IS he insecure about you or what? make everything clear. Why is he acting in that manner?

I know why he is liked by so many given how dysfunctional your political system as been lately, but Balen's performance during his stint wasn't that great either. Sadly, no culture of constructive criticism in Nepal.|||I am satisfied with his work because I know it’s not easy. The system itself is messed up, so obviously one person alone can’t fix everything on their own. There will be tons of hurdles, especially in the capital city of the country. Not just the capital, honestly, you can even say Kathmandu as Nepal itself, because it has become the center for everything. No matter what work you have, you somehow have to come to Kathmandu for it. So yeah, I understand his situation.  The one thing I really criticize him for is his lack of communication. That is something I am very disappointed about. During his entire campaign, he kept saying that he wouldn’t be like previous mayors and that he would stay in constant communication with the public. But after winning, he almost completely stopped connecting with people. There is no proper accountability, just one-sided Facebook status updates. This is the part where I am extremely disappointed in him and openly criticize him.  Other than that, I think he has actually shown that work can be done. He has also given inspiration to young people to enter politics.|||Done In some ways  . Even non Exciting programs .Some Jhara tareko type. Some Unfeasible .. some better options appear and done.

            "body": "I used to watch In-Depth Story, but I’ve realized the content is fundamentally superficial. Here is why I believe the channel fails its audience:  1. The content is rarely original. It is compiled from existing news articles that anyone could find doing Google. It’s a summary service, not investigative journalism.  2. As it relies on secondary sources, it never goes deep. It stays on the surface of issues, prioritizing smooth editing over raw facts.  3. The channel’s main narrative is simple: 'The country is doomed.' This is a lazy narrative. Telling us that politicians are bad or the system is broken is stating the obvious. It validates anger but offers no insight.  If you want to be entertained, it works. But if you want to be informed, this is a waste of time.",

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.  I (21M) and my sibling (15F) are taking care of our parents during the day and our cousins help at night. Because of this, we’ve missed months of classes but we don’t really have a choice right now.  If anyone is able to help even a small amount, it would mean a lot to us.  I’ve verified the case with two of the mods and I’ll be posting medical reports in the comments as well.  Please DM or comment if you can help in any way. Even sharing this post would really help.",

I got tired instantly. It really sucked. We were finally able to catch him. The dude tried to hit me up with stones and all. but i managed to get hold of him.  I have not smoked since and i don't intend to ever again. Also, i left the job|||Congratulations 🎊|||Agree with you!! You can't plan on quitting it has to be sudden with no backups or cheeky puffs!!   Stopped smoking since may 2023 its been a life changing decision. And about the urge to smoke it never left me. After 2yrs when i see someone smoke on the roadside i get the urge to smoke. Ig once you started smoking the urge will last forever just don't loose to that urge.   And you'll be so proud of yourself|||Life won't get any better.

I quit smoking cigarettes and weed couple of years ago. Weed ta aboh kaam ma Drugs and Alcohol test le garda kheri ho tara cigarettes was coz one morning I was at work and some guy walked in after smoking. Teti bela I just started thinking to myself, is this how bad I smell and does everyone in the office look at me disgusted like I am doing right now? So tya bata I just stopped smoking automatically. I also threw away all my packs.  Later on I got urges to smoke after couple of months and that’s when I fucked up… I started vaping and that shit was too addictive than cigarettes because you can literally vape in your room, car anywhere… so it took me a while to decide to stop vaping too after 3 years…   Whatever you are all doing, please don’t turn to vaping thinking it will help you quit cigarettes… it will just reverse everything!  To all the quitters, please stay strong 💪🏼|||crazy|||Great job. I did that with weed. Decided this is my last one and it has been 7 years haven't smoked any.  I'm using vape to quit smoking but I'm happy with smoking 1 pack every year.",

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

Most of the teachers in school and college all of the are pedophiles.|||I'm not aware of the definition - is it like somebody who's grooming girls under 18? Are you using the term loosely?  It's an individual-thing and not a profession-thing. Girls sending DMs to get referred (when they have no skills) is also more common than you think. I get many DMs asking for free help (refactors)/ referrals (barely know them/ barely seen their code) and I just ignore them. I help many people (m/f) on a daily basis, and I've never met most of them. I know many of my 'male' senior friends (no female senior dev friends) do the same.  You should clear your exams first. Last bullet point sounds like a good plan.  Most people here will be happy to review 1-2 projects for free. I'll jump in if it's Python/ Next.js/ ML. Just post your github repo on some relevant community and they'll do free reviews.   Edit: I dont do free mentorships, happy to review repos/ coding practices.|||In my experience, Girls seem to help girl only when they are on some “female tech organization” and it’s rarely a technical mentorship. They should be helpful without such aids too. I am sorry that you had to deal with these. that’s extremely disgusting.  Still there are bunch of female led tech groups - they have ties with it company - approach them.|||I get what you r saying but the term pedo applies to people who r way older and trying to groom n trap minors (under 18).

A young girl in her early 20s reached out to me for a referall for associate engineer. I hesitated a bit seeing her technical knowledge.

I thought it wouldn't be that difficult since I have decent projects and a year of experience, but I remain jobless for next three months. It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

(Should I personally ask them to deduct 5% TDS?)  I also receive USD payments from an EU-based company. In that case, tax is deducted twice: first by the platform itself (approximately 3.5%), and then another 5% TDS is deducted here. When the funds arrive, my bank automatically converts the USD to NPR based on the prevailing exchange rate and credits it to my account in Npr.  I opened a USD account (dollar card) using my PAN. The annual limit is USD 500, but as far as I understand, this limit is only for payments/spending. Is it possible to increase this limit or ask the bank to keep incoming USD directly in that USD account instead of converting it to NPR?  Another question is that, if i’am to receive payments from a subscription based service from a platform apps i made, i basically can’t from nepal, for that i either need the LLC or C-Corp registered in US banks that accepts remote workers no ?  Up to how much extent can nepal banks provide services to be able to pay and receive payments internationally ? Or which banks ? That can win over the limitation of dollar cards ?

But motivation usually comes from showing the path, not just the end result. A screenshot shows where you landed, not how you got there.  People here asked genuine questions about niche, stack, timeline, experience, etc because that’s the part that actually helps others move in that direction. That’s where the value would have been. Without that context, the post ends up reading more like a soft flex than mentorship. Nothing wrong with flexing, just don’t call it motivation if you’re not giving people anything they can learn from or replicate.  With 5+ years of experience you’ve seen enough of the field to know that the “how” matters more than the “what,” especially for people in Nepal who are trying to break into the global market.

There aren’t many good options in my country to receive international payments, so I used Binance P2P to convert USDT to local currency and send it to my bank account. This money is my salary, not trading profits or third-party funds.  This morning my bank froze my account without warning. These were my hard-earned savings that I was slowly building to someday build a home, so this hit me really hard mentally.  Tomorrow I’m going to the bank in person, but I’m unsure:  What exactly should I say to them?  What should I not say?  What documents usually help in these cases?  Has anyone here gone through something similar and successfully unfrozen their account?  Is there a real risk of losing the money, or is this usually just a compliance review?  I’m not trying to avoid laws or do anything shady. I just didn’t have a better way to receive my income.  Any advice or shared experiences would really help right now. Thanks for reading.",

Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||[deleted]|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||Skill issue.

My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights.

Sure, it is not realistic to overlook the economy or the job scarcity that is so prevalant now, maybe for the longest time yet but it doesn't adjucate to the premise of Software Engineering isn't feasible as a career anymore, at least to the degree people are making it out to be. AI-driven development may very well be a 'bubble', and when it pops and the dust settles, the next big thing will provoke a similar reaction. While it is evident that people with years of experience are at a loss right now, and even more so for students trying to make it in tech, undergrads or young aspirants.  I believe it was never about how greatly any technology overshadows the current technology even if it transforms areas of it by overwhelming amounts but the ability to use it to your advantage.

Regarding AI, its here to stay wear we like it ir not. We don't need to me AI/ML experts we just have to learn how to use it, or embrace it, and not reject it. Its on the hype but it will die down and come back to its default.|||Jack of all with understanding of Ai tools and how to implement wins. Be the jack of all. Don’t try to master one thing. That’s what I suggest.   Decent apps can be build in a day if you know the requirements, understand system design and  logic needed. You need to understand things like how apps are build, deployed etc.  At least in US, Ai replacing engineerings is not exactly false.   With Automated workflows and Ai agents, team needing 100 members could only need couple members. That does mean Ai replaced 98 people among 100. That’s how I see.",

            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

If I have the time, I might join if I'm free. If they were inviting Harvard professors, it'd cost you 10x more to attend. Events take time and effort. Many costs. Let's switch the focus to you. Have you organized an event? Was it easy? Who did you invite as a speaker?   If you're a student, why care about an enterprise AI event? I fail to see your criticisms. Not everybody needs to start a business to prove their credibility. It literally takes <20k.  I don't expect them to cover hf peft best practices. It's an event for enterprises. I don't have expectations for food. If I meet somebody interesting, that's good enough for me.  I think you're being confused between training courses and networking events. Plenty of events if you want to learn. ANAIS, NAAMII charged 12k for students this year. Was fine. Good stuff. Made many friends.  I dislike AI non-profits that claim to do research and fail to have any publications or research projects, yet say they're open to collaborations. But the AI association isn't a research body, probably does just events. Executives don't open up VS code and grind all day. That's a very small minority. They're skilled, just not in a way that appeals to you. They bring in investors, organize events, lots of things. If you ask me, there's a lot more to a product than PRs and merges. If you're not already the Lead for some MNC, some humility helps. It's dumb to say a CEO doesn't have skills because they don't code like you do, don't you think?  I'm not affiliated with naamii or any non-profits.|||On one hand, I can see the low effort poster with multiple mistakes and the fluffy pointless nonsense that is the main paragraph probably written by ChatGPT with a 6 word prompt. There's no mention of the \"Experts\" that are supposed to lead the thing.  On the other hand, your post has offered no genuine criticism of the event. It is just as pointless as the poster. Maybe offer anecdotes? Some tangible verifiable reason to justify your \"nrs 350 for 2.5 hours is a massive waste\".  Organizing an event comes with some cost, and some of that must be passed to the visitor. NRS 350 is some money, it is definitely not a lot of money. It is most definitely not \"expensive\" for an event in any sense of the word.   Justify your claims. Why is this a \"scam\"? What other way can a person \"use nrs 350 to learn by yourself\" (your words)? Who are the speakers and why are they unqualified to speak on this program?  *disclaimer: not affilaited to this org or event*, *just a random angry redditor*",

I can probably create apps that would take more years in a month. So there is a plus point to this as well.|||managing data layer is the hardest part of frontend(at least to me) and AI also fails in this aspect when the codebase is too big. i think developers should focus more on this aspect rather than limiting them to the ui layer only.|||I have not written single line of code over past few months after I started using github copilot its quite easy to find bug fix errors or build features which would take me a day or something I can do that within an hour and so baki ma chill ma basxu. AI leh job lehla tara aileh chai dherai sajilo vaxa 🤣|||So start standing out. I am a 2 years experienced backend developer and I did this sprints task in just 2 days. Everything was finalized with the product owner and I researched a bit in the code base what existing tested methods exist. Then boom, give cursor clear instructions. Done in 10 minutes. So then I realized what I have in hand that an inexperienced ones have - already useful skill, product knowledge and codebase knowledge. That is helping me in productivity. But the real growth and survival will happen if I gain the skills of a lead like a team lead, a manager, a product owner, or solution architect or any kind of lead is fine. And you won’t see many leads in a team. Leads are already out standing. So You have to figure out how you can be the lead.|||All|||AI will **replace a significant portion of developers**, and not in some distant future. This is already happening, and it will accelerate rapidly over the next 12–24 months as AI tools get mass-adopted inside companies.  That said, the outcome isn’t as simple as “developers are done.”  What’s actually happening is a restructuring of value.  As companies begin laying off junior and mid-level developers, they won’t eliminate development teams entirely. Instead, they’ll rely on fewer, highly reliable developers who can handle much more work with the help of AI. This creates a paradoxical situation: layoffs on one side, high demand on the other, but only for the right people.    If you come from a development background, the smartest move right now is simple:  * Become exceptional at using AI as a force multiplier. * Just knowing how to code won’t be enough anymore. That used to be the differentiator; now it’s table stakes.    **What matters now is:**  * Knowing how to think in systems * Translating vague requirements into clear specs * Using AI to generate, refactor, test, debug, and ship faster * Understanding architecture well enough to spot what AI gets wrong * Owning a specific niche deeply enough to solve high-value problems quickly    Companies won’t pay top dollar for someone who can “do everything moderately well.”  They will pay very well for someone who can fix a very specific, painful problem reliably.  And let’s be honest: saying “AI won’t replace humans” is already outdated. It has started replacing roles; not because AI is perfect, but because it’s good enough when paired with the right person.  If a non-technical person, like myself, someone who loves tech but never formally learned coding, can now build a full-fledged system using tools like ChatGPT and Replit, then the competitive bar has fundamentally shifted.  AI isn’t coming for jobs.   It’s coming for generic skill sets.    **So the choice is clear:**  * Either level up into a top-tier senior developer who designs systems, makes decisions, and leads execution * Or become a highly specialized mid-level developer with deep expertise in one niche and excellent AI leverage  Anything in between is the danger zone.  This isn’t a threat, it’s an opportunity.  But only for those who adapt early and intentionally.  Cheers!|||Lmao CRUD/landing page ta garihaalxa ni.

Limit the number of projects. As you said, if it's a small notebook only and you provide link to the project it devalues your profile.  Bring skills below the about me section. Make the about me section more personalized. Tailor both to the job. As a former academic I value latex skills but you don't need to mention zotero as a skill.  Impressive that you have published in your undergraduates. Finally, good luck and keep applying 🤞|||dont you think DS projects are very beginner level? i am in 12th rn and i have dont projects like these too so|||You are good to go, however you have added some naive projects (can't judge, but as you havent mentioned anything unique those are some basic stuffs). Focus on 1/2 core projects , refine them. As from the CV ig you are more into the agentic/applied AI stuffs that's currently booming, so focus on it rather than DS/ML if you want to enter the industry soon. Try Fine-tuning models, edge devices deployments , local end to end pipelines, and stuff  and you will be pretty strong.||| Too much Medical: You’ve got 4 medical projects. It looks a bit like academic practice. Swap 2 of them for something else (like Finance or E-commerce) to show you can handle different types of data. Flex that MLOps project: Move the ICU Deterioration one to the top! It’s your best flex because it mentions monitoring and drift (Prometheus/Grafana). That’s exactly what remote MLOps recruiters are looking for. Make Demos \"One-Click\": Make sure those [Demo] links go to a live site (Streamlit/Hugging Face). For remote jobs, if they can't see it working in 5 seconds, they might skip it. Add some numbers: In your internship part, try to mention a % improvement or a specific result. \"Built a model\" sounds okay, but \"Boosted accuracy by 15%\" sounds like a pro.|||[deleted]|||If you're  starting make it one page not 2|||Limit it to 1 page.

After +2, I applied to Canada and the USA for further studies, but my visa got rejected. Instead of wasting a year, I joined BBS , and now I’m in my 3rd year.  When the visa didn’t work out, I decided to take responsibility for my own future. I started learning about AI, automation, and new technologies. Over time, I picked up practical skills, experimented a lot, and eventually started freelancing. Right now, I work as an AI Developer on Upwork, and even in the early stage, I’m earning more than 1 lakh NPR per month.  I’m not an expert and I still have a lot to learn but I know my strengths. I’m good at managing things, people, sales, content, and marketing, and I can execute fast. I have learned most of this by consuming real-world information online and applying it through actual work.  I have big plans in the AI space, but I also know that building something great alone is very difficult. That’s why I am looking for a technical co-founder, someone strong on the engineering side so we can build, learn, and grow together.  The idea is to:  * Start very small and lean * No heavy investment * Focus on AI services / automation / agency-style work * Only basic costs like hosting or APIs * Aim to generate revenue within 2–3 months  I currently live with my parents in Butwal, but I want to move to Kathmandu, take a small flat, and fully focus on building. I also plan to start creating content alongside the business.  I’m looking for someone who:  * Is disciplined and focused * Serious about long-term growth * Not into unhealthy habits * Wants a simple lifestyle with deep work * Has strong technical skills or is deeply committed to developing them  Most importantly, I want a co-founder who understands that things won’t always work. There will be hard times, failures, and uncertainty. During those phases, we should push and motivate each other, stay consistent, and keep moving forward. Even if something fails, we should come out smarter, stronger, and more experienced than before.  We don’t need much money to start just enough for basic living expenses. I have savings that allow me to manage accommodation and food for a long time, and I strongly believe we can make this sustainable within a few months.  The goal is simple:   Live together. Build together. Learn together. Grow together.  If you’re technically strong, disciplined, and serious about building a real AI business from Nepal, let’s connect.",

This has now gotten out of hand, and this type of behavior will surely spread to other tourist areas, especially those closer to the border like Sauraha and others. I have seen these 'tourists' in Thars and other SUVs riding recklessly on our highways, mocking our rules and laws. In my local area in the Terai, there have been a couple of incidents where such SUVs have hit locals, including traffic police, and fled to India.  Let's continue to do what we can from our end - I have reported the videos and his channel, and let's keep reporting those videos wherever we find them, and from any other Indian 'YouTubers'. Influencers from Pokhara need to raise their voices collectively on other popular social media channels like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Local influencers need to unite and raise this issue from their platforms in their individual capacities. Otherwise, we might be just one incident away from breaking news.  I will share this thread with a popular Indian YouTube journalist-The Deshbhakt. I have been following him, and he has made videos on such stupidity by Indian tourists. I will leave his Instagram link here so that everyone with evidence can share information.

Nepal is a country with a deep-rooted identity, culture, and values that have existed for centuries. Yet today, we seem to be losing our sense of judgment, influenced heavily by social media popularity rather than thoughtful evaluation. In the process, we are slowly drifting away from our ethics, integrity, and understanding of how we should act as citizens and how we should choose to be governed.  Governance should not be reduced to visibility and viral moments. Appreciation must be based on substance, responsibility, and long-term impact, not hype.

RaSaPa ko ki Mutton Kaji Farm ko?|||Lol, honestly I didn’t even know he had uploaded something yesterday, but my post had perfect timing and it blew up. Even Bibek Thapaliya was hiding his affiliations, and KMAG still hides theirs. This guy just picked up that post and used it to make himself look good again.  I know how biased he is or maybe he doesn’t even realize how he got used. This is how Gagan operates. He invites these influencers, keeps them close, so they don’t post or make content against him. By doing these meetings, he slowly creates a soft corner in their mind and heart. So later, when Gagan messes up, they hesitate to criticize him because they’ve met him personally and think, “He’s a good guy.”  This is also how Gagan has managed to influence journalists across different media houses. Not all of them are in his inner circle, but he subtly shapes how they think. He invites them, talks to them, and slowly pushes the narratives he wants—who’s bad, what’s bad, and how to counter certain people.  The social media ban happened when Congress was in government, right? He won’t openly say, “Support me” or “Make things favor me,” but indirectly he keeps planting ideas like, I’m the only one who can fix this, and stuff like that.  This is a very familiar pattern with Gagan Thapa. First, influencers like these create noise online, and once it starts getting attention, he jumps in and talks about the issue as if he really cares. If he genuinely cared about social media, he could’ve spoken up against the social media ban when Congress was in power.  Even during the Gen Z protest, he subtly planted leaders like Tanuja and Rakshya Bam through his media outlet, Setopati. Their interviews were pushed again and again, filling the feed with news about what Rakshya and Tanuja were saying. Slowly, that turned into posts supporting Gagan Thapa. In the end, neutral and unaware people start feeling like, oh, Gagan is the hero we were looking for, just because these figures they follow are also backing him.  Ask him if he made any contents on Gagan Thapa?  \\-  Did he made video when Congress tried to sneak in a loophole in the cooling period? What happened to Khatiwada then after?  \\- Did he made how gagan thapa surviving without doing a single job?  \\- When Congress/UML tried to pass 5 years corruption expiry bill.  \\- Even to debunk PACT corruption where Gagan Thapa was alleged, even to debunk the allegation. (he wont, cz truth or not, many will know about this case and will have -ve perception of Gagan)  \\- Why is he surrounded and hangs out with Goons?  \\- Why WikiLeaks has Gagan Thapa as key embassy contact?  No, he won’t do that, because he’ll always have a soft corner for Gagan Thapa. That’s how Gagan Thapa works he spreads narratives through influencers like him, who knowingly or unknowingly end up producing such content.  Another example is Gagan doing small meetings on “populism” and then letting influencers create content around that topic to “spread awareness.” For influencers, it looks like he’s thinking about the nation. But from Gagan’s point of view, he knows those influencers will create content that ends up being subtly targeted at new faces.  https://preview.redd.it/x4nqjclj1veg1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=5303b0b09e8b772195bbc2a80116bd3b9f25bdb5|||RONB le tetro Balen ko chusekai chusai cha ta 3 4 barsa bata yo vanda badi jholagiri ta kai dekhechaina kunai media le koi lai gareko.

And everyone knows it is because of high vote share madesh have, and they want to capitalize it. Even beside Balen today every other RSP leader mostly focused on the state matter of Madesh rather than the whole of Nepal, so it is evident that they want to capture proportional candidate vote as much as they can.

She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

Communism is really stupid if you look back at humanity now.|||This should be categorised as fictional book|||some deep shit ! ... op is not asking for superficial answer|||Technically, yes, he wrote the manual. But, Marx was a man who saw a disease but prescribed a medicine that was more toxic than the sickness. He wanted to fix the world by changing who owns the \"stuff\" without changing the \"human being\" who uses the stuff.  ​When you try to enforce \"equality\" through a state, you don't get a paradise; you get a prison. This is why Marxism has failed wherever it was tried as a rigid political tool.  ​Why \"Harkabad\" is the Antidote TODAY:  ​The reason we look toward a philosophy like Harkabad (Prakriti, Samskriti, Pravidhi) instead of Marxism or Western Capitalism is because it addresses the foundation, not just the \"economics.\" Harka Smapang has time and again said it has nothing to do with his name. He is suggesting a solution that isn't a western copy but suitable to the soil we stand on.   ​Marxism says: \"Who owns the factory?\" ​Capitalism says: \"How much can the factory produce?\" ​Harkabad says: \"Do we even need the factory if it kills the river (Prakriti) and destroys the community's soul (Samskriti)?\"  If you ask me if we need \"Harkabad,\" I would say we need Consciousness.  ​Harka Sampang is essentially bringing consciousness to governance. When he goes out and carries stones with his own hands (Shramadaan), he is moving from the \"ugly\" socialism (taking from others) to the \"wonderful\" socialism (giving of oneself).  ​We don't need a \"Communist\" revolution where blood is spilled to change the law. We need a \"Harkabad\" style evolution where sweat is spilled to restore the land. ​You don't need a book from 19th-century Germany to tell you how to live. You just need to look at the earth beneath your feet and the people around you.",

The feeling of lying in the bed with inherent thoughts of disperse happiness and the want to be able to understand if that happiness is as true as it seems is not new and it's also not wholly mine   I look at all these motion picture hoping to find something. And what that might be is as ananomus to me as it is to you. I look at these things, listen as they talk, but the existence of this feeling of watching doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm lying on this virgin earth, unmolested and untouched, devoid of any feeling of any sort except for one; consciousness. The consciousness reigns supreme within and without all within the vicinity of my existence.  At this point, life as you call it feels not a moments passing by or time flowing like my thoughts.  My head feels particularly heavy, as if I'm thinking but a thought is yet to process. But how can this be? Without a thought, how can you think? How can one live, without knowing the value of death? But that's not right either. For one to know the value of death,.one must first know of its qualities, it's feature in all it's dimensions. The inherent idea of a thought being, and to think not sounds stupid as if not funny enough. But you can't overlook the idea behind such ponder.   I take very long breaths as I think. My heart beats loud enough for me to hear it. And all my bodily functions seems very much obvious to me. This isn't new but it's not wholly mine.   Ahh now my head hurts a little to. But this shall too pass.   Theres this lingering feeling of solitude that I feel very sensationally. For solitude has been my friend far longer then any. The silence that made me feel alone after some years felt not pleasing but good enough to make me feel a bit stingy if it got disturbed.  But now this solitude engulfs me, strangles me so that I choke these thoughts out of me which are yet to be. But it was this very solitude that made me form a thought but now it want it back. Like how death waits right Infront of you, lingers above you with it's hands around neck, and then takes you through the stairs of lifelessness while you climb oblivious. Similar is the solitude that I experience right now, but instead of lifelessness, I climb and climb but towards nothing, I climb and climb but climb on empty thoughts.

Better to choose korea/japan for quick earning bachelor ko lagi ,master garna Germany gaye vayo|||You have got good GPA, I suggest SAT gara as well as IELTS. It will open multiple doors for you not just one country and programme which you are doing rn, Germany vayena vane k garnu type hudaina. Also try and apply as much scholarship opportunities you can find over the internet like DAAD, Hungarium Stipendum, Denish Govt Scholarishp and many more out there, if you are good in essay writting, some ECA in your school time, good social profile like involving and working in Rotaracts or Red Cross, good spoken English, can attend interview then you have very high chance that you can get good scholarship opportunity. Same time try countries like ITALY or Austria where you can get free undergrad programmes in Public unis (dont go to consultancy 8-10lakh lutchan). Keep hopes, manifest your plan, and start woking on it. Good luck.",

So yeah.  But girls bias that exists mostly coz of pedos I assume.

We skipped the formal lectures and kept things simple—just hands-on demos and honest conversations. The goal wasn’t to teach a full curriculum in an afternoon; it was to show these kids that technology isn't out of reach.  As a student-led initiative, we don't have a big corporate engine behind us. We’re just a group of peers showing up and leading where we can. This reel captures some of the curiosity we saw that day—it’s a small start, but a meaningful one.  If you want to build, learn, or contribute to what we're doing, we’d love to have you.  👉 Join the movement: https://codeyatranp.com/join",
