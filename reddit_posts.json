Our team may be able to provide support in an official capacity.|||This culture of treating teachers, elders, parents as god is one of the reasons behind so many of Nepal’s problems. Teachers are paid professionals, nothing more. Most teachers in Nepal are just frustrated with their daily lives, have big ego because of guru dev guru brahma nonsense, and take it out on students. Im pretty sure there’s also lots of scientific research on the negative impacts of corporal punishment on childrens mental health.

My aunt, who is like a mother to me, has recently become seriously ill and our family is struggling in every possible way to manage her treatment. She has no one to support her. Her husband left her many years ago and i never even saw his photo; some say he was in the army and died, but nothing is certain. She lives with her elderly mother in Melamchi Municipality, Sindhupalchok Ward 10. About a month ago she fainted in the middle of the street and we rushed her to the hospital where she had to stay in the ICU for three days, which was extremely expensive for us. After that, more tests showed abnormal growths in her brain that could be a tumor or even cancer. We still need advanced tests to confirm everything, but the MRI already shows something serious. She has no job, no savings, no relatives willing to help, and I’m just a student trying my best but unable to afford the treatment on my own. We are emotionally and financially drained.  If anyone here is able to help, even a small amount, it would truly mean the world to us. Your support could genuinely save her life. I will attach her MRI report, and if anyone wants to confirm her situation, you can contact the Melamchi Ward Office in Sindhupalchok Ward 10 because they know about her condition. If you prefer to help face-to-face or want more details, please message me anytime. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. Even if you cannot donate, just sharing this post could help her more than you can imagine.",

Today, I searched on YouTube and found out that it is also streaming on the Kirtipur Max TV channel, so I thought of checking the application to see if the channel was available there. I reinstalled the app and clicked on Watch Live; usually, it shows a notice asking me to buy a plan, but this time it didn’t show anything and the live stream started. When I checked the account section, it showed that I had a one-month subscription.",

Right now, I have to walk 20 minutes to the bus park and then spend 30 minutes on the bus, each way. Getting a bike would save me a lot of time and hassle.  Since I'm a student with no personal earnings, my budget is tight—around 400,000 NPR—so I'm definitely looking at the used bike market.  I'm hoping you can help me with a few questions:  1. Is it a good decision? Given my daily 2+ hours of commute, does getting a bike make financial and practical sense?  2. Which models should I look for? I need something reliable, fuel-efficient, and cheap to maintain.  3. What should I check when buying a used bike? As a complete beginner, I'm worried about getting scammed or buying a bike with hidden problems.  4. Besides the bike's cost, what other expenses should I budget for? (e.g., insurance, maintenance, etc.)  Any other tips or suggestions would be hugely appreciated! Thanks in advance.",

            "body": "I’ve been noticing a trend in Nepal’s tech scene, and I’m curious what others think.  It feels like Nepal is reaching the end of its “let’s build an app for every small problem” phase. Most day-to-day needs already have apps — payments, rides, food, banking, shopping, telehealth, LMS, ticketing, etc. The market is small, and the problems are mostly solved.  At the same time, many companies are: •\tcutting native Android/iOS teams, •\tslowing down on new product development, • and focusing on maintenance instead of innovation.  Some people believe that in the future, Nepal will simply “import” franchise-level apps once international payment becomes seamless. If apps from abroad work out of the box — with Visa Direct, PayPal, Apple/Google Pay — then why would a Nepali company rebuild the same thing?  So the real question is:  Are we entering a phase where Nepal won’t need many new apps — only maintenance, hybrid development, and outsourcing?  Or is this just a temporary market correction?  Curious to hear from devs, founders, engineers, and anyone who has been watching the job market shift.",

A huge percentage of e-commerce websites are still running just using websites—they never really need apps. WooCommerce, Shopify, Magento, BigCommerce, and more.

What I’m seeing is marketplace-based websites doing apps.|||~~Some people believe that in the future, Nepal will simply “import” franchise-level apps once international payment becomes seamless.

Trendy: they're brainwashed, selfish, came for masubhat  Reality: UML has strong foundation and institutions in every sectors, from education to workers, farmers, employees, businesses.   These organizations/institutions although have bad reputations, have done some apprecianle deeds too. From volunteering, blood donations, scholarship schemes etc. For eg. UML's student union was the first one to reach to Kalapani and put Nepal's flag on the land.   What we're doing is just bashing them on the internet with mostly baseless accusations. (Mostly, not all). That's not how you defeat an established and strong organization. If we want these parties to perish, we've to understand how they function and why they are still popular in villages and countryside. Kati paye gau gau ma ja govt pugna sakya xaina, tya yinai big parties ka sangathan harule public service puryayeka pani xan.  You need to address these necessities of the political parties through strong governance practice in order for people to not run after their flag. Birodh ko lagi matra birodh garne vaye ta kei gari sakkinnan yi party haru. Maoist ra aru 5/6 ota party/leaders unite vayera aauna lagisake, genZ ko chai 10 ota vanda badhi party banisakyo.

Tbh, at this point it's almost sure they'll do so.|||CPN UML have 650,000 people, you know? Some of them get food because party put them in government jobs. Now, if they don’t help the party, if UML lose, they will be in big trouble. People will ask how they get those jobs! So now, even if it means supporting murderers and rapists, they will do it. Why? To protect themselves! It's all about saving their own skin!|||So many dumb people in the country🤦|||political parties are built on a set of beliefs, called ideology. this ideology is like a master plan for how to run the country. it covers everything from how the government should work to how to take care of citizens and deal with other nations.  people often support a party because they truly believe in this plan and its leaders. it is not just about short term benefits(masu baht, jagir, and all) or projects for their local area. they connect with the party's vision for the future.  for democracy to work, we need such organized groups. they help bring many different people's ideas together and give voters clear choices. without them, the system would be just chaotic and unstable.  however, running a political party is very complicated, especially in a democracy like ours. leaders can't just do whatever they want. they have to manage different opinions inside the party and respond to the public. un a country like Nepal, with its difficult geography and many different groups of people, this complexity is even greater. change cannot happen quickly.  a major problem that makes everything harder is corruption. when leaders abuse their power for personal gain, it breaks the public's trust. it also makes the gap between the rich and the poor much worse. this means that while a few people get richer, many others are left behind in poverty, creating a deep social divide.  because of all these challenges including corruption and inequality, parties and their leaders can be slow to create change. a real shift in how things are done takes a long time. maybe decades. because it takes a series of elections and filtrations.  therefore, it is better to try to understand this complex situation rather than simply calling party supporters jholey. understanding the difficulties, including how anarchy and chaos hurt everyone, helps us have a more informed and useful discussion about nepal's future.|||They are building army of nepali citizen to flight against nepali citizen. If anyone talks or goes against them, these will be their shield. Just like Prachanda fooled thousands of nepali citizen. Similar thing is going to happen.

            "body": "[https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/11/19/nepal-unlawful-use-of-force-during-gen-z-protest](https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/11/19/nepal-unlawful-use-of-force-during-gen-z-protest)  Human Rights Watch found that police indiscriminately fired on protesters multiple times over three hours, killing seventeen people in Kathmandu who had been demonstrating against corruption in politics and a sweeping social media ban imposed four days earlier at a [“Gen Z” protest](https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/09/09/nepal-police-fire-on-gen-z-protest) in the capital, Kathmandu, on September 8.  “The recent violence in Nepal included serious human rights violations, and those responsible should be held accountable, whether they are security forces or political actors,” said [Meenakshi Ganguly](https://www.hrw.org/about/people/meenakshi-ganguly), deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The government should ensure that the investigations are independent, time-bound, and transparent, and that no one found responsible for breaking the law is unfairly protected from proper prosecution.”  Human Rights interviewed 52 witnesses, victims, journalists, medical professionals, politicians, and sources close to the security forces; verified photographs and videos posted to social media or shared with researchers; and visited hospitals and the scenes of protests and arson attacks. The research focused on Kathmandu.  Close to 1 p.m., “things became really bad,” said a journalist who heard gunfire and sheltered with a colleague near the parliament compound’s front wall. “A bullet whizzed between me and another journalist.” None of the witnesses interviewed heard any warnings before police used lethal force.  Police gunfire continued intermittently for hours. At around 1:40 p.m., police shot a 20-year-old university student through the shoulder. “When I was shot, there was no violence,” the student said. “It was very peaceful. Out of nowhere, they started firing.” Her surgeon confirmed her injuries.  Pathologists at a Kathmandu morgue, which received 47 bodies over the two days, told Human Rights Watch that they determined 35 cases of death had been due to “high velocity gunshot wounds” to the head, neck, chest, or abdomen. Staff in various hospitals [said they received hundreds of injured patients](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2025/09/16/medics-shocked-by-bullet-wounds-of-gen-z-protesters). Police entered the grounds of a hospital on September 8 and charged staff and patients with batons, injuring a staff member, a hospital official said.   A police officer with knowledge of the operation said that police had underestimated the size of the gathering, and this failure of intelligence and preparation may have contributed to subsequent events. A retired senior police officer noted that it should have been possible to manage the protest without using lethal force. “For me, it was a fiasco,” he said.  A retired senior police official said police had failed to follow procedures for dispersing protests and the use of lethal force. The [United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/basic-principles-use-force-and-firearms-law-enforcement) prohibits the use of firearms except in cases of imminent threat of death or serious injury. Intentional lethal use of firearms is permitted only when it is strictly unavoidable to protect life. Under Nepali law, security forces, even when authorized to use lethal force to restore order, must issue warnings and prevent fatalities.  “The authorities should recognize that widespread impunity for human rights violations in the past helped enable the violence that occurred this time in Nepal,” Ganguly said. “It is crucial to reverse the decades-long tendency by successive governments in Nepal to bury investigations and stall prosecutions, and to bring about accountability and security sector reform.”  A police officer who was on the scene said that officers opened fire with lethal force five minutes after the District Administration Office declared an emergency curfew in the area at around 12:30 p.m. Human Rights Watch analyzed a video showing the Nepal Police and paramilitary Armed Police Force (APF) firing at protesters just in front of the main parliament gate. Another video shows officers inside parliament grounds, 40 meters from the wall, firing military rifles in the direction of protesters.   A 20-year-old woman said that after hearing that two people had been shot dead, she and others went to plead with the police to use restraint. “We were not there for any violence,” she said. Soon after, at around 1:40 p.m., she decided to go home. She said she was on the opposite side of the road from parliament, roughly 45 meters away, with her back turned, when she was shot through her shoulder.  Another protester said that he arrived at the Naya Baneshwor junction around 1:30 p.m. and stayed for two hours. He saw protesters transporting injured people to hospitals. He saw police officers firing guns from positions on the street in front of the main gate, and others firing tear gas from beside the wall of parliament between the gate and the junction. “During the two hours I was at the intersection, people were getting shot in their hands, legs,” he said.  One video captures the moment a protester who posed no apparent threat was shot on the street near the southwestern corner of the parliament. A boy in school uniform—later identified online as 17-year-old Shreeyam Chaulagain—is walking away from the parliament, clapping his hands above his head. A gunshot rings out. The boy’s head snaps forward, and he collapses. The shadows in the video indicate he was shot around 2 p.m. Another video filmed shortly after shows other protesters trying to carry him away and stem the blood flowing from the back of his head. He did not survive.  A senior official at the Civil Service Hospital said it treated 221 patients injured in the protest on September 8. Three died at the hospital. Staff at the National Trauma Center said they received 8 patients who were dead or later died and 73 who were injured. The Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital received over 30 casualties that day, mostly gunshot wounds and injuries from kinetic impact projectiles. Other hospitals also treated casualties.  Researchers analyzed and verified 50 videos uploaded to social media platforms. Human Rights Watch has not included links to the online videos due to their graphic nature, but has preserved the visual evidence.",

You have all the pity for yourself and no consideration for their time and effort. If you keep cancelling, obviously they will stop inviting you. Do not make friends you can't keep. Do not make friends who's level youre not in. If your friends can afford the lifestyle of going places and you can't, make friends who you don't need to go out with.

Around a year worth of income of an average Nepalese just for a 2 years of teen's study.  My experience with Kavya was that my mom went there just to check it out (ofcourse it was out of our budget) and sadly she entered her number in some survey they had.      The number of calls those nggas made during 2 whole weeks, fk. We kept on declining and blocking their numbers but everytime it was a new number lmao. When we first asked for discount, they declined for even a rupee but later on they started giving offers themselves, despo times for them ig.

Then, you review. Look at the mistakes you did. Then do it again, after doing it again, compare. Think to yourself what did I do better this time and reflect.

Watch khan academy for general concepts. Use Perplexity AI or something like that for personal guidance. I got away with a 3.8+ GPA with only these resources.

For example: Use Fundamental Physics by Resnick and Halliday to understand the concepts in Physics, Thomas calculus for calculus, also most of the math is covered in BC Bajracharya's Basic of Mathematics.

And when you say indo gangetic plain , it includes bangladesh and parts of pakistan too. Its a regional problem. And being north of these countries, well , you get plenty of emissions carried by the wind which dissipates in our mountain ranges.

Awareness 2. Bans, stronger rules 3. Traffic police checks  What has worked and what will work is pricing. Get rid of rules that promote cartelling and let capitalism solve the issue.   If you had the choice to pay 20 rupees more but travel with slightly more comfort, and with a nice seat, maybe 30-40% of people would be willing to pay, which in result means more businesses willing to invest in public transport as they seek profit, more competition, better services. Those who offer neither good service nor good pricing then deserve go out of business.  This weird government backed cartelling with fixed artifical prices will never work.|||We should implement a metro-style system for local transport in Kathmandu. Currently many buses operate within the ring road but cannot travel beyond it due to narrow and congested lanes. Even when they do it only results in traffic jams.  What if we introduced autos in the valley that follow the same routes as local transport and carry 3–4 passengers per ride? Buses and vans could be restricted to the ring road and every bus stop along the ring road could have designated autos and rickshaws to drop passengers to their destinations at the same fare.  If implemented all the microbuses and hiaces could be replaced with standard buses which would likely cause less congestion than the current smaller vehicles.|||The metropolitan and the yatayat syndicate are the problems. There should be a limit on the number of passengers each vehicle can carry. For large buses, it should not be more than 110% of the number of seats. And for microbuses, it should not be more than 100% of the seating capacity. The limit rule should be enforced by the traffic police.   It's a systemic problem and requires a systemic solution.|||Nepal yatayat ma gundruk khade vanda namajale khadiyeko yaad ayo|||nonchalant khalasi dai|||Ajhai 3 Jana atne thau cha.|||Khalasi be like pachadi sarnus na tetro khali cha|||aghii pakhai ho ni..khalashi haru huncha micro ra yatayaat ko bhadaa karcha.

The land already belongs to a government body, in this case, TU, it made things easy.  But elsewhere in larger projects, main reason this is difficult is because of people. For example, the nagdhunga project was stalled for 6 months because of local demands of alternative water supply, compensation money, jobs for the locals, etc. Without this, it would have already been completed last year.  Now, significant amount of taxpayer money in infrastructure projects are spent in land acquisition. The only way for Nepal to develop fast is i. stop people needlessly stopping projects and either ii. significant land reform, or complete land price collapse and people to stop seeing land as investment.|||This was a dream for cricket fan like me!!

            "body": "I started teaching a Grade 12 girl Physics and Math from middle of Kartik. I taught her with full effort. I explained every concept, every formula, and showed her how to solve questions step by step. When I revised with her, she could answer. So I thought she was understanding the lessons.  About a week ago, she told me her school also started Physics tuition. I said it was okay and told her that I am still available if she needs help. Two days ago, I asked her mother about it again.  Then today, her mother called me and said her daughter “doesn’t understand anything I teach” and they want to stop the tuition.  I didn’t argue. I just said okay. But after that, I started thinking about everything.  The strange thing is that during class, she actually understood what I taught. She answered my questions, remembered formulas, and solved problems with me. The only problem was she almost never did the homework. Every time I asked, she said she didn’t do it or was too busy to do it. So I told her I would take a small test soon.  Now I feel like maybe she got scared or stressed because she wasn’t practicing at home. Maybe she felt pressure when I said I would take a test. Or maybe she simply wasn’t interested in studying physics with me. School tuition might have felt easier for her.  I also think the mother used the excuse “she doesn’t understand anything” because it’s easier than saying “my daughter didn’t do homework” or “she didn’t want tuition.”  Maybe my teaching style and her learning style didn’t match. Maybe she wasn’t ready for the routine and homework. I don’t know.  I just want to know if other tutors in Nepal have faced this.   Does this happen often?   Students understand during class but leave when it gets serious?   How do you deal with this kind of situation?  I’m not angry. Just a bit confused and disappointed. Any advice or similar experiences would help.",

My mom has to fight her way just to get a job that accepts her qualifications (those qualifications are from a GERMAN university and she has more work experience than all her peers) and the way she is treated as simple cheap labour being forced to do jobs that are under her qualifications is insane. She has been working in the hospital here for over 12 years btw.   So there are visible material effects and it's getting worse by the day. The German state has been talking about banning refugees from public gatherings, how long until it's not only refugees from Syria but also US? People get pushed, punched, harrassed for things they have no control over... There is no future for us here and we don't belong here.   I'm very thankful for having seen this country but I don't see myself living here any longer any more. Around 53% of Germans have recently mentioned they'd vote for parties that advertise specifically xenophobic policies, specifically AFD and the CDU. The amount of hatred is only increasing and it's been worsened through anti Indian social media trends.   Anyone thinking about working abroad: you'll face many issues on the way. Even if you do everything perfect, even if your German is excellent, even if you are charismatic. Sometimes all that combined isn't enough.   I don't wanna ramble too much but it's fucking tiring paying taxes doing 8 hours of labour everyday just to feel like these public places don't belong to. It's mentally exhausting and I seriously don't know what the future is at this point.",

It will never feel like home simply cause everyone around won't, that feeling of walking nonchalantly in your own streets, blending in and not feeling watched- the things we take for granted ain't gonna be there ever.|||As a German, I am so sorry you are experiencing this!!! My partner is Nepali and the change of politics at the moment really scare me and make me worry for him. I think he doesn’t experience too much racism because he lives in a really left leaning bubble with me, my family and our friends and also at his work (he works at the university) so it’s even more shocking to hear your experience. But I will never forget the racist comment someone told me because of my boyfriend and it was the most hurtful thing I ever heard and it wasn’t even about me directly. So I can only imagine what you must feel like and I truly hope things change here again soon :((|||Just last week me and my group Nepali friends encountered blatant racism where someone said that there are “too many of us”. It was my first time experiencing such blatant racism.   I’ve been in Aus for almost a decade now, and imo the sentiment towards immigrants has been the worst in all of my time being here. There were always few instances of subtle racism where someone would be a little too patronising or passive aggressive for example asking where I’m REALLY from, how my English is so good or assuming I don’t speak good English, and so on. But never such blatant racism….not the best of feelings tbh.  The problem is Asian hate (inc Indians) is taken very lightly in Australia and most Western nations. Asians and Indians are very easy targets. What doesn’t help is other fellow South-Asians (Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and also Nepalis) participate heavily in hating Indians not knowing that to a racist we are all the same. I’m hoping tensions don’t flare up and turn physically violent. Rough times ahead for immigrants in Australia imo|||I know it sucks and you can't do anything. You can't get general people to get the xenophobic feelings out of their head. You know very week the reasons that have pushed them to feel that way - denying and blaming is not the solution.   Also, for some (like in your case looking of Indian origin) genetics can fk us , not to do anything with your aesthetics, especially in situations like this. I have a few friends who work in Austria and are of Mongolian origin and get work in mountain areas because he told them that he is Sherpa. In those countries apparently mongol people are less discriminated compared to you and I, of Aryan origin who looks Afghani.|||indians last 10-15 yrs  afno lack of civic sense, thagi,impolite behavior, lack of personal hygiene le yeti gand failayo , tesai ko result ho  asti Aus ko reel herya khate haru swimming pool ma sabun lagaera nuhaudai k !!|||What city are you living in? Maybe it's time to move to a different place in Germany.   I know certain areas are very hostile towards immigrants. But it's not the case everywhere.   I've been in Germany for 8 years now, and have been working in completely German spaces for 4 of those years. I'm the only non-german at my current workplace with mostly older colleagues and I've never heard such comments.   Everyday racism in the form of ignorant comments is common, unfortunately. But no one has ever called me mango lassi, or any other weird names due to me being a brown person.   It's already difficult to live in a foreign land, you don't have to add to the burden by living in an extreme right area.|||Nowhere is better than your own country. |||the way out of it is, the population of South Asian in the west has to continue growing and the representation has to take more space in areas of society.|||[removed]|||Everything is tied to economy, Germany (west in general) is getting poorer, getting poorer makes people mad, politicians directs anger towards migrants.

So has been in our country. Letz forget about abroad, and speak up aginst such discriminations in our own country.|||It’s everywhere|||I will say this been in US 25 plus years and child is born here. Yes they are xenophobic and racist and it is increasing day by day but we don't do ourselves a favor if we cannot coexist outside Nepal as Nepalese. Where I live there are people from Kathmandu, butwal, baglung, Pokhara and everyone wants to live their separate life and gc holders and kids who are born here  and f1 students have their own silos..if you get my gist. We also hate on Indians, Bangladeshi, Pakistani. We do not teach our our kids empathy and embrace our own community ( I know people who have isolated kids and parents who are neurodivergent, gay/lesbian), casteism ni cha but not prominent but we expect the white population to embrace us. I am not denying it's getting worse, look at USA. People have become more emboldened here but it's not just the white, it's blacks, latinos, asians. We were supposed to be the model minority but now we are being treated bad because of jealousy. |||That's sad man. May I ask where you're located? East Germany ma dherai racist cha vanne suneko.

A country cannot forever take the refugees. There’s a limit on how open you want to help other. Immigrants are possible since they add value and boost economy. Refugees needs to be taken care of. When your own citizen are not in good place, such friction is bound to happen. So country should be able to refuse refugees if they cannot handle it or afford it any more .    Also, i cannot personally tell who that white guy is from or the black guy or the Latino or Asian. So, I am not surprised if they see you as part of larger dominating group. Like , Canadian being confused for American. 🤷🏻‍♂️or every Latinos being confused for Mexicans . If good Asian call them Korea or Japanese and for bad one call them Chinese. This kind of racism has existed . Subtle or explicit.   And it’s their country, they make the rules. It’s the democracy in practice. Respecting the rules that was mandated by the people or the elected bodies.   And I am a bit surprised you were expecting immigrant to get treated as equal as citizens? Thats a very hopeful move. Maybe first generation might get such opportunities but the immigrants who moved there it’s not even possible. Your experience starts the moment you land there . Not what you did in the third world country.   Later you might be able to provided not just skills but your language is good too. And your culture fit . Immigrant need to adjust to host country. You should not be expecting them to accommodate your every cultural nuances.   Western country treat more humanely than Kafala system like those of Middle East , even Korea and Japan are no good. Western country at least respect the basic human rights.    And if you have been living there so long, was eligible to take citizenship but did not . It mean that relationship with the host country you had is pure transactional. Not something like “Canadians are born all over the world, it just sometimes takes them a bit of time to get here.” Just replace the Canada with any host country. So, if you don’t take citizenship after being hosted and being eligible and had time, this was pure transactional not a connection you should have felt with host country. So they will be hostile . Which is wrong but it’s their country we Are guest there.    I have been mistaken for being Pakistani or Afghan or Middle East and mostly Latino . Some don’t even speak English straight up speak Spanish. Even if i Say Nepal, some say Naples . So they imagine the minority they interact or come in contact with .    I have not personally faced the racism. The hate are on rise especially after Russia Ukraine war and Indian Government making deal with Russia to purchase their oil on discount under green light of West. Kuro k Ho bhane, you are guest there, always remember that. Don’t ever forget, western country have one of the most atrocities in the recorded history.   Just be safe and cautious.   While you complain here, have you ever thought of working class of Nepal? Those people with same qualifications but with wrong family name? Or born in wrong geography? Ever think of working conditions of laborer of Nepal? Talked with them? What you have done? It is easy to take the hit when you are victim in another system but remember there are Nepali here who also suffer same systemic injustice. Like how certain group of people’s nationality is always questioned especially one doing the menial job.   This is just a life cycle or political cycle. Unfortunately we are at the end of the liberal democracy. Oh well. It was good while it lasted .|||Yeah true.   I hate to use racial profiling on people since it is not common in Nepal.   I live in Australia, I don’t call my anglo Australian friends “white” or my African Aussies “black”. People using skin color to identify has always been a cultural shock for me.  However, not to be racist, but expecting anyone other than Nepali people to acknowledge you being a Nepali is a waste of your time. Don’t waste your energy telling them you are from Nepal. They will NEVER understand   In their eyes: everything is about RACE. There are people who don’t care about race but to be on the safe side, it’s fair to assume most of them use racial identity as the main identification.   You may ask : “isn’t expecting white people to be racist, just because they are white, racist in itself?” , yeah it is. But like they say - while in Rome, do what Romans do.   ——  P.S racism doesn’t always mean Hate. Stereotyping anything based on race is racism. Like “Chinese being good at maths”. These sets unrealistic expectations and harms the people.   Regardless of whether they are being mean or not, Their whole belief system is based on RACE.|||Not relevant to r/Nepal. Maybe post it in r/Germany. Btw just paying taxes does not make you the citizen of that country. Always keep that in mind. Nobody forced your parents to migrate there. 🤷. Stop complaining.

If you arrived here early you can visit three Durbar Square first day ie   -Patan Durbar Square, patan Lalitpur. -kathmnadu Durbar Square - Kathmandu  -Bhakatapur Durbar Square - Bhaktapur  (Have to pay entrance fee)  At night you can visit -Baudha Stupa -Monkey Temple (Swaymbunath) -Thamel Areas (can visits clubs and cafe for relaxing)   Next day you can leave early for POKHARA.  -8-9hr by local bus -25mins by flight   At Pokhara  -lakeside -Sarangkot -Peace Stupa -lord Shiva statue at pumdikot - Do paragliding  -Ride boat at phew lake   After exploring Pokhara you leave for Ghandurk in Scorpio. There you see beautiful mountain range view and can try local dress and local foods.  After than you can leave for chitwan, Sauraha. -visit National Park  -Do animal sightseeing   Foods to try Momo Local Dal Bhat Ju ju dhau(curd) at Bhaktapur Durbar Square , Newari cuisine at patan Durbar Square    Etc etc|||You don't need to worry about safety. Kathmandu is a safe place. I walk around at 9 - 10 pm and there is nothing to worry about. You can call out anyone if needed in the street and anyone will help you.    Pokhara and Sauraha are great as well.|||It’s gonna be long so take time reading it    so It depends upon ur expectations n interest.  I would suggest enjoy places rather than rushing.    First what time of day u arriving and on which day.    Day1:If u land in afternoon on weekend n u like night life- then spend ur time Thamel (it will be easier if u r staying near by) n Ason where u can try local food, culture and night clubs (Thamel) if u want to or just roam around at night. By the way most club don’t charge entry fee to female.    Day 2:  Next day u can start ur day (early as it’s going to be a busy day for u) going to pashupati mandir ( if u r Hindu or wish to, Muslim and foreigner not allowed inside). Take ur time there as it’s gonna be crowded in the morning n evening. N enjoy it, I will suggest to visit Guheswori temple just in vicinity ( u can ask people, 1 km may be) both pashupati n guheswori in same compound ( more important u will be among few Indians who knows n went there, its a sakti peeth like jwalaji and kangda ji, u can google further)  Now I will suggest u to go bhaktapur Darbar square from pashupati itself for rich culture n heritage, u can hv nepali food n juju dhau ( bhaktapur is famous for that actually, actually it’s called bhaktapur ko juju dhau) while trying Nepali food try any place who just offer nepali khana, no momo or fast food and u will be good. Next Lalitpur for patan darbar square u can try newari foods here. (Check Honacha, local newari nasta, if u like u can hv juju dhau here too) Finally to kathmandu darbar square by evening ( here u can buy iconic Khukuri as a souvenir small one may cost 800-1000npr, of course depends upon quality but cheaper one enough one for ur cause) as it is near to Thamel actually u can walk from here to ur hotel in Thamel.    Day 3: in the morning after breakfast or early lunch u can go to swayambhunath temple (Buddhist temple) aka monkey temple, bikes and car go upto the temple but I will suggest u to climb stairs from the front rather than direct approach. And in afternoon go to boudhnath another Buddhist temple where u can enjoy in the evening its beautiful in lights. And u can try Nepali coffee at Himalayan Java and end ur day with Tibetan food and laphing (actually I love Tibetan momo more so u can try that too, its less spices, more juicy)  Day4: if u r not planning to go to pokhra or elsewhere go to Nagarkot for a day, sunrise is pretty good (depends upon weather) leave after lunch so I can reach there by 12 and check in , walking n nature. Its winter so u can ask beforehand if they can arrange for campfire and u can enjoy roast/grill meat by self and drinks of ur liking, wake up in the morning for sunrise and after breakfast back to kathmandu.   Day 5 and 6: if u r into religion u can visit budanilkantha temple. Its sacred temple of Vishnu (reclining pose which is not very common) u will find a lot of Indian pilgrims here as well, and there after u can visit to Osho Tapoban and stay there for a day help u relax and retreat (will suggest to stay if u can’t don’t go as u can visit park n nature else where, its about relaxing no rush here), if u want to skip Osho then will suggest skipping pashupatinath on day 2 as it will be too hectic and do it on 5th day morning then to budhanilkanta temple.   Day6: roam around ason, Indra Chowk , darbar marg, Thamel ( it’s all nearby u don’t need ride just a pair of walking shoes)   Day7: return to India (hoping flight if not then return on day 6 and spent a day in Lumbini Nepal birthplace to Gautam Buddha, it’s a border city. U can reach India in an hour from here and gorakhpur by 3-4 hrs. And from there u can hv flight to Delhi n elsewhere.   Hope this helps.

            "body": "I had a dog ( japanese spitz ) , 2 and half years old in my home. I had bought him when he was just 40 days old so you can understand how much i loved him. He was like a family to me. My family loved that dog to the heart. Yes, he was bit naughty but he hadn't once disobeyed me and my family members once.  Yesterday, an incident happened. He had a habit of going to the road ( not a busy one as i am living in remote area and only few tracters and bike move) for either roaming, playing and sometimes for toilet purposes. In the morning, a person from my village had threatened to kill him just for barking at him ( he was driving tge tracter) but i didn't cared that much. But during the afternoon, when my whole family was busy in home chores, the dog happened to go the road and that person willingly struck him with his vehicle ( tracter). My neighbours saw it and even before realizing, he fleed from there and my dog was lying there unconscious and just under 2-3 minutes he died. Upon checking, there was no major bruishes on this body but may be internal bleeding had started because of the shock in the head or whatever the reason ( he died within 2-3 minutes).  From that day, i haven't been able to reconcile the event. My parents are deeply saddened and sometimes even cry and i think my dog needs justice. There wasn't a single incident in the past that he bite someone or even barked someone without any cause and now he is no more. I even tried to confront him that day, asking him wht he did what he did , called him on his home, but nobody came outside and now he has completely avoided walking from the road of my home. I had tried to talk with him several times, even asked my ward chairperson to see the situation but noone is helping?   Isn't there any law or anything that i can do to make him pay for what he did? Or atleast make him apologize for his actions so that such actions won't recuur in the future? I need sugesstions as this is very depressing and i am saddened by the looks of my parents eyes everyday.",

Also, appeal to the new government that protects animals against this sort of behavior. They are very open to listening to people's concerns. I'm really sorry for you and your family, and I pray that your dog gets justice.|||It's indeed too much to kill an animal when he could have just chased it off with some noise. But you're equally at fault for letting the dog off alone on street.  >There wasn't a single incident in the past that he bite someone or even barked someone without any cause   Be it human or animal, their behaviour toward someone they're familiar and stranger is different.   Also, kept dogs are pain in ass for drivers as they're used to going near human, sometimes they even approach running vehicles which it risky for both driver and dog. Yestai kei bhayo hola ra tw timilai warn gareko thiyo, aafno irresponsibility ko blame aru lai nadeko bes.   But still killing seems too much, right? That dog was your friend so you viewed it differently. For many, dog or goat are same, we don't treat them differently; we kill them if necessary. Animal rights are there to prevent extreme animal abuse and keep them from going extinct, asking them for same rights as human is just being selfish, makes no sense.|||Seriously why would you leave your dog that it can go outside of the house on its own? That’s carelessness and you are also partly to be blamed. I’ve had close calls with dogs many times on the streets whether I am on a motorcycle or walking home in the evening.",

After plugging in the charger, the laptop didn’t respond at all for hours.  Assuming the charger was faulty, I took it to the Mudita service center. Later, they informed me that the **motherboard was damaged (“shot”)** and needed to be replaced, costing **about 60% of the laptop’s original price**. To make things worse, the laptop had just exceeded its 12 month warranty by around one month, so they refused to cover the repair under warranty.  It feels extremely strange and concerning that a motherboard or CPU would get damaged simply while charging normally. If there had been a high-voltage surge, then **all devices connected at the same time should have been affected**, including my colleagues’ laptops and chargers — but none of them faced any issue.  For a device to fail like this right after warranty expiry raises doubts about **product durability and quality assurance**. Very disappointed with this experience.",

First Salary was Rs. 16,000 (at Javra on 2019). After 3 months of internship, I joined another MNC company for Rs. 45,000. By Dec, 2023 my salary had increased to Rs. 1,44,000. I worked as Software Engineer in one MNC in Kathmandu. Were all of my classmates able to get similar jobs / salary? No. Were few earning even more than me? Yes.

I think its a huge mistake personally. I know there are many people who have done great in their lives. but I feel like (in the context of Japan) its a huge mistake to move after +2 because the cultural and language barrier is so high that even people with masters degree are working in convenient stores and other low paying jobs that need no academics. after +2 you just are so young and confused that you don't even know what you want in life and what are your options. at least after Bachelor's I'd guess you get what you should expect from life in general. also after Bachelor's its far easier to apply and get approved as opposed to after +2. also Bachelor's is very cheap compared to bidesh. Leaving the country as a teenager and growing up throughout my early 20s in bides has had me plant a doubt of growth in me. i feel like i have wasted my potential in Japan. I did 2 years of language and 4 years of graphic design and am currently studying 3d designing (1st year) as soon as i complete my study i wanna try and leave this country for good.   but I can also give a reason why you should move. 1. exposure at a young age. you get to experience things for the first time which is a doorway to learn many things about yourself and everything else. you see things that you have never even imagined. different languages and different cultures are important to live outside the bubble and see the world a little differently   2. privacy. in Nepal we have zero privacy. you do get total privacy and you can enjoy your alone time in solitude. this also comes with loneliness so be prepared to live a lonely life for the most part. loneliness also comes with anxiety and depression so try to keep yourself busy and in a circle.   3. life lessons. you start earning and learn to budget your expenses. you realize earning is easy and how much your parents had to sacrifice for you to be where you are. you also start getting very confident because now you are king of your own decisions.  4. You understand where you and your country lacks and how you can improve it. In Nepal there are many areas where change is necessary and if you never see it from others POV you will never know that it needs fixing. for example, i never cooked while i was in Nepal because mom did it all the time. but after coming here i have learned to cook some good food and also learned communication skills because of my work. also you see what exactly is not good in nepal and get the idea how you can fix it. for example lines in hospitals and other businesses like ward offices and banks. this can easily be fixed with a simple token and display. also supermarket like bhat bhateni can be improved with better staff training for efficiency  5.You can finally buy the things you couldn't afford as a kid. and you can buy the gifts for your family without having to worry about money so much. the face they make when you hand them the gifts is just priceless.  6. quality of life increases because you learn to keep yourself healthy and hygienic all the time. wearing nice clothes and with better styles uplifts your life by folds.   7. BAD SIDE  : you might also start drinking and smoking very often leading to sickness in the future when you are in your 30s and 40s|||I think it's the personal choice.

It feels like Nepal is reaching the end of its “let’s build an app for every small problem” phase. Most day-to-day needs already have apps — payments, rides, food, banking, shopping, telehealth, LMS, ticketing, etc. The market is small, and the problems are mostly solved.  At the same time, many companies are: •\tcutting native Android/iOS teams, •\tslowing down on new product development, • and focusing on maintenance instead of innovation.  Some people believe that in the future, Nepal will simply “import” franchise-level apps once international payment becomes seamless. If apps from abroad work out of the box — with Visa Direct, PayPal, Apple/Google Pay — then why would a Nepali company rebuild the same thing?  So the real question is:  Are we entering a phase where Nepal won’t need many new apps — only maintenance, hybrid development, and outsourcing?  Or is this just a temporary market correction?

If apps from abroad work out of the box — with Visa Direct, PayPal, Apple/Google Pay — then why would a Nepali company rebuild the same thing?~~  This question is unclear!!

Is that a one-time payout or recurring as long as the client stays subscribed? Also, this structure feels extremely one-sided. In proper sales roles, especially SDR/AE positions, a base salary exists for a reason.... people invest time, energy, and effort, while the company shares part of the risk. Here, it seems like the company carries no risk at all, you're gathering a large number of people, paying only for closed clients, and expecting consistent motivation without offering stability. If the product or leads aren’t strong, this becomes hours of drain with no result. That’s why SDRs abroad often earn more than developers.

The actual selling will start soon, and we are collecting the team before launch.  What the work involves:   • You’ll be given specific people to contact each day.   • You talk to them using simple information we provide.   • You keep track of who you’ve contacted and follow up when needed.   • Everything is done online. No field work.  What you don’t need to worry about:   • No fees or paid onboarding.   • No affiliate links or MLM-style structure.   • No searching for leads on your own. We supply all of them.  Preparation period:   While the product is being finalized, we will share short reading materials about communication and closing conversations. This phase lasts around 1–2 weeks and is very simple.  Earnings:   Payment is commission based.   You receive around 7–10 USD per confirmed client, and payment is made shortly after confirmation.   Payout in Nepal is supported.  Expectation:   To keep the project productive, each person is expected to close at least one client within roughly two weeks of active sales. If not, the role may end so the team stays efficient.

            "body": "Gen-Z Rise Again as UML Welcome Rally Turns Into Street Battle” Simara, Nov 19 What began as a peaceful black-flag demonstration by the Gen-Z youth of Simara took a dramatic and violent turn today, echoing the spirit of the September 8/9 Revolution that first put the city’s young protestors in the national spotlight.   Early this morning, as UML leader Mahesh Basnet was scheduled to arrive in Simara for a grand welcome rally, a group of Gen-Z protestors lined the streets with black flags symbolizing their dissatisfaction with the rapidly expanding UML influence in the region.   But at 11 a.m., tensions flared. According to eyewitnesses, several UML supporters confronted the protestors, harshly ordering them to “go home” and stop the demonstration. The young protestors refused, insisting on their right to a peaceful protest. Within moments, the situation spiraled as a group of UML members allegedly attacked the Gen-Z demonstrators with punches and kicks, forcibly dragging them off the road.   Despite the police presence, officers reportedly took no action against the UML supporters, instead attempting to summon the young protestors who were being assaulted.   The violence triggered swift public anger. Locals rushed to defend the youth, causing the UML members involved to flee toward the Simara airport. Meanwhile, Basnet’s incoming flight was cancelled due to safety concerns. But the confrontation didn’t end there.   The Gen-Z protestors, refusing to back down, marched to the airport demanding the arrest of those who attacked them. Police sealed off the airport to prevent clashes, prompting some protestors to throw stones at the airport gate and officers. With tensions boiling over, the youth of Simara took their demonstration to the streets, blocking the major highway from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m., creating a city-wide standstill. In a heated face-off with the DSP, the Gen-Z protestors issued a clear ultimatum: If the UML supporters responsible for the assault are not taken into custody by 9 a.m. tomorrow, November 20, they will seal the roads again.   Simara now waits for dawn and for the authorities’ next move as the city’s youth once again position themselves at the frontlines of political resistance.",

It should be well investigated that whether its UML's trick or what.

I highly doubt that the script was planned so that election could be disturbed,  chaos will be creates and more and more violence so that the current government gives up.  UML is champion in such script. Remember Bidya Bhandari Ktm baata chunab utheko bela Keshav Sthapit le Bidya bhandari koo poster maa gobar dalerw congress le daleko vanerw anti-congress sentiment create gareko.  GenZ are not matured in such jal jhel and unfair games. That's why we are getting played on by UML. UML is such champion player in such script. They want to defame Genz and want to create more hate towards us. So they attacked airport to show as if gen z are deshdrohi. We need to act mature and be non-violent so that such UML jholeys will not be able to defame us.|||Thoughts on this incident",

Trendy: they're brainwashed, selfish, came for masubhat  Reality: UML has strong foundation and institutions in every sectors, from education to workers, farmers, employees, businesses.   These organizations/institutions although have bad reputations, have done some apprecianle deeds too. From volunteering, blood donations, scholarship schemes etc. For eg. UML's student union was the first one to reach to Kalapani and put Nepal's flag on the land.   What we're doing is just bashing them on the internet with mostly baseless accusations. (Mostly, not all). That's not how you defeat an established and strong organization. If we want these parties to perish, we've to understand how they function and why they are still popular in villages and countryside. Kati paye gau gau ma ja govt pugna sakya xaina, tya yinai big parties ka sangathan harule public service puryayeka pani xan.

To protect themselves! It's all about saving their own skin!|||So many dumb people in the country🤦|||political parties are built on a set of beliefs, called ideology. this ideology is like a master plan for how to run the country. it covers everything from how the government should work to how to take care of citizens and deal with other nations.  people often support a party because they truly believe in this plan and its leaders. it is not just about short term benefits(masu baht, jagir, and all) or projects for their local area. they connect with the party's vision for the future.  for democracy to work, we need such organized groups. they help bring many different people's ideas together and give voters clear choices. without them, the system would be just chaotic and unstable.  however, running a political party is very complicated, especially in a democracy like ours. leaders can't just do whatever they want. they have to manage different opinions inside the party and respond to the public. un a country like Nepal, with its difficult geography and many different groups of people, this complexity is even greater. change cannot happen quickly.  a major problem that makes everything harder is corruption. when leaders abuse their power for personal gain, it breaks the public's trust. it also makes the gap between the rich and the poor much worse. this means that while a few people get richer, many others are left behind in poverty, creating a deep social divide.  because of all these challenges including corruption and inequality, parties and their leaders can be slow to create change. a real shift in how things are done takes a long time. maybe decades. because it takes a series of elections and filtrations.  therefore, it is better to try to understand this complex situation rather than simply calling party supporters jholey. understanding the difficulties, including how anarchy and chaos hurt everyone, helps us have a more informed and useful discussion about nepal's future.|||They are building army of nepali citizen to flight against nepali citizen. If anyone talks or goes against them, these will be their shield. Just like Prachanda fooled thousands of nepali citizen. Similar thing is going to happen.

Watch khan academy for general concepts. Use Perplexity AI or something like that for personal guidance. I got away with a 3.8+ GPA with only these resources. Perplexity really helped me understand the topics I was really struggling with. Also take full advantage of your school library. I used different books to get my concepts clear. For example: Use Fundamental Physics by Resnick and Halliday to understand the concepts in Physics, Thomas calculus for calculus, also most of the math is covered in BC Bajracharya's Basic of Mathematics. Even if you study an hour a day using these resources, that would be enough (Considering you pay attention in class).|||How much is the fee|||Too bad youtube ma free ma xa 😢|||Don't take online tuition class myannn|||You can easily access any topics from any elite professors for FREE .

And also, I did waste some very precious hours studying complicated things instead of basics, which I had left for later. And I did not do it later. So I'm regretting it a little. The test was bland. It was good, but it was bland. It had basics only. It didn't have anything complicated. None of our teachers had said anything. It's not like I go to college anyways. This academic year, I was present for only like 25 to 30 percent attendance. Otherwise, no. But still, no teacher had said anything about what would come for the exam. And I'm quite disappointed. Other than that, it was good. Not bad, not excellent. It was good. It was neutral. So, yeah. I don't think I will sleep now, because there would be a jet lag sort of feeling. If I sleep now, I will like sleep for a long time. And then if I sleep for a long time, then I will stay awake at night and, you know, the cycle. So I will resist and sleep at night and wake up in the morning as good as new.   And by the way, you should check this app called Sizzle. It's kind of like notebook LM but it teaches you yk.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NepalPlusTwo) if you have any questions or concerns.*|||Hey — good question. Applying for the MEXT (Japanese Government) Scholarship from Nepal is totally possible, but it can be a bit complicated. Here’s a breakdown of the typical process, eligibility, tips, and some pitfalls (especially for Nepali students), plus some resources. (If you tell me whether you’re applying for undergraduate, master’s / PhD, or teacher training, I can tailor this more.)  ⸻  What is the MEXT Scholarship (for Nepalese Students) \t•\tMEXT = Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan). \t•\tThe Japanese Embassy in Nepal runs a “Scholarship by Embassy Recommendation” for various categories: undergraduate, postgraduate/research, specialized training college, and teacher training.  ￼ \t•\tThere are also “University Recommendation” schemes, but embassy-recommendation is the more common route for many students in Nepal.  ⸻  Key Steps / Process (for Nepali Applicants)  Here’s how it generally works from Nepal: \t1.\tCheck Eligibility \t•\tYour category (UG / PG / Research / etc.) matters.  ￼ \t•\tAge limits usually apply (for example, for teacher training under MEXT in Nepal: under 35 years old).  ￼ \t•\tAcademic performance: You need your transcripts, certificates. For UG: plus-two, SLC, etc.  ￼ \t•\tLanguage: You should be willing to learn Japanese, because many programs require Japanese.  ￼ \t•\tCitizenship: Must be Nepali national.  ￼ \t2.\tPrepare Documents Typical required docs: \t•\tApplication form (from Japanese Embassy in Nepal)  ￼ \t•\tAcademic transcripts and certificates (notarized)  ￼ \t•\tRecommendation letter(s) (teacher / principal / academic advisor)  ￼ \t•\tCitizenship certificate (Nepali)  ￼ \t•\tHealth certificate / medical check (after interview) is often required.  ￼ \t•\tResearch plan (if applying for postgraduate / research)  ￼ \t3.\tSubmission \t•\tFor Nepal, applications are submitted to the Embassy of Japan in Nepal, usually via email.  ￼ \t•\tMake sure attachments (PDFs, scans) are under the size limit (e.g., under 10 MB).  ￼ \t•\tUse the correct email subject / naming format, as specified in the guidelines. (E.g. for teacher training: “MEXT: Teacher Surname_Givenname …”)  ￼ \t4.\tSelection Process \t•\tDocument screening: Embassy reviews your submitted documents.  ￼ \t•\tWritten exam: For some categories (e.g., UG, research) there may be a written test conducted by the embassy.  ￼ \t•\tInterview: Shortlisted candidates are interviewed. The interview often tests academic motivation, research plan (if applicable), and interest in Japan.  ￼ \t•\tMedical Check: After interview, you’ll need to submit a medical certificate.  ￼ \t5.\tResults & Notification \t•\tIf selected, the embassy will notify you.  ￼ \t•\tThen, you will go through additional administrative processes (visa, university placement, etc.). \t6.\tDeparture to Japan \t•\tOnce everything is cleared (university, visa, health), you move to Japan for your program under the scholarship.  ⸻  Special Notes / Tips for Nepali Students \t•\tOrientation: There is a MEXT Scholars Orientation Program in Nepal run by JUAAN (Japanese University Alumni Association of Nepal) which is super helpful.  ￼ \t•\tNo Application Fee: You don’t pay any application fee for MEXT.  ￼ \t•\tBe Careful of Scams: The Embassy explicitly warns that ANYONE charging an “application fee” or “deposit” is not legitimate.  ￼ \t•\tPrepare Early: Since you need a lot of documentation (notarization, recommendation letters, research plan), start preparing well in advance. \t•\tLanguage Preparation: Even if your program is in English (some are), showing willingness to learn Japanese is important. \t•\tNetwork: Try to connect with past MEXT scholars from Nepal (e.g., via JUAAN) — they can give very practical advice.  ⸻  Common Challenges / Pitfalls \t•\tDocument Mistakes: Notarized copies, wrong formatting, large file sizes — many applications get rejected at screening for simple mistakes. \t•\tCompetition: MEXT is very competitive. Even after passing document screening and written exam, interview is tough. \t•\tCapacity Issues: According to some Reddit users, sometimes there are “capacity” constraints (i.e., even if approved, there may not be enough spots in Japanese universities for all recommended applicants).  ￼ \t•\tTiming: Deadlines are strict. Missing the application window means waiting for the next year. \t•\tFinancial Planning: While MEXT covers a lot, depending on your university and field you may have extra costs (travel, initial living costs, etc.).  ⸻  Resources (for Reference) \t•\tEmbassy of Japan in Nepal — MEXT Scholarship info page.  ￼ \t•\tMEXT Teacher Training Student program details (Nepal) via Embassy.  ￼ \t•\tRain Education’s “Study in Japan from Nepal” guide (step-by-step).  ￼ \t•\tYouTube video: Walkthrough for Nepali students filling MEXT form.  ⸻ ——-ChatGPT",

Awareness 2. Bans, stronger rules 3. Traffic police checks  What has worked and what will work is pricing. Get rid of rules that promote cartelling and let capitalism solve the issue.   If you had the choice to pay 20 rupees more but travel with slightly more comfort, and with a nice seat, maybe 30-40% of people would be willing to pay, which in result means more businesses willing to invest in public transport as they seek profit, more competition, better services. Those who offer neither good service nor good pricing then deserve go out of business.  This weird government backed cartelling with fixed artifical prices will never work.|||We should implement a metro-style system for local transport in Kathmandu. Currently many buses operate within the ring road but cannot travel beyond it due to narrow and congested lanes. Even when they do it only results in traffic jams.  What if we introduced autos in the valley that follow the same routes as local transport and carry 3–4 passengers per ride? Buses and vans could be restricted to the ring road and every bus stop along the ring road could have designated autos and rickshaws to drop passengers to their destinations at the same fare.  If implemented all the microbuses and hiaces could be replaced with standard buses which would likely cause less congestion than the current smaller vehicles.|||The metropolitan and the yatayat syndicate are the problems. There should be a limit on the number of passengers each vehicle can carry. For large buses, it should not be more than 110% of the number of seats. And for microbuses, it should not be more than 100% of the seating capacity. The limit rule should be enforced by the traffic police.

The land already belongs to a government body, in this case, TU, it made things easy.  But elsewhere in larger projects, main reason this is difficult is because of people. For example, the nagdhunga project was stalled for 6 months because of local demands of alternative water supply, compensation money, jobs for the locals, etc. Without this, it would have already been completed last year.  Now, significant amount of taxpayer money in infrastructure projects are spent in land acquisition. The only way for Nepal to develop fast is i. stop people needlessly stopping projects and either ii. significant land reform, or complete land price collapse and people to stop seeing land as investment.|||This was a dream for cricket fan like me!!

She recently had a baby, so I was genuinely happy to visit her and meet her newborn. I was meeting her in person after 2 years.  We cooked together, washed the dishes, gossiped a lot, and I came home with a full heart.  Then at the dinner table, my parents asked what caste she is. I told them… and they immediately started talking about caste differences and how I shouldn’t visit her house for meals, and how she shouldn’t come to ours. Hearing them talk about her caste that way absolutely broke my heart. I couldn’t control my tears, and my mom said, “kina yesto chitta dukhako. Pitri farak farak hunxa, manxe yeutai matra vayerw hunna. Hamlai ni aaru le yesto garxan, hamle ni garnu parxa. Paxi tha pauxau, etc etc.”  We never had serious caste conversations before. In fact, I remember them teaching us that these things shouldn’t exist, that we’re all equal. And they’ve never shown this kind of behavior toward others who visit our home or toward our tenants who are the same caste as my friend?

Our parents grew up in a time where extreme casteism was normal. They didn’t create it, but they were raised inside that system, taught to follow it, and warned about the consequences of not doing so. Education shapes the mind, and the education they received reinforced these beliefs regardless of religion, culture, or society. So they’re not entirely wrong, and we’re not entirely right either.  The real problem is that we often fail to understand the environment they grew up in and the fears they carried. Instead of trying to see their side, we sometimes blame them or play the victim because it’s the easier option.

I respect him for his contribution in reformation in electricity of Nepal. But that don’t give him excuse to whatever theater he is creating now.  He was waiting for RSP meeting held in chitwan of central committee and when it was certain that none of them wants him as a president before Rabi either gets convicted of charges from court or finish his two tenure if not found guilty, then why won’t he accept any other role? Rabi and other made the RSP  from dust and he wants a free dinner with zero contribution. I cannot see any other reason other then his aim to bring destabilization in party and finally end this party as Ganesh kakrki revealed that in one recent interviews which also aligns with Balen too plans.  Why they desperately wants to end RSP just like congress and yemale has been trying so far?? Everyone is demanding to form coalition between RSP, Kulman and Balen to get more seats and can justice be given to family of martyrs. Why they are putting their ego first before country interest ??  All this theatrics indicates that kulamn could be still pawn on hand of prachanda and Balen either being manipulated by his close allys or fucking moron that cannot either embrace crowd, face press , or make decisions.

Three different blokes with 3 different political agendas and most importantly three famous social media personalities.|||People practice democracy = People are mad anyway|||Kulman isn’t gonna be the chairman of his new party.  Former energy secretary is going to be. He is just going to a member. So the premise of your argument is flawed.|||Why should he join RSP? He is the probably the most capable person to lead a country right now and you want him to work under Sobita Gautam and DP Aryal.

Is this confirmed or just rumors?|||Balen le party banaucha vanera kasle vanyo?|||It is hard for people to believe, but Kulman is corrupt, albeit, not on the level of old goons. His work is visible, but he is corrupt.  Balen is the only person whom I can say with confidence is not corrupt, yet. But he is no politician, and I don't think he will ever be. It is also very hard for him to open party with individual who is not involved in any scandal, and keep his non-corrupt image intact.  Rabi has his own problems. However, he is the only person at the moment who is a politician, and not involved with old goons. Only his party could have defeated the old goons, but since he is in jail, RSP will not get majority seats this time.  So, the new alternative forces combined will still not have majority in present scenario. Only way the alternative forces can have majority is if Balen and Kulman would have join RSP with Rabi still as head of RSP. But this scenario was simply not possible from start. Balen cannot associate himself with people with scandals, and Kulman is not really an alternative force, but rather the produce of the old goons who is not as bad as the old goons.|||Chup machikney tyo purano vanda yei thiq , reddit ma aayera na vuk|||One thing I will suggest if new party is contesting In some constituency just don't contest in that area. The same tactic Congress did with maobadi during election. After winning form an alliance which is the best thing to do. For that rpp rsp and new parties should agree on this. But the problem is will people trust these party chances are high they might change if favourable and good candidates are provided. Another thing CK raut did the worst mistake by completely showcasing the madesh separation thing. The thing is he would have ideal for collation to collaborate in madesh election. But one thing is for sure he lost his own madesh people club after gen z election and this statement have made him more hateful among madesh youth. Boy is gonna loose huge. Be sure three taukeys of madesh mahant thakur upendra and Rajendra are no way gonna go against uml and congress. They will completly support them and form government in madesh with majority seats.

It’s impossible to have good people lead the country when constitution promotes forming political alliance instead of promoting qualified candidate.|||First read the RSP bidhan. Unlike traditional parties, anyone with potentiality can join and compete in elections.  If Rabi Lamichane had wanted, he could have pushed Kulman Ghising as face of RSP for PM. Rabi didn't have to handover chairman. As he is in jail. He cannot run the country anyway.  There are others beside Rabi, who are aiming for PM in absence of Rabi. That's why the discussion failed. Don't blame on Kulman Ghising.  Kulman Ghising is the only person, that knows bureaucracy from core. He knows where to tweak and break. They can't fool him. He is needed for country. If RSP wants change. Then, they must give up their ego.|||You can read the indepth article to find out how Sumana and the gang along with Balen and Kulman tried to oust Rabi from his own party. https://www.nepalpress.com/2025/11/03/656615/|||There's no any alternative to Congress and UML.

After plugging in the charger, the laptop didn’t respond at all for hours.  Assuming the charger was faulty, I took it to the Mudita service center. Later, they informed me that the **motherboard was damaged (“shot”)** and needed to be replaced, costing **about 60% of the laptop’s original price**. To make things worse, the laptop had just exceeded its 12 month warranty by around one month, so they refused to cover the repair under warranty.  It feels extremely strange and concerning that a motherboard or CPU would get damaged simply while charging normally. If there had been a high-voltage surge, then **all devices connected at the same time should have been affected**, including my colleagues’ laptops and chargers — but none of them faced any issue.  For a device to fail like this right after warranty expiry raises doubts about **product durability and quality assurance**. Very disappointed with this experience.",

First Salary was Rs. 16,000 (at Javra on 2019). After 3 months of internship, I joined another MNC company for Rs. 45,000. By Dec, 2023 my salary had increased to Rs. 1,44,000. I worked as Software Engineer in one MNC in Kathmandu. Were all of my classmates able to get similar jobs / salary? No. Were few earning even more than me? Yes.    In the hindsight, I think my best decision was to stay here for bachelors degree & get that skill and work-experience in Nepal. Now, I'm in USA and working with one of the top fortune 100 companies as software engineer. My journey to here was much easier than other students who came for bachelors.      I know that my suggestion can be truly biased on what I faced after my bachelors degree here, but if you are planning to study computer related field, and can work hard on your skills, then there are good paying MNCs here. One of my friends is supposedly earning 3lakhs+ monthly salary in Nepal.       TL:DR; I'd suggest at least study bachelors here and gain few years of professional experience before going abroad. You'll 100% not regret it.|||I stayed after +2, stayed after bachelors. I dont feel any regrets not going abroad till date.

I think its a huge mistake personally. I know there are many people who have done great in their lives. but I feel like (in the context of Japan) its a huge mistake to move after +2 because the cultural and language barrier is so high that even people with masters degree are working in convenient stores and other low paying jobs that need no academics. after +2 you just are so young and confused that you don't even know what you want in life and what are your options. at least after Bachelor's I'd guess you get what you should expect from life in general. also after Bachelor's its far easier to apply and get approved as opposed to after +2. also Bachelor's is very cheap compared to bidesh. Leaving the country as a teenager and growing up throughout my early 20s in bides has had me plant a doubt of growth in me. i feel like i have wasted my potential in Japan. I did 2 years of language and 4 years of graphic design and am currently studying 3d designing (1st year) as soon as i complete my study i wanna try and leave this country for good.   but I can also give a reason why you should move. 1. exposure at a young age. you get to experience things for the first time which is a doorway to learn many things about yourself and everything else. you see things that you have never even imagined. different languages and different cultures are important to live outside the bubble and see the world a little differently   2. privacy. in Nepal we have zero privacy. you do get total privacy and you can enjoy your alone time in solitude. this also comes with loneliness so be prepared to live a lonely life for the most part. loneliness also comes with anxiety and depression so try to keep yourself busy and in a circle.   3. life lessons. you start earning and learn to budget your expenses. you realize earning is easy and how much your parents had to sacrifice for you to be where you are. you also start getting very confident because now you are king of your own decisions.  4. You understand where you and your country lacks and how you can improve it. In Nepal there are many areas where change is necessary and if you never see it from others POV you will never know that it needs fixing. for example, i never cooked while i was in Nepal because mom did it all the time. but after coming here i have learned to cook some good food and also learned communication skills because of my work. also you see what exactly is not good in nepal and get the idea how you can fix it. for example lines in hospitals and other businesses like ward offices and banks. this can easily be fixed with a simple token and display. also supermarket like bhat bhateni can be improved with better staff training for efficiency  5.You can finally buy the things you couldn't afford as a kid. and you can buy the gifts for your family without having to worry about money so much. the face they make when you hand them the gifts is just priceless.  6. quality of life increases because you learn to keep yourself healthy and hygienic all the time. wearing nice clothes and with better styles uplifts your life by folds.   7. BAD SIDE  : you might also start drinking and smoking very often leading to sickness in the future when you are in your 30s and 40s|||I think it's the personal choice.

            "body": "Hello everyone,  I never thought I’d be writing this again. I wish our situation had gotten better since my last post… but reality has been harsher than I ever imagined.  My father is battling Stage 3 Gall Bladder Cancer, and his treatment at RGCI, Delhi is ongoing. We somehow managed to complete 5 chemo cycles , by selling whatever little we had, taking loans, borrowing from friends and relatives, and emptying every bit of savings. But now, we are completely drained .. emotionally, mentally, and financially.  The doctors say the next few chemo cycles are critical . If we stop now, everything we’ve fought for so far might go in vain. But the treatment cost has now gone beyond ₹20 lakhs, and we have nothing left to continue.  My father is a simple, hardworking man a small farmer and shopkeeper from a middle-class family. He spent his entire life making sure we never felt our struggles,have some good education. Only now do I truly see how much he silently sacrificed for us. I’m still in college, trying to study, trying to stay strong, but watching him in pain and feeling helpless is tearing me apart. i feel cancer is the worst thing you can ever deal with .  I’ve seen my mother cry silently in the corner every night, and my sisters trying to smile despite knowing how close we are to losing everything. I keep telling them we’ll make it that I’ll find a way but right now, I don’t know how much longer we can hold on without help.  In my last post, so many kind souls came forward. I’m truly, deeply grateful — we managed to raise about ₹1.5 lakh, which helped us cover chemotherapy and hospital bills. Every rupee meant the world to us. 🙏  But the journey is far from over. We still need around ₹20 lakhs more to continue his treatment and give him a real chance at life.  If you’re reading this please, help us if you can. Even a small amount, even a share, even a prayer it all counts.   I’m not asking for sympathy; I’m asking for humanity.

This is an insane lifestyle, nothing less than Dahal family. If a local ward chairperson can amass such wealth, those at the level of IGP and mantri have looted us taxpayers a hundred times higher.   This guy is apparently the son of nepal’s most corrupt chief justice Gopal Parajuli, btw he had to resign because of fake citizenship. Openly flexing luxury cars and watches on social media. Arent we tired of them by now?  The poor doesnt have access to proper ambulances, meanwhile ankit khand the son of nepali citizenship seller balkrishna khand takes helicopters, everywhere he goes! Manju Khand ko chorra.  Shaniddhya Shaudharya Khanal, son of Ex IGP of APF, Shailendra Khanal. What is the salary of these officers to be able to afford these lifestyles?  Garima Paudel daughter of ex minister devendra paudel proudly faunting her international lifestyle. International tours, comfortable international lifestyle, business class travels while the poor are forced to use tuins for daily commute. Are we not tired of this? This is why we are exposing corruption in nepal  Sangita Pahadi has recently been sued by CIAA for 3 arba scam. Their children have been living a lavish lifestyle since ages. No shame. 30 hajar ko talab, 30 ota gharbari. Finish them all.  We found another generational corruption run. Khushi Pandey is the granddaughter of Ramesh Nath Pandey, he was the FORMER MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, INDUSTRY, TOURISM, ENVIRONMENT and COMMUNICATIONS. She is also the daughter of Nischal Nath Pandey, who served as a government employee during ramesh nath pandey’s long ministerial run. Look at this damn lifestyle. How is it possible to afford all of this when the family has nothing except civil service for the past 50 years?  Supriya Bohora, granddaughter of Deepak Bohora, former member of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and the House of Representatives, has recently come under the spotlight. Deepak Bohora was known for his strong hand in the Panchayat system and his unwavering support for the monarchy. His political journey is remembered not only for his allegiance to authoritarian structures but also for allegations of corruption. One of the most prominent accusations linked to Deepak Bohora is the illegal consumption of land where the Fun Park ice rink in Bhadrakali Road now stands. What was once a symbol of political maneuvering and alleged misappropriation of public assets is now being flaunted by his granddaughter as a mark of achievement, raising questions about how the spoils of corruption are normalized across generations.  Anusandhan khai ta comrade? Granddaughter living in europe to protect all the money stored in swiss bank. EXPOSE THEM ALL!  Most corrupted ones are the generals from police special dsp and upwards.👮 I have seen them using massive funds to get their sons n daughters abroad or in prestigious schools by paying hefty fees. their home looks like that of a king , literally narayanhiti jastai same and their sons n daughters are living the life of luxuries carrying iphones and designer dresses and bags . Actually what these officer do is they heavily launder money and budgets which comes to their department . They practice “milijuli khane” . They also take funds from criminals to manage cases. Then they use these funds to bribe politicians for getting higher post like dsp to dig , from DIG to IG and so on . They conduct massive weddings and ceremonies spending crore of rupees. this is same with army generals as well.  `-`  **TLDR - REGISTER AND CONVINCE YOUR FRIENDS, COUSINS IF THEY STILL HAVE NOT MADE VOTER ID**  Read an interesting blog on this. Hamro lato politician le k bujhla esto. Chorra chorri lai instagram delete garna chai layo dhanna teti chai buddhi raicha.  >The corrupt ruling elites of the Third World, who used to steal everything, destroy economies, and create hell for their own populations, have now added one more thing: they openly allow their children to flaunt the spoils of corruption on Instagram, right in front of their starving people. Something previous generations never witnessed.  >The new rich have never gone through a revolution so they don't understand not to flaunt their wealth like the old bourgeoisie who have witnessed multiple revolutions throughout history. It's ironic that the Maoists instigated a revolution yet the children of said Maoists are now living the luxurious lives posting everything not knowing whats simmering in society. It looks like at least the kids have understood not to flaunt their stolen wealth to avoid angering the masses.  >In any ways what happened in Nepal highlights a trend I’ve discussed on here before, which is how Instagram utterly radicalizes youth heavy developing societies.  >Suddenly you as a poor but striving young man or woman have full visibility to how the elite/upper class of your country + diaspora live, but you have little access or hope of ever living the same for the most part. The impact of this on mental health, societal stability, and also fertility rates cannot be underestimated.  >Imagine going from a society with five state channels and a few cable options in the 2000s to Instagram in just five years. That’s what happened to all of South Asia + Africa + a lot of Latin America.  These guys were being exposed to the lifestyles of the baddie daughters and Chad sons of the fucktards ruling their country,  >You see their trip to Japan and London for the summer. See their parties at their elite mansions in the most posh suburbs and neighborhoods and you realize you’re just fucked and not getting there ever, your country simply does not have the mechanism to enable that for you, you’re unemployed even despite a college degree.  >**Upward mobility is like a pressure valve. Nepal never had that. The elites taxed people, slapped tariffs on imports & ignored building institutions that foster upward mobility. Instead, they assumed that sending their populace to the Middle East would be sufficient.**  >What’s surprising is how the corrupt politicians allow their kids to flaunt stolen wealth so brazenly. Kids of politicians in developing countries flaunting their extravagant lifestyles on public Instagram accounts is so foolhardy. Exposure to social media and bragging about your luxurious lifestyle risks fuelling resentment and envy.  >It's how uprisings have always been. Old bourgeoisie don't show off their wealth like those Nepali elites did. This behavior is what got both the iranian and russian noble families killed. This also happened in Mongolia earlier this year, although less dramatically. The Prime Minister had to step down due to protests that kicked off because his son was showing off his luxury holidays and clothes too much on Instagram.",

At the end of the day, even though I scored 3.97 GPA, In the Kathmandu Metro Scholarship exam, I choked. I barely made it onto the second nomination list and ended up in a college that’s just “okay.” But honestly, I don’t blame the college I blame myself. There were others who got into better colleges than me, even though they had lower grades. So, I can’t say grades don’t matter, but the first term really showed me how tough things can get. I know I need to improve, and I’m determined to do so. I got an A+ in Computer Science, even though I didn’t study as much as I should have. I love Computer Science and building a lot of skills in the field. Right now, though, I’ve decided to take a break from everything every extracurricular activity, including learning JavaScript, React, and other things. I know I probably shouldn’t, but I feel like it’s necessary for now. Starting today, I’ll be locking my phone and using my laptop strictly for studying. I need to focus on my second terminal exams, and it’s time to set boundaries.If I’ve said anything wrong, I apologize. I don’t blame anyone or anything but myself, even though I studied harder than I ever have. My lack of proper note-taking has cost me. Right now, I’m just looking for advice from seniors who have gone through this and come back stronger, getting good results in the end.",

But it turned out none of it actually mattered.   Last year I gave CEE exams for MBBS ug , I couldn't get a scholarship and it felt like the end of the world especially because people expected a lot from me. I used to avoid talking to anyone.

I understand it looks a lot worse to you (and maybe your guardians) coming from 3.97 to 3.10 and your feelings are very valid. I have seen toppers with dead end jobs and barely first class pass having a stellar careers. I'm somewhat middle of the lot myself.  You've got a lot going for you, you got a 4.0 in the subject you love and sounds like you're pretty proactive with it and fairly competent too. All the B's and B+'s  could have been A's with a little discipline and bit of a good luck, and most of all hopefully this has given you a wake up call.

Ya and i got an overall 3.8  and ya forgot to mention, If u dont understand a topic than u have youtube .To be frankly honest,i used to watch a lecture from youtube everytime a topic or concept or terms even if its subtle. Without the teachers from youtube, well i wouldnt have scored even a 3.6.

They outsource their jobs to poorer countries where people are happy to accept a meager $2800/month, whereas a domestic worker in the US would have to be paid at least double that. So the company saves 50% of their costs pretty much immediately. Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to. If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.   I hope the US government puts into place policies that make outsourcing jobs much more expensive/restrictive than hiring domestic workers.|||Bhik me kuch dedo humko bhaisahab|||What you planning to do with the money saved|||what do you recommend to get the skill on ?|||What courses/sites helped you the most in developing your skills?|||Daily work hour?|||is it that common to find a remote job that pays in dollars or is it very rare? just curious bcz planning to study cs|||Is it too little too late to start at final bachelors year.

            "body": "Hello! Myself (20M), along with two of my friends and our families, visited Nepal during the Diwali holidays. We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8. Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)

            "comments": "First of all, commendations for such well written and structured post, that too with all the additional info at the end. (For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".

I have a relative who works as a travel agent, and he told me that many agents and shopkeepers tend to focus more on foreign tourists than on Indians, because they believe they can overcharge them easily. So, bro, be careful  there are many thugs and dishonest agents who might try to charge you extra. **Bargaining is the key.**  In almost every corner, if a hotel recommends you a place or a service, remember that the hotel usually gets a commission from it. The entire system in tourist areas like Thamel often runs on commission-based deals. So it’s always better to ask genuine locals for suggestions rather than agents pretending to be locals. In Thamel, you’ll find many such people who act friendly but are just trying to make money off tourists.  If you have Nepali friends, you can travel cheaply and safely otherwise, just be a bit cautious and smart while dealing with people. To be honest, a few uneducated people here may dislike Indian tourists, and that’s an unfortunate reality. But overall, we Nepalese are known to be **very hospitable, kind, and friendly**, and most people will treat you with respect and warmth. Just stay alert, bargain wisely, and you’ll have a wonderful time in Nepal.|||Bro, timi Darjeeling bata vayae taa, yo sabai Normal hola ni taa timro laagi taa?? 🤔|||where did u take that video bro? was it in pokhara?|||You skipped Bandipur en route Pokhara from Kathmandu.

So stunning!|||Kudos for well organized post. Go to Mustang, you can reserve scorpio or take your own vehicle. It will be worth it since you are mesmerised by Sarangkot.  Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||Have a great time here, enjoy it and after you go back to your home just think is it fair to take land of the country who provided you with such great hospitality?|||[deleted]",

Awareness 2. Bans, stronger rules 3. Traffic police checks  What has worked and what will work is pricing. Get rid of rules that promote cartelling and let capitalism solve the issue.   If you had the choice to pay 20 rupees more but travel with slightly more comfort, and with a nice seat, maybe 30-40% of people would be willing to pay, which in result means more businesses willing to invest in public transport as they seek profit, more competition, better services. Those who offer neither good service nor good pricing then deserve go out of business.  This weird government backed cartelling with fixed artifical prices will never work.|||We should implement a metro-style system for local transport in Kathmandu. Currently many buses operate within the ring road but cannot travel beyond it due to narrow and congested lanes. Even when they do it only results in traffic jams.  What if we introduced autos in the valley that follow the same routes as local transport and carry 3–4 passengers per ride? Buses and vans could be restricted to the ring road and every bus stop along the ring road could have designated autos and rickshaws to drop passengers to their destinations at the same fare.  If implemented all the microbuses and hiaces could be replaced with standard buses which would likely cause less congestion than the current smaller vehicles.|||The metropolitan and the yatayat syndicate are the problems. There should be a limit on the number of passengers each vehicle can carry. For large buses, it should not be more than 110% of the number of seats. And for microbuses, it should not be more than 100% of the seating capacity. The limit rule should be enforced by the traffic police.

The land already belongs to a government body, in this case, TU, it made things easy.  But elsewhere in larger projects, main reason this is difficult is because of people. For example, the nagdhunga project was stalled for 6 months because of local demands of alternative water supply, compensation money, jobs for the locals, etc. Without this, it would have already been completed last year.  Now, significant amount of taxpayer money in infrastructure projects are spent in land acquisition. The only way for Nepal to develop fast is i. stop people needlessly stopping projects and either ii. significant land reform, or complete land price collapse and people to stop seeing land as investment.|||This was a dream for cricket fan like me!!

I'm no expert but I  do come with a few facts . The actual knowledge I feel like I know it better than anyone here. Not bragging .  So take it as a means of education. I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it. Capitalism and communism don't antagonises each other. They coexist in a healthy modern economy.|||Ask a regular min wage worker in the US if capitalism is working for them.

            "heading": "A Night in Kathmandu — The Unexpected Bar Scam Experience",
            "body": "After completing our last destination in Kathmandu, our Nepal trip was almost coming to an end. We had planned to spend the evening shopping around local markets before heading back home.  But as luck would have it, the weather had other plans. It started raining heavily, and most of us decided to cancel the shopping plan and stay inside the bus, waiting for the rain to stop.  While we were sitting there, a Nepali guy — sort of an agent — climbed onto the bus. He started chatting with my friend, talking about dance bars, attractive girls, and fun nightlife in Kathmandu. My friends, curious and excited to explore something different, agreed to check it out. So, we went along with him from Gaushala Chowk.  ⸻  The Arrival  We reached around 7 PM. The place looked more like a small pub or lounge — dim lights, loud music, and barely anyone inside. There were just two Indian guys with a few Nepali girls, sitting at a corner table, smoking hukka and drinking.  We were a group of 12 people, so we took two tables (6 on each). I sat on the other table, while two Nepali girls from the bar joined my friends’ table. They were friendly, laughing, and talking in Hindi — chit chat, masti, jokes — sab Hindi mein.  After a few minutes, the girls said they wanted to have a drink. The same agent who brought us there told my friend, “Sir, bas 400 Rs ka juice hai.” They wrote the order on a small paper chit, took my friend’s signature, and soon two juices were served.  That’s how their system worked — write on paper, take a sign, and serve the order.  We also ordered 4 beers for ourselves. Out of 12, only 4 were drinking — the rest were just watching the dance show.  ⸻  The Show Begins  Soon, Nepali girls started dancing on Hindi songs, followed by a couple of male dancers and another girl joining the floor. The vibe felt okay at first — typical dance bar scene, music, lights, drinks.  But after the girls finished their drinks, a waiter brought a hukka pot to our table without even asking. We immediately told him to take it away. The girls got off from our table soon after that.  ⸻  Something Felt Off  After finishing the beer, me and my friend went to the washroom. There we saw those same two Indian guys who were sitting earlier — looked like North Indians (maybe Delhi or Haryana). They seemed tense, arguing with the bar staff.  Out of curiosity, I asked one of them, “Bhai kya hua?” He said, “Dekho na bhai, kuch khaya nahi, thoda piya sirf — aur bill 32,000 Nepali bana diya!”  That one line was enough to send chills down my spine.  I quickly went back to my table and told my friend what had happened. We immediately asked for our bill — but the damage was already done.  ⸻  The Shocking Bill  The bill came in Nepali currency: \t•\t4 Beers = 4000 \t•\t2 Drinks for girls = 8000 \t•\t23% Service charge = 2760 Total = 14,760 NRS (≈ 9,840 INR)  My friend was shocked. He said, “Ladies drink price to 400 bola tha,” but by then, the agent who brought us there had vanished.  There was no point arguing — the staff was large in number, and the situation didn’t look safe. Finally, we settled the bill for 9,500 INR and left the place quietly.  ⸻  What Happened Next  As we were leaving, I noticed those two Indian guys being locked in a small office, surrounded by bar staff demanding they hand over their mobiles or belongings to pay off the bill.  I felt genuinely bad for them — and guilty for not sitting at my friend’s table earlier, or checking the price list before signing that paper chit.  But at the same time, I was thankful that we escaped early — with just a 4-beer loss instead of a full-blown scam.  ⸻  The Reality Behind the Glamour  While we were stepping out, a few more Nepali guys entered, and immediately all the bar girls — including those who had been at our table — went to join them, smoking hukka and ordering drinks.  Just watching that, I could only think: “Isko to aaj 40,000–50,000 ka chuna lagne wala hai.”  ⸻  Final Thoughts  Our Nepal trip overall was beautiful — from Pokhara’s serenity to the spiritual vibe of Pashupatinath. But this one Kathmandu nightlife experience was a reminder that not everything that glitters is gold.  If you ever plan to explore nightlife in Kathmandu, be cautious: \t•\tNever sign anything you don’t understand. \t•\tAlways ask for the price upfront. \t•\tAnd if something feels shady — walk away.  This experience became a story to remember — not for the fun, but for the lesson it taught us.",

She recently had a baby, so I was genuinely happy to visit her and meet her newborn. I was meeting her in person after 2 years.  We cooked together, washed the dishes, gossiped a lot, and I came home with a full heart.  Then at the dinner table, my parents asked what caste she is. I told them… and they immediately started talking about caste differences and how I shouldn’t visit her house for meals, and how she shouldn’t come to ours. Hearing them talk about her caste that way absolutely broke my heart. I couldn’t control my tears, and my mom said, “kina yesto chitta dukhako. Pitri farak farak hunxa, manxe yeutai matra vayerw hunna. Hamlai ni aaru le yesto garxan, hamle ni garnu parxa. Paxi tha pauxau, etc etc.”  We never had serious caste conversations before. In fact, I remember them teaching us that these things shouldn’t exist, that we’re all equal. And they’ve never shown this kind of behavior toward others who visit our home or toward our tenants who are the same caste as my friend?

Our parents grew up in a time where extreme casteism was normal. They didn’t create it, but they were raised inside that system, taught to follow it, and warned about the consequences of not doing so. Education shapes the mind, and the education they received reinforced these beliefs regardless of religion, culture, or society. So they’re not entirely wrong, and we’re not entirely right either.  The real problem is that we often fail to understand the environment they grew up in and the fears they carried. Instead of trying to see their side, we sometimes blame them or play the victim because it’s the easier option. But change takes understanding from both generations—not just criticism. 🙏|||When you leave Nepal and meet fellow Nepalese, you will continue this tradition.|||This will just go with this generation or maybe next or next but you just forget what they said and forget about the cast system as well and just focus on people's behavior and if nobody talks about it next generation is not even going to know such a thing and it will just go away.

Indirectly they'll learn that cast is a big deal. that's my point of view. And forget my English as well ☺|||This is really heartbreaking. It’s painful when people who taught us about equality show a different side. Caste ideas came through shared history and influence from India, but we don’t have to carry them forward.

            "body": "It is now clear that kulman had already planned out to make new party. He was waiting for green signal from RSP if they give him president or not. I respect him for his contribution in reformation in electricity of Nepal. But that don’t give him excuse to whatever theater he is creating now.  He was waiting for RSP meeting held in chitwan of central committee and when it was certain that none of them wants him as a president before Rabi either gets convicted of charges from court or finish his two tenure if not found guilty, then why won’t he accept any other role? Rabi and other made the RSP  from dust and he wants a free dinner with zero contribution. I cannot see any other reason other then his aim to bring destabilization in party and finally end this party as Ganesh kakrki revealed that in one recent interviews which also aligns with Balen too plans.  Why they desperately wants to end RSP just like congress and yemale has been trying so far?? Everyone is demanding to form coalition between RSP, Kulman and Balen to get more seats and can justice be given to family of martyrs. Why they are putting their ego first before country interest ??  All this theatrics indicates that kulamn could be still pawn on hand of prachanda and Balen either being manipulated by his close allys or fucking moron that cannot either embrace crowd, face press , or make decisions. Mahesh karauna thale dekhi he is kind of caved in totally and his silence has taken many hopes from people.",

Three different blokes with 3 different political agendas and most importantly three famous social media personalities.|||People practice democracy = People are mad anyway|||Kulman isn’t gonna be the chairman of his new party.  Former energy secretary is going to be. He is just going to a member. So the premise of your argument is flawed.|||Why should he join RSP? He is the probably the most capable person to lead a country right now and you want him to work under Sobita Gautam and DP Aryal.

Is this confirmed or just rumors?|||Balen le party banaucha vanera kasle vanyo?|||It is hard for people to believe, but Kulman is corrupt, albeit, not on the level of old goons. His work is visible, but he is corrupt.  Balen is the only person whom I can say with confidence is not corrupt, yet. But he is no politician, and I don't think he will ever be. It is also very hard for him to open party with individual who is not involved in any scandal, and keep his non-corrupt image intact.  Rabi has his own problems. However, he is the only person at the moment who is a politician, and not involved with old goons. Only his party could have defeated the old goons, but since he is in jail, RSP will not get majority seats this time.  So, the new alternative forces combined will still not have majority in present scenario. Only way the alternative forces can have majority is if Balen and Kulman would have join RSP with Rabi still as head of RSP. But this scenario was simply not possible from start. Balen cannot associate himself with people with scandals, and Kulman is not really an alternative force, but rather the produce of the old goons who is not as bad as the old goons.|||Chup machikney tyo purano vanda yei thiq , reddit ma aayera na vuk|||One thing I will suggest if new party is contesting In some constituency just don't contest in that area. The same tactic Congress did with maobadi during election. After winning form an alliance which is the best thing to do. For that rpp rsp and new parties should agree on this. But the problem is will people trust these party chances are high they might change if favourable and good candidates are provided. Another thing CK raut did the worst mistake by completely showcasing the madesh separation thing. The thing is he would have ideal for collation to collaborate in madesh election. But one thing is for sure he lost his own madesh people club after gen z election and this statement have made him more hateful among madesh youth. Boy is gonna loose huge. Be sure three taukeys of madesh mahant thakur upendra and Rajendra are no way gonna go against uml and congress. They will completly support them and form government in madesh with majority seats.

It’s impossible to have good people lead the country when constitution promotes forming political alliance instead of promoting qualified candidate.|||First read the RSP bidhan. Unlike traditional parties, anyone with potentiality can join and compete in elections.  If Rabi Lamichane had wanted, he could have pushed Kulman Ghising as face of RSP for PM. Rabi didn't have to handover chairman. As he is in jail. He cannot run the country anyway.  There are others beside Rabi, who are aiming for PM in absence of Rabi. That's why the discussion failed. Don't blame on Kulman Ghising.  Kulman Ghising is the only person, that knows bureaucracy from core. He knows where to tweak and break. They can't fool him. He is needed for country. If RSP wants change. Then, they must give up their ego.|||You can read the indepth article to find out how Sumana and the gang along with Balen and Kulman tried to oust Rabi from his own party. https://www.nepalpress.com/2025/11/03/656615/|||There's no any alternative to Congress and UML.

From any browser:  Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID → Find iPhone → select your Mac from All Devices and use the same options.   What each option does:  Play Sound — helps if it’s nearby.  Mark as Lost / Lock — remotely locks the Mac with a passcode and shows your message/phone number on screen. It also disables Apple Pay.  Erase Mac — wipes data. Use only if you’re sure you can’t get it back; after erasing you can no longer track it.   2) If Find My was not enabled  Tracking is much harder.

I used to work for a Nepali Marwari owner here in the US who had around 30 stores under one of the biggest wireless companies in the country. Dude was loaded the brand name itself brought in enough business to make him filthy rich.  But man, the micromanagement was on another level. He believed employees should always be under pressure. Two minutes late? You’d get sent home with 2–3 follow-up emails. He had cameras everywhere and watched every move if you touched your phone for even a second, you’d get an email warning.  We had to message the group chat every time we clocked in, went on break, and clocked out while doing same in an app. It was ridiculous. The managers around him were total yes-men with no real management skills or education, just doing whatever the boss said.  Most of us employees were Nepali, Indian, or other South Asians, and we just tolerated it. But eventually, they started pulling the same nonsense with the white employees constant monitoring, weird punishments, and micromanaging everything. Those folks didn’t stay quiet.  When they complained, he retaliated by transferring them to faraway locations (which, by the way, is illegal in the US I didn’t even know that back then). They ended up suing the company.  After months of legal battles, the owner lost big time. He had to settle for almost $1 million, and worst of all, he lost his business licenses. Now, he can’t make any major business decisions without approval from the state attorney.  Man had everything going for him a successful business, money, connections but greed and micromanagement destroyed it all|||Wow, the folks over at SCN really do seem to be speedrunning labor law violations.

Tech adaptations are wide and quick, but regulation and accountability are close to non-existent. There is also a steep decline in the quality and camaraderie of the developer community.   Ultimately, the possibility and goal of earning well compared to other professions is and has been the motivation for lots of young graduates getting into software/product development/design. With the field now getting more complex and overwhelming to start as a beginner, and the unstable tech-job market, it puts more pressure on newcomers to integrate.  For these kinds of companies (mostly newly started, providing services as consultants for foreign companies), there's a low probability of growing to the scale of other established tech companies in Nepal. But I'm not trying to undermine and paint a negative image here. Rather, it can be the best opportunity and environment for a motivated individual to learn and grow together with team members.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So, here are a couple of points I'd like to suggest to newcomers/students getting into this profession:  * **GROWTH**: Always keep your individual growth as the main motivator. Keep it as a core \"essence\" of being a developer. Comparing yourself with your own past self will help you a lot in the long run. Secondly, a good payslip is always great to have as a +motivator. * **Incremental & Iterative**: Anything you'll learn or want to improve upon will take time. You'll need to make mistakes/errors, analyse why and how they occurred, and do it again with the correction. * **EMPATHY**: It's what most people lack in every field, and I like to believe that people can change. An empathetic co-worker makes the working environment more pleasant just by being in the office. They will see their team members as a collaborator in their work rather than their 'juniors' or just 'people who work under their command'.  If the 'co-worker' or 'supervisor', who'll be involved with your onboarding/daily tasks, lacks any understanding of these aspects, then I believe they're not quite fit for a LEADERSHIP role, despite their years of experience and how much BETTER of a developer they are.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|||[deleted]|||\\#CompanyProfiling   noted!|||This is exactly what happens abroad lol.",

First of all, India has a 1bn population. Given the hostility between the US and china, most of the big tech have their satellite offices in India, and that gets so much of techs from India. Because, people see scope in tech, many Indians go for BTech, CS.  But - how much of tech innovation do you see from India vs China or the US?  There was a time once when you could hire 5 people in India with a budget for 1 in the US. Now that is slowly going away, so many of the tech companies are now expanding in Africa and Latin America.|||Lol I work with Indians in a US company, don't get me wrong there are a lot of quality indians software engineers but this premise about Indians being the only one who are crazy tech talented is a joke, if that was the case we'd see some innovative indian tech company comparable to the ones from China/US.|||'America Kya keheta tha' ?|||Bill Gates also said he would rather hire lazy people to his company because they would find an easier way to do difficult task.|||I once interned at one of the FAANG (now MAANG) companies, and from my experience, I can say without a doubt that Indians play a massive role in the top American tech firms. They’ve become an inseparable part of the U.S. IT industry a huge portion of the real engineering work is done by them. These companies rely heavily on Indian talent, and because of that, Indian Americans have grown to become quite influential, even in U.S. politics. It’s no surprise that they’re now the highest-earning ethnic group in the entire country.  I remember one senior engineer I worked with a German once told me, *“Indian Americans are the 21st-century Jews of America.”* That line stuck with me.  But it does make you wonder if Indians are so talented, why isn’t India as developed as the U.S.? The main issue is the lack of a strong support system and consistent government backing for innovation and startups. For a long time, India didn’t create the right environment to make full use of its skilled people.  Now, about whether India is catching up to China in tech not quite yet. Chinese engineers are incredibly skilled, and China still has a big edge in infrastructure, funding, and startup ecosystems. Right now, India sits at number three, behind the U.S. and China, in the global tech scene. But give it another 20–25 years, and India could very well take the second spot, right after China.  That said, India’s future looks bright. The liberalization policies and the country’s strong emphasis on education have built a solid foundation. Institutions like the IITs, AIIMS, and IIMs have produced some of the best minds in engineering, medicine, and business. These people are driving not just India’s growth but also global innovation. With an open economy, a thriving startup culture, and millions of ambitious young people, India is steadily moving toward becoming one of the leading technology and economic powers of the world behind China.|||Is there another Microsoft in China though?|||India chai haina China le chai banauxa arko MS    They are good at creating and that works too   India on other hand will send huge skilled resources tara banauna chai sakdaina hai   India ko IT market thulo xa    ani China ko le ta duniya nai chalya xa hai   reminded of some so called nepali techfluencers haru    Nepal lai IT hub banayera tech revolution lyaune    some dude from NASIT (shitty association of IT comanies of Nepal)|||Well Indians are great at tech that's a fact we can't deny that.

The reality is that India lacks internet giants, nor does it have widely used software applications. Even the major software applications developed domestically are from the US. While you could argue that Indians participated in the development of these applications, it's still not Indian software. This isn't entirely bad, however. The internet industry is dominated by only two major players: the US and China. Even Europe and Japan have seen their internet industries and talent drained by the US. For example, in the electric vehicle industry, Chinese electric vehicle companies are internet giants, while German electric vehicle companies are industrial giants. Germany's lack of internet talent forces it to partner with Chinese companies for technology, whereas 30 years ago, China partnered with German automakers due to a lack of technology. Before his death, Henry Kissinger expressed concern about Europe's extreme lack of long-term strategic planning. Many Europeans still fail to grasp this reality, their thinking still mired in outdated Cold War thinking, which sees a Soviet Union as the scapegoat for all their mistakes. India and many other countries haven't fared any better than Europe.|||Bro been working with Indians for last 2 years. 90% of them are \"Kaam chorr\".|||1.

Confident xaina vanya you can take it to repair store.|||ashambhav|||If the laptop can be upgraded to an SSD, it will improve the boot time and make it somewhat faster. After that, you might consider upgrading the RAM. However, some older laptops have limits on how much RAM they support. For example, my old Sony Vaio can handle up to 8GB, while an older Dell model only supports a maximum of 4GB. You can easily check online by searching your laptop model to find out if it supports SSD upgrades and the maximum RAM capacity.  Also note that in Nepal the shop are asking upward of 2-3,000 NPR for each 4gb RAM module, claiming a 6-month warranty.   Since my brother studies in India, he managed to get me an 4/4gb - total of 8GB RAM for a much cheaper price, around 249 INR.   Best of luck|||firstly that laptop looks ancient. and youre running windows. you can optimize windows to run faster on low end devices but its still windows, its shit. adding RAM will help. you will soon find out that you have a lot of processes running in the background (coz windows) and will cause you problems during multi process workloads. if youre up for it install a linux mint or ubuntu. get some more RAM and if your laptop supports it an SSD|||buy a ssd 128 gb, insert 4 gb ram. that will be the cheapest way to make laptop faster.|||Let your laptop rest in peace.|||go Linux.

            "body": "Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about job security in the IT field here in Nepal. I earn in lakhs even with just a few years of experience, which I’m grateful for, but I can’t help wondering how long this will last.  Sure, I could aim for higher-paying roles or even start my own company, but honestly, that feels too risky right now. The market doesn’t seem very promising, and the uncertainty makes it hard to plan for the future.  At the same time, I know this routine: waking up early, going to work every day, coming home late, getting two days off won’t stay exciting forever. Sometimes I feel like I’m just running on autopilot.  Part of me envies people with government jobs. The pay might be lower, but there’s stability, no pressure to constantly learn new tech, and no fear of layoffs. Just a simple, secure, and peaceful life.  Does anyone else feel the same way? How do you deal with the uncertainty of IT jobs here?",

All the work to make someone else rich and with rapid growth of AI, job uncertainty is at it's peak. Already done with corporate.

Got a good tech job & didn’t study bachelors after +2. Will stay here if I keep earning what I am right now else I’ll move.|||Stayed after +2, and completed my bachelor's a year ago. Had started working professionally 2 years ago with a beginning salary of 12k per month. Kept on switching jobs until I reached 40k. Tara i realized ki I can earn more for the amount of work i do abroad so I'm planning to purse my masters in Australia.   I would say youth should stay until they complete their bachelor's in the country. Tespaxi they will know if either staying or going abroad is the best choice.

First Salary was Rs. 16,000 (at Javra on 2019). After 3 months of internship, I joined another MNC company for Rs. 45,000. By Dec, 2023 my salary had increased to Rs. 1,44,000. I worked as Software Engineer in one MNC in Kathmandu. Were all of my classmates able to get similar jobs / salary? No. Were few earning even more than me? Yes.    In the hindsight, I think my best decision was to stay here for bachelors degree & get that skill and work-experience in Nepal. Now, I'm in USA and working with one of the top fortune 100 companies as software engineer. My journey to here was much easier than other students who came for bachelors.      I know that my suggestion can be truly biased on what I faced after my bachelors degree here, but if you are planning to study computer related field, and can work hard on your skills, then there are good paying MNCs here. One of my friends is supposedly earning 3lakhs+ monthly salary in Nepal.       TL:DR; I'd suggest at least study bachelors here and gain few years of professional experience before going abroad. You'll 100% not regret it.|||I stayed after +2, stayed after bachelors. I dont feel any regrets not going abroad till date.

I think its a huge mistake personally. I know there are many people who have done great in their lives. but I feel like (in the context of Japan) its a huge mistake to move after +2 because the cultural and language barrier is so high that even people with masters degree are working in convenient stores and other low paying jobs that need no academics. after +2 you just are so young and confused that you don't even know what you want in life and what are your options. at least after Bachelor's I'd guess you get what you should expect from life in general. also after Bachelor's its far easier to apply and get approved as opposed to after +2. also Bachelor's is very cheap compared to bidesh. Leaving the country as a teenager and growing up throughout my early 20s in bides has had me plant a doubt of growth in me. i feel like i have wasted my potential in Japan. I did 2 years of language and 4 years of graphic design and am currently studying 3d designing (1st year) as soon as i complete my study i wanna try and leave this country for good.   but I can also give a reason why you should move. 1. exposure at a young age. you get to experience things for the first time which is a doorway to learn many things about yourself and everything else. you see things that you have never even imagined. different languages and different cultures are important to live outside the bubble and see the world a little differently   2. privacy. in Nepal we have zero privacy. you do get total privacy and you can enjoy your alone time in solitude. this also comes with loneliness so be prepared to live a lonely life for the most part. loneliness also comes with anxiety and depression so try to keep yourself busy and in a circle.   3. life lessons. you start earning and learn to budget your expenses. you realize earning is easy and how much your parents had to sacrifice for you to be where you are. you also start getting very confident because now you are king of your own decisions.  4. You understand where you and your country lacks and how you can improve it. In Nepal there are many areas where change is necessary and if you never see it from others POV you will never know that it needs fixing. for example, i never cooked while i was in Nepal because mom did it all the time. but after coming here i have learned to cook some good food and also learned communication skills because of my work. also you see what exactly is not good in nepal and get the idea how you can fix it. for example lines in hospitals and other businesses like ward offices and banks. this can easily be fixed with a simple token and display. also supermarket like bhat bhateni can be improved with better staff training for efficiency  5.You can finally buy the things you couldn't afford as a kid. and you can buy the gifts for your family without having to worry about money so much. the face they make when you hand them the gifts is just priceless.  6. quality of life increases because you learn to keep yourself healthy and hygienic all the time. wearing nice clothes and with better styles uplifts your life by folds.   7. BAD SIDE  : you might also start drinking and smoking very often leading to sickness in the future when you are in your 30s and 40s|||I think it's the personal choice.

Marriage is a two way street. I can also say that a lot of women have inflated egos but I'm not gonna make such statements.   People need to understand that when two people live together, both need to compromise a bit. What they compromise on and how much depends on their partners.  This post is extremely one sided and not representative of reality because love marriages are almost as common as arranged marriage. Some communities have more, others less.   Also, if arranged marriages are removed from societies, women would need to get married to someone who's not yet settled in life. If not, they'd have to marry someone who's much older or wait till they're in their late 20s - mid 30s. Almost nobody is well settled in their careers in their 20s.|||Omg, why men get so much hate for no reason let them live a peaceful life leave them alone|||https://preview.redd.it/mgw54f3ymgxf1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=2354d343c7a3e21eecae47b92b774715cd28c2a1  at least comeup with some originality and authencity. Definitely any Nepali would not want to get arranged with such cheap copies.|||eaa huss|||Average women of Nepal is better than average man of Nepal but that does not allow us to hate on men as a whole.   To further clarify:   Upper echelon men and women mostly date at their level of wealth, attractiveness and power.  Average men and women will date on their level as well but an average women has higher chance of dating upper echelon of men and women in comparison to average men.   Lower echelon men and women also date each other most of the time but lower echelon women also have higher chance of dating average men and women in comparison to lower echelon men.  This should not be about man vs women if we are  in a relatively good society than Nepal but we are not in a equal society.  (Also if you think inequality does not exist just because you didn't experience it, then you are part of the inequality equation)  Nepali society ma misogyny dherai Cha which will lead to misandry someday.  Mysogny should be reduced for the sake of equality, not for the sake of preventing misandry.  (Also attractiveness and wealth  plays a good amount of role in the dating circle of Nepal to the point where a lot of insane shortcomings become ignored)|||introvert me  ![gif](giphy|COYGe9rZvfiaQ)|||I don't agree that most men will find it hard to find a partner|||[deleted]|||Generalization tbh.

Also, if men don't get married, women automatically don't get married too.|||This is why I believe in dowry concept it might sound rude but this is what it is. Since, most of the people have their past life and multiple relationships even before marriage these days. And that relation sometimes seems so so deeply rooted that it becomes difficult to forget. Some are involved in extramarital affairs as well. Then there's bitterness in the present married life and relations with family of husband. Now assume if her husband was single till the marriage for a perfect wife but what he got? Nothing but mental tension afterwards.   The psychological impact a normal people can't even bear. And sometimes girls even planned to marry a rich guy just for money and then divorce and get alimony which she'll spend with her lover. Sometimes, she even plans to kill her husband to get out of that thing. This is freaking crazy how people are thinking this way. I'm not justifying that she's the only culprit here but also her ex cum present hidden lover is equally involved.   Now in this situation it's better to live unmarried or take a grand amount as collateral if you are doing an arranged marriage. So that it will be easier for alimony.   You might call me bias but the thing is different. If we alternate the situation like a groom will have to leave his home and settle with bride forever, and if alimony should be paid by the bride after getting divorced, yeah a groom should have to give dowry as the collateral.   Fun fact: Love marriages crash faster than arranged ones. It’s like 1 v 1 versus many v many, so too many players in the latter provide team support 😅 during clashes.

The same thing is happening everywhere. Marriage isn't a means for money or safety anymore as it used to be. Women now are independent and can handle their own finances It's not even about social standing anymore, the patriarchal lines of hierarchy are slowly but surely getting blurred.   Nowadays, marriage is about partnership, trust, companionship, love and respect. Most men haven't understood that and would rather blame women as being \"gold diggers\" than realize that it's not the money (or the lack thereof) that influences the attitudes of women towards them.

            "body": "Hello everyone,  I never thought I’d be writing this again. I wish our situation had gotten better since my last post… but reality has been harsher than I ever imagined.  My father is battling Stage 3 Gall Bladder Cancer, and his treatment at RGCI, Delhi is ongoing. We somehow managed to complete 5 chemo cycles , by selling whatever little we had, taking loans, borrowing from friends and relatives, and emptying every bit of savings. But now, we are completely drained .. emotionally, mentally, and financially.  The doctors say the next few chemo cycles are critical . If we stop now, everything we’ve fought for so far might go in vain. But the treatment cost has now gone beyond ₹20 lakhs, and we have nothing left to continue.  My father is a simple, hardworking man a small farmer and shopkeeper from a middle-class family. He spent his entire life making sure we never felt our struggles,have some good education. Only now do I truly see how much he silently sacrificed for us. I’m still in college, trying to study, trying to stay strong, but watching him in pain and feeling helpless is tearing me apart. i feel cancer is the worst thing you can ever deal with .  I’ve seen my mother cry silently in the corner every night, and my sisters trying to smile despite knowing how close we are to losing everything. I keep telling them we’ll make it that I’ll find a way but right now, I don’t know how much longer we can hold on without help.  In my last post, so many kind souls came forward. I’m truly, deeply grateful — we managed to raise about ₹1.5 lakh, which helped us cover chemotherapy and hospital bills. Every rupee meant the world to us. 🙏  But the journey is far from over. We still need around ₹20 lakhs more to continue his treatment and give him a real chance at life.  If you’re reading this please, help us if you can. Even a small amount, even a share, even a prayer it all counts.   I’m not asking for sympathy; I’m asking for humanity.

I agree that we have seen many rich and high power people get away with any crime. But let me remind you some cases : Maina Sunuwar, Rabi Lammichanne and other where everyone praised the court and claimed justice stood.Even you might know many of the cases  What I find uncomfortably troubling is that  People have been shifting their narrative about the court in whatever comforts them. Literally what Rabi did : When big politicians got GUITY from the court he said \"adalat le vaneko namanne?\"  When it was his turn he said every court is corrupt trying to get away. We are facing a same scenario here. Firstly the case was approached from a minor consent. And as far i believe the age couldn't be proven to be under 18.

I don’t know Sandeep personally and don’t care if he’s arrogant or k k. It doesn’t matter. Because that’s not why he’s defamed.   Aba you’ll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re. Harek din naya bayaan and naya kahaani. Kt party ko main intention nai was to get as much of compensation as possible rather than punishing Sandeep.

This is an insane lifestyle, nothing less than Dahal family. If a local ward chairperson can amass such wealth, those at the level of IGP and mantri have looted us taxpayers a hundred times higher.   This guy is apparently the son of nepal’s most corrupt chief justice Gopal Parajuli, btw he had to resign because of fake citizenship. Openly flexing luxury cars and watches on social media. Arent we tired of them by now?  The poor doesnt have access to proper ambulances, meanwhile ankit khand the son of nepali citizenship seller balkrishna khand takes helicopters, everywhere he goes! Manju Khand ko chorra.

This is why we are exposing corruption in nepal  Sangita Pahadi has recently been sued by CIAA for 3 arba scam. Their children have been living a lavish lifestyle since ages. No shame. 30 hajar ko talab, 30 ota gharbari. Finish them all.  We found another generational corruption run. Khushi Pandey is the granddaughter of Ramesh Nath Pandey, he was the FORMER MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, INDUSTRY, TOURISM, ENVIRONMENT and COMMUNICATIONS. She is also the daughter of Nischal Nath Pandey, who served as a government employee during ramesh nath pandey’s long ministerial run. Look at this damn lifestyle. How is it possible to afford all of this when the family has nothing except civil service for the past 50 years?  Supriya Bohora, granddaughter of Deepak Bohora, former member of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and the House of Representatives, has recently come under the spotlight. Deepak Bohora was known for his strong hand in the Panchayat system and his unwavering support for the monarchy. His political journey is remembered not only for his allegiance to authoritarian structures but also for allegations of corruption. One of the most prominent accusations linked to Deepak Bohora is the illegal consumption of land where the Fun Park ice rink in Bhadrakali Road now stands. What was once a symbol of political maneuvering and alleged misappropriation of public assets is now being flaunted by his granddaughter as a mark of achievement, raising questions about how the spoils of corruption are normalized across generations.  Anusandhan khai ta comrade? Granddaughter living in europe to protect all the money stored in swiss bank. EXPOSE THEM ALL!  Most corrupted ones are the generals from police special dsp and upwards.👮 I have seen them using massive funds to get their sons n daughters abroad or in prestigious schools by paying hefty fees. their home looks like that of a king , literally narayanhiti jastai same and their sons n daughters are living the life of luxuries carrying iphones and designer dresses and bags . Actually what these officer do is they heavily launder money and budgets which comes to their department . They practice “milijuli khane” . They also take funds from criminals to manage cases. Then they use these funds to bribe politicians for getting higher post like dsp to dig , from DIG to IG and so on . They conduct massive weddings and ceremonies spending crore of rupees. this is same with army generals as well.  `-`  **TLDR - REGISTER AND CONVINCE YOUR FRIENDS, COUSINS IF THEY STILL HAVE NOT MADE VOTER ID**  Read an interesting blog on this. Hamro lato politician le k bujhla esto. Chorra chorri lai instagram delete garna chai layo dhanna teti chai buddhi raicha.  >The corrupt ruling elites of the Third World, who used to steal everything, destroy economies, and create hell for their own populations, have now added one more thing: they openly allow their children to flaunt the spoils of corruption on Instagram, right in front of their starving people. Something previous generations never witnessed.  >The new rich have never gone through a revolution so they don't understand not to flaunt their wealth like the old bourgeoisie who have witnessed multiple revolutions throughout history. It's ironic that the Maoists instigated a revolution yet the children of said Maoists are now living the luxurious lives posting everything not knowing whats simmering in society. It looks like at least the kids have understood not to flaunt their stolen wealth to avoid angering the masses.  >In any ways what happened in Nepal highlights a trend I’ve discussed on here before, which is how Instagram utterly radicalizes youth heavy developing societies.  >Suddenly you as a poor but striving young man or woman have full visibility to how the elite/upper class of your country + diaspora live, but you have little access or hope of ever living the same for the most part. The impact of this on mental health, societal stability, and also fertility rates cannot be underestimated.  >Imagine going from a society with five state channels and a few cable options in the 2000s to Instagram in just five years. That’s what happened to all of South Asia + Africa + a lot of Latin America.  These guys were being exposed to the lifestyles of the baddie daughters and Chad sons of the fucktards ruling their country,  >You see their trip to Japan and London for the summer. See their parties at their elite mansions in the most posh suburbs and neighborhoods and you realize you’re just fucked and not getting there ever, your country simply does not have the mechanism to enable that for you, you’re unemployed even despite a college degree.  >**Upward mobility is like a pressure valve. Nepal never had that. The elites taxed people, slapped tariffs on imports & ignored building institutions that foster upward mobility. Instead, they assumed that sending their populace to the Middle East would be sufficient.**  >What’s surprising is how the corrupt politicians allow their kids to flaunt stolen wealth so brazenly. Kids of politicians in developing countries flaunting their extravagant lifestyles on public Instagram accounts is so foolhardy. Exposure to social media and bragging about your luxurious lifestyle risks fuelling resentment and envy.  >It's how uprisings have always been. Old bourgeoisie don't show off their wealth like those Nepali elites did. This behavior is what got both the iranian and russian noble families killed. This also happened in Mongolia earlier this year, although less dramatically. The Prime Minister had to step down due to protests that kicked off because his son was showing off his luxury holidays and clothes too much on Instagram.",

No, yet most nations frown or ban them from being raised for slaughter.  The same is true here. Cows are important part of their religious or cultural identity for most Nepalese people.

We are Hindu majority. Nepalese of all religion are already normalized to not consuming beef, this will start a conflict amongst our own majority. Us not consuming beef has kept Muslims and Christians in low numbers- they are major consumers of beef and send missionaries everywhere to increase their numbers. If there are two similarly sized groups with different people- that will create political conflict and add to our issues. We already see this play out in western countries- they have major political issues around Muslims and recently Indians (who they associate with Hinduism which they've already begun to hate in Canada, and if you a brown Nepali- you are Indian to them) Don't make moves that will drive your own group's numbers low. We have to keep the status quo in regards to issues like this.   Not eating cow has not created any issue that is worth our attention. Focus on tackling actual issues like further eradicating this baun, chettri nonsense which is the bane of Hinduism- we can and are doing it while keeping our culture, traditions and identity.|||just say chamal ko bora ta paako this , visa ni paaulas ni and move on|||So much for a secular nation|||lets eat beef guys",

People romanticize going abroad, but they don’t realize it’s a full reset! Your last name, your family status, your struggles back home, none of it matters. What counts is how disciplined and valuable you are in that new system.  I’d add, learn to manage your emotions too. It’s not just physical or financial survival — it’s mental. You’ll feel lonely, rejected, homesick, but those who turn that into fuel grow faster than anyone else. Also, you don’t have to be the smartest person, but be reliable.

            "body": "I always thought my life was done for. I was a bad son and a bad brother. I let my family down so many times that they eventually kicked me out. Fair enough, I couldn’t offer them anything except shame and duniya ko tana. I’ve heard things like “Yesto xora janmaunu vanda na janmekai thik hunthyo”. Those words used to hurt me a lot, but still I couldn’t change.  I’ve done many wrong things in life which i regrets . Been to jail a few times, have criminal charges, got rusticated from college because of fights, couldn’t complete my bachelor. Friends betrayed me too they were only there when they could use me. As time passed, I got more depressed. Most of the time, only suicidal thoughts used to come to my mind. I had no place to stay, used to sleep where I worked or sometimes on the street.  One day I finally decided I’d had enough. Bought a mouse poison, tried to take my life. But at the very last moment I was too scared to die. I cried for a long time that night. I realized how miserable I had become to even think of doing that.  But that night I also realized something  maybe I’m not done yet. Maybe there’s still a small ray of hope. I still wanted to live, and live a good life. I had only two options: either change myself completely or kill myself. I couldn’t choose the second option.  So I started working hard doing different odd jobs. Quitted smoking and drinking at once it was so hard. I used to get worst panic attacks, but I managed.   Now I’ve been clean for a year. I have my own small room to live in, my own second-hand bike, and I earn through a ride-sharing app. I also started self-studying because I couldn’t finish my bachelor. Been learning programming from YouTube for two months now. It’s tough, but I’m thinking of joining classes soon. Someone told me you don’t need a college degree to become a software developer, and that really motivated me.  I even tried to apply abroad, but because of my police record it wasn’t possible. So now I just want to become someone respectable in my own country. I want to prove my father wrong. They still don’t know where I am, but one day I’ll go to them when they can proudly call me their son.  It feels unreal sometimes that I have my own room, my own food, my own bike , own laptop(second hand😁) all this within just one year. I can’t believe it. A year ago, I wanted to die. Now I just want to live better. Even though I'm alone , It really feels like dream to live like this.   Happy Happy tihar everyone and happy  bhaitika. Aja didi ko kasto yaad aayo!! Pic 7 year ago this day.  My last bhai tika.",

If nothing is done, the problem will likely get worse and could lead to harm to himself or others. Do not let him slip into a darker path. Take initiative and recommend behavioral therapy now. Physical punishment is not an appropriate way to communicate with a five‑year‑old.

At the end of the day, even though I scored 3.97 GPA, In the Kathmandu Metro Scholarship exam, I choked. I barely made it onto the second nomination list and ended up in a college that’s just “okay.” But honestly, I don’t blame the college I blame myself. There were others who got into better colleges than me, even though they had lower grades. So, I can’t say grades don’t matter, but the first term really showed me how tough things can get. I know I need to improve, and I’m determined to do so. I got an A+ in Computer Science, even though I didn’t study as much as I should have. I love Computer Science and building a lot of skills in the field. Right now, though, I’ve decided to take a break from everything every extracurricular activity, including learning JavaScript, React, and other things. I know I probably shouldn’t, but I feel like it’s necessary for now. Starting today, I’ll be locking my phone and using my laptop strictly for studying. I need to focus on my second terminal exams, and it’s time to set boundaries.If I’ve said anything wrong, I apologize. I don’t blame anyone or anything but myself, even though I studied harder than I ever have. My lack of proper note-taking has cost me. Right now, I’m just looking for advice from seniors who have gone through this and come back stronger, getting good results in the end.",

There could be others, who scored 1000, 999 and 998 before you. So, competition is tough, repeating same thing multiple times doesn't mean, good score. Overtime, brain starts to saturate, hallucinate and if not taken care, gives up and become mad. The competition itself is not for light hearted.

            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I’ve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don’t know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

Lately, I’ve been more interested in social sciences or subjects related to diplomacy.  I’m not the type to sit in a room all day buried in books. I love exploring the world, meeting people, understanding life, and actually working for society. Engineering feels like endless calculations, IT and physics don’t excite me anymore, and law… I just can’t spend years memorizing articles and stressing over licenses. I also don’t want to do BSW/BASW because too many people struggle to find work after that.  I want a bachelor’s where I can study and work at the same time since my family do not earn well and I definitely have to look after my family after 12. So, are there any courses that actually fit someone like me — social, practical, people-oriented, and not purely academic or number-based? Any suggestions?",

And 12th is alll about organic ,yup almost all.The same teacher will teach u organic chem till the last day of 12th ,yup u heard it right.However, its not the matter to be intimidated .Personally i practiced organic each day,some day i took a break obviously .So, ya u should revise it from the first chapter. My organic chap teacher was amazing ,calm and gave notes and also provided ideas to make it easier to study while i was in KMC . If u dont have those ,study from youtube.  Ya and i got an overall 3.8  and ya forgot to mention, If u dont understand a topic than u have youtube .To be frankly honest,i used to watch a lecture from youtube everytime a topic or concept or terms even if its subtle. Without the teachers from youtube, well i wouldnt have scored even a 3.6. Only a handful number of teachers teaches the best while others simply recite what is shown on the slides.|||Chem is all about consistency daily class na oadhako concept bujni ho ani al din aagadi mop up garera ni sakkincha|||Ma ta cheat chorera pass vako ho yaar :)|||Well 11 is not like 10, you have to study, hunatw ma ni ekdin agadi padera +2 katako ho, but chemistry ko lagi chai you need to revise reaction haru.
