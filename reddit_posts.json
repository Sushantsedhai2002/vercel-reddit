Income is more in bidesh, but that definitely comes as cost, being far from family, almost 0 social and cultural life, and so on.   If I had everything normal after my +2, I'd have decided to stay in Nepal. So, don't make bidesh the first choice. Running from problems is not always the best option, try to solve em. I'll be returning Nepal soon either, ASAP.   We have normalized going bidesh as it is the only way for us, instead it shouldn't have been like that. We were born in Nepal, raised in Nepal, our first thinking must be how we can grow young and old in Nepal. But idk, maybe the failure of system, we're thinking going foreign is our only option after plus two. We have universities, we have jobs, we have a good economy, we have peaceful life, we have no wars like in syria, no crimes like in honduras, pakistan, we have the best nature's gift as we can be at -4° to 40° at same day, we can have a very good life in Nepal only.   Imo, study in Nepal, struggle to find job, find it, live it and go on. If you wanna go bidesh, go for travel and foreign trips. Don't make foreign studies as first option. If you get scholarship, get one, travel and come back is what I'd suggest.

CCTV shows I did not have the phone when I got inside, and it was too hard to see what happened in the CCTVs outside of the airport. It was pretty crowded.  Thanks in advance for comments. And I am sorry (and upset) for everyone who has also gotten their phones stolen and they were important to you beyond material value.  P.S. Do you think we could strategize together and bust those places that deal with stolen phones and collectively recover them? I mean, I bet it's been done before, individually, to buy a stolen phone back, with some knowledge and connections.

They  know their clients better  in and out from their own experience. And those 'gundas' can bring in clients with their PR.   Most of the them are ex-patients themselves either hired by the management or they have opened up new on their own.   During the early 2000s, Rehab business was in its peak in Kathmandu because drug use was high among youths. I suppose they aren't as popular as they used to be.   Drug addicts are taken as next to a 'danger' criminals in our society. Therefore,  a gunda is needed to deal with a dangerous criminal who can do all the security needed activities like a bouncer or guard. Since the gundas are in the management too, the official workstyle becomes gundalike too.   Most of the patients in rehab are admitted without their consent. 'Kidnapping-like-admittance' is pretty normal. Since drug abusers are considered ill and thus are considered mentaly unfit to decide on their own, any harsh measure is permissable to those gundas once the parents/guardian of the patients signs the admission form.   Parents mostly do not know anything and are totally helpless. They can do nothing but watch those gundas reduce their kids to rats and cockroaches.   The rehab business is one of the most unregulated business in urban areas. In my time around 15yrs ago,  around 1,00,000 youths were thought to be using drugs in major urban cities.  The number of abusers seem to have dwindled along with the number of rehab centres. We will always need such centers in our society,  so what you've raised is a serious issue.|||Concentration camp nai ho Nepal ko rehab haru. |||Also heard of SA happenning in some of these centers.

Really want to experience it.|||Dherai kura mis managed thiyo I agree, but just clarifying a few things which were already mentioned during briefing and later when u brought it up in whatsapp group.  Firstly, venue related problems were our fault. We should’ve planned better, will do better at that. The venue wasn’t suitable for a hackathon and we should’ve known that.  But these are the things I’d like to clarify:  - It was just a 24 hour hackathon, u can’t expect to have all the mattresses and beds to sleep on when its just 24 hours. However, we did have backup sleeping bags enough for reasonable margin of participants and warm rooms with heaters which would’ve provided if asked for + infirmary if someone wasn’t feeling well.   - Regarding judging, I’m pretty sure the mentors had mentioned in briefing that top N teams samma would be judged according to the regular progress checks done by the mentor and final submission.  You’re complaining about the judge who came in there for 1m to get an idea of what each team is doing. He was unaware of the selection criteria and had no role in selection of Top N teams. The initial screening by the judge was just to get an understanding of all the projects (which again, was mentioned multiple times to each team + the judge was accompanied by the mentor who was doing their final progress check as well)  The mentors selected those teams after reviewing our progress checks for each team and the final submission.  As mentioned multiple times, the judge was only there for judging from the top 10 teams, and as he was the sole sponsor for the event, it seemed reasonable for him to judge it along validated more by his industry experience.   The other feedback regarding food, venue and logistics are valid and the team will work on it on upcoming events. We should’ve planned better and done better on those aspects, on behalf of the management team I apologize for it.",

And since it is the only decent khaja ghar affordable for me near Bodhi study room, I will have to not go there hence not come to Bodhi at all.  - Rs.3500/month is expensive. Add khaja, petrol, it sucks 10,000 every month from my savings.  - The cubicles suffer from mosquito problems. There is no net on windows.  - It is an expensive area. And it makes me overeat as I eat lot when I am out. It is increasing my weight.  I have finally found a peaceful room in my home.",

            "body": "I’ve been working as a developer for about a year now. I started at my current company as an intern, and honestly, I’ve learned so much here. I can handle almost all the frontend work on a project now, and even some backend. The company has been really good to me, and I’m truly grateful for the opportunities I’ve had.  When I joined, I got my first increment about four months after the internship, and another one around eleven months later. I’m happy about that, but lately, I’ve been feeling like my growth has slowed down. I’m not learning as much as I used to, and things are starting to feel a bit repetitive.  Recently, I received an offer from another company. The salary they’re offering is about the same as what I’m getting now, but they mentioned that they review performance regularly and adjust pay more frequently. I feel confident that I can perform well there.  To be honest, I’m also not totally satisfied with my current salary. I feel like in the new company, I’d have a better chance of getting raises faster based on performance.  The main reasons I’m considering the new opportunity are:  * Better growth and learning opportunities * Faster salary raises based on performance * I don’t want to stay stuck in one company for too long * I feel like, since I’m just starting out, I should explore more and get diverse experience instead of staying in one place for too long  At the same time, I can’t help but feel a bit guilty about leaving the company that helped me get this far. I’m also hesitant because I’m currently handling most of the work on one project that’s close to completion. However, I’m not sure when it will actually be done since new features keep getting added as requirements change.  It’s also a bit awkward to bring up the topic of leaving. Has anyone else gone through a similar situation? How did you decide?  Also, for those who’ve been in similar roles — what’s a reasonable salary range for a full-stack developer with about one year of experience?",

What changed is a new court interpretation that looks more at who paid for what and whose name the property’s under.  In short they are approaching it in a more nuanced way.It’s gender-neutral and still considers years of marriage, kids and even non financial contributions but it’s not some blanket rule like “wife gets nothing”. Basically, it’s about clearer proof, not banning claims. Stop oversimplifying laws and for once, read past the headline before running with it.   And btw, alimony is a gender-neutral term it’s not solely “for women.” The reason most recipients are women is because many are still financially tied to their husbands. If the husband earns less than the wife, the court can absolutely order her to pay alimony instead.|||The topic is more complex than our simplistic thoughts like that  Nepal ma maximum ladies get no fokkin inheritance from their born family ani they spend a boatload on marriage (the ceremony, bhoj, daijo) ani then if the guy goes around and cheats, he beats her up, etc she is def owed half of everything he owns  Tara no fault divorces ma chai testo hunu hunna hai feri (nepal and most of the world ma testai huncha) ho it makes some sense cause most women are tied down financially to their husbands but aesma female ko financial independence improve garne ho na ki divorce ma j bhaye ni aadi sampatti badhne|||Could go either ways.|||https://preview.redd.it/djl1pbukrczf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=d953bd1827a3a6fbe3e523a22994eca84b54a572  [https://www.quora.com/China-executes-white-collar-criminals-Has-this-proven-to-be-a-great-deterrent-from-crime-in-general](https://www.quora.com/China-executes-white-collar-criminals-Has-this-proven-to-be-a-great-deterrent-from-crime-in-general)  Nepal ma yo chai garnai parcha.

He said, “**पोखरा एयरपोर्टको भ्रष्टाचार त ट्रेलर मात्र हो। २३ अर्बको जग्गा खरिद गरेर भैरहवा एयरपोर्टमा भ्रष्टाचार भएको छ। अहिले त्यो एयरपोर्टमा हजारौँ भैंसी चरिरहेका छन्, माछापालन भइरहेको छ।”**  >The complaint, filed on Chaitra 3, 2081 BS (March 16, 2025), claims that although the airport project cost around Rs. 6 billion excluding land compensation, an additional Rs. 13 billion was allegedly misappropriated through fraudulent practices related to land acquisition, compensation distribution, and equipment procurement.  >**According to the petitioner, compensation for land acquisition was massively inflated beyond official government rates. It is alleged that properties not connected to main roads were compensated at premium rates, typically reserved for road-adjacent plots, due to collusion between project officials and local brokers**. **Land that had been donated for public use—such as temples, schools, and monasteries—was reportedly acquired under false claims from individuals pretending to be heirs of deceased owners, and compensation was disbursed under fraudulent identities.**  >**The complaint also accuses project officials of inflating assessments for damage to homes and public buildings in order to receive kickbacks.** The funds, initially deposited in the name of legitimate landowners, were allegedly siphoned off by brokers acting on behalf of corrupt officials, including then Project Chief Prabhesh Adhikari and accountant Pradeep Kumar Sah.  >**Whenever a new infrastructure project is proposed, intermediaries quickly become active. Those with strong political connections buy local land at low prices and then inflate its value to claim higher compensation.  According to the complainant, Yogesh Bhattarai discouraged his fellow lawmakers from raising corruption concerns during the visit, presenting the airport project as a success despite objections from other committee members. The complaint suggests that Bhattarai maintained close ties with CAAN Director General Pradeep Adhikari** and benefited from personal favors, including a luxury cars and alleged investments made in real estate and hospitality ventures under the names of Bhattarai and his relatives. Due to political pressure, compensation was paid at up to nine times the land’s actual value.  >  [बुढीगण्डकी जलविद्युत आयोजना : १० वर्षमा जग्गाको मुआब्जामै सकियो झण्डै ४३ अर्ब| सेटिङमा ठेक्का दिने र रद्द गर्ने दाउपेच अब अन्त्य होला ?](https://www.ratopati.com/story/401471/budigandaki)  [https://english.biznessnews.com/posts/budhigandaki-breaks-deadlock-construction-to-kick-off-in-2025](https://english.biznessnews.com/posts/budhigandaki-breaks-deadlock-construction-to-kick-off-in-2025) 0% progress in construction 11 years after DPR.  >For years, disagreements between the Finance and Energy ministries stalled progress.

The price of LPG for cooking remains unchanged at Rs 1,910 per cylinder.  >The Corporation has been claiming to have implemented an automatic system to adjust prices in the Nepali market at the same rate as the international market, but in practice, it has not been able to maintain consumer-friendly prices.

Of this, Rs 264 billion was paid to Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) for purchasing oil, the source said.

If you spend a bit of time gaining the right skills when you are a bachelor student, you can get a remote job super easily. There are hundreds of jobs waiting for you. Earning in $$$ feels like heaven.   My advice for young Nepalese on Reddit:  \\- Bachelor ma pick up a strong tech skill. You will never regret it later.  \\- Ani, If you are a tech student, don’t ignore coding, it opens a lot of doors later on.  **My role: Offensive Security Engineer, Certs I’ve earned: OSCP, OSWE, CREST (CPSA + CRT)**",

My hajurbuwa died due to negligence and misdiagnosis here. My uncle was given the wrong combination of medicine that nearly cost him his life.

They outsource their jobs to poorer countries where people are happy to accept a meager $2800/month, whereas a domestic worker in the US would have to be paid at least double that. So the company saves 50% of their costs pretty much immediately. Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to. If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.   I hope the US government puts into place policies that make outsourcing jobs much more expensive/restrictive than hiring domestic workers.|||What you planning to do with the money saved|||what do you recommend to get the skill on ?|||What courses/sites helped you the most in developing your skills?|||Daily work hour?|||is it that common to find a remote job that pays in dollars or is it very rare? just curious bcz planning to study cs|||Is it too little too late to start at final bachelors year.

I guarantee you that hard work and a spiritual mindset will give you both financial success and internal happiness.  But actually doing that is on you and has near zero to do with where you are born, what your politicians are doing, etc.  Good luck to you.|||Nepal got screwed by its geography and demographics. I don’t think it has much of a future for success. It’s a small landlocked country with no natural resources and tough terrain, which makes it hard to build large cities and slows down trade. It’s stuck between two superpowers, India and China, thus its politics will never be free from their influence. It's very diverse with deep rooted caste/ethnicity issues which makes it harder to unite the country toward a common cause. On top of that, Nepali people are sorta low IQ on average (as are other South Asians) so they can't make up for it in human capital|||nepal needs leaders like Putin, Xi or any other strong leadership. useless democratic leader!|||Nepal ko real problem nepali haru lai nai thaha xaina.

If everyone thought like u , we r done so every citizen's thought matter to his/her country's welfare.|||Y'all all talking about \"hard work\" as if that's the only thing that differentiates developed nations from developing ones. What about taking advantage of your own resources? What about planning your economy in order to take advantage of global supply chains?   We never did that because our system is one that benefits other countries like India and the USA and China. We won't develop because developing would mean we need to care about our own interests and distance ourselves from other countries.   Neo-liberal capitalism won't bring us forward, only socialism will. The only hope a small nation like ours has to develop is if ALL resources our country has (hydro, minerals, tourism) is exploited FULLY for OUR benefits. Only then will we actually develop. We need to fully control private businesses centrally, develop 5 year plans like China to take advantage of the global trade market and allow foreign companies to manufacture inside of Nepal.   Once they start production, we learn how to produce our own products by looking at how they produce and then we can upgrade from a resource exporting country to a manufacturing economy.   This won't take \"hard work\" but a restructure of our system to benefit national interests|||English chai testo ramro raina cha|||ok but who asked?",

            "body": "We started manaslu circuit trek on 25 oct right after Tihar. Unfortunately the weather changed and started raining after the third day and continued to rain till Saturday.  The snowfall in the larke la pass made impossible to complete larke la pass and had to return back to starting poing ( machhakhola ). The way back was also not easy due to rain and landslides.   On the way donwhill there were plenty of landslides and one of the foreigners slipped off while crossing one of them. It was in between pewa and nyak. Although her body was trapped in stones she was breathing. The porter and guides willing to help couldn’t do  so because they didnot had anything to rescue her. Maybe a strong rope could help. There was not even a rope or other emergency kits on the way. Later after so many hours, the police had to carry rope from down where they could not make it till the incident place where the victim has to die helplessly. This is just extreme level of careless despite of taking so many permit charges for the foreigners trekking in manslu circuit.  They have no emergency rescue plan such as information flow system, emergency tools on the way. If you have been to this circuit trek its very risky.  There is need for lots of improvements in terms of safety in the cricuit. What do the so called authorities of conservation area plan for this?  The trekkers are paying their lives.",

Our economy doest get good if INR becomes strong/weak. At the end NRB has to buy and sell INR using USD to maintain the pegged ratio. So actually, if INR becomes too strong, it will cost us more (USD) to keep the peg. It nis not some contract between Nepal and india that says the ratio is constant.|||For good.. So, i always have hesitation hating India... cannot|||I am writing one on the root cause analysis of economic stagnation - focussing on the economic history and critical junctures. So some crossover there but not a huge. I think flexibility in macro-economic policy particularly, the ability to depreciate the NRs, probably is not the major lever that we can use to grow our economy.   Open border, growing Indian GDP and our heavy reliance on Indian corridors for incoming and outgoing mostly incoming goods and energy makes it a sensible decision. I wonder what % of our GDP is foreign remittances other than IRS. There is some argument there given25% of our GDP is remittances, we may have enough foreign reserve to float our currency.

            "body": "TLDR: A Nepali student at Ole Miss asked JD Vance why legal immigration is being cut after leaders promoted the American dream to those who followed the rules. The exchange was calm factual and brave.  Video:   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WScSX1vyWI8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WScSX1vyWI8)  At the University of Mississippi a Nepali calmly and clearly questioned JD Vance during a Turning Point event. She asked why leaders who once promoted the American dream to legal immigrants now argue to shrink legal pathways and say we do not belong. Her poise facts and courage were inspiring.  For many of us this moment feels personal. Legal immigrants study work pay taxes and strengthen communities. When people in power target legal pathways it is fair and necessary to speak up with respect and clarity.  Gen Z in Nepal recently showed remarkable civic courage during protests against corruption. That same spirit peaceful principled and focused on justice belongs in every place. From Kathmandu to a college campus in Mississippi we Nepalis should raise our voices against injustice misinformation and the scapegoating of immigrants.  This moment matters because it centers fairness and the promises made to those who followed the rules. It highlights how rhetoric at political events touches real lives of people waiting in long lines for visas and green cards. It also connects to a wider wave of youth led civic action that insists on dignity and accountability.  Note:   She is Nepali, but most Indian media are portraying her as Indian. Did not expect anything less. 😅",

But even then i didn't feel any sadness when she died. Infact i was reciting movie stories to my friends on the way back home after doing final rites.       My mind went on denial mode. I couldn't accept the reality and my mind diverted from truth and created a lie inside my head that my mom will be home waiting for me when i get back. This denial went for months and finally when i realized i can't lie to myself forever a sense of sadness came over me. That day i cried a lot. Since then 15 years have passed and i still think why i didn't react on the spot.

            "body": "In the long course of history, nature’s most capable predator evolved not only in body, but in mind. With consciousness came conscience — yet we still ask: is that conscience innate, or carved into us by our surroundings? What is good, and what is bad? Is it truly universal, or only what our minds accept as moral, rational, or ethical? Perhaps “good” and “bad” are just perspectives formed by the finest instrument nature ever created: the human brain. From west to east, humans have vast differences. Was it evolution alone that shaped us into social beings, or the cultures we built around our fears, hopes, and beliefs? Culture — different everywhere — has long been our guide, telling us what is right and what is wrong. Alongside faith in deities, these traditions became the unwritten rules that shaped our conscience. But what have we carried from the past? Often not the reasons behind our rituals, only the instructions on how to perform them. Not the “why,” just the “how.” We repeat steps inherited from centuries ago, even when the world around us has changed. What we sow today determines tomorrow, yet what we need to do today may not be what was needed hundreds of years ago. We follow traditions hoping they will bring the same results they once did, without asking whether the original purpose still exists — or whether our actions need to evolve just as life evolves. Evolution hasn’t stopped, but sometimes we stop it from making sense. Out of fear of the unknown, fear of being separated from the group, we continue as we always have, even when our conscience whispers that understanding the reason is more important than repeating the act. We are social animals, yes — but we are also thinkers. And perhaps the real evolution lies in questioning what we follow, not abandoning it, but understanding it, and guiding it toward the world we live in today.",

From your iPhone / iPad:  Open Find My → Devices → tap your Mac.  Options: Play Sound, Directions (if location available), Mark as Lost (Lock), Erase This Device.   From any browser:  Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID → Find iPhone → select your Mac from All Devices and use the same options.   What each option does:  Play Sound — helps if it’s nearby.  Mark as Lost / Lock — remotely locks the Mac with a passcode and shows your message/phone number on screen. It also disables Apple Pay.  Erase Mac — wipes data. Use only if you’re sure you can’t get it back; after erasing you can no longer track it.   2) If Find My was not enabled  Tracking is much harder. Still:  Check your Google account (if Chrome was signed in) for recent device activity.  Check services you used (Dropbox, Microsoft, email) for recent logins — they sometimes reveal IP/location.  Look at any linked accounts for device lists under your Apple ID (appleid.apple.com → Devices) — it shows serial numbers and last seen info.   3) Gather identifying info (do this now)  Serial number of the Mac (found on original box/receipt, Apple invoice, or appleid.apple.com under your devices).

Firstly, venue related problems were our fault. We should’ve planned better, will do better at that. The venue wasn’t suitable for a hackathon and we should’ve known that.  But these are the things I’d like to clarify:  - It was just a 24 hour hackathon, u can’t expect to have all the mattresses and beds to sleep on when its just 24 hours. However, we did have backup sleeping bags enough for reasonable margin of participants and warm rooms with heaters which would’ve provided if asked for + infirmary if someone wasn’t feeling well.   - Regarding judging, I’m pretty sure the mentors had mentioned in briefing that top N teams samma would be judged according to the regular progress checks done by the mentor and final submission.  You’re complaining about the judge who came in there for 1m to get an idea of what each team is doing. He was unaware of the selection criteria and had no role in selection of Top N teams. The initial screening by the judge was just to get an understanding of all the projects (which again, was mentioned multiple times to each team + the judge was accompanied by the mentor who was doing their final progress check as well)  The mentors selected those teams after reviewing our progress checks for each team and the final submission.  As mentioned multiple times, the judge was only there for judging from the top 10 teams, and as he was the sole sponsor for the event, it seemed reasonable for him to judge it along validated more by his industry experience.   The other feedback regarding food, venue and logistics are valid and the team will work on it on upcoming events. We should’ve planned better and done better on those aspects, on behalf of the management team I apologize for it.",

            "body": "I’ve been working as a developer for about a year now. I started at my current company as an intern, and honestly, I’ve learned so much here. I can handle almost all the frontend work on a project now, and even some backend. The company has been really good to me, and I’m truly grateful for the opportunities I’ve had.  When I joined, I got my first increment about four months after the internship, and another one around eleven months later. I’m happy about that, but lately, I’ve been feeling like my growth has slowed down. I’m not learning as much as I used to, and things are starting to feel a bit repetitive.  Recently, I received an offer from another company. The salary they’re offering is about the same as what I’m getting now, but they mentioned that they review performance regularly and adjust pay more frequently. I feel confident that I can perform well there.  To be honest, I’m also not totally satisfied with my current salary. I feel like in the new company, I’d have a better chance of getting raises faster based on performance.  The main reasons I’m considering the new opportunity are:  * Better growth and learning opportunities * Faster salary raises based on performance * I don’t want to stay stuck in one company for too long * I feel like, since I’m just starting out, I should explore more and get diverse experience instead of staying in one place for too long  At the same time, I can’t help but feel a bit guilty about leaving the company that helped me get this far. I’m also hesitant because I’m currently handling most of the work on one project that’s close to completion. However, I’m not sure when it will actually be done since new features keep getting added as requirements change.  It’s also a bit awkward to bring up the topic of leaving. Has anyone else gone through a similar situation? How did you decide?  Also, for those who’ve been in similar roles — what’s a reasonable salary range for a full-stack developer with about one year of experience?",

They had asked for 2 years of experience but I told them in job application about my bug bounties only as I had no other work experience. Yesterday they sent an email saying I was shortlisted for written test and told me to bring work experience proof and bachelor certificate. Is that a lie telling I have only bug bounty experience? I also recently graduated and just applied for certificate and it may take few weeks ig. It's a jr security analyst role. I am very far from ktm. So would the written test be worth?

I am also not bluffing stuffs, but i am very interested in learning things and just getting out of this web-dev space.   You don't have to worry about how will i learn and contribute.   Short background check (not trying to impress just what i know):  I have pretty much good foundations on things like OS, Networks and most of the projects i've done is in Node, in fact, i've just switched to Go (just to be little bit low haha).

When you cut off the expectations, you feel more happier and contained with yourself. You begin to prioritize, be selfish and learn more about people. I have the same situation. Accept that I left home 2 years back. First year was really difficult. This year also, I shifted in a new city. My aunty just bought me dry ass cookies and call it a day. I begin to hide my birthday and treat myself biryani,  ice cream and stuff. And why just birthday? I try to make my every moment special. I try to treat myself the most special person in this world. And people are getting attracted to me these days. But I don't care at all. I am just focused on my goals. People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within. And people don't understand that simple thing.🤣🤣🤣|||Yesterday it was mine birthday too but same situation.|||Happy belated birthdayyyyy|||mero nii birthday aaudai xaa wish gara la mallai on  November 4 nai birse bro . anyways dhillo bhaye Pani wish gare haii Happy birthday dai/dd|||Happy Belated Birthday <3|||Meroni thyo hijo.

I’ve heard many disrespectful remarks directed at fellow Nepali travelers, even for the smallest mistakes like something as simple as pressing a thumb incorrectly.|||Mad because they were colonised and we didn't|||Man this is infuriating.

Every time, he was singled out, even though he traveled two to three times a year. They would ask about his visa, his job on the cruise, and why he was carrying money, if any. It seemed like they had never seen a Nepalese carrying dollars for travel expenses. After working on cruises for nearly 35 years and traveling extensively across the USA and Europe, he only faced this treatment at Indian airports. As a result, he now completely avoids traveling to or through India.|||I never had any issues|||I also felt the same when I was travelling through IGIA.

But few weeks ago when they went there, they were told that government has said don't allow any Nepali to stay at any government hotel or lodge!

No, yet most nations frown or ban them from being raised for slaughter.  The same is true here. Cows are important part of their religious or cultural identity for most Nepalese people.

We are Hindu majority. Nepalese of all religion are already normalized to not consuming beef, this will start a conflict amongst our own majority. Us not consuming beef has kept Muslims and Christians in low numbers- they are major consumers of beef and send missionaries everywhere to increase their numbers. If there are two similarly sized groups with different people- that will create political conflict and add to our issues. We already see this play out in western countries- they have major political issues around Muslims and recently Indians (who they associate with Hinduism which they've already begun to hate in Canada, and if you a brown Nepali- you are Indian to them) Don't make moves that will drive your own group's numbers low. We have to keep the status quo in regards to issues like this.   Not eating cow has not created any issue that is worth our attention.

But the very reason eating beef is prohibited because it is against so called 'hindu' norms.  During the Rig Vedic period, beef was a diet. After the 'puran yug', so many new dieties were created like Narayan and Laxmi. And thus eating cows became a taboo.   But a law is a law. Laws need to change too as per the dynamics of society. If you don't change the law, people will always create chaos over such things.  Regarding this and other so called 'hindu' values, we khas people and Hindusized Kirati are far liberal. It is a very disturbing fact that even them people can't comprehend that 'Hindu'  values were imported from modern day North India.  'Hinduism' is not the de facto religion of Nepal, mainly the hilly and mountainous region. But in the Terai region that adjoins with Bihar and surrounding provinces, 'hindu' values are very deep rooted in their genes. It will be almost impossible to get them behave in different ways.  This issue is a serious one. Rai, Limbu and other Kirati tribes want to eat beef. It is not that they are not eating already. But they want it to be legal.  But the 'hindus' whose ancestry goes back to modern day North India and those khas people who think 'hinduism' was always their roots find it very hard to digest.   If you understand the root of the problem,  solution is easy.   If it was up to me, I would change the law leaving it to be individual or provincial freedom. Tolerance need to be practiced. No 'hindu' will be forced to eat beef or witness the killing or trade. But no non-hindu should be prohibited from eating it.  I'd advise my 'hindu' friend that they learn history beyond puran ages. And again, I request them to understand Nepal is not as very much 'hindu' as as India. Our ruling class adopted 'hinduism' so the common people were forced to follow 'hinduism'.  I also request them to understand that they do not always have the final or decisive say because we are not a Hindu kingdom anymore and there is no hindu king to enforce the law strictly.  Disowing those who raise question is very bad practice. They are as Nepali as anybody can be and in their mind they are fighting to preserve their long held values.|||Extremist area ma estai ho.

The breakup might not even be the real cause, but just a rumor people create to justify what they cannot understand.  In Nepal, mental health awareness is still so rare. People often fail to see that behind someone’s smile, there might be silent battles, unhealed wounds, and unseen pain.  Our parents believe that paying school fees, buying clothes, giving pocket money, and providing food and comfort is enough. Yet they forget the most precious thing: time, presence, and the warmth of genuine understanding.  So many children and young people hesitate to speak about their struggles, not because they don’t want to, but because they were never truly heard. And it’s not their parents’ fault entirely, because their own voices were once silenced, leaving them unsure how to listen with compassion.

I got really anxious at some point of time thinking that money could have bought me a month of groceries. Later it turned out that he used that money for drugs and alcohol.

In response, they bombed areas where countless innocent people lost their lives.  Israel has been doing this for a long time — bombing cities, hospitals, and homes — killing thousands of innocent people, including children, all in the name of “wiping out Hamas.” But do you really believe that all the people in those hospitals and cities were Hamas members? No. Most of them were innocent civilians, families, and children.  I’m not supporting Hamas. I’m supporting the innocent people of Gaza who are suffering endlessly. Yes, we lost a brave soul, Bipin Joshi, because of Hamas — and that’s tragic. But at the same time, we must not ignore the pain of the people in Gaza who are losing their loved ones every single day due to Israel’s continuous bombings.

Non hamas palestine people are also victim to hamas actions and have share uncessarily shared blame and hate due to hamas.   Anti palestine uses this narrative effectively.

            "heading": "Time-Travelling to the 90s with Notepad 😭",
            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I’ve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don’t know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

But yeah I won't suggest be like me and force it to get opened go as doc suggests not that I regret or had issues onwards but once to twice in month sometimes I suffer unbearable pain and only suspicion arises that I didn't let it get heal well so that's all I can share|||One of my friend got his hand fractured in class 10, he couldn't/didn't write for like 2 months if I remember correctly.

Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to. If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.   I hope the US government puts into place policies that make outsourcing jobs much more expensive/restrictive than hiring domestic workers.|||What you planning to do with the money saved|||what do you recommend to get the skill on ?|||What courses/sites helped you the most in developing your skills?|||Daily work hour?|||is it that common to find a remote job that pays in dollars or is it very rare? just curious bcz planning to study cs|||Is it too little too late to start at final bachelors year.

From your iPhone / iPad:  Open Find My → Devices → tap your Mac.  Options: Play Sound, Directions (if location available), Mark as Lost (Lock), Erase This Device.   From any browser:  Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID → Find iPhone → select your Mac from All Devices and use the same options.   What each option does:  Play Sound — helps if it’s nearby.  Mark as Lost / Lock — remotely locks the Mac with a passcode and shows your message/phone number on screen. It also disables Apple Pay.  Erase Mac — wipes data. Use only if you’re sure you can’t get it back; after erasing you can no longer track it.   2) If Find My was not enabled  Tracking is much harder. Still:  Check your Google account (if Chrome was signed in) for recent device activity.  Check services you used (Dropbox, Microsoft, email) for recent logins — they sometimes reveal IP/location.  Look at any linked accounts for device lists under your Apple ID (appleid.apple.com → Devices) — it shows serial numbers and last seen info.   3) Gather identifying info (do this now)  Serial number of the Mac (found on original box/receipt, Apple invoice, or appleid.apple.com under your devices).  Model, color, distinguishing marks, last known location/time.|||..........|||....|||........|||you can message me with all the information you have about this person and the incident ,I am not saying I will succeed but I can try help you|||Why did you post this just now if it happened 2 weeks ago?|||so sorry but he looks like mero school ko classmate 😭|||Apple ko authorized reseller bata purchase gareko bhaye, ra original purchase bill bhaye apple support lai report garda kei garna sakxan hola|||Thanks guys for the help.

I used to work for a Nepali Marwari owner here in the US who had around 30 stores under one of the biggest wireless companies in the country. Dude was loaded the brand name itself brought in enough business to make him filthy rich.  But man, the micromanagement was on another level. He believed employees should always be under pressure. Two minutes late? You’d get sent home with 2–3 follow-up emails. He had cameras everywhere and watched every move if you touched your phone for even a second, you’d get an email warning.  We had to message the group chat every time we clocked in, went on break, and clocked out while doing same in an app. It was ridiculous. The managers around him were total yes-men with no real management skills or education, just doing whatever the boss said.  Most of us employees were Nepali, Indian, or other South Asians, and we just tolerated it. But eventually, they started pulling the same nonsense with the white employees constant monitoring, weird punishments, and micromanaging everything. Those folks didn’t stay quiet.  When they complained, he retaliated by transferring them to faraway locations (which, by the way, is illegal in the US I didn’t even know that back then). They ended up suing the company.  After months of legal battles, the owner lost big time. He had to settle for almost $1 million, and worst of all, he lost his business licenses. Now, he can’t make any major business decisions without approval from the state attorney.  Man had everything going for him a successful business, money, connections but greed and micromanagement destroyed it all|||Wow, the folks over at SCN really do seem to be speedrunning labor law violations.

Tech adaptations are wide and quick, but regulation and accountability are close to non-existent. There is also a steep decline in the quality and camaraderie of the developer community.   Ultimately, the possibility and goal of earning well compared to other professions is and has been the motivation for lots of young graduates getting into software/product development/design. With the field now getting more complex and overwhelming to start as a beginner, and the unstable tech-job market, it puts more pressure on newcomers to integrate.  For these kinds of companies (mostly newly started, providing services as consultants for foreign companies), there's a low probability of growing to the scale of other established tech companies in Nepal. But I'm not trying to undermine and paint a negative image here. Rather, it can be the best opportunity and environment for a motivated individual to learn and grow together with team members.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So, here are a couple of points I'd like to suggest to newcomers/students getting into this profession:  * **GROWTH**: Always keep your individual growth as the main motivator. Keep it as a core \"essence\" of being a developer. Comparing yourself with your own past self will help you a lot in the long run. Secondly, a good payslip is always great to have as a +motivator. * **Incremental & Iterative**: Anything you'll learn or want to improve upon will take time. You'll need to make mistakes/errors, analyse why and how they occurred, and do it again with the correction. * **EMPATHY**: It's what most people lack in every field, and I like to believe that people can change. An empathetic co-worker makes the working environment more pleasant just by being in the office. They will see their team members as a collaborator in their work rather than their 'juniors' or just 'people who work under their command'.  If the 'co-worker' or 'supervisor', who'll be involved with your onboarding/daily tasks, lacks any understanding of these aspects, then I believe they're not quite fit for a LEADERSHIP role, despite their years of experience and how much BETTER of a developer they are.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|||[deleted]|||\\#CompanyProfiling   noted!|||This is exactly what happens abroad lol.",

First of all, India has a 1bn population. Given the hostility between the US and china, most of the big tech have their satellite offices in India, and that gets so much of techs from India. Because, people see scope in tech, many Indians go for BTech, CS.  But - how much of tech innovation do you see from India vs China or the US?  There was a time once when you could hire 5 people in India with a budget for 1 in the US. Now that is slowly going away, so many of the tech companies are now expanding in Africa and Latin America.|||Lol I work with Indians in a US company, don't get me wrong there are a lot of quality indians software engineers but this premise about Indians being the only one who are crazy tech talented is a joke, if that was the case we'd see some innovative indian tech company comparable to the ones from China/US.|||'America Kya keheta tha' ?|||Bill Gates also said he would rather hire lazy people to his company because they would find an easier way to do difficult task.|||I once interned at one of the FAANG (now MAANG) companies, and from my experience, I can say without a doubt that Indians play a massive role in the top American tech firms. They’ve become an inseparable part of the U.S. IT industry a huge portion of the real engineering work is done by them. These companies rely heavily on Indian talent, and because of that, Indian Americans have grown to become quite influential, even in U.S. politics. It’s no surprise that they’re now the highest-earning ethnic group in the entire country.  I remember one senior engineer I worked with a German once told me, *“Indian Americans are the 21st-century Jews of America.”* That line stuck with me.  But it does make you wonder if Indians are so talented, why isn’t India as developed as the U.S.? The main issue is the lack of a strong support system and consistent government backing for innovation and startups. For a long time, India didn’t create the right environment to make full use of its skilled people.  Now, about whether India is catching up to China in tech not quite yet. Chinese engineers are incredibly skilled, and China still has a big edge in infrastructure, funding, and startup ecosystems. Right now, India sits at number three, behind the U.S. and China, in the global tech scene. But give it another 20–25 years, and India could very well take the second spot, right after China.  That said, India’s future looks bright. The liberalization policies and the country’s strong emphasis on education have built a solid foundation. Institutions like the IITs, AIIMS, and IIMs have produced some of the best minds in engineering, medicine, and business. These people are driving not just India’s growth but also global innovation. With an open economy, a thriving startup culture, and millions of ambitious young people, India is steadily moving toward becoming one of the leading technology and economic powers of the world behind China.|||Is there another Microsoft in China though?|||India chai haina China le chai banauxa arko MS    They are good at creating and that works too   India on other hand will send huge skilled resources tara banauna chai sakdaina hai   India ko IT market thulo xa    ani China ko le ta duniya nai chalya xa hai   reminded of some so called nepali techfluencers haru    Nepal lai IT hub banayera tech revolution lyaune    some dude from NASIT (shitty association of IT comanies of Nepal)|||Well Indians are great at tech that's a fact we can't deny that.

So, to answer no, they aren't.|||“People believe anything when it’s put between quotation marks.”   — *Abraham Linkon*|||India's vaunted software industry has outsourced the least technologically demanding and most labor-intensive parts of the European and American software industries. The reality is that India lacks internet giants, nor does it have widely used software applications. Even the major software applications developed domestically are from the US. While you could argue that Indians participated in the development of these applications, it's still not Indian software. This isn't entirely bad, however. The internet industry is dominated by only two major players: the US and China. Even Europe and Japan have seen their internet industries and talent drained by the US. For example, in the electric vehicle industry, Chinese electric vehicle companies are internet giants, while German electric vehicle companies are industrial giants. Germany's lack of internet talent forces it to partner with Chinese companies for technology, whereas 30 years ago, China partnered with German automakers due to a lack of technology. Before his death, Henry Kissinger expressed concern about Europe's extreme lack of long-term strategic planning. Many Europeans still fail to grasp this reality, their thinking still mired in outdated Cold War thinking, which sees a Soviet Union as the scapegoat for all their mistakes. India and many other countries haven't fared any better than Europe.|||Bro been working with Indians for last 2 years. 90% of them are \"Kaam chorr\".|||1.

As a engineer with good foundation and working experience the only difference is syntax and core language features like JS functional programming, Java OOPS, Golang goroutines, etc.   One with good fundamental and system design concept with atleast 2-3yrs expericence can adapt to any techstack within a week or two.

Firstly, venue related problems were our fault. We should’ve planned better, will do better at that. The venue wasn’t suitable for a hackathon and we should’ve known that.  But these are the things I’d like to clarify:  - It was just a 24 hour hackathon, u can’t expect to have all the mattresses and beds to sleep on when its just 24 hours. However, we did have backup sleeping bags enough for reasonable margin of participants and warm rooms with heaters which would’ve provided if asked for + infirmary if someone wasn’t feeling well.   - Regarding judging, I’m pretty sure the mentors had mentioned in briefing that top N teams samma would be judged according to the regular progress checks done by the mentor and final submission.  You’re complaining about the judge who came in there for 1m to get an idea of what each team is doing. He was unaware of the selection criteria and had no role in selection of Top N teams. The initial screening by the judge was just to get an understanding of all the projects (which again, was mentioned multiple times to each team + the judge was accompanied by the mentor who was doing their final progress check as well)  The mentors selected those teams after reviewing our progress checks for each team and the final submission.  As mentioned multiple times, the judge was only there for judging from the top 10 teams, and as he was the sole sponsor for the event, it seemed reasonable for him to judge it along validated more by his industry experience.   The other feedback regarding food, venue and logistics are valid and the team will work on it on upcoming events. We should’ve planned better and done better on those aspects, on behalf of the management team I apologize for it.",

So you can imagine the shallow interaction between the sexes. As a result many guys dont have a clue on how to talk to women, dunno if its true for the other side. Men and women grew up on different spheres and many have no idea what the other wants.  Also patriarchy also has some play in it.

Baau aama le milaidi halchan bhanera matra ho natra adhi Kta haru single nai marthe🤣|||For this are we to bame the social conditioning, the patriarchy, the education system, the parenting or just blame the male gender. It's not just a male flaw the problem runs deeper it's deep rooted in our culture and society. Maybe we're a flawed society. So let's create a better society where men aren't like this? But this doesn't mean we should use society as an excuse to avoid personal accountability. Every man is still responsible for unlearning harmful behavior and trying to be a better person. But we also can’t ignore why so many men think and act this way in the first place.|||Don't worry homies, it ain't just you.

Weak financial backgrounds being from lower/middle, and more lovestruck fools getting into marriage.|||Yea Arrange marriage is shit. You will get trap for unnecessary drama both for men as well as women and never ending fight. Better is to not marry than marry someone whom you don't like.|||There are more men than women. Also, if men don't get married, women automatically don't get married too.|||This is why I believe in dowry concept it might sound rude but this is what it is. Since, most of the people have their past life and multiple relationships even before marriage these days. And that relation sometimes seems so so deeply rooted that it becomes difficult to forget. Some are involved in extramarital affairs as well. Then there's bitterness in the present married life and relations with family of husband. Now assume if her husband was single till the marriage for a perfect wife but what he got? Nothing but mental tension afterwards.   The psychological impact a normal people can't even bear. And sometimes girls even planned to marry a rich guy just for money and then divorce and get alimony which she'll spend with her lover. Sometimes, she even plans to kill her husband to get out of that thing. This is freaking crazy how people are thinking this way. I'm not justifying that she's the only culprit here but also her ex cum present hidden lover is equally involved.   Now in this situation it's better to live unmarried or take a grand amount as collateral if you are doing an arranged marriage. So that it will be easier for alimony.   You might call me bias but the thing is different. If we alternate the situation like a groom will have to leave his home and settle with bride forever, and if alimony should be paid by the bride after getting divorced, yeah a groom should have to give dowry as the collateral.   Fun fact: Love marriages crash faster than arranged ones. It’s like 1 v 1 versus many v many, so too many players in the latter provide team support 😅 during clashes. Honestly, better to stay single… or marry someone who doesn’t try to wrestle your ego.      Nepal and India(depending upon urbanization)   Arranged marriage divorce rate: <5%  Love marriage divorce rate: 35-50%|||You can't blame just men on this.

Most men would rather call it \"hating on men\" or talk badly about women instead of rising to the occassion and actually trying to do and be better. It's not just a Nepal thing, though. The same thing is happening everywhere. Marriage isn't a means for money or safety anymore as it used to be. Women now are independent and can handle their own finances It's not even about social standing anymore, the patriarchal lines of hierarchy are slowly but surely getting blurred.   Nowadays, marriage is about partnership, trust, companionship, love and respect. Most men haven't understood that and would rather blame women as being \"gold diggers\" than realize that it's not the money (or the lack thereof) that influences the attitudes of women towards them.  Remember that we have an ever increasing **male loneliness epidemic** and it's not for no reason.|||The reason behind me not knowing how to approach woman is because of their parents who were mostly arrangely married and never allowed/encouraged their sons to do so|||Mate who gives a shit how people marry? let em marry arranged or by falling in love, as long as both parties consent who cares how good or bad they are at getting in a relationship|||Haha kta le matra bihe garne hora both party share equal part in this|||Girl has a lot of priorities.

When you cut off the expectations, you feel more happier and contained with yourself. You begin to prioritize, be selfish and learn more about people. I have the same situation. Accept that I left home 2 years back. First year was really difficult. This year also, I shifted in a new city. My aunty just bought me dry ass cookies and call it a day. I begin to hide my birthday and treat myself biryani,  ice cream and stuff. And why just birthday? I try to make my every moment special. I try to treat myself the most special person in this world. And people are getting attracted to me these days. But I don't care at all. I am just focused on my goals. People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within. And people don't understand that simple thing.🤣🤣🤣|||Yesterday it was mine birthday too but same situation.|||Happy belated birthdayyyyy|||mero nii birthday aaudai xaa wish gara la mallai on  November 4 nai birse bro . anyways dhillo bhaye Pani wish gare haii Happy birthday dai/dd|||Happy Belated Birthday <3|||Meroni thyo hijo.

I agree that we have seen many rich and high power people get away with any crime. But let me remind you some cases : Maina Sunuwar, Rabi Lammichanne and other where everyone praised the court and claimed justice stood.Even you might know many of the cases  What I find uncomfortably troubling is that  People have been shifting their narrative about the court in whatever comforts them. Literally what Rabi did : When big politicians got GUITY from the court he said \"adalat le vaneko namanne?\"  When it was his turn he said every court is corrupt trying to get away. We are facing a same scenario here. Firstly the case was approached from a minor consent. And as far i believe the age couldn't be proven to be under 18.

Harek din naya bayaan and naya kahaani. Kt party ko main intention nai was to get as much of compensation as possible rather than punishing Sandeep.   And brought shame to our cricketing fraternity rey? Yo statement batai it’s easy to assume ki yo post garne eauta kti ho, ki jindagi ma lukera basne kta ho or Bharkhar ko fucche ho.  Even Cristiano Ronaldo was accused of rape numerous times. Eauta case ta it’s ekdummai severe. That girl immediately told her friends and filed lawsuit walla. Sandeep ko ta proper honeytrap thyo, Ronaldo had an actual case against him. But bail payo, where he still continued with his career. Unlike Sandeep, Ronaldo continued with his career. Pachi final verdict afnai favor ma payo.   So did he bring shame to Portugal? To Real Madrid? (at the time of the case) Ani Sandeep le chai kasari?   You put yourself in his shoes. You go out on a date with someone. Everything seems perfect, you guys kiss hug and spend an amazing time together. Belka you guys stay out ani make out. Bholi you drop her home. Then you go out for your work, ani bahira huda nai after a few weeks you find out that girl has filed a complaint for rape against you. What would you do?   I’m more than happy that our recent constitution and policies are in full support of women.

Good thing was that there were other staff member who knew the rule and helped us out. Thr lady couldnhave just asked her senior and would have know the reason but instead decided that she isn’t there to serve but to rule.

I have great respect for Nepal and its culture. If it were upto me, I'd support strengthening ties between India and Nepal.|||I am really sorry to hear that but the way they treat first-time visitors from Nepal in India is even more disgusting than how they treat frequent visitors. Even those who visit India often are treated as if we’re some kind of threat to the country. Sometimes, I feel it’s because of our weak passport and the way they perceive our country. I’ve heard many disrespectful remarks directed at fellow Nepali travelers, even for the smallest mistakes like something as simple as pressing a thumb incorrectly.|||Mad because they were colonised and we didn't|||Man this is infuriating.

Every time, he was singled out, even though he traveled two to three times a year. They would ask about his visa, his job on the cruise, and why he was carrying money, if any. It seemed like they had never seen a Nepalese carrying dollars for travel expenses. After working on cruises for nearly 35 years and traveling extensively across the USA and Europe, he only faced this treatment at Indian airports. As a result, he now completely avoids traveling to or through India.|||I never had any issues|||I also felt the same when I was travelling through IGIA.

I live in Aus and these days the hate sentiments against Indian is too much. Sometimes even I feel bad for them. |||I heard this from my relative; they went to India. It wasn't first time. They knew a hotel used to stay there because it was known. But few weeks ago when they went there, they were told that government has said don't allow any Nepali to stay at any government hotel or lodge! Maybe the reason is recent protest and many criminals were out of jail. But The hotel manager knew that they weren't bad people, but didn't allow them.

We are Hindu majority. Nepalese of all religion are already normalized to not consuming beef, this will start a conflict amongst our own majority. Us not consuming beef has kept Muslims and Christians in low numbers- they are major consumers of beef and send missionaries everywhere to increase their numbers. If there are two similarly sized groups with different people- that will create political conflict and add to our issues. We already see this play out in western countries- they have major political issues around Muslims and recently Indians (who they associate with Hinduism which they've already begun to hate in Canada, and if you a brown Nepali- you are Indian to them) Don't make moves that will drive your own group's numbers low. We have to keep the status quo in regards to issues like this.   Not eating cow has not created any issue that is worth our attention. Focus on tackling actual issues like further eradicating this baun, chettri nonsense which is the bane of Hinduism- we can and are doing it while keeping our culture, traditions and identity.|||just say chamal ko bora ta paako this , visa ni paaulas ni and move on|||So much for a secular nation|||lets eat beef guys",

What counts is how disciplined and valuable you are in that new system.  I’d add, learn to manage your emotions too. It’s not just physical or financial survival — it’s mental. You’ll feel lonely, rejected, homesick, but those who turn that into fuel grow faster than anyone else. Also, you don’t have to be the smartest person, but be reliable.

            "heading": "Time-Travelling to the 90s with Notepad 😭",
            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I’ve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don’t know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

I want a bachelor’s where I can study and work at the same time since my family do not earn well and I definitely have to look after my family after 12.

The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it.

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts.

They called the “earn and learn” program an internship, likely just to bypass foreign employment laws. In reality, it was pure exploitation. From what I’ve read, students were made to work five days a week in questionable conditions and study only one. I wouldn’t be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.

They outsource their jobs to poorer countries where people are happy to accept a meager $2800/month, whereas a domestic worker in the US would have to be paid at least double that. So the company saves 50% of their costs pretty much immediately. Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to. If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.   I hope the US government puts into place policies that make outsourcing jobs much more expensive/restrictive than hiring domestic workers.|||What you planning to do with the money saved|||what do you recommend to get the skill on ?|||What courses/sites helped you the most in developing your skills?|||Daily work hour?|||is it that common to find a remote job that pays in dollars or is it very rare? just curious bcz planning to study cs|||Is it too little too late to start at final bachelors year.

While most countries have been struggling with deforestation, Nepal somehow managed to reverse the trend.  A few key reasons:  * **Community Forestry Program** — locals manage and protect their own forests instead of the central government. * **Rural-Urban Migration** — many farmlands were abandoned as people moved to cities or abroad for work, letting nature reclaim them. * **Alternative Energy** — more use of biogas and LPG means less dependence on firewood. * **Reforestation & Conservation** — national parks, reserves, and local planting drives helped too.  Now nearly **45% of Nepal’s total land** is covered by forests — up from around **25% in the early 1990s**.  Pretty wild, right?   What do you think — is community-led management the real key here, or did urban migration play a bigger role?

If recovery isn’t possible, does anyone know **any trusted shops, vendors, or businesses that buy or accept large NTC balances** (maybe at a discounted rate)?

In very rare, exceptional cases, NTC may have options for extremely large accidental top-ups, though the taxes already paid to the government make a full reversal highly complex. * **Attempt a formal complaint through the digital wallet:** If they used a digital wallet like eSewa or Khalti, they should file a complaint with that wallet provider. These wallets can act as intermediaries and request a reversal from [Nepal Telecom](https://www.ntc.net.np/), though ultimately, NTC controls the outcome.   Long-term strategies for using the balance  Since a refund is almost certainly not an option, the best approach is to recover the value over time by converting the credit back into cash.  * **Offer balance transfers to friends and family:** The Reddit user can offer to transfer balance to friends and family in exchange for cash. This is a common and reliable method of liquidating NTC balance.    * **Balance transfer limits:** NTC allows up to 20 transfers per day, with a maximum of Rs. 500 per transfer.    * **Execution:** They can use the NTC mobile app or the USSD code `*422*SecurityCode*RecipientNumber*Amount#` to initiate transfers. * **Offer mobile top-ups in the local community:** For people who prefer cash transactions, the user can act as an unofficial recharge agent. They can offer to top up people's phones in exchange for cash, perhaps at a small discount to incentivize the transaction. * **Bundle and sell discounted packages:** The user can purchase various voice, data, and SMS packs offered by NTC and resell them to others at a discounted rate. For example, they could buy a large 28-day data pack with a market value of Rs. 999 and sell it to someone for a reduced cash price. * **Use the balance for services and bills:** The user can offer to pay for other people's utility bills that can be settled via an NTC number and accept cash in return. This could include things like landline or internet service bills if NTC provides them.   Warning for the Reddit user  * **Scams:** Advise the user to be very cautious about offers from strangers promising to buy the balance or provide a refund. They should only perform transactions with people they know and trust to avoid losing the balance without getting paid. * **Security code:** The NTC security code for balance transfers is like a bank PIN and should never be shared with anyone. The user must perform all transfers themselves. |||Chora chori thula vayinjel samma balance halna parena aba..😝|||At this point, I’ve accepted there’s no way to get a refund.

This is extremely ironic bc Balen is a devout hindu who is working to preserve Ktm's heritage and culture but Harkey is literally a race-baiting missionary. Harkey is huge red flag the one who will do or say anything to get to power will also say or do anything to \\*\\*remain\\*\\* in power. Not to mention he doesn't really have any long term plans or vision for the country and his tantrums and crash outs would hurt Nepal in the intl stage. He is kinda like a Stupider Version of Trump with a stupider more openly racist fanbase, and like in the US, foreign-backed fascists are also hoping to use him to get what they want.

I’m currently abroad, but my mom and my rabbit were at home. The noise was so intense that even over the phone, I could hear it in the background. My rabbit was terrified and yesterday morning, on Laxmi Pujamy mom called crying, he was gone. The continuous sound of fireworks had stressed him so much that his little heart couldn’t take it anymore. He died scared and alone, and I wasn’t even there to hold him. I was supposed to be home in just 1.5 months. I kept imagining how happy he’d be when he’d see me again.   He wasn’t just a pet. He was family, my little brother. I don’t have siblings, and he filled that space in my life with his sweet energy and unconditional love. I can’t describe the guilt and pain I feel. I keep imagining him hiding in fear, shaking every time another pataka went off, and I hate that I couldn’t be there for me. My lil bro didn’t deserve this. None of them do.",

I'm very sorry for your loss. What was meant to be a heartwarming celebration, was infiltrated by these customs no one knows who started.|||I am so sorry for your loss. Try to dont play such scenarios in your head, I know its hard..  Yes, many animals experience severe distress due to fireworks and firecrackers, cows, dogs, cats etc. The smaller the animal, stronger the distress.   You can check statistics over the world, its a real issue. We humans dont respect the native habitants (animals) and this is just one of examples. Like, is the loud sound more important than a divine life (as all life is divine)?  Can that simbolism be expressed in a better way, by singing, instruments etc...  Luckily, as the world is slowly becoming aware of this, so the regulations starts to exist. In many countries there are now regulations that prohibit fireworks and firecrackers, exactly because of this reason (not to mention distress to some humans that exist too..).|||I am so so sorry.

I'm not trying to be rude or to devalue your loss. It must be sad for you, yes, but I feel worse for that rabbit who lost its life because you made it live with humans and could not accommodate its needs. Firecrackers didn't take his life.  Saying \"firecrackers took my rabbit's life\" is like putting a child on the middle of the road and complaining that \"car took my child's life\". Should the driver have been more careful? Yes. But shouldn't the parent be accountable too?|||Is a rabbit more important than a chicken? Is the festival cultural practice of fireworks less important than rabbits life?

From your iPhone / iPad:  Open Find My → Devices → tap your Mac.  Options: Play Sound, Directions (if location available), Mark as Lost (Lock), Erase This Device.   From any browser:  Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID → Find iPhone → select your Mac from All Devices and use the same options.   What each option does:  Play Sound — helps if it’s nearby.  Mark as Lost / Lock — remotely locks the Mac with a passcode and shows your message/phone number on screen. It also disables Apple Pay.  Erase Mac — wipes data. Use only if you’re sure you can’t get it back; after erasing you can no longer track it.   2) If Find My was not enabled  Tracking is much harder. Still:  Check your Google account (if Chrome was signed in) for recent device activity.  Check services you used (Dropbox, Microsoft, email) for recent logins — they sometimes reveal IP/location.  Look at any linked accounts for device lists under your Apple ID (appleid.apple.com → Devices) — it shows serial numbers and last seen info.   3) Gather identifying info (do this now)  Serial number of the Mac (found on original box/receipt, Apple invoice, or appleid.apple.com under your devices).

Two minutes late? You’d get sent home with 2–3 follow-up emails. He had cameras everywhere and watched every move if you touched your phone for even a second, you’d get an email warning.  We had to message the group chat every time we clocked in, went on break, and clocked out while doing same in an app. It was ridiculous. The managers around him were total yes-men with no real management skills or education, just doing whatever the boss said.

But eventually, they started pulling the same nonsense with the white employees constant monitoring, weird punishments, and micromanaging everything. Those folks didn’t stay quiet.  When they complained, he retaliated by transferring them to faraway locations (which, by the way, is illegal in the US I didn’t even know that back then). They ended up suing the company.

Tech adaptations are wide and quick, but regulation and accountability are close to non-existent. There is also a steep decline in the quality and camaraderie of the developer community.   Ultimately, the possibility and goal of earning well compared to other professions is and has been the motivation for lots of young graduates getting into software/product development/design. With the field now getting more complex and overwhelming to start as a beginner, and the unstable tech-job market, it puts more pressure on newcomers to integrate.  For these kinds of companies (mostly newly started, providing services as consultants for foreign companies), there's a low probability of growing to the scale of other established tech companies in Nepal. But I'm not trying to undermine and paint a negative image here. Rather, it can be the best opportunity and environment for a motivated individual to learn and grow together with team members.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So, here are a couple of points I'd like to suggest to newcomers/students getting into this profession:  * **GROWTH**: Always keep your individual growth as the main motivator. Keep it as a core \"essence\" of being a developer. Comparing yourself with your own past self will help you a lot in the long run. Secondly, a good payslip is always great to have as a +motivator. * **Incremental & Iterative**: Anything you'll learn or want to improve upon will take time. You'll need to make mistakes/errors, analyse why and how they occurred, and do it again with the correction. * **EMPATHY**: It's what most people lack in every field, and I like to believe that people can change. An empathetic co-worker makes the working environment more pleasant just by being in the office. They will see their team members as a collaborator in their work rather than their 'juniors' or just 'people who work under their command'.  If the 'co-worker' or 'supervisor', who'll be involved with your onboarding/daily tasks, lacks any understanding of these aspects, then I believe they're not quite fit for a LEADERSHIP role, despite their years of experience and how much BETTER of a developer they are.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|||[deleted]|||\\#CompanyProfiling   noted!|||This is exactly what happens abroad lol.",

First of all, India has a 1bn population. Given the hostility between the US and china, most of the big tech have their satellite offices in India, and that gets so much of techs from India. Because, people see scope in tech, many Indians go for BTech, CS.  But - how much of tech innovation do you see from India vs China or the US?  There was a time once when you could hire 5 people in India with a budget for 1 in the US.

They’ve become an inseparable part of the U.S. IT industry a huge portion of the real engineering work is done by them. These companies rely heavily on Indian talent, and because of that, Indian Americans have grown to become quite influential, even in U.S. politics. It’s no surprise that they’re now the highest-earning ethnic group in the entire country.  I remember one senior engineer I worked with a German once told me, *“Indian Americans are the 21st-century Jews of America.”* That line stuck with me.  But it does make you wonder if Indians are so talented, why isn’t India as developed as the U.S.? The main issue is the lack of a strong support system and consistent government backing for innovation and startups. For a long time, India didn’t create the right environment to make full use of its skilled people.  Now, about whether India is catching up to China in tech not quite yet. Chinese engineers are incredibly skilled, and China still has a big edge in infrastructure, funding, and startup ecosystems. Right now, India sits at number three, behind the U.S. and China, in the global tech scene. But give it another 20–25 years, and India could very well take the second spot, right after China.  That said, India’s future looks bright. The liberalization policies and the country’s strong emphasis on education have built a solid foundation. Institutions like the IITs, AIIMS, and IIMs have produced some of the best minds in engineering, medicine, and business. These people are driving not just India’s growth but also global innovation. With an open economy, a thriving startup culture, and millions of ambitious young people, India is steadily moving toward becoming one of the leading technology and economic powers of the world behind China.|||Is there another Microsoft in China though?|||India chai haina China le chai banauxa arko MS    They are good at creating and that works too   India on other hand will send huge skilled resources tara banauna chai sakdaina hai   India ko IT market thulo xa    ani China ko le ta duniya nai chalya xa hai   reminded of some so called nepali techfluencers haru    Nepal lai IT hub banayera tech revolution lyaune    some dude from NASIT (shitty association of IT comanies of Nepal)|||Well Indians are great at tech that's a fact we can't deny that.

The reality is that India lacks internet giants, nor does it have widely used software applications. Even the major software applications developed domestically are from the US. While you could argue that Indians participated in the development of these applications, it's still not Indian software. This isn't entirely bad, however. The internet industry is dominated by only two major players: the US and China. Even Europe and Japan have seen their internet industries and talent drained by the US. For example, in the electric vehicle industry, Chinese electric vehicle companies are internet giants, while German electric vehicle companies are industrial giants. Germany's lack of internet talent forces it to partner with Chinese companies for technology, whereas 30 years ago, China partnered with German automakers due to a lack of technology. Before his death, Henry Kissinger expressed concern about Europe's extreme lack of long-term strategic planning. Many Europeans still fail to grasp this reality, their thinking still mired in outdated Cold War thinking, which sees a Soviet Union as the scapegoat for all their mistakes. India and many other countries haven't fared any better than Europe.|||Bro been working with Indians for last 2 years. 90% of them are \"Kaam chorr\".|||1.

But we studied together at NITR, India.  The process in India itself is top, so it's real hard to get recruited from Nepalese colleges.|||Applying to FAANG from India is not worth it bro. First thing the competition is huge and second thing the pay for FAANG position in India is like what at max 1.5 to 2 Crore if you get lucky. And I seriously believe that the stress to compensation is not worth it.  If it was in the case of USA especially in the bay area, then I would say the grind was worth it because they pay ridiculously high, like even after all the tax cuts and expenses you can save around 100-150k easily in a year given your compensation is 350-400k USD per year and the position is at the bay area.  But competition is tough there too, you need PhDs and all.  But I think it's still better than India. In India nowadays almost like minimum 10 lakhs students have already mugged up at least 300-400 leetcode questions so, chances are slim there.  My advice is target for such positions where the competition is low, grind there for 3-4 years and apply as independent contractors for remote position, you can easily make above 100k if you are sharp.  Then move to Romania applying a digital nomad visa and pay only about flat 10-11% tax for your 100k plus income. Cost of living is also affordable in Romania, soon to be included into schengen and of course after 5 years apply for PR, get the passport and travel freely for vacation. (It's passport is in top ten strongest list)  And this is the most achievable goal and path for a Nepali IT specialist. Even if you get 60k USD remote job in Nepal, it's not worth it because the progressive tax system will make the effective tax to around 30-33% and all your tax for what? Into the belly of corrupt politicians.  Actually it's a bad idea to live in Nepal, the tax is too much. You pay 25% tax and 13% vat for almost everything. Forget about buying vehicles, the added cost is like price of Vehicle(100%) and 80% flat tax + 13% vat + 10-25% profit margin + extraa whatever. You pay more than double for any vehicles.

Tried refreshing, logging in again, clearing cookies — nothing worked. I messaged him, and he replied once saying he’s “sorting it out for all clients ,” but after that — no reply, I checked post too deleted, and he disappeared.

Build cool projects and show them off on X or LinkedIn. Follow a bunch of US founders. Research YC and follow YC founders. The projects will need to show extraordinary level of depth in whatever field you want to pursue. A simple webapp, or a mobile app wont suffice.

I absolutely hate the Google calendar app on my phone. If you need some contributions for the app I can donate via PayPal or direct bank transfer if you are in Nepal.

Wth|||works offline once loaded. that was a great feature.|||atleast has no ads and does not refresh when changing month  unlike hamropatro  W|||Amazing ! Just replaced it with hamro patro. The widget of nepali date is what sold me. The UI looks clean. I like that i can see the previous month and calendar years back but it would be cool if instead of the drop-down it was something else as the drop-down blocks the view of the current calendar and i feel it looks like the design aesthetic with the rest of the app design.   I hope you keep improving and adding new features !|||Tried it. Looks good.   One thing that i felt redundant was the popup layout when seeking other dates. Like when i want to see what is on 3rd Kartik, it opens up a popup therefore blocking the calendar entirely. I have to then close the popup  to seek through the next date. I feel that you could just update the info below the calendar for the selected date instead of the popup.   Makes it easier to seek through the dates.|||whats smarter in this calendar?|||Best!

It’s really smooth on my iOS. It feels like above 90, probably 120. Also, when adding reminders, can you make it show nepali date as well? I often have to hop between two apps to confirm the Nepali date while adding reminders.  And, can you make the widget also switch between light/dark mode based on my device theme?|||Well the best part of the app is it's minimilastic. Thanks.. 😊|||Loved the widgets more. Less bloat.

Nepali local companies are too exploiting. Finding a remote job is not easy either. Everyday you learn new things apply to jobs and think good will happen. The pay in nepali company just sucks they pressurize employees and then in return you get 25-30k per month.

Many talented individuals are even losing jobs and opportunities simply because there’s no reliable way to get paid for their work.  This issue directly impacts Nepal’s growing digital workforce and limits the country’s potential in the global freelancing market. I kindly request you to post about this problem and urge the Finance Minister and related authorities to take action.  Your platform has a powerful voice, and raising this concern could help push for real change.  Thank you for your time and for always being the voice of the people.  Warm regards, [Your Name",

Really want to experience it.|||Dherai kura mis managed thiyo I agree, but just clarifying a few things which were already mentioned during briefing and later when u brought it up in whatsapp group.  Firstly, venue related problems were our fault. We should’ve planned better, will do better at that. The venue wasn’t suitable for a hackathon and we should’ve known that.  But these are the things I’d like to clarify:  - It was just a 24 hour hackathon, u can’t expect to have all the mattresses and beds to sleep on when its just 24 hours. However, we did have backup sleeping bags enough for reasonable margin of participants and warm rooms with heaters which would’ve provided if asked for + infirmary if someone wasn’t feeling well.   - Regarding judging, I’m pretty sure the mentors had mentioned in briefing that top N teams samma would be judged according to the regular progress checks done by the mentor and final submission.  You’re complaining about the judge who came in there for 1m to get an idea of what each team is doing. He was unaware of the selection criteria and had no role in selection of Top N teams. The initial screening by the judge was just to get an understanding of all the projects (which again, was mentioned multiple times to each team + the judge was accompanied by the mentor who was doing their final progress check as well)  The mentors selected those teams after reviewing our progress checks for each team and the final submission.  As mentioned multiple times, the judge was only there for judging from the top 10 teams, and as he was the sole sponsor for the event, it seemed reasonable for him to judge it along validated more by his industry experience.   The other feedback regarding food, venue and logistics are valid and the team will work on it on upcoming events. We should’ve planned better and done better on those aspects, on behalf of the management team I apologize for it.",

            "body": "Yesterday, I received what seemed like a great opportunity. A nonprofit reached out saying I'd be a perfect fit for their full stack role. My previous colleagues vouched for me, and everything felt right.  Then came the reality check.  They couldn't figure out how to send payments to Nepal. Something about international payment systems, tax handling, and complications I honestly didn't fully understand. The conversation ended there.  I'm 18 and actively looking for frontend roles. I've got the skills and the drive, but I'm clearly missing something important about how remote work actually works from Nepal.  Here's what I'm trying to figure out:  How do you handle international payments when companies can't use standard methods? What platforms or workarounds do Nepali developers use? Are there specific things I should know about taxes and compliance? Should I only target certain types of companies that can handle these complications?  If you're from Nepal and working remotely for international companies, I'd really appreciate hearing how you navigated this. What do you wish someone had told you when you were starting out?  I don't want to miss the next opportunity because of something I could have prepared for.  Open to connecting with anyone who's been through this or has advice to share.",

Reasonable: You are getting paid directly to your bank with a nominal transfer fee. 2. Legal: Bank will deduct 5% tax as per government rule 3. Scalable: This action is repeatable month-after-month regardless of amount.  If you're doing any third party systems, like Wise, you lose on three fronts:   A. Wise cuts a transfer commission   B. The amount needs to be converted to NPR before sending and costs money   C. Depositing in Nepali bank has another processing fee in rupees  So this is not a good way to receive salary every month. See how much money you're losing even before paying a single rupee in tax amount.  Some companies do have issues setting up complex arrangements for just one person. I say this because I am the only Nepali person there. Everyone, including Indians are cool with receiving salaries in crypto, Wise wallet or other forms that do not work in Nepal.

If they commission the salary on bank account then they should have no problem of wiring it straight to your bank account. They'd send you invoice and use that Invoice to show the bank in Nepal as proof of your income and you can setup that recurring payment as your employment payment and bank'll deduce 5% on each transaction from that party, hence your tax payment for Nepal government.  Ask or search for your Bank's SWIFT code and provide necessary documents, that should suffice for international payment afaik.  Edit : unconventional payment should involve third party transaction. Paypal & payoneer work but payoneer is very unreliable. If everything works, no problem but to resolve ANY problem with payoneer is a nightmare. Skrill (I haven't used it) could be an alternative. You could use someone trusted who's abroad to use their paypal.

Since, most of the people have their past life and multiple relationships even before marriage these days. And that relation sometimes seems so so deeply rooted that it becomes difficult to forget. Some are involved in extramarital affairs as well. Then there's bitterness in the present married life and relations with family of husband. Now assume if her husband was single till the marriage for a perfect wife but what he got? Nothing but mental tension afterwards.   The psychological impact a normal people can't even bear. And sometimes girls even planned to marry a rich guy just for money and then divorce and get alimony which she'll spend with her lover. Sometimes, she even plans to kill her husband to get out of that thing. This is freaking crazy how people are thinking this way. I'm not justifying that she's the only culprit here but also her ex cum present hidden lover is equally involved.   Now in this situation it's better to live unmarried or take a grand amount as collateral if you are doing an arranged marriage. So that it will be easier for alimony.   You might call me bias but the thing is different. If we alternate the situation like a groom will have to leave his home and settle with bride forever, and if alimony should be paid by the bride after getting divorced, yeah a groom should have to give dowry as the collateral.   Fun fact: Love marriages crash faster than arranged ones. It’s like 1 v 1 versus many v many, so too many players in the latter provide team support 😅 during clashes.

Believe me what you said applies to Nepali women as well and you know what most of them are not even working unlike men. So I do not see any difference this logic is making.

What kind of take is this?|||Well then both genders will have to go their own way finding their partners. It's not like only men need women or vice versa. Both genders need to have something to show for themselves to be considered by their potential partner.|||Remove the concept of marriage altogether and many girls will not find a partner in the old age because nobody wants to deal with drama anymore.|||The comments on this thread just go on to further prove the issue that the text describes. Most men would rather call it \"hating on men\" or talk badly about women instead of rising to the occassion and actually trying to do and be better. It's not just a Nepal thing, though. The same thing is happening everywhere. Marriage isn't a means for money or safety anymore as it used to be. Women now are independent and can handle their own finances It's not even about social standing anymore, the patriarchal lines of hierarchy are slowly but surely getting blurred.   Nowadays, marriage is about partnership, trust, companionship, love and respect. Most men haven't understood that and would rather blame women as being \"gold diggers\" than realize that it's not the money (or the lack thereof) that influences the attitudes of women towards them.  Remember that we have an ever increasing **male loneliness epidemic** and it's not for no reason.|||The reason behind me not knowing how to approach woman is because of their parents who were mostly arrangely married and never allowed/encouraged their sons to do so|||Mate who gives a shit how people marry? let em marry arranged or by falling in love, as long as both parties consent who cares how good or bad they are at getting in a relationship|||Haha kta le matra bihe garne hora both party share equal part in this|||Girl has a lot of priorities.

When you cut off the expectations, you feel more happier and contained with yourself. You begin to prioritize, be selfish and learn more about people. I have the same situation. Accept that I left home 2 years back. First year was really difficult. This year also, I shifted in a new city. My aunty just bought me dry ass cookies and call it a day. I begin to hide my birthday and treat myself biryani,  ice cream and stuff. And why just birthday? I try to make my every moment special. I try to treat myself the most special person in this world. And people are getting attracted to me these days. But I don't care at all. I am just focused on my goals. People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within. And people don't understand that simple thing.🤣🤣🤣|||Yesterday it was mine birthday too but same situation.|||Happy belated birthdayyyyy|||mero nii birthday aaudai xaa wish gara la mallai on  November 4 nai birse bro . anyways dhillo bhaye Pani wish gare haii Happy birthday dai/dd|||Happy Belated Birthday <3|||Meroni thyo hijo.

I agree that we have seen many rich and high power people get away with any crime. But let me remind you some cases : Maina Sunuwar, Rabi Lammichanne and other where everyone praised the court and claimed justice stood.Even you might know many of the cases  What I find uncomfortably troubling is that  People have been shifting their narrative about the court in whatever comforts them. Literally what Rabi did : When big politicians got GUITY from the court he said \"adalat le vaneko namanne?\"  When it was his turn he said every court is corrupt trying to get away. We are facing a same scenario here. Firstly the case was approached from a minor consent. And as far i believe the age couldn't be proven to be under 18.

Aba they’ll say I’m being sexual ki rude eta uta. Okay let’s go thru facts one by one.   Firstly the whole case looks fabricated as hell. The day that couple spent the night together, next day aayera afnai room mate sanga ekdum excited bhayera Kura gareko cha. A few weeks later gayera case haleko cha. Usko roommate ko statement sunnu paila.   First ma statutory rape bhanyo, which was a massive one. Tyo case ho Bhane Sandeep should rot in jail. Tara that wasn’t the case, ani age ta 18 above cha raicha Bhanera tha paye pachi case chai rape ko ma change bhayo. Tyo pani when you go through the whole thing, it is pretty easy to make it out that the girl was trying to mint money out of Sandeep. It was a honey trap Bhanera ta sabai lai tha cha.   I don’t know Sandeep personally and don’t care if he’s arrogant or k k. It doesn’t matter. Because that’s not why he’s defamed.   Aba you’ll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re. Harek din naya bayaan and naya kahaani. Kt party ko main intention nai was to get as much of compensation as possible rather than punishing Sandeep.   And brought shame to our cricketing fraternity rey? Yo statement batai it’s easy to assume ki yo post garne eauta kti ho, ki jindagi ma lukera basne kta ho or Bharkhar ko fucche ho.  Even Cristiano Ronaldo was accused of rape numerous times. Eauta case ta it’s ekdummai severe. That girl immediately told her friends and filed lawsuit walla. Sandeep ko ta proper honeytrap thyo, Ronaldo had an actual case against him. But bail payo, where he still continued with his career. Unlike Sandeep, Ronaldo continued with his career. Pachi final verdict afnai favor ma payo.   So did he bring shame to Portugal? To Real Madrid? (at the time of the case) Ani Sandeep le chai kasari?   You put yourself in his shoes. You go out on a date with someone. Everything seems perfect, you guys kiss hug and spend an amazing time together. Belka you guys stay out ani make out. Bholi you drop her home. Then you go out for your work, ani bahira huda nai after a few weeks you find out that girl has filed a complaint for rape against you. What would you do?   I’m more than happy that our recent constitution and policies are in full support of women. Patriarchal society where girls were always oppressed, we finally have laws that protect and safeguard women. Tara yei law lai misuse Garne haru ni Chan.

The situation remains uncertain. Several media outlets have only reported that his name is missing from the list of 20 hostages confirmed to be alive, yet some are hastily jumping to conclusions without verified information. Such speculation is irresponsible, especially when the facts are still unclear. These pages are so immaturely jumping to conclusions in a state where things are uncertain.|||Bipin looked fine in that released video dated November 2023. It means that either Bipin died during the strikes or Hamas' foul play. Our foreign policy is also to be blamed. How could they detain Nepalese who had no association with Israel?

Eleven of our sons, including Bipin Joshi, who arrived in Israel just 25 days before Hamas’s October 7, 2023, bloodbath, were brutally murdered. Four days ago, 48 hostages clung to life; now, only 20 survive. Hamas’s “justified” slaughter, draped in twisted dogma, mocks humanity. Two years of torment, dangling hope of Bipin’s survival, only to end in his cold-blooded killing by these bloody cowards. At home, Gen Z’s September “uprising” killed 51, including kids, burning Kathmandu, freeing 12,500 criminals to prop up corrupt elites’ spoiled brats. Our nation’s credibility is trashed, a global joke. Hamas and their ilk, like Jamkash, happily point fingers at Jews and Hindus for every woe, but when it’s time to face their own kind, they scatter like roaches, spineless. Yet we let their hate-preaching ideology fester in our hills, unchecked. No more. Deport their firebrand clerics, cut off their dirty foreign cash. We must back our own against Hamas, demand international recognition to flex Nepal’s strength, resilience, and power. This must never happen again.

We told her that we were Nepali citizen and didn’t needed visa. Then ahead rudely shouted to get the bording pass from the person who made that rule. Good thing was that there were other staff member who knew the rule and helped us out. Thr lady couldnhave just asked her senior and would have know the reason but instead decided that she isn’t there to serve but to rule. The problem ia that these people aren’t deceplined for their actions and continue to melign the name of their own country.|||As an Indian, I'm very sorry that Nepalis have to go through this in India. I have great respect for Nepal and its culture. If it were upto me, I'd support strengthening ties between India and Nepal.|||I am really sorry to hear that but the way they treat first-time visitors from Nepal in India is even more disgusting than how they treat frequent visitors. Even those who visit India often are treated as if we’re some kind of threat to the country. Sometimes, I feel it’s because of our weak passport and the way they perceive our country. I’ve heard many disrespectful remarks directed at fellow Nepali travelers, even for the smallest mistakes like something as simple as pressing a thumb incorrectly.|||Mad because they were colonised and we didn't|||Man this is infuriating.

Every time, he was singled out, even though he traveled two to three times a year. They would ask about his visa, his job on the cruise, and why he was carrying money, if any. It seemed like they had never seen a Nepalese carrying dollars for travel expenses. After working on cruises for nearly 35 years and traveling extensively across the USA and Europe, he only faced this treatment at Indian airports. As a result, he now completely avoids traveling to or through India.|||I never had any issues|||I also felt the same when I was travelling through IGIA.

They knew a hotel used to stay there because it was known. But few weeks ago when they went there, they were told that government has said don't allow any Nepali to stay at any government hotel or lodge!

No, yet most nations frown or ban them from being raised for slaughter.  The same is true here. Cows are important part of their religious or cultural identity for most Nepalese people. So, I don't think such legalization will work or be treated positively.  Do I personally think Cows, or even dogs or cats should be banned? No, frankly I don't care as long as it does not impact humans or the species themselves on a conservation scale.  But I don't think this can or should be implemented nation wide.

We are Hindu majority. Nepalese of all religion are already normalized to not consuming beef, this will start a conflict amongst our own majority. Us not consuming beef has kept Muslims and Christians in low numbers- they are major consumers of beef and send missionaries everywhere to increase their numbers. If there are two similarly sized groups with different people- that will create political conflict and add to our issues. We already see this play out in western countries- they have major political issues around Muslims and recently Indians (who they associate with Hinduism which they've already begun to hate in Canada, and if you a brown Nepali- you are Indian to them) Don't make moves that will drive your own group's numbers low. We have to keep the status quo in regards to issues like this.   Not eating cow has not created any issue that is worth our attention. Focus on tackling actual issues like further eradicating this baun, chettri nonsense which is the bane of Hinduism- we can and are doing it while keeping our culture, traditions and identity.|||just say chamal ko bora ta paako this , visa ni paaulas ni and move on|||So much for a secular nation|||lets eat beef guys",

I can understand you and what I'd suggest you is to focus on the class properly sit on the first bench, listen to the teacher and mark important things that the teacher says. Thats all you gotta do in college.  Secondly, after coming home from college take a break and revise what has been taught in class. Study consistently. 80% of the questions comes from 20% of the important concepts. Understand the concept and youtube ma gayera search important topics and questions from that chapter ani practice questions regularly. Ani sabai subject thorai thorai everyday study gara.

Because there was no one to guide me, i failed this year's neb board.   so from someone who learned from his own experience, my best advice is that you don't depend only on teachers from your school. there are tons of videos on youtube and tons of notes and  straight up answers in the internet.   if you do not understand and get anything at all, then only focus on the questions that are asked many times or repeated i.e only imp questions.   you have to make sure that you atleast passing marks, so look focus on the chapters you understand and master them first then only focus on others.   You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I’ve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don’t know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can’t get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",
