Is it generational wealth or does it come from the husband's side of the family?  I am also curious about Ayushman's professional background because it almost seems like he does not work.

Buspark, Gongabu, Balaju area are transit hubs, they have mobile population of people out of valley. Bouddha, Swayambhu areas have a strong Tibetan and our native Buddhist population.    Kalimati, Kuleshwor area have heavy Madhesi presence. Used to have, dunno nowadays.   Riverside settlements, the illegal and encroached ones are heavily homeless population.  Areas inhabited by, for lack of a better word, stable population and old school elites like Baluwatar, Maharajgunj, Lazimpat are better policed. Honestly they have better infrastructures in every way. Keep in mind I said elites. The settlements around Shova Bhagwati composed of original natives are neglected both in terms of infrastructures and policing.  To answer your question, is it rumor that Chabahil, Boudhha, Buspark, Swayambhu area are unsafe to the degree of murders and mob punishments, it's a no. Don't believe the movies and don't believe the old xenophobic stereotype. However non-violent and petty crimes are comparatively lot more prevalent there. It's all about how seriously the state takes those areas. My aunt's house got ransacked multiple times in Budhanilkantha area 25 years back when it was very sparsely populated. It was Tamang settlement back then if I'm not wrong. Fast forward now and the entire original settlements and farmlands have been wiped out for fancy mansions. I've not heard any bad news recently.|||The riversides near dhumbarai - chabahill for sure. I think it has gotten a lot better but those areas always used to have home theft/ robbery reports from time to time.|||lived in Balaju for 10 years and no issues.  it's actually a good place to live in being close to the Raniban hill. New Buspark side - I'm not sure, it does seem shady because of the hotels.|||Avoid the place where Sukumbasi Basti is. It's the breeding ground for Crime.|||[removed]|||what the frack.. yeah maybe some shady business runs at nightime around chabahil,bus park, surely there isnt common case of entire things you're reffering to. I live around bouddha and chabahil. Its peaceful dude.   Time to shut down your imaginary mind.|||I don't think any of above things runs openly in any part of Kathmandu Valley. I have seen those only in movies, not in real life in Kathmandu Valley. Yes, things that you have mentioned above are happening in different parts of Valley not only to those areas. New Buspark and Gongabu are has high mobile population so such crime may be operating there, but Movie maa dekhaune jasto chai I have not seen. And regarding gang fights, tyo ta alikati manchhe haru jamma hune thau maa jaha pani hunchha, but I have not seen such figths in in valley recently (yes  varkhar ko young kta haru ko vairako hunchha, but tyo ta junsukai thau ma pani hunchha ali ali.)|||How is kalanki khasibazar to live|||avoid maharajgunj to chabahil area those bansbari boudha jorpati kapan balaju all these areas are worst areas of ktm|||Lazimpath and Jawlakhel esp near area called Jhamel are particularly unsafe I hear.

            "body": "Hey everyone,  I recently bought a Triumph Scrambler 400x (green) from the Pokhara showroom. Honestly, the bike itself is incredible – I love it. But my experience with the showroom has been frustrating and disappointing.  Before buying, the sales lady was so nice, always polite, smiling, and helpful. I felt confident and excited. But after I paid and officially owned the bike, her attitude completely changed. She became rude, dismissive, and seemed like she was intentionally ignoring me multiple times. I even talked to a couple of other Triumph owners during my first servicing, and they mentioned they had noticed the same behavior from her.  To make matters worse, I didn’t even get a helmet included, which I was expecting. I had to buy one at night just to get home safely.  Today, I had a minor accident and went for servicing. Two people stopped while I was on the road to check if I was okay, offered help, rest, and even bought me water. Their kindness made me realize how poorly the showroom treated me. When I finally reached the showroom, I had to wait 30 minutes just to talk to her, and she barely acknowledged my accident. She just said something like “aaja ta hudaina, boli parsi tera kaila hunxa,” completely dismissive and unhelpful.  It’s such a shame because the bike is phenomenal, but this kind of attitude makes me regret choosing this showroom. I genuinely feel like a lot of customers must be unhappy because of how she handles things.  Has anyone else faced this kind of treatment at bike showrooms? I just needed to vent because I’m feeling really frustrated.",

            "body": "Hi everyone, I’m trying to get into the QA/Software Testing field, but I’m confused about where to start. I have a tech background but no industry experience, and the amount of information online is overwhelming. For an absolute beginner, what are the practical steps to become a QA Engineer? I’m unsure whether to begin with manual testing basics like SDLC/STLC, or jump into tools. I also don’t know how much coding is needed at the start or how much Python/automation knowledge is actually expected for a fresher. I’d really appreciate guidance on what tools matter for beginners, what kind of small projects I can do to build a portfolio, and how to prepare for entry-level interviews. If anyone working as a QA could share a simple roadmap, helpful resources, or things they wish they knew when starting, it would mean a lot.",

And sometimes switched tools to fix the mess one of the tool created.  And the mac app that I created is by no means simple tool.

The obvious is being able to run more workloads without a headache, multitasking will be way smoother, faster loading times for OS, apps and games and all, etc, etc.  (Use RAM in dual channel e.g. 2x8gb as it will be way faster than a single 16gb stick)|||free memory is waste of a memory.|||it depends! upgrading ram you will definitely see performance improvement but how much exactly it will vary from setup to setup. if you have a anything above i7 10th and a ok graphics card then you will see big difference in performance and if you are on i3 8-9 or below with no graphics card then you wont see a big jump but still some performance improvement.|||depends on what kind of work you do, what type of application you use.    if it's just normal usage like browsing, Microsoft words, music then the difference will be so slim that you'll not even feel it.    in case of browsing though you'll be able to open multiple tabs without lagging.    if you play games, use photoshop, video editor, android studio which are ram intense then you'll be able to see the difference like the load time will be faster, for video editing you'll be able to load higher quality or longer videos.  the minimum requirement for windows is 8gb and windows sometime eats 6gb 7gb of ram because of which you'll not be able to do much.    So if you already have ssd in your laptopo then I'll suggest you to go for 16gb ram even if you'll not see much change.|||If your current usage exceeds the 8 gb ram limits then the multitasking will be smoother and less lags then before and if you game you would get better frames..|||Think of your laptop like a car would changing the tires make a difference? Yes but the change of one component doesn't decide the function of the system the tires of a racing car are wasted on a regular car and the tires of a regular car will hold back the potential of a racing car|||performance difference hunxa but jati ram thapdai gayo operating system leh teti khana khojxa but still it will be a smoother experience processor ma ni depend garxa hai|||Yes. 8gb is not enough.|||What I'd do is install hwmonitor and work on the most power hungry task you usually do and some more and check the max ram usage. It is hitting above 85-90%(you've started to hit memory bottleneck), you'd know adding it helps significantly. Regardless adding ram helps with performance a bit even though you do not desperately need it.",

However, since I have a personal account, I can't publish the app under it, and I don't have the funds to set up an organizational account. And going through the DUNS registration phases.   Given my situation, I’m considering selling the app. I would be willing to offer a broker a 5-10% commission for facilitating the sale, but I'm unsure where to find brokers or potential buyers for an app like this especially since it’s still in the \"unlaunched\" phase.  I’m really at a crossroads. Should I wait and try to run the app myself, or would it be better to sell it? And if I decide to sell, where can I find people or platforms who would be interested in buying an unreleased pre-profit app like this?  Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated!

You trash Madhesh as the \"worst\" province, yet ignore that with the lowest GDP per capita (~$932), it is a labor exporter, not some economic paradise attracting migrants; the flow you see is often cross-border kinship (\"roti-beti\") that predates your entire concept of a nation-state. You wonder why other provinces don't have this issue? It’s called geography: Madhesh borders the accessible plains of Bihar/UP, while other provinces are buffered by hills or lower density, so comparing them is intellectually bankrupt. Finally, border security is a federal mandate, so blaming the provincial Madhesh government for Kathmandu’s open-border policy just proves you're looking for a scapegoat, not a solution.  Also how do you feel about pahadiyas crossing border to India through Farwestern region ? Does that not concern you.|||🤦‍♂️ blatant racism against madeshis in this don’t make me laugh you’re a bahun madeshi people are your genetic siblings forget imaginary lines they’re even your countrymen 🤣😂🤦‍♂️ same religion same genetics same everything.

Again, it doesn't matter; a good argument is that you enjoy business, so you would've gotten something out of it, but sometimes life isn't linear.    If you want to study in the US, you need a bachelor's degree before a law degree(juris doctor or JD), so you can do your bachelor's in business.

As someone who has lived in South Korea for 10+ years—a country with one of the best public transportation systems on the planet—coming back to Nepal feels like entering a different century.  The buses? No schedule. No reliability. Half the time you don’t even know if the bus is going to stop or just fly past you like you’re invisible. And when it does stop, you’re basically fighting for your life trying to get inside.  Microbuses? I swear these things break the laws of physics. Somehow they pack 25 people into a space designed for 12, and the conductor will still shout “aaja aaja, thau chha!” like it's a joke.  Routes? Good luck. Wanna go somewhere? You better pray you know someone who knows someone who once took that route when they were 16. Google Maps? Lol. Schedules? Double lol.  Traffic? I’m convinced Kathmandu traffic is a social experiment to test human patience.  After living in Korea—where buses arrive to the minute, subways are clean, safe, on time, and everything just makes sense—Nepal’s transportation feels like torture.  I’m not saying we need bullet trains or ultra-modern subways. I’m just saying… can we at least get buses that come when they say they will? Or like… signs? Information? Anything?  End of rant. I just needed to scream into the void.",

But I strongly do not recommend that you return to Nepal directly, because you mentioned that your family’s income is low and you don’t have a clear or feasible plan for going back. That would be a very unwise choice.  I mean no offense, but if you eventually manage to stay in Australia and become a citizen, that could very well be the greatest contribution you make in your entire life,for yourself and for your family.  Let’s calmly think about your situation: your family doesn’t earn much, yet you went to Australia to work. Think about the support and expectations your family has for you, as well as the effort you’ve put in. If you choose to return now without even knowing what you would do for a living, and considering that with your current situation you might be able to obtain Australian residency, then giving that up and going back might be the biggest mistake you ever make.  I know your journey hasn’t been easy, and maybe it feels difficult to keep going, but think carefully about the situation you and your family—and even future generations—may face if you return. You will most likely regret it.  That’s all I have to say.|||Lets be realistic no ones doing well in this country.

What you’re going through is something many Nepali students in Australia and abroad can relate to — the pressure for PR, job uncertainty, and also the weight of family expectations back home. It’s a lot to deal with, mentally and emotionally.  One thing I want to say for sure: your worth is not measured only by PR or money. You’ve already shown courage by going here alone, studying, and working hard these four years. That itself is a big achievement.  About your dilemma — returning home vs. staying — there’s no right or wrong choice here. What matters is what gives you a future that feels meaningful and sustainable. If the job doesn’t feel right and the sponsorship comes with years of compromise, it’s okay to step back and rethink. And if doing something of your own in Nepal excites you more, that’s a real option too. Nepal needs young people with global perspective and courage to take risks.  Your parents will always want your happiness first. Yes, money matters — but your peace of mind matters too. Whatever decision you take, take it with confidence, not fear. And remember, success doesn’t have only one path.  Take your time, think calmly, and choose the life you truly want. You’re going to do great — whether that’s in Australia or back home. 💪🏼💛|||Afu nai khus na bhaye k, but for your parents ma lai hatayerah ba, ma lai herah an do not return if you do not have a solid plan.|||Don’t return without money and PR/citizen   Natra life damage huncha|||Lol dont return here please.|||My honest opinion don't return to nepal for 3-4 years because of political instability !!!

But if you’re starting from zero, it will be challenging. The good thing is, you’ve got a Master’s from Australia, and depending on your field, you can either jump straight into job hunting or start something on your own. Give yourself a few months to study the market and understand the trends. It's swim or sink there. People are either making filthy money, or barely keeping their above water.    Ignore the naysayers..at the end of the day, it’s your path...your grind, your life, period! People love to gossip/bitch there, but don’t let that noise affect ya.   I recently spent almost two years in Nepal, and honestly, I was jealous seeing how relaxed and comfortable my friends, including my brother's lives were, while I’m here grinding every day. I’ve had PR for 12 years now (never bothered with Citizenship, never will), and I’m seriously considering moving back to Nepal. We shall see.|||If it is your last option, welcome back bro ! Relax, come and use your expertise. DM me if you need some ideas on starting low and areas where you can excel.|||I have seen first hand experience people harassing one of my friend just for returning back home from abroad.  You will very likely be harassed by your so called \\*close circles\\*. Be prepared mentally. I suggest you build life somewhere far from your home, avoid them, stay low-profile, eg. in ktm, if you are from outside of the valley. Once you stand firm, then go and say them \"hello\".  I wish you very well.|||I came to Australia for my Master’s and recently graduated. I’m on my TR now with around two years left.  To be honest, it only took me about a year to realise that Australia isn’t where I see myself long term. Since then, I’ve been focused on building networks, skills, and connections that I can use later in Nepal. I’m confident I can start from scratch there and build something meaningful with the experience I gained here.  Through this whole journey, I’ve noticed that Nepali students who come to Australia usually fall into one of two mindsets: \t1.\tThe “I’ll do whatever it takes for PR” mindset. This path needs long-term commitment, smart planning, and patience. There are multiple routes, but you have to be ready to follow them consistently. \t2.\tThe “Use Australia as a resource and return” mindset. Some people come here to gain skills, experience, money, or professional networks not necessarily to settle. If used wisely, Australia offers a lot that you can take back home and build a career with.  Neither mindset is wrong. The problem is when people don’t think strategically and end up stuck in between spending years here without building anything solid in either country.  This is just my experience, but I hope it helps someone who’s trying to figure out what they actually want.|||Go to banglore and find some work in IT.|||I’ll give you a very practical advice.

That's Nepal in a nut shell.   Logically Speaking, Custom duty should be only charged for something bought within Nepal with Nepal's own money. For example if someone from Nepal buys a foreign goods, he should pay the import duty and VAT tax for the luxury of owning a foreign good.  Thats the whole idea behind import duty - to discourage from spilling out national income through foreign spending. It's also OK to charge someone who went abroad for a short holiday trip.

Distribute hardware (primarily GPUs) on an extremely large scale to conglomerates. The conglomerates then use the hardware for something else.

Is it generational wealth or does it come from the husband's side of the family?  I am also curious about Ayushman's professional background because it almost seems like he does not work.

            "body": "So I’m a practising Hindu and feel that every religion including Hinduism has its flaws. We need to reform with time and discard old practises. What surprises me is this rather significant proportion of Hindus who selectively criticize other religious texts like from Christianity and Islam while ignoring that Hindu religious texts and rituals themselves are not that different from other religious texts in their advocacy of sexist, violent , casteist nonsense. Hindus criticizing Islamic texts for polygamy, slavery and what not, what about Mahabharat where polygamy and slavery are just accepted as part of life: these religious texts claiming to teach people how to lead a good life implicitly accept polygamy and slavery. Then you have this whole concept of patibrata dharma in texts like Swasthani which is just plain misogyny and designed to keep women down. Add to this, there’s this whole nonsense about karma, reincarnation, and caste system, where they say that lower caste are born this way because they committed horrible sin in past lives, so they deserve to be treated bad. This religion is full of fraudsters and scam artists: dhongi babas, jyotoshis, fake unproven ayurvedic medicine, matas, gaumutra ley sabai thik huncha  Hindu supremacists and chauvinists, before criticizing other religions and cultures, perhaps take the time to look at the evil within our own religion and culture.

Unlike some religions, almost nobody wants to bring back sati or other backward traditions.   If anything, Hindus have been very progressive, changing their ways and practices with the time. You may debate if the change has been fast or slow but you cannot deny that there *has been* change and most Hindus are okay with it for the most part.|||Because Hinduism isn't a religion like others .. it's a way of living .

When most of atrocities and genocides in the name of religion are done by Abrahamic religions.    From Terrorist groups to Crusades, don’t you think they don’t need to be criticized?|||How have you been practicing Hinduism?|||Ngl modern hindus in nepal are overly self critical. We are taught of satu pratha, mysoginy, caestism early in school.  I don't think no young person in nepal supports caestism in palpable level.  Also modern nepali think that caestism, sati pratha, slavery was worse than it actually was. Compared to other religions like islam or Christianity. We had much better ethical codes.  Slavery in nepal wasn't anywhere near as bad as islamic or Christian world. Not even 5% of it. Slavery here was more akin to servitude. They weren't treated as badly. And had some personal rights. And much rare in numbers.  Also karma is one of the most beautiful concepts i have ever seen. It encourages ppl to do good deeds. Hindusim doesn't teach to treat badly. If you look at history. Hindusim and buddhism had developed very good morality since a long time. It was about karma and dharma and treating everyone good.   Also caste wise, lower caste ppl weren't discriminated economically. They hold very important economic jobs like burning bodies, blacksmiths, etc.. It was more of a social and spiritual division. Still bad but there were way more apertheid societies. In nepal it was peaceful as long as they lived separately. This is probably why there was social harmony and they lived in peace for thousands of years.  Sati pratha in nepal in the ancient times was as rare as honor Killing is in Uk now. And most of it was through consent.   Avg nepali's idea of these thing are overblown and they criticize alot. Imo.   But if they learn about the type of shit that was happening in euorpe, middle east and north africa in the name of religion.   Also one big difference. Hindus texts aren't taken as the ultimate truth something they should follow through stuff like sharia laws. Its too vast and too open for interpretation.  It's hard to see a muslim esp criticize any of the ill doing in their religion of which there are so many even in this modern days. Im so thankful that that's not the case in nepal. They overly self criticize imo.  For the record, im very athesit i don't believe in religion. I was raised a Hindu and i hated and got annoyed by religion growing up. But now that im Learning more about other cultures. I think our morality was superior. Which is making me appreciate is more what's even more lovely is, people widely criticize the bad part while taking on the good ones. I like how our religion isn't dogmatic and how vast it is.  This says all. For eg: noone in nepal would support misogyny. In Bangladesh, ppl were rallying and beating effigy of women cuz the government reformed some laws for women.  I don't want to create bad stereotype for other religions too. But ehhh, my view is, statistically they do way too many fucked up things it has more fundamental problems for like islam and Christianity. Their religious texts are way too dogmatic. Tbf Christian society have reformed but its being hard for islamic societies to do so.      If you look at their history its so fucked up too. Religious wars, killing, enslaving, raping ppl from other religions sanctioned by their religious text. This was way too common.  Look at that and look at hindu history.|||Wdym by you’re practicing hinduism? Are you switching religion or exploring hinduism? Nonetheless every religion has its flaws so I suggest you to not just follow books but also use common sense and see weather something written in book are true or not. Also every religion teaches you to be good human being if you enjoy stories read those dharmic books if you are self aware of good and bad you really don’t need religion at all. Buts it’s your choice so have fun either way your free will. 😊|||Stop pretending dude|||What exactly are Hindus criticizing about other religions?|||What you're saying is like Science is a means of destruction just like War Arts, while it's a way of studying and understanding everything, just cause some use it to create means of destruction doesn't make it worthy of ill criticism. Hinduism is the same, it's a way of life and was accepted by many and was eternally changing. Some exploited that to turn practices means of better life and slowly ill-interpreted them to turn this into means of control. This wrong-turn branch was created by powerful peoples and widely spread, that's why it looks like it's Hinduism, but it's a mere branch of many branches of Hinduism.  If you cannot accept Hinduism, you're either a fool or ill-intent individual or someone good enough to be atheist.|||Hinduism nabhako bhaya secularism ni hudaina thiyo ni....hami hamrai naramro chalan Lai khandan garchhau Ra swikarchhau Pani.|||Sexiest? Bro? How can Hinduism be sexist when the Vedas have the contribution of women scholars, name one religion other than Hinduism whose holy book has women scholars and their contribution, Hindus consider 108 upanishads as the source of highest of knowledge out of which 18-25 are written by women scholars how is it sexist?  If you've learned just polygamy and slavery from those texts than I believe you're a the most bigoted man. The most worshipped Hindu God till today is Mahadeva he is said to be incomplete without his wife, thus it's said that husband and wife are complementary to each other where one complements the other and thus we have the complete form of Shiva the ardhanarshwor. And if it were so misogynistic the great of text which is even called the fifth veda, Ramayana does it always talk about Patni dharma or it more explicitly talk of Pati dharma, because Rama crossing an ocean and forming the way in ocean to get his wife for which he was ready to face the most fearful person on the planet of that time just shows me a glimpse of how we men should be, it is said that Rama never looked at other woman other than Sita, does this show you misogyny or does it show you Pati dharma of Rama. In other religion marriage is a contract between two bodies, Hinduism is the only one which says marriage is a bond between two souls to complement each other for not just life but also after life and even beyond that, during the marriage you circle around the agni where for first 3 you are at front and promise in front of agni deva that you will protect her no matter what the situation and later than she come in front and you promise her to include her in every decision making of your life. How is the Hindu tradition misogyny? About the caste factor, just think of it for a sec that Chinese Buddhist Scholars who had come to Bihar for Buddha's teaching never quite have mentioned the word jati or jaat, infact they have described it as an inclusive society which allowed them to study, but when the Europeans came they came up with their own caste trauma and when they saw Brahmins, Kshytriya Vaishya and Shudras they immediately went on to go ahead and form a chronology, because of their own historical trauma what is the surname smith, it's the one who worked with metals, it's a European thing transcended upon Hinduism by the Europeans, for us it was the muluki ain of JBR which reduced the fluidity between the varnas and stagnated it to make it a jati, rather than what it was, the varna system geeta talks of equality and says that all four varnas are equal in the society. You are just pointing out the modern day problems which I agree exists within Hinduism which is why we should promote hindutva ideology to rise  beyond caste, to rise beyond sects and all the things that are dividing Hindus. |||We as a society are trying to correct the bad things that has existed and trying to teach our children that the essence of religion is peace and humanity through education system. Change in social mentality doesn't come overnight but in no way casteism, immorality and sexism are getting ignored. What makes you feel so? And if there is fault in other practices, they should try to improve their practice as well. I think it is okay to criticize the thought if they are not willing improve and change. Western society has corrected their evil and illogical things and have much improved as society now, and we were late but are in correction phase right now. By your post, I assume you are defending Islam's criticism right now- but it is sadly indeed true that even in today's time, fascism, terrorism, genocide are happening various muslim society right now, and lots of problem are growing too. If you search about what's happening in nigeria, sudan right now or some other radical muslim society, you'd know. Chaos is on whole another level that Nepal's issue would seem insignificant. And no, we won't accept muslims starting to idealize such path in Nepal. It's obvious that criticism will be thrown when the actions and words remind people of that radical ideology.",

I took the same course purely out of passion, but I only landed better jobs because of my creativity,not because of a certificate. None of the companies I’ve worked with ever asked about my educational title; only some uncreative Nepali companies did, and they couldn’t even afford my salary.  My 6 years of experience have taught me a lot. I’ve worked with foreign clients, accepted low pay in the beginning just to learn more, and over time those skills paid off. I was even offered a position at a major tech company in Nepal, but I chose to join an AI company with a bigger vision and at double the salary.  The motto “Think Different” truly matters but listen it took me 6 years of constant sacrifices just to Learn not to Earn.|||Yesko matra valeu ta chhaina tara you got solid skills and projects then has valeu|||You need a showreel and that certificate won't get you much.|||3D kun software ma garayo, ani compositing ?|||Oh I have one too.

That's what it is supposed to do. Now make a portfolio. Having both cert + portfolio is good.

When I felt the exact same thing that you are facing, I did the same, it took some time, but the patience was worth it. I used to be a Multimedia Designer, I shifted to a better foreign company who appreciated my creativity, Nepalese companies doesn't even understand the \"C\" of creativity.|||To be honest, the working environment in Nepal feels messed up to me. I’ve worked in India as well, and the difference is huge. There, people respect your ideas, give you support, and actually let you try new things. You learn a lot in that process, and there’s real accountability for your work  and that’s what makes the job interesting. But in Nepal, most companies are full of office politics. People focus more on chilling than building something meaningful. Then suddenly, one day, all the “fun” stops and you’re expected to show results overnight. That’s when everything turns into chaos. I personally feel Nepal’s IT sector is not growing the way it should because of this mindset. Management hesitates to try new ideas, and most companies are still following the same blueprint they’ve been using for the past 10 years. No innovation, no mindset shift.  In my opinion, work becomes fun and challenging only when you are given responsibility and the freedom to try new things. Otherwise, it’s just the same rat race, the same routine, and the same day repeating again and again.|||I do get bored tara month ko end ma paune salary relieves that slog, I guess.|||Finalize na vayesamma kam nai avoid garxu ma ta.

The same boring schedule is real but try to enjoy the weekends to reset. And take out 25 - 60 mins of time everyday to practice interview questions and maybe some personal projects that interests you. With 1 YOE the only way to overcome what you are describing is switching the job itself which should increase your salary, network and confidence to have a kinda fresh new start. About finalizing the whole thing, most companies don't research or even have time to do so ig. Also the requirements changing are frustrating af but i think we learn something at least. So i highly recommend start making a proper portfolio with proofs of work in GitHub and CV, apply to new jobs and prep for interviews and try to switch the job.   My current life is also same as yours rn ( 3 YOE ) Clg - work - learn - sleep - repeat. I kind of have passion for coding though. I admit it gets boring but there is always a small excitement that keeps me going. And my only formulae is i try to enjoy the weekends to my fullest so that the whole week becomes worth it. And final suggestion which are just fundamentals ig.. take proper breaks, hydrate throughout the day, workout and have proper sleep schedule. I hope this helps a little.

Steam has greatly invested in this. Windows jastai feel chainey vaye try Zorin, it’s based on Ubuntu so it will be familiar. Or you may try cutefishOS which is also based on Ubuntu.    Good reasons to switch to linux, if you are using windows 10 and your pc doesn’t support 11, you should switch to Linux. You get to learn a lot about open source softwares. You’ll reduce your dependence on Microsoft.  Almost all games run on Linux, it even runs better on Linux.  Good reasons not to switch is if you’re not tech savvy and want things simple, you shouldn’t.|||Choosing Linux is the best choice. As a Linux user, I initially used Parrot OS, which is quite good, mainly for cybersecurity purposes, with a minimal and straightforward, non-complicated user interface. As you've mentioned, you are beginners, so you can try Linux Mint or Ubuntu, which are lightweight and offer a Windows-like experience within a Linux environment.  If you truly want to have your own fully customisable setup, you can use Hyprland WM in your preferred distro.  It has a strong active community.  Btw rn I'm using hyprland too.|||go for pop os or fedora|||The only good reason not to switch to Linux are that many of apps and majority of games are made only for windows.      **However** you can still use wine and proton for the apps and games (compatibility will differ).

If you work with adobe software they are not available but you have  linux alternatives. If you are  a programmer or work in IT linux will most certainly help you. Most of the distros are configurable via GUI nowadays. I'd recommend starting with Linux Mint if you want windows like feel or pop os because it has  good nvidia support and gaming is easier on pop os.Both are ubuntu based so any problem faced in them can be fixed with fixes suggested on ubuntu help threads.|||minecraft works natively (cuz java), roblox can run on andriod emulator (waydroid is the most popular), steam games run flawlessly unless they have kernel level anti cheat (check protondb to see if the game runs or not).  for distro, im currently running cachyOS with KDE. arch based, so it has it's quirks and learning curve. but much easier to setup since most things are taken care of (most notably nvidia drivers). do look into nobaraOS and fedora as well.  id recommend dual booting, but it has its own headaches. i broke the bootloader a few times fucking around lmao.  for windows application, there's winboat. runs windows virtual machine underneath but makes it seems like there's no vm. it can do most things but doesn't have GPU passthrough yet so no gaming, vid & img editing. better to find linux alternative. davinci resolve for vid editing, affinity for pic editing.  everything i mentioned is free.|||Install steam os|||98% percent of servers run on Linux, tara that doesn't mean linux distros for desktop, that means 98% of the servers are in linux server distros like ubuntu server , redhad , centos , linux sikna mann xa vane euta Virtual bos ma vm banau, static ip rakha , putty hanera chalau , appications , tools deploy gara na|||let me give you very honest answer, I was using Linux since I was 13 year old and I used it for almost 10 years, I also developed linux application and also experience system admin and it was very much good time. My favorite distro was debian because of stability, apt (a great package manager) and large collection of packages. I was pretty much happy. Then a year and half ago I bought a gaming laptop (i don't game much, mostly I used gaming laptop for Data Science work) and there pre-installed window was there, so i thought to remove windows and switch back to my old debian but my friend told me to give it a try. I remember last time I was using windows 8 and now on windows 11. After one and half year I think my life become more easier than using just using that old linux because of windows experience, I got pre built tools that almost optimize all the application, plus nvidia graphic driver works great on windows than linux and plus I can game too. For any linux tasking I got the wsl2 which work flawless. So using wsl I never felt like going back to linux because of windows experience and there is some shitty saying like If you are a developer than use linux or if you want privacy than use linux. Look windows is great from developer's point of view. You need to code than every OS is fine for you (expect building on iOS or MacOS) and for privacy stuff you can switch to Window Pro or Enterprise and microsoft is taking money for your windows experience.   It is a choice, If you want to learn system admin or server management than I think you need get your hands dirty on Linux Distro in bare metals but if you are an experience developer than you know what to do.  Btw I am not going to switch back to linux soon because of windows experience and why I don't choose MacOS .. because of pricing|||Use mint or Ubuntu but mint is better for beginners imo. Dual boot if you're just starting out but default to linux is what I recommend.  Most of the other replies have covered how gaming is but in short: Yes, it's mostly possible and very much usable, but often not natively. If some of the tiny quirks and exceptions end up being an issue for you, stick to windows.  It's well worth just dipping your toes in and learning the basics but you will reach a point where you have to ask yourself, \"Do I need linux?\"   Everyone has their own reasons, for most windows users it's simplicity, reliability and usually the default choice. For lots of linux people, it's the community and sense of being in control. Some might have completely different reasons.  In the end, it depends on what your use case is. Choose the right tool for the job. But it is very much worth it to at least try it out.

            "body": "A clear vision for a truly digital Nepal  If I were entrusted with the responsibility of leading Nepal’s Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, my first priority would be to build a fast, reliable, modern digital ecosystem for every citizen. Today, people waste hours in queues and face endless frustration because our government systems are slow, outdated, and poorly maintained. This must change.  1. High-speed, modern servers for all government services  Citizens should not have to wait 30 minutes to 1 hour just to load a form. I would upgrade outdated servers to modern, scalable cloud infrastructure so that: websites don’t crash services open instantly users don’t see “server busy” or “system down” Speed and reliability would become the standard.   2. High-quality websites built by skilled private IT companies Government platforms are often slow, heavy, and full of bugs because they go to the lowest bidder. I would ensure development contracts go to top private IT firms, focusing on quality, security, and long-term performance—not cheap shortcuts.   3. Strong in-house IT teams for maintenance Every major digital platform would have a dedicated team of developers, designers, database managers, and cybersecurity specialists with: proper salaries training responsibility for monitoring and improving systems 24/7 support during peak usage No more outdated portals that never get updated.   4. A powerful, secure, fully centralized Nagarik App  The Nagarik App would become the heart of digital governance. All major documents would be stored securely inside it: citizenship passport academic certificates tax documents PAN driving license health records social security details It would also include a complaint submission section, so people can report issues directly. For those unfamiliar with digital systems, complaints could be filed through ward offices.   5. Fast online services for forms and applications  Citizens would be able to submit applications for: driving license passport police report birth registration taxation land documents with zero lag — from the website or through Nagarik App.   6. Auto-filled forms from centralized data  Once data is linked and verified, any form you open will automatically fill itself with your information. No more entering the same details a dozen times.   7. Skilled ICT technicians in every ward and municipality  Every ward office would have at least one trained computer technician who can: guide citizens fix basic errors help with online applications operate digital systems This reduces queues and makes government offices efficient.   8. Fully digital, efficient government hospitals  One of the most painful problems citizens face is in government hospitals, where even after having computers and internet, staff say: “System slow cha, online chaldaina, wait garnu parcha.” This causes people to wait for hours just for:   OPD ticket lab report payment receipts doctor appointments patient record updates   To fix this, I would: ✔ Install fast, dedicated hospital servers So patient data loads instantly without lag. ✔ Use digital queue management systems Tokens, OPD numbers, and reports would appear online or on the app—no more pushing in crowded lines. ✔ Introduce Electronic Health Records (EHR) When a patient visits any government hospital, their entire medical history loads instantly from the central system. ✔ Build a Hospital Digital Support Team Trained IT technicians in every major hospital to fix internet, system errors, and software issues immediately. ✔ Guarantee 24/7 internet uptime Hospitals would have backup connections so service never stops due to network problems. This would save time, reduce frustration, reduce corruption, and improve the entire healthcare experience.   9. Move toward a paperless digital government  Government operations would shift from physical files to secure digital systems. This reduces: corruption delays lost documents unnecessary travel wasted time Everything becomes transparent and traceable. Why this transformation is necessary Currently Nepalis suffer because of: slow servers outdated systems long queues lazy maintenance no accountability untrained staff poor hospital digitalization An entire country cannot progress with such a weak digital backbone. My commitment If I became MoCIT Minister, I would build a Nepal where: technology works smoothly government services are fast hospitals are efficient citizens don’t waste hours standing in line and every Nepali can access digital services with confidence and dignity A truly Digital Nepal — not just in words, but in real life.

Since electronics here in the U.S. are way cheaper, I can bring a few items for anyone interested — smartphones, smartwatches, iPads/tablets, cameras, AirPods... (no laptops though).   Just note that the new devices would be out of box as I will bring the device like my own. I will keep the boxes/paper/receipts safely in checked baggages.  I can bring brand-new items. Everything comes with the box + papers, and if you’re not satisfied, you can return it to me — I can easily return it here in the U.S, but I would really appreciate if you do your research and not make hassle for both of us!   Please also check the model's price and everything in Nepalese market for your reference!  It would be cheaper for you than in market, and with the cut from selling you, it aids me paying this semester's fees as I get to see my aging parents.   I dont want any advance payment or smth. We meet, you see everything and check whether it is authentic and all like papers and all (I get you; I am a stranger and you are paying a lot)..!   I can only bring like one each along with my friend, so DM or comment asap.",

I wanted to take a moment to share something from the heart, especially for the Gen Z community here. I’m not here to lecture, judge, or pretend that I “know better.” In fact, it’s the opposite—I’m here because I genuinely admire a lot about Gen Z, and I’d love to learn from you if you’re open to talking or sharing your perspectives.  What I really respect about your generation is the honesty. The courage to say things out loud that older generations kept buried. The way you call out what doesn’t feel right, whether it’s in society, culture, work, or even in yourselves. The world is changing fast, and you all seem to face it with a unique blend of humor, vulnerability, and resilience. And honestly, that’s inspiring.  I’m not perfect, and I don’t pretend to fully understand everything about today’s trends, language, mindset, or struggles. But I’m here with an open mind. If any Gen Z member is willing to talk—to enlighten me, challenge me, laugh with me, or even correct me—I’d sincerely appreciate it.  I’m reaching out with respect and humility. I’m here to listen, not impose. Thank you to anyone who takes a moment to respond. 🙏🏽|||yesto sanskar vaka le kasto desh banauxan hola?

            "body": "I swear, the more I watch Miraj Dhungana’s actions after the Gen-Z protests, the more pissed off I get. This guy went from saying “I’m not the leader, this is a collective movement” to suddenly announcing a whole political party under the Garikhana Deu banner like it’s some kind of personal promotion. Do you even realize how ridiculous that looks? We were told this movement was leaderless, built on the frustration of an entire generation, and now the SAME person who said he wasn’t leading anything is stepping into politics like he’s been preparing the whole time. It feels like the movement’s energy was used as a ladder.  And don’t even get me started on the way he handled the October 9 protest confusion. When young people were panicking, waiting for clarity, ready to go to the streets again because the country is literally suffocating under corruption, what does he do? He steps back. He shrugs it off and says Gen-Z wasn’t involved. Bro, if you’re going to speak for the movement when it’s convenient, then show up when shit gets chaotic too. That’s literally what leadership is. Instead, he pops up when the cameras are rolling and disappears the moment things get risky. That kind of pick-and-choose activism makes me angry because that’s exactly the political behavior we protested against.  Then there’s the whole “our office was attacked” episode. He went public with it, made it sound serious, and then the police said there was no official complaint, and everything was calm when they arrived. What are we supposed to believe? Either be transparent or don’t dramatize it. People actually suffered during these protests. People bled. People DIED. And watching someone drag the movement into half-explained drama with zero clarity is honestly insulting.  What makes me the most furious is how he keeps talking like he represents the entire generation, giving big speeches about unity, direct elections, overseas voting, and political reform, while his actions keep zig-zagging all over the place. You don’t get to call yourself the voice of Gen-Z while making moves that look inconsistent, self-centered, and convenient. The Gen-Z protests weren’t a TikTok trend. They weren’t a branding opportunity. They were a desperate cry from a generation that’s tired of being silenced and robbed of a future.  Watching someone turn that into a messy political ambition is heartbreaking and infuriating. We didn’t risk our safety so one guy could walk around looking like a “youth politician.” We marched for real change. For accountability. For a country that doesn’t chew its future generation alive. And right now, Miraj feels like he’s drifting so far from the soul of that movement that it’s honestly painful.  If he actually wants to stand for Gen-Z, then he needs to stop playing this half-activist, half-politician game and show some damn consistency, clarity, and courage because right now, all I’m seeing is another person using the movement’s energy to put himself in the spotlight.  Anyone else feel like this? Because I’m seriously done pretending this is okay.    And here are the straight-up questions people genuinely have for him:  Who is funding your movement, your events, and now this new political party?  Why did you claim there was “no leader” during the protests but suddenly step into a political role afterward?  When exactly did you decide to form a party during the protests or after?  If you didn’t intend to be a leader, why are you acting like one now?  Why do you vanish or disengage whenever things get tense, unclear, or dangerous?  Why was the October 9 situation handled so confusingly by you?  Why talk about an attack on your office but file no clear, formal police complaint?  Who keeps you accountable? Who checks your decisions?  What gives you the right to speak on behalf of an entire generation?  Are you building a movement or building a personal political brand?",

He's been doing 'media' stuff like making videos and shit from a while ago but he hasn't been 'in the streets' as a kid and it shows. Call me backwards or whatever but if you never got into fights as a kid, or even as a teenager, you don't have that 'bite'. That's him. That softness combined with good looks and branding made him the perfect mascot for non-violent 'gen-z'. He's great as a model but as a ruthless and calculating leader that can lead hundreds of people to bring a certain outcome? Nope.. he's a weak kid inside. Aba ko political events le uslai daro banauna chai sakcha hai in that regard.  He got scared after the sep 8/9 incidents, fearing that his good life could get stripped away from him. He's someone with a lot to lose. His family and relatives probably held him back. Tespachi he probably came back to the front ali pachi with some kind of a plan. Aile chai I just think he's trying to do what he thinks and knows is right - play by the political system's rules. And since we all have severe trauma related to anything 'political party' related, we hate to see it.  Sudan is the opposite of miraj - he's been in the field, has scolded corrupt officials to their face since 2015, has had literal dirt and blood on him. But he's not an eloquent speaker like miraj, he's got 'a look' but the kind of person he has become, branding himself online is not sth he cares about. Whatever he is, is his brand.  In any case, we gotta be careful and discerning and support where needed and criticize where appropriate. Let's get it 💪|||.|||Clips ki video xaina yo post KO?|||Sabai opportunistic cha kasai lai wastai chaina euta main leader nai chaina euta ley aafno party kholya cha arko yo vaye na tyo vayeh na arko paila ko party haru ley movement start garya cha genz yeta euta kei garna sakya chaina.|||movement was leaderless but quite not. but even then the aftermath can't go on like that leaderless, shapeless, formless, faceless. why don't u go take his job?|||He doesn’t know How politics works.|||so its oli/prachande/deuba jhole vs sudan jhole vs durga jhole vs miraj jhole vs ck raut jhole now   hahahahaha  mathi ko main madaari hasi ra hola goti haru ko activity dekhera|||k ho reason chai hate garnu ko? k kura garyo genZ movement represent nagarne?|||Kaam garne kaalu|||No doubt young generation is powerful and should be in politics too.

Intentions sahi hola but yinarle anarchy matra badauxan.|||Not a Zenzee and while I appreciate the revolution and all, they have slowly becoming Oli gang. What it demonstrates is the blood we have - thirsty for oneself, power, money, opportunity. I am particularly upset with Sudan Gurung who is hell bent at removing Home Minister and this guy called Miraj Dhungana. I will dismiss Miraj right off the bat because I don't see anything in his eyes and his face. He is a selfish person and anyone who is following him and all should think many times. Sudan Gurung - the guy is hell bent on removing home minister on such a stupid demand that he wants to arrest Oli and Lekhak. What the hell guys ? are you looking for rawanraj? we have laws and we want to enforce it fairly and strictly. Om Prakash is a lawyer and he is not trying to protect Oli or Lekhak - anyone thinks that is such a stupid Zenzee. Do you guys want to arrest someone just on a whim? without gathering sufficient proof? In western countries law enforcement officials spend years if not decades monitoring and gathering evidences against someone they think is culprit - they just don't  arrest someone and investigate - that wouldn't be rule of law. Om Prakash has that schooling. I don't care who Om Prakash is and all but he is definitely a capable guy and has proved it time and again - after all, he is chosen by PM.  Now, are you guys looking to change ministers and government leadership when we only have 4 months to go ? Its such a shame when every so called Zenzee goes to Singhadarbar and disturbs our government's actions. Just think if all the time they spend is meeting you guys.     Now listen to what Mahabir Pun said - please go to your constituencies and help new  political parties that align to your views win - why are you spending so much energies trying to meet the PM ? The Miraj Dhungana is such a scam guy - He is driven by his own ambition, I feel. I did like Sudan but he is also active childish and not a thing in near future.  Whatever everyone says and does listen and watch what Rachha Bam says and does. She is the one who walked out with Army Chief when he seemed to infer democracy was in danger. She is acting with passion and patience. I would recommend everyone to support behind Raswapa, Sagar Dhakal, Baburam, Kulman,  Sumana Shrestha. Sumana is the real deal.     Now if you believe in democracy and free and fair election, support Rabi. How can a person so beloved by people can be in jail without having an opportunity to go to people? is democracy is for the people and by the people?     I recommend please read. Watch what Swarmin Wagle said few days that Deuba was Zenzee, Oli was Zenzee and every popular leader was zenzee when they started politics. There has been tremendous progress but it was not enough. Just because you feel young and under 25 doesn't mean its your government and can do anything. Nope - no way until we have rule of law.     Now this government gotta focus on election and it has to happen. When I hear Miraj and Sudan that say it can't happen in current condition are not only naïve but foolish. They gotta go read what democracy is. Nothing happens without people's mandate which is vote.     And don't forget its not you guys who brought this change - it was a coincidence.  Someone else did on 24th so you really shouldn't overwhelmingly take any credit, especially Miraj who didn't even take part in the protest ! Hope it helps.|||Ani aaja bholi singa durbar bhitra baseka haru protocol follow garera aako hun ta ??|||miraj and party >>>>> yemale and other similar parties|||Yea the protest was headless/leaderless but we need people to lead you can't complain he gained from this protest of course he did and we want a capable leader to run office not military the argument that he was not in the protest is stupid this is exactly why we failed as national because we put fighters as leaders they can be leaders while fighting but in office we need people who lead office not mobs and arms   Not taking his side but this was a common argument against him and I disagree so this ... Btw I don't know why they want directly elected pm within 6 months like bring 2/3 majority and do what you want their ego will delay the election effectively pushing the country years backwards focus on NOTA and NRN voting rights and different policy and development plan for future|||All this shit is happening coz there was no leader during gen z protests. They did not achieve anything despite such massive movement except toppling Government.   Miraj Dhungana came into realization. An organised group is must to move forward. The most important thing a leader should have is a clean image and clear vision. The maturity he has shown not being political figure is admirable.   One of the good thing coming out of Gen Z movement is the youth having interest on politics and stepping forward to be incharge.  We should not discourage them, in the same time help them by giving healthy and constructive criticisms.|||आज उनीहरूले गरेको माग केपी र लेखक लाई सजाए को दायरा मा ल्याउनुपर्छ भन्ने विषयमा थियो। सायद त्यो माग राख्नु गलत भयो होला है।|||Yo sub pani flip bhaira hunxa harek bela.

They will always make reasons like we are Nepali muslims and we are different but their genetics, history is the same as that of Indian muslims as majority of musilmw living in Nepal migrated from Kashmir, UP, Bihar and Bangladesh .  For Muslims, religion comes first before nationality. Many groups within nepal have differences between them but for them the nation comes first, you will see a hindu nepali protesting against India and Buddhist protesting about illegal citizenship to Tibetan refugees. But a muslim will never say anything about illegal migration of Rohingyas .   Also, these people are real fanatics and radicals . ApM ssaid something that’s true, many arab nations don’t provide equal opportunities to women. Saudi just maid it legal for women yo obtain driver’s licenses just a year ago, many of the women can’t travel alone, islam allows mens to have multiple wives but why isn’t the same applied towards women?  Also, PM mentioned that in the past muslims women in muslims nation faced far much difficulties and there was no reason to be triggered about it.  They literally made movies about Sati practices withng some community but no one came put to protest against the release, had it been something about muslims they will flood the streets .  At the end, its upto nepali to believe that muslims of Nepal are different from rest of south asian muslims. I wonder when most of the madarsas, mosques have bangaldeshi, paksitani imams and scholars how will the teachings be any different?

            "body": "A few days ago, I got a call from an old Muslim friend from Sarlahi, Nepal. He was calling from Germany. He had left Nepal three years earlier, and we hadn’t spoken in over a decade. We ended up talking for nearly two hours, and toward the end he shared something that has stayed with me since.  He was born and raised in a devout Muslim family. From childhood he was taught to pray five times a day (though, like most teenagers, he often missed a few). After school, he used to go to the local madrasa to memorize the Quran. I still remember asking him once, “What does it mean, the part you’re reciting?” He recited a few lines in beautiful Arabic and then admitted, “I don’t know. They don’t teach the meaning here. They just teach the recitation.”  After SLC, we both moved to Kathmandu for higher studies but ended up at different colleges. Whenever we met for tea in New Road or Ratna Park, he was still the same religious boy. He told me his dream was to learn Arabic properly so he could finally understand the Quran in its original language.  Then life happened, and we lost touch for more than ten years.  When he called the other day, we started with the usual catching-up: jobs, marriage, parents, health. Then, quietly, he said, “Brother, I finally learned Arabic. I read the Quran myself, cover to cover, in the language it was revealed.”  He paused for a long time.  What he found inside shattered him. Verses permitting sex slavery, verses cursing Jews, Christians and polytheists, verses he could never imagine were part of the book he had memorized as a child. He thought maybe he had bought a defective copy. He checked five different editions. They were still the same. In panic, thinking his Arabic wasn’t good enough, he opened translations in Nepali, Urdu, and English. Every single one said the same thing.  His iman, the faith he had guarded his whole life, collapsed. He went to local scholars, to imams he respected, begging for explanations that could save his belief. Nothing they said helped. The verses were too clear.  Finally he gathered the courage to tell his family. Their reaction? Death threats. “If you leave Islam, we will kill you ourselves. We can’t live with the shame of an apostate son.” His younger brother told him plainly, “Better you die than bring this disgrace on us.”  Nepal is not Saudi Arabia or Pakistan. We proudly call ourselves a secular republic. Yet here was my friend, a Nepali citizen, forced to flee his own country because he asked questions about his religion and found answers he could not accept.  He now lives in Germany, safe but heartbroken. He still loves his parents, his siblings, his village, the taste of mutton sekuwa at the Sarlahi haat, the smell of rain on the Bagmati plains. But there is no home for him here anymore.  I knew apostasy could be dangerous in some Muslim-majority countries. I never imagined it could happen to someone I grew up with, in our own Nepal.  Why should a person be disowned, or worse, threatened with death, just for changing his mind about religion? How is this still happening in 2025?  I am sharing my friend’s story (with his permission) because silence won’t fix this. If even one family in Nepal thinks twice before issuing a death threat to their own child for leaving religion, this post will have been worth it.  Let’s talk about it openly, honestly, without fear. Our country is big enough for people of all beliefs and none. No one should have to choose between their conscience and their life.",

The instability is only within politics. As a girl living in Bangladesh, I don’t face anything. I can wear whatever I want. It’s just you all overthinking because of Indian media. No one will harm you unless you go and involve yourself in it. Stay away from political opinions and you’re safe. And Bangladeshis especially have no enmity with Nepal, Bhutan or Sri Lanka.

Though I am not aware of much SCIENCE but unfortunately we can only do so much ourselves and cant control the air currents. (I'm not from science bg so correct me if I'm wrong)...|||Yes it is unfortunate. Sadly there is nothing we can do. Indians must be immune to pollution or something.|||China used to have high air pollution in but they are able to control it in few years.   Air quality in China: Pollution levels down by 42% over the past ten years • FRANCE 24 English  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCZn0GSuLr0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCZn0GSuLr0)|||We are the same people, India or Nepal. Same civilization, same geography same economy. A border got created a few hundred years back doesn't make us special, if anything this attitude is the problem.  In winter the cold air keeps pollution trapped, neither blowing away nor washing down. Everything contributes here - India contributes according to its size and population, and so does Nepal. We can't even manage the few thousands of vehicles we have in Nepal. If we could at least stop the black smoke gushing from exhausts in Kathmandu maybe we could act noble, but we can't even do that due to corruption. So with what moral superiority can we look down on the chaos in India? We could act superior if we weren't dependent on the same polluting industries and agriculture of India. We depend without limits upon food grains, vegetables, medicines, fuel, vehicles, appliances that same polluting India creates. Just because your mom or wife is in a smoky kitchen doesn't mean you can act smug and call them polluters while you are still eating the food they cooked.  So chill, we \"South Asians\" are just starting to develop, delayed due to our colonial past. We got caught in the world population boom due to collective human knowledge growth, but unlike the rest of the world we had richer land and environment that could sustain billions of lives \"year round\". The education boom caught the world only after the population boom, making this rich land have more unbalanced population growth than the rest of the world.|||India is a permanent problem for Nepal. Until Indians clean their air for themselves we are fucked for air quality.|||Plant more trees|||Good question 🤔|||Create a government and bring the change you so want. aba ta samaya, paristhiti sab cha.... garinas bhaney COWARD hos! 😘|||Need to put a big Fan|||[removed]|||to be fair they get the floods during the summer|||https://preview.redd.it/ih0s9emcdx2g1.jpeg?width=576&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97d0cff8dcf4d3476bd71c948a2236fce384c748  111in mirchaiya . bahira sadak na jada dhula khan milaxa ghar ma dhuwa.|||Shift Nepal to Finland borders, I'm sure you can do that.|||Class action lawsuit in UK court.|||Kasto aalu manxe hola|||Im in india.

I suspect the maximum of 25 years before it happens.|||Neighbors",

Awareness 2. Bans, stronger rules 3. Traffic police checks  What has worked and what will work is pricing. Get rid of rules that promote cartelling and let capitalism solve the issue.   If you had the choice to pay 20 rupees more but travel with slightly more comfort, and with a nice seat, maybe 30-40% of people would be willing to pay, which in result means more businesses willing to invest in public transport as they seek profit, more competition, better services. Those who offer neither good service nor good pricing then deserve go out of business.  This weird government backed cartelling with fixed artifical prices will never work.|||We should implement a metro-style system for local transport in Kathmandu. Currently many buses operate within the ring road but cannot travel beyond it due to narrow and congested lanes. Even when they do it only results in traffic jams.  What if we introduced autos in the valley that follow the same routes as local transport and carry 3–4 passengers per ride? Buses and vans could be restricted to the ring road and every bus stop along the ring road could have designated autos and rickshaws to drop passengers to their destinations at the same fare.  If implemented all the microbuses and hiaces could be replaced with standard buses which would likely cause less congestion than the current smaller vehicles.|||The metropolitan and the yatayat syndicate are the problems. There should be a limit on the number of passengers each vehicle can carry. For large buses, it should not be more than 110% of the number of seats. And for microbuses, it should not be more than 100% of the seating capacity. The limit rule should be enforced by the traffic police.   It's a systemic problem and requires a systemic solution.|||Nepal yatayat ma gundruk khade vanda namajale khadiyeko yaad ayo|||nonchalant khalasi dai|||Ajhai 3 Jana atne thau cha.|||Khalasi be like pachadi sarnus na tetro khali cha|||aghii pakhai ho ni..khalashi haru huncha micro ra yatayaat ko bhadaa karcha.

            "body": "As an Computer Engineering/IT graduate in Nepal, there are various pathways.  Option A) You stay in Nepal  Option B) You move abroad   Let's discuss about Option A first.  There are two realistic pathways you could take if you stayed in Nepal.  - work at private  - work at government   I have tried working at private. But the amount of discrimination being done in private companies really blew me up. As someone who was also preparing for government jobs, I had noticed lots of underprivileged folks participating in government jobs exam(for computer engineer as well). I used to ponder what made them do this since this is not a very lucrative job compared to what a \"certain community\" person makes at private or \"certain community\" person grows at private job. But later realized that private companies are not interested to hire these \"underprivileged\" folks.   Lots of people might argue (although they know it is not true) private jobs hire on merit. No they do not do so in Nepal. It is completely based off connections. It does not matter your knowledge. It is about who you know 100%. I am not ignorant that this might be the case outside, but I swear to god everyday, esto garera USA ma jasto innovative companies cha tyo ta pakkai hudainthyo..   The reason for such favoritism is mainly because the work they do is so shit. Leaving few companies who developer softwares that Nepalese use on daily basis(Not ludo), other jobs are not very interesting to do either. It is the same low quality menial job with meagre pay.   The companies who have a business are handful already. Investor ko money burn garne jasto nepal ma kei hudaina as there are no investors. So you see these bitchy ass companies hiring full stack developer every day for the salary of an intern.     I could not really be bothered with working under someone and taking all nonsense blames for 30,000 per month on hand. With no future and no growth and dismissing my self esteem. My aviman is and was huge.   The second pathway is to work at government corporations. I looked at the salary of computer engineer at Nepal Army, Nijamati and it is decent. But the upwards mobility is just not there. What I mean by that is salary is not growing when you grow your experience. Aba ta government employee specially nijamati lai dekhne bittikai yo bhrastachari raicha bhanne lagcha. Kinaki bhrastachar nagari ta khana basnai napugne. Pradhan Sena Pati ko talab cha 67000. Social security benefits cha good and all but cash in hand ni aileko market rate anusar ta dinu paryo ni. 67000 ma kam garne pradhansenapati le ghus nakhaye k garera palne? lol.  I looked at corporations salary. And it seems that if you manage to get a handle at a corporation(Sansthans), you can make be sure to make average of 60-70 thousands per month even as a 6th level officer. At this point of my career, this seems fair enough. But it will not be enough after 5 years, if my increment is just 1 thousand per year.    A huge reform is required in government services. Government services (specially nijamati) are the core to how people feel about the government. If we cannot make it attractive and lucrative, it does not matter how rich we are saving on their salary.  Next option is moving abroad.  Aba ko market ma abroad ma PR paune/GC paune biswas ta chaina. Unless you do the jobs that Americans do not want to do (or foreigners) like teaching for 60k/year, nursing old people etc.  15 years bidesh ma basna jane. Kam garne and coming back to Nepal. It seems the most plausible way forward. Nepal ma ayepachi k garne bhanne hunasakcha however.  The countries in option to stay for so long are Japan, India. Do not want to surrender my passport to Dubai sheikh. Also middle east is terror and war prone so do not want to end up there.   Europe tira padna gaye matra ho. It seems bleak for immigrants nowadays. And I do not think they earn that much in Europe (for someone planning to return back to Nepal and not stay there). Teta nabasne bhayepachi social security ko teti matlab bhayena.   How about USA? USA seems fine and all. but I do not think getting a work permit after Masters degree is going to be easy. Or that you are going to make big bucks and save big bucks as an immigrant in this economy. Since PR/GC is not guaranteed, you are basically playing a zero sum game. The experience that you get in abroad and education bla bla is huge investment however.",

I took the same course purely out of passion, but I only landed better jobs because of my creativity,not because of a certificate. None of the companies I’ve worked with ever asked about my educational title; only some uncreative Nepali companies did, and they couldn’t even afford my salary.  My 6 years of experience have taught me a lot. I’ve worked with foreign clients, accepted low pay in the beginning just to learn more, and over time those skills paid off. I was even offered a position at a major tech company in Nepal, but I chose to join an AI company with a bigger vision and at double the salary.  The motto “Think Different” truly matters but listen it took me 6 years of constant sacrifices just to Learn not to Earn.|||Yesko matra valeu ta chhaina tara you got solid skills and projects then has valeu|||You need a showreel and that certificate won't get you much.|||3D kun software ma garayo, ani compositing ?|||Oh I have one too.

That's what it is supposed to do. Now make a portfolio. Having both cert + portfolio is good.

            "body": "Hi everyone👋 I’m 23, living in Nepal, only a high-school degree, and I’m broke (only have 100 dollars in savings rn). I want to build a real career in IT so I can eventually work remotely or move abroad. I want something realistic that I can learn in about a year and turn into a stable, good-paying job.  Honestly, I’m not interested in freelancing or full-stack because (personally) it feels oversaturated and too creative (for each project) and portfolio-heavy, but I’m still open if I’m wrong. I don’t wanna sound picky, and desperate, like “I only want X, not Y.” Please don't get me wrong. I'm willing to learn and work. I’m flexible - I just want something that's worth my time and effort.  I’m looking for an IT path that:  • isn’t super saturated   • is easier for beginners   • hires freshers from Nepal (South Asia)   • has a stable monthly salary (4 digits)   • has a clear roadmap   • doesn’t require a uni degree   • reliable - won’t be replaced by AI soon   • can help me find jobs abroad  If you were in my shoes - 23, broke, no degree, living in Nepal, trying to break into tech in 2025/2026 - what would you realistically choose?  I’m open to anything: front-end, app dev, full stack, IT support, cloud, DevOps, QA, cybersecurity, networking, data, MySQL - anything that actually works for someone starting with almost nothing. Coz, I don't wanna end up being homeless. Seriously, I am so sick of my current lifestyle, I wanna make a change and take some right action that will lead me to my goal. I literally don't care if it's hard or impossible, coz now it's a necessity.. I am ready to sacrifice my time. I wanna invest in myself (my skills).  So, please, I need your help to choose the right direction.  I’d really appreciate any honest suggestions, roadmaps, or personal stories from people who started in a similar place.  Thanks a lot.",

QA is the easiest and fastest way to get a job because it’s not too saturated, Nepal hires many freshers, and you don’t need a portfolio or degree. IT support is the most stable long-term option because it’s beginner friendly, companies always need support staff, and it naturally leads to higher-paying roles like SysAdmin or Cloud Engineer. Cybersecurity is the most future-proof, global, and high-demand field, but it requires more effort in the first few months.  Things like frontend, full-stack, and freelancing are not the best starting point when you’re broke and need stability fast; they take longer and require portfolios or creativity. A simple one-year plan would look like this: for QA, learn manual testing first, then SQL/API testing, and later basic automation. For IT support, learn computer basics, networking, and ticketing tools, then move towards cloud platforms. For cybersecurity, start with networking and Linux, then learn security basics and practice SOC labs.  If you want something fast, choose QA. If you want something stable and practical, go for IT support. If you want long-term growth and international opportunities, choose cybersecurity. Any of these three can realistically change your life within a year if you stay focused|||You’re only 23, so you have time on your side. While I understand you want quick results, consider exploring online degree programs. Many are flexible and work-friendly. A degree can make a huge difference when applying for jobs abroad and competing for better positions - it might be worth the investment alongside building your skills. 🙂🙂|||If I were you, I’d start with IT support → networking → cloud. It’s cheap to learn, beginner-friendly, hires freshers in South Asia, and leads to real stable jobs. Once you get basic support skills, aim for CCNA, then AWS. It’s the most realistic path to a solid career without a degree.|||look for QA, devrel, dev advocate, project manager, sre/devops etc. what's the tech skill that u already know? |||Garo nai cha aile ko situation ma ta.

What did those first few months feel like — mentally, financially, emotionally? * Do you ever regret your decision to move? If yes, what moments made you feel that way? And if no, what kept you motivated? * What was the reality from day one? Did you struggle to find part-time work? Was balancing study and work harder than you expected? How lonely was it, if at all? * Did your journey turn out the way you had imagined? Or did things change once you arrived? * Are you still working in IT now? If not, what pulled you away from the field? Did you find your way back eventually? * Looking back, was the move worth it for you — personally, professionally, and financially? * What would you genuinely tell someone in Nepal who is earning decently in IT and is thinking of coming to Australia as a student? Should they do it? Should they wait? Should they stay? And what should they prepare for? * How did this move impact your mental health? Did you feel lost, homesick, or confused about your career at any point? * What was the biggest shock you faced after coming here? (job market, rent, workload, lack of time, loneliness, culture, etc.) * Do you feel you’ve grown as a person after moving — or do you feel stuck? * If you could talk to your “old self” back in Nepal before coming, what advice would you give?",

Mahavairocana tantra -7th/8th century. One of the foundational texts of esoteric buddhism. Here Ganesha appears as Vinayaka, often portrayed as an obstacle creating diety sub dued by the buddha's mantra. Yet once pacified. He becomes a protector.  Kanguyar - the tibetan buddhism canon, preserves several tantric texts where Ganapati is invoked. Toh 666, Toh 665 heart of mantra appears here.  Sadhanmala -a vast collection of tantric sadhanas compiled between 10th to 11th centuries include detailed rituals of Maha rakta Ganapati and other ganesha forms. These practice invoke Ganesha as a wealth bestowing and obstacle clearing diety.  In buddhism, the ganapati hridaya sutra also known as the arya maha ganapati hridaya dharani, is a sacred mantra given by shakyamuni buddha to his desciple Ananda.  Mostly Ganesha is seen in Tibetan and Vajryan with more than 4 hands.  All the buddhist countries as Japan, Thailand , indonesia (former), China see elephant head diety as buddhist god.  Ganesha images in China occur between 6th to 7th century.  Lets see where Ganesha appears in Brahmin religion (hindu).  Rigveda - 1464AD is the oldest surviving manuscripts (30 pages or folios of birch bark) submitted by Indian Governmet to UNESCO.  Ganesha does not appear in it.  And in later rigveda version also, Ganesha vagueley appears. In short, hindu Ganesha does not exist.  They may claim Veda is million years old, but we must stick with history not theories.  Ganesha Purana - 13 to 17 th century. It explains the story of Ganesha.  However , it seems the ganesha cult started form 9th/11th century.|||“Kaaaaa yesto Kura gareko hera,   Yo tah hamro Saan ani dharma ho ni ,  Hami ajhai every tourist destination ma religious sites banau parcha ,  Nepal and its natural beauty jawos Kholai khola .tyo ek dui Jana tourist naayera k huncha Hami Lai.”|||Desh tikekai India ra Indian tourists le ho ta saathi.

Most of the tourists that these places receive are mostly internal tourist, which is Nepalese, and majority of Indians, and buddhist. These places aren't attracting any secular tourists as such, plus just because they suddenly declared Nepal is a secular country, doesn't erase it's civilizational history, any western tourist when he thinks of Nepal, the things that comes in his mind are mountains, buddha, temples, monastries and stuffs, that's what they expect.  So, when there is already enough reason, Temples are automatically going to be built.  Plus, we have more and enough evidences that after building temples or statues in such places, the tourism has actually gone up.  So, it makes no sense why you are mad here.  Regarding the shoes, except the main area of Temple, it's wrong to just dictate to open shoes, that's something we all can raise voice.  Regarding Bhajan, that's definitely wrong, no one can just blast any Bhajan in such open place whenever they like it. And, this issue is also solvable.  It's sad that just because of these two issue of shoes and Bhajan, you went on to attack the existence of Mandir and statues themselves without actually understanding the overall context.|||I was there this summer, they never said to take off my shoes and there wasn't any bhajan and stuff.|||What’s the meaning behind this is Pokhara not Janakpur?|||keta keti haru jun thau pani romanticize garne lul.

These organizations/institutions although have bad reputations, have done some apprecianle deeds too. From volunteering, blood donations, scholarship schemes etc. For eg. UML's student union was the first one to reach to Kalapani and put Nepal's flag on the land.   What we're doing is just bashing them on the internet with mostly baseless accusations.

I wanted to take a moment to share something from the heart, especially for the Gen Z community here. I’m not here to lecture, judge, or pretend that I “know better.” In fact, it’s the opposite—I’m here because I genuinely admire a lot about Gen Z, and I’d love to learn from you if you’re open to talking or sharing your perspectives.  What I really respect about your generation is the honesty. The courage to say things out loud that older generations kept buried. The way you call out what doesn’t feel right, whether it’s in society, culture, work, or even in yourselves. The world is changing fast, and you all seem to face it with a unique blend of humor, vulnerability, and resilience. And honestly, that’s inspiring.  I’m not perfect, and I don’t pretend to fully understand everything about today’s trends, language, mindset, or struggles. But I’m here with an open mind. If any Gen Z member is willing to talk—to enlighten me, challenge me, laugh with me, or even correct me—I’d sincerely appreciate it.  I’m reaching out with respect and humility. I’m here to listen, not impose. Thank you to anyone who takes a moment to respond. 🙏🏽|||yesto sanskar vaka le kasto desh banauxan hola?

I’m truly grateful. Recently during an interview, I shared my personal political standpoint. I mentioned that I do not personally recognize K.P. Oli as a leader whose ideology I align with. I say this not out of disrespect, but from a place of accountability and responsibility toward our nation. After the recent Gen Z protests, I believe many of us expected honest conversations, acknowledgment of public concerns, and accountability for the injustices that occurred under his administration where many lives were lost. When leadership is unable to take responsibility for such serious matters, it becomes difficult for me to support or follow their ideology. My intention is not to attack individuals, but to stand for truth, transparency, and a future where leaders are answerable to the people. I believe Nepal deserves leadership that listens, learns, and upholds justice for every citizen. Thank you once again to everyone who resonated with my thoughts. Let’s continue pushing for a better and more responsible political culture together.|||So many Incel chicks in comment, are we even safe?|||Nepal is literally full of chutiyas like these, logic fact kei chaina 😂 .

            "body": "I swear, the more I watch Miraj Dhungana’s actions after the Gen-Z protests, the more pissed off I get. This guy went from saying “I’m not the leader, this is a collective movement” to suddenly announcing a whole political party under the Garikhana Deu banner like it’s some kind of personal promotion. Do you even realize how ridiculous that looks? We were told this movement was leaderless, built on the frustration of an entire generation, and now the SAME person who said he wasn’t leading anything is stepping into politics like he’s been preparing the whole time. It feels like the movement’s energy was used as a ladder.  And don’t even get me started on the way he handled the October 9 protest confusion. When young people were panicking, waiting for clarity, ready to go to the streets again because the country is literally suffocating under corruption, what does he do? He steps back. He shrugs it off and says Gen-Z wasn’t involved. Bro, if you’re going to speak for the movement when it’s convenient, then show up when shit gets chaotic too. That’s literally what leadership is. Instead, he pops up when the cameras are rolling and disappears the moment things get risky. That kind of pick-and-choose activism makes me angry because that’s exactly the political behavior we protested against.  Then there’s the whole “our office was attacked” episode. He went public with it, made it sound serious, and then the police said there was no official complaint, and everything was calm when they arrived. What are we supposed to believe? Either be transparent or don’t dramatize it. People actually suffered during these protests. People bled. People DIED. And watching someone drag the movement into half-explained drama with zero clarity is honestly insulting.  What makes me the most furious is how he keeps talking like he represents the entire generation, giving big speeches about unity, direct elections, overseas voting, and political reform, while his actions keep zig-zagging all over the place. You don’t get to call yourself the voice of Gen-Z while making moves that look inconsistent, self-centered, and convenient. The Gen-Z protests weren’t a TikTok trend. They weren’t a branding opportunity. They were a desperate cry from a generation that’s tired of being silenced and robbed of a future.  Watching someone turn that into a messy political ambition is heartbreaking and infuriating. We didn’t risk our safety so one guy could walk around looking like a “youth politician.” We marched for real change. For accountability. For a country that doesn’t chew its future generation alive. And right now, Miraj feels like he’s drifting so far from the soul of that movement that it’s honestly painful.  If he actually wants to stand for Gen-Z, then he needs to stop playing this half-activist, half-politician game and show some damn consistency, clarity, and courage because right now, all I’m seeing is another person using the movement’s energy to put himself in the spotlight.  Anyone else feel like this? Because I’m seriously done pretending this is okay.    And here are the straight-up questions people genuinely have for him:  Who is funding your movement, your events, and now this new political party?  Why did you claim there was “no leader” during the protests but suddenly step into a political role afterward?  When exactly did you decide to form a party during the protests or after?  If you didn’t intend to be a leader, why are you acting like one now?  Why do you vanish or disengage whenever things get tense, unclear, or dangerous?  Why was the October 9 situation handled so confusingly by you?  Why talk about an attack on your office but file no clear, formal police complaint?  Who keeps you accountable? Who checks your decisions?  What gives you the right to speak on behalf of an entire generation?  Are you building a movement or building a personal political brand?",

He's been doing 'media' stuff like making videos and shit from a while ago but he hasn't been 'in the streets' as a kid and it shows. Call me backwards or whatever but if you never got into fights as a kid, or even as a teenager, you don't have that 'bite'. That's him. That softness combined with good looks and branding made him the perfect mascot for non-violent 'gen-z'. He's great as a model but as a ruthless and calculating leader that can lead hundreds of people to bring a certain outcome? Nope.. he's a weak kid inside. Aba ko political events le uslai daro banauna chai sakcha hai in that regard.  He got scared after the sep 8/9 incidents, fearing that his good life could get stripped away from him. He's someone with a lot to lose. His family and relatives probably held him back. Tespachi he probably came back to the front ali pachi with some kind of a plan. Aile chai I just think he's trying to do what he thinks and knows is right - play by the political system's rules. And since we all have severe trauma related to anything 'political party' related, we hate to see it.  Sudan is the opposite of miraj - he's been in the field, has scolded corrupt officials to their face since 2015, has had literal dirt and blood on him. But he's not an eloquent speaker like miraj, he's got 'a look' but the kind of person he has become, branding himself online is not sth he cares about. Whatever he is, is his brand.  In any case, we gotta be careful and discerning and support where needed and criticize where appropriate.

Intentions sahi hola but yinarle anarchy matra badauxan.|||Not a Zenzee and while I appreciate the revolution and all, they have slowly becoming Oli gang. What it demonstrates is the blood we have - thirsty for oneself, power, money, opportunity. I am particularly upset with Sudan Gurung who is hell bent at removing Home Minister and this guy called Miraj Dhungana. I will dismiss Miraj right off the bat because I don't see anything in his eyes and his face. He is a selfish person and anyone who is following him and all should think many times. Sudan Gurung - the guy is hell bent on removing home minister on such a stupid demand that he wants to arrest Oli and Lekhak. What the hell guys ? are you looking for rawanraj? we have laws and we want to enforce it fairly and strictly. Om Prakash is a lawyer and he is not trying to protect Oli or Lekhak - anyone thinks that is such a stupid Zenzee. Do you guys want to arrest someone just on a whim? without gathering sufficient proof? In western countries law enforcement officials spend years if not decades monitoring and gathering evidences against someone they think is culprit - they just don't  arrest someone and investigate - that wouldn't be rule of law. Om Prakash has that schooling. I don't care who Om Prakash is and all but he is definitely a capable guy and has proved it time and again - after all, he is chosen by PM.  Now, are you guys looking to change ministers and government leadership when we only have 4 months to go ? Its such a shame when every so called Zenzee goes to Singhadarbar and disturbs our government's actions. Just think if all the time they spend is meeting you guys.     Now listen to what Mahabir Pun said - please go to your constituencies and help new  political parties that align to your views win - why are you spending so much energies trying to meet the PM ? The Miraj Dhungana is such a scam guy - He is driven by his own ambition, I feel. I did like Sudan but he is also active childish and not a thing in near future.  Whatever everyone says and does listen and watch what Rachha Bam says and does. She is the one who walked out with Army Chief when he seemed to infer democracy was in danger. She is acting with passion and patience. I would recommend everyone to support behind Raswapa, Sagar Dhakal, Baburam, Kulman,  Sumana Shrestha. Sumana is the real deal.     Now if you believe in democracy and free and fair election, support Rabi. How can a person so beloved by people can be in jail without having an opportunity to go to people? is democracy is for the people and by the people?     I recommend please read. Watch what Swarmin Wagle said few days that Deuba was Zenzee, Oli was Zenzee and every popular leader was zenzee when they started politics. There has been tremendous progress but it was not enough. Just because you feel young and under 25 doesn't mean its your government and can do anything. Nope - no way until we have rule of law.     Now this government gotta focus on election and it has to happen. When I hear Miraj and Sudan that say it can't happen in current condition are not only naïve but foolish. They gotta go read what democracy is. Nothing happens without people's mandate which is vote.     And don't forget its not you guys who brought this change - it was a coincidence.  Someone else did on 24th so you really shouldn't overwhelmingly take any credit, especially Miraj who didn't even take part in the protest ! Hope it helps.|||Ani aaja bholi singa durbar bhitra baseka haru protocol follow garera aako hun ta ??|||miraj and party >>>>> yemale and other similar parties|||Yea the protest was headless/leaderless but we need people to lead you can't complain he gained from this protest of course he did and we want a capable leader to run office not military the argument that he was not in the protest is stupid this is exactly why we failed as national because we put fighters as leaders they can be leaders while fighting but in office we need people who lead office not mobs and arms   Not taking his side but this was a common argument against him and I disagree so this ... Btw I don't know why they want directly elected pm within 6 months like bring 2/3 majority and do what you want their ego will delay the election effectively pushing the country years backwards focus on NOTA and NRN voting rights and different policy and development plan for future|||All this shit is happening coz there was no leader during gen z protests. They did not achieve anything despite such massive movement except toppling Government.   Miraj Dhungana came into realization. An organised group is must to move forward. The most important thing a leader should have is a clean image and clear vision. The maturity he has shown not being political figure is admirable.   One of the good thing coming out of Gen Z movement is the youth having interest on politics and stepping forward to be incharge.  We should not discourage them, in the same time help them by giving healthy and constructive criticisms.|||आज उनीहरूले गरेको माग केपी र लेखक लाई सजाए को दायरा मा ल्याउनुपर्छ भन्ने विषयमा थियो। सायद त्यो माग राख्नु गलत भयो होला है।|||Yo sub pani flip bhaira hunxa harek bela.

Watch khan academy for general concepts. Use Perplexity AI or something like that for personal guidance. I got away with a 3.8+ GPA with only these resources. Perplexity really helped me understand the topics I was really struggling with. Also take full advantage of your school library. I used different books to get my concepts clear. For example: Use Fundamental Physics by Resnick and Halliday to understand the concepts in Physics, Thomas calculus for calculus, also most of the math is covered in BC Bajracharya's Basic of Mathematics.

            "body": "Hello! Myself (20M), along with two of my friends and our families, visited Nepal during the Diwali holidays. We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8. Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)

(For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".  During off season, it's easily manageable & fun because less people & no need to queue to get a selfie with some peculiar rock or a waterfall, butttttt, it's called off season for a reason, the majestic views might be compromised or not, it's a gamble.|||Dhulikhel rock view point, man why would they take you there! 🤦  Are you speaking 'Bangla'?|||Bhaktapur is the jewel 🙏|||kudos to camera work- given the health condition of your mum- i recommend you sepnd more time in chitwan- janakpur and lumbini-- may be 3 days each city- it covers pilgrimage and cultural aspect-|||Others have already suggested you some places to visit, so I just want to give you one important piece of advice. I have a relative who works as a travel agent, and he told me that many agents and shopkeepers tend to focus more on foreign tourists than on Indians, because they believe they can overcharge them easily. So, bro, be careful  there are many thugs and dishonest agents who might try to charge you extra. **Bargaining is the key.**  In almost every corner, if a hotel recommends you a place or a service, remember that the hotel usually gets a commission from it. The entire system in tourist areas like Thamel often runs on commission-based deals. So it’s always better to ask genuine locals for suggestions rather than agents pretending to be locals. In Thamel, you’ll find many such people who act friendly but are just trying to make money off tourists.  If you have Nepali friends, you can travel cheaply and safely otherwise, just be a bit cautious and smart while dealing with people. To be honest, a few uneducated people here may dislike Indian tourists, and that’s an unfortunate reality. But overall, we Nepalese are known to be **very hospitable, kind, and friendly**, and most people will treat you with respect and warmth. Just stay alert, bargain wisely, and you’ll have a wonderful time in Nepal.|||Bro, timi Darjeeling bata vayae taa, yo sabai Normal hola ni taa timro laagi taa?? 🤔|||where did u take that video bro? was it in pokhara?|||You skipped Bandipur en route Pokhara from Kathmandu.

So stunning!|||Kudos for well organized post. Go to Mustang, you can reserve scorpio or take your own vehicle. It will be worth it since you are mesmerised by Sarangkot.  Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||Have a great time here, enjoy it and after you go back to your home just think is it fair to take land of the country who provided you with such great hospitality?|||[deleted]",

Same civilization, same geography same economy. A border got created a few hundred years back doesn't make us special, if anything this attitude is the problem.  In winter the cold air keeps pollution trapped, neither blowing away nor washing down. Everything contributes here - India contributes according to its size and population, and so does Nepal. We can't even manage the few thousands of vehicles we have in Nepal. If we could at least stop the black smoke gushing from exhausts in Kathmandu maybe we could act noble, but we can't even do that due to corruption. So with what moral superiority can we look down on the chaos in India? We could act superior if we weren't dependent on the same polluting industries and agriculture of India. We depend without limits upon food grains, vegetables, medicines, fuel, vehicles, appliances that same polluting India creates. Just because your mom or wife is in a smoky kitchen doesn't mean you can act smug and call them polluters while you are still eating the food they cooked.  So chill, we \"South Asians\" are just starting to develop, delayed due to our colonial past. We got caught in the world population boom due to collective human knowledge growth, but unlike the rest of the world we had richer land and environment that could sustain billions of lives \"year round\".

Awareness 2. Bans, stronger rules 3. Traffic police checks  What has worked and what will work is pricing. Get rid of rules that promote cartelling and let capitalism solve the issue.   If you had the choice to pay 20 rupees more but travel with slightly more comfort, and with a nice seat, maybe 30-40% of people would be willing to pay, which in result means more businesses willing to invest in public transport as they seek profit, more competition, better services. Those who offer neither good service nor good pricing then deserve go out of business.  This weird government backed cartelling with fixed artifical prices will never work.|||We should implement a metro-style system for local transport in Kathmandu. Currently many buses operate within the ring road but cannot travel beyond it due to narrow and congested lanes. Even when they do it only results in traffic jams.  What if we introduced autos in the valley that follow the same routes as local transport and carry 3–4 passengers per ride? Buses and vans could be restricted to the ring road and every bus stop along the ring road could have designated autos and rickshaws to drop passengers to their destinations at the same fare.  If implemented all the microbuses and hiaces could be replaced with standard buses which would likely cause less congestion than the current smaller vehicles.|||The metropolitan and the yatayat syndicate are the problems. There should be a limit on the number of passengers each vehicle can carry. For large buses, it should not be more than 110% of the number of seats. And for microbuses, it should not be more than 100% of the seating capacity. The limit rule should be enforced by the traffic police.

I'm no expert but I  do come with a few facts . The actual knowledge I feel like I know it better than anyone here. Not bragging .  So take it as a means of education. I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it. Capitalism and communism don't antagonises each other. They coexist in a healthy modern economy.|||Ask a regular min wage worker in the US if capitalism is working for them.

            "heading": "A Night in Kathmandu — The Unexpected Bar Scam Experience",
            "body": "After completing our last destination in Kathmandu, our Nepal trip was almost coming to an end. We had planned to spend the evening shopping around local markets before heading back home.  But as luck would have it, the weather had other plans. It started raining heavily, and most of us decided to cancel the shopping plan and stay inside the bus, waiting for the rain to stop.  While we were sitting there, a Nepali guy — sort of an agent — climbed onto the bus. He started chatting with my friend, talking about dance bars, attractive girls, and fun nightlife in Kathmandu. My friends, curious and excited to explore something different, agreed to check it out. So, we went along with him from Gaushala Chowk.  ⸻  The Arrival  We reached around 7 PM. The place looked more like a small pub or lounge — dim lights, loud music, and barely anyone inside. There were just two Indian guys with a few Nepali girls, sitting at a corner table, smoking hukka and drinking.  We were a group of 12 people, so we took two tables (6 on each). I sat on the other table, while two Nepali girls from the bar joined my friends’ table. They were friendly, laughing, and talking in Hindi — chit chat, masti, jokes — sab Hindi mein.  After a few minutes, the girls said they wanted to have a drink. The same agent who brought us there told my friend, “Sir, bas 400 Rs ka juice hai.” They wrote the order on a small paper chit, took my friend’s signature, and soon two juices were served.  That’s how their system worked — write on paper, take a sign, and serve the order.  We also ordered 4 beers for ourselves. Out of 12, only 4 were drinking — the rest were just watching the dance show.  ⸻  The Show Begins  Soon, Nepali girls started dancing on Hindi songs, followed by a couple of male dancers and another girl joining the floor. The vibe felt okay at first — typical dance bar scene, music, lights, drinks.  But after the girls finished their drinks, a waiter brought a hukka pot to our table without even asking. We immediately told him to take it away. The girls got off from our table soon after that.  ⸻  Something Felt Off  After finishing the beer, me and my friend went to the washroom. There we saw those same two Indian guys who were sitting earlier — looked like North Indians (maybe Delhi or Haryana). They seemed tense, arguing with the bar staff.  Out of curiosity, I asked one of them, “Bhai kya hua?” He said, “Dekho na bhai, kuch khaya nahi, thoda piya sirf — aur bill 32,000 Nepali bana diya!”  That one line was enough to send chills down my spine.  I quickly went back to my table and told my friend what had happened. We immediately asked for our bill — but the damage was already done.  ⸻  The Shocking Bill  The bill came in Nepali currency: \t•\t4 Beers = 4000 \t•\t2 Drinks for girls = 8000 \t•\t23% Service charge = 2760 Total = 14,760 NRS (≈ 9,840 INR)  My friend was shocked. He said, “Ladies drink price to 400 bola tha,” but by then, the agent who brought us there had vanished.  There was no point arguing — the staff was large in number, and the situation didn’t look safe. Finally, we settled the bill for 9,500 INR and left the place quietly.  ⸻  What Happened Next  As we were leaving, I noticed those two Indian guys being locked in a small office, surrounded by bar staff demanding they hand over their mobiles or belongings to pay off the bill.  I felt genuinely bad for them — and guilty for not sitting at my friend’s table earlier, or checking the price list before signing that paper chit.  But at the same time, I was thankful that we escaped early — with just a 4-beer loss instead of a full-blown scam.  ⸻  The Reality Behind the Glamour  While we were stepping out, a few more Nepali guys entered, and immediately all the bar girls — including those who had been at our table — went to join them, smoking hukka and ordering drinks.  Just watching that, I could only think: “Isko to aaj 40,000–50,000 ka chuna lagne wala hai.”  ⸻  Final Thoughts  Our Nepal trip overall was beautiful — from Pokhara’s serenity to the spiritual vibe of Pashupatinath. But this one Kathmandu nightlife experience was a reminder that not everything that glitters is gold.  If you ever plan to explore nightlife in Kathmandu, be cautious: \t•\tNever sign anything you don’t understand. \t•\tAlways ask for the price upfront. \t•\tAnd if something feels shady — walk away.  This experience became a story to remember — not for the fun, but for the lesson it taught us.",

We cooked together, washed the dishes, gossiped a lot, and I came home with a full heart.  Then at the dinner table, my parents asked what caste she is. I told them… and they immediately started talking about caste differences and how I shouldn’t visit her house for meals, and how she shouldn’t come to ours. Hearing them talk about her caste that way absolutely broke my heart. I couldn’t control my tears, and my mom said, “kina yesto chitta dukhako. Pitri farak farak hunxa, manxe yeutai matra vayerw hunna. Hamlai ni aaru le yesto garxan, hamle ni garnu parxa. Paxi tha pauxau, etc etc.”  We never had serious caste conversations before.

Our parents grew up in a time where extreme casteism was normal. They didn’t create it, but they were raised inside that system, taught to follow it, and warned about the consequences of not doing so. Education shapes the mind, and the education they received reinforced these beliefs regardless of religion, culture, or society. So they’re not entirely wrong, and we’re not entirely right either.  The real problem is that we often fail to understand the environment they grew up in and the fears they carried. Instead of trying to see their side, we sometimes blame them or play the victim because it’s the easier option. But change takes understanding from both generations—not just criticism. 🙏|||This will just go with this generation or maybe next or next but you just forget what they said and forget about the cast system as well and just focus on people's behavior and if nobody talks about it next generation is not even going to know such a thing and it will just go away. But if we keep saying we're all equal frequently children are going to think they are saying this because  we're all not equal. Indirectly they'll learn that cast is a big deal. that's my point of view. And forget my English as well ☺|||This is really heartbreaking. It’s painful when people who taught us about equality show a different side. Caste ideas came through shared history and influence from India, but we don’t have to carry them forward. Gen Z has a real chance to change this for our friendships, love, and human connection matter more than labels. What you shared with your friend is so real and nothing can take that away.|||Reasons like this is why I have decided to stop living in this country at all, caste difference bhanxan,  ximeki le naramro najar le herxan bhanxan, I'm tired of this.|||Depends on society, hami baun bhayeni, hamro gau ko aguwa haru chai singh (bishwokarma) ho, so they frequently come to our home khana khana, hamro aunty ko shraddhama pani aru lower cast ko manche haru bolayera involve garunu bhayeko thiyo.

He was waiting for RSP meeting held in chitwan of central committee and when it was certain that none of them wants him as a president before Rabi either gets convicted of charges from court or finish his two tenure if not found guilty, then why won’t he accept any other role? Rabi and other made the RSP  from dust and he wants a free dinner with zero contribution. I cannot see any other reason other then his aim to bring destabilization in party and finally end this party as Ganesh kakrki revealed that in one recent interviews which also aligns with Balen too plans.  Why they desperately wants to end RSP just like congress and yemale has been trying so far?? Everyone is demanding to form coalition between RSP, Kulman and Balen to get more seats and can justice be given to family of martyrs. Why they are putting their ego first before country interest ??  All this theatrics indicates that kulamn could be still pawn on hand of prachanda and Balen either being manipulated by his close allys or fucking moron that cannot either embrace crowd, face press , or make decisions.

Is this confirmed or just rumors?|||Balen le party banaucha vanera kasle vanyo?|||It is hard for people to believe, but Kulman is corrupt, albeit, not on the level of old goons. His work is visible, but he is corrupt.  Balen is the only person whom I can say with confidence is not corrupt, yet. But he is no politician, and I don't think he will ever be. It is also very hard for him to open party with individual who is not involved in any scandal, and keep his non-corrupt image intact.  Rabi has his own problems. However, he is the only person at the moment who is a politician, and not involved with old goons. Only his party could have defeated the old goons, but since he is in jail, RSP will not get majority seats this time.  So, the new alternative forces combined will still not have majority in present scenario. Only way the alternative forces can have majority is if Balen and Kulman would have join RSP with Rabi still as head of RSP. But this scenario was simply not possible from start. Balen cannot associate himself with people with scandals, and Kulman is not really an alternative force, but rather the produce of the old goons who is not as bad as the old goons.|||Chup machikney tyo purano vanda yei thiq , reddit ma aayera na vuk|||One thing I will suggest if new party is contesting In some constituency just don't contest in that area.

Another thing CK raut did the worst mistake by completely showcasing the madesh separation thing. The thing is he would have ideal for collation to collaborate in madesh election.

Unlike traditional parties, anyone with potentiality can join and compete in elections.  If Rabi Lamichane had wanted, he could have pushed Kulman Ghising as face of RSP for PM. Rabi didn't have to handover chairman. As he is in jail. He cannot run the country anyway.  There are others beside Rabi, who are aiming for PM in absence of Rabi. That's why the discussion failed. Don't blame on Kulman Ghising.  Kulman Ghising is the only person, that knows bureaucracy from core. He knows where to tweak and break. They can't fool him. He is needed for country.

Then, they must give up their ego.|||You can read the indepth article to find out how Sumana and the gang along with Balen and Kulman tried to oust Rabi from his own party. https://www.nepalpress.com/2025/11/03/656615/|||There's no any alternative to Congress and UML.

I guarantee you that hard work and a spiritual mindset will give you both financial success and internal happiness.  But actually doing that is on you and has near zero to do with where you are born, what your politicians are doing, etc.  Good luck to you.|||Nepal got screwed by its geography and demographics. I don’t think it has much of a future for success. It’s a small landlocked country with no natural resources and tough terrain, which makes it hard to build large cities and slows down trade. It’s stuck between two superpowers, India and China, thus its politics will never be free from their influence.

If everyone thought like u , we r done so every citizen's thought matter to his/her country's welfare.|||Y'all all talking about \"hard work\" as if that's the only thing that differentiates developed nations from developing ones. What about taking advantage of your own resources? What about planning your economy in order to take advantage of global supply chains?   We never did that because our system is one that benefits other countries like India and the USA and China. We won't develop because developing would mean we need to care about our own interests and distance ourselves from other countries.   Neo-liberal capitalism won't bring us forward, only socialism will. The only hope a small nation like ours has to develop is if ALL resources our country has (hydro, minerals, tourism) is exploited FULLY for OUR benefits. Only then will we actually develop. We need to fully control private businesses centrally, develop 5 year plans like China to take advantage of the global trade market and allow foreign companies to manufacture inside of Nepal.   Once they start production, we learn how to produce our own products by looking at how they produce and then we can upgrade from a resource exporting country to a manufacturing economy.   This won't take \"hard work\" but a restructure of our system to benefit national interests|||English chai testo ramro raina cha|||ok but who asked?",

After plugging in the charger, the laptop didn’t respond at all for hours.  Assuming the charger was faulty, I took it to the Mudita service center. Later, they informed me that the **motherboard was damaged (“shot”)** and needed to be replaced, costing **about 60% of the laptop’s original price**. To make things worse, the laptop had just exceeded its 12 month warranty by around one month, so they refused to cover the repair under warranty.  It feels extremely strange and concerning that a motherboard or CPU would get damaged simply while charging normally. If there had been a high-voltage surge, then **all devices connected at the same time should have been affected**, including my colleagues’ laptops and chargers — but none of them faced any issue.  For a device to fail like this right after warranty expiry raises doubts about **product durability and quality assurance**. Very disappointed with this experience.",

Confident xaina vanya you can take it to repair store.|||ashambhav|||If the laptop can be upgraded to an SSD, it will improve the boot time and make it somewhat faster. After that, you might consider upgrading the RAM. However, some older laptops have limits on how much RAM they support. For example, my old Sony Vaio can handle up to 8GB, while an older Dell model only supports a maximum of 4GB. You can easily check online by searching your laptop model to find out if it supports SSD upgrades and the maximum RAM capacity.  Also note that in Nepal the shop are asking upward of 2-3,000 NPR for each 4gb RAM module, claiming a 6-month warranty.   Since my brother studies in India, he managed to get me an 4/4gb - total of 8GB RAM for a much cheaper price, around 249 INR.   Best of luck|||firstly that laptop looks ancient. and youre running windows. you can optimize windows to run faster on low end devices but its still windows, its shit. adding RAM will help. you will soon find out that you have a lot of processes running in the background (coz windows) and will cause you problems during multi process workloads. if youre up for it install a linux mint or ubuntu. get some more RAM and if your laptop supports it an SSD|||buy a ssd 128 gb, insert 4 gb ram. that will be the cheapest way to make laptop faster.|||Let your laptop rest in peace.|||go Linux.

            "body": "As an Computer Engineering/IT graduate in Nepal, there are various pathways.  Option A) You stay in Nepal  Option B) You move abroad   Let's discuss about Option A first.  There are two realistic pathways you could take if you stayed in Nepal.  - work at private  - work at government   I have tried working at private. But the amount of discrimination being done in private companies really blew me up. As someone who was also preparing for government jobs, I had noticed lots of underprivileged folks participating in government jobs exam(for computer engineer as well). I used to ponder what made them do this since this is not a very lucrative job compared to what a \"certain community\" person makes at private or \"certain community\" person grows at private job. But later realized that private companies are not interested to hire these \"underprivileged\" folks.   Lots of people might argue (although they know it is not true) private jobs hire on merit. No they do not do so in Nepal. It is completely based off connections. It does not matter your knowledge. It is about who you know 100%. I am not ignorant that this might be the case outside, but I swear to god everyday, esto garera USA ma jasto innovative companies cha tyo ta pakkai hudainthyo..   The reason for such favoritism is mainly because the work they do is so shit. Leaving few companies who developer softwares that Nepalese use on daily basis(Not ludo), other jobs are not very interesting to do either. It is the same low quality menial job with meagre pay.   The companies who have a business are handful already. Investor ko money burn garne jasto nepal ma kei hudaina as there are no investors. So you see these bitchy ass companies hiring full stack developer every day for the salary of an intern.     I could not really be bothered with working under someone and taking all nonsense blames for 30,000 per month on hand. With no future and no growth and dismissing my self esteem. My aviman is and was huge.   The second pathway is to work at government corporations. I looked at the salary of computer engineer at Nepal Army, Nijamati and it is decent. But the upwards mobility is just not there. What I mean by that is salary is not growing when you grow your experience. Aba ta government employee specially nijamati lai dekhne bittikai yo bhrastachari raicha bhanne lagcha. Kinaki bhrastachar nagari ta khana basnai napugne. Pradhan Sena Pati ko talab cha 67000. Social security benefits cha good and all but cash in hand ni aileko market rate anusar ta dinu paryo ni. 67000 ma kam garne pradhansenapati le ghus nakhaye k garera palne? lol.  I looked at corporations salary. And it seems that if you manage to get a handle at a corporation(Sansthans), you can make be sure to make average of 60-70 thousands per month even as a 6th level officer. At this point of my career, this seems fair enough. But it will not be enough after 5 years, if my increment is just 1 thousand per year.    A huge reform is required in government services. Government services (specially nijamati) are the core to how people feel about the government. If we cannot make it attractive and lucrative, it does not matter how rich we are saving on their salary.  Next option is moving abroad.  Aba ko market ma abroad ma PR paune/GC paune biswas ta chaina. Unless you do the jobs that Americans do not want to do (or foreigners) like teaching for 60k/year, nursing old people etc.  15 years bidesh ma basna jane. Kam garne and coming back to Nepal. It seems the most plausible way forward. Nepal ma ayepachi k garne bhanne hunasakcha however.  The countries in option to stay for so long are Japan, India. Do not want to surrender my passport to Dubai sheikh. Also middle east is terror and war prone so do not want to end up there.   Europe tira padna gaye matra ho. It seems bleak for immigrants nowadays. And I do not think they earn that much in Europe (for someone planning to return back to Nepal and not stay there). Teta nabasne bhayepachi social security ko teti matlab bhayena.   How about USA? USA seems fine and all. but I do not think getting a work permit after Masters degree is going to be easy. Or that you are going to make big bucks and save big bucks as an immigrant in this economy. Since PR/GC is not guaranteed, you are basically playing a zero sum game. The experience that you get in abroad and education bla bla is huge investment however.",

I took the same course purely out of passion, but I only landed better jobs because of my creativity,not because of a certificate. None of the companies I’ve worked with ever asked about my educational title; only some uncreative Nepali companies did, and they couldn’t even afford my salary.  My 6 years of experience have taught me a lot. I’ve worked with foreign clients, accepted low pay in the beginning just to learn more, and over time those skills paid off. I was even offered a position at a major tech company in Nepal, but I chose to join an AI company with a bigger vision and at double the salary.  The motto “Think Different” truly matters but listen it took me 6 years of constant sacrifices just to Learn not to Earn.|||Yesko matra valeu ta chhaina tara you got solid skills and projects then has valeu|||You need a showreel and that certificate won't get you much.|||3D kun software ma garayo, ani compositing ?|||Oh I have one too.

That's what it is supposed to do. Now make a portfolio. Having both cert + portfolio is good.

            "body": "Hi everyone👋 I’m 23, living in Nepal, only a high-school degree, and I’m broke (only have 100 dollars in savings rn). I want to build a real career in IT so I can eventually work remotely or move abroad. I want something realistic that I can learn in about a year and turn into a stable, good-paying job.  Honestly, I’m not interested in freelancing or full-stack because (personally) it feels oversaturated and too creative (for each project) and portfolio-heavy, but I’m still open if I’m wrong. I don’t wanna sound picky, and desperate, like “I only want X, not Y.” Please don't get me wrong. I'm willing to learn and work. I’m flexible - I just want something that's worth my time and effort.  I’m looking for an IT path that:  • isn’t super saturated   • is easier for beginners   • hires freshers from Nepal (South Asia)   • has a stable monthly salary (4 digits)   • has a clear roadmap   • doesn’t require a uni degree   • reliable - won’t be replaced by AI soon   • can help me find jobs abroad  If you were in my shoes - 23, broke, no degree, living in Nepal, trying to break into tech in 2025/2026 - what would you realistically choose?  I’m open to anything: front-end, app dev, full stack, IT support, cloud, DevOps, QA, cybersecurity, networking, data, MySQL - anything that actually works for someone starting with almost nothing. Coz, I don't wanna end up being homeless. Seriously, I am so sick of my current lifestyle, I wanna make a change and take some right action that will lead me to my goal. I literally don't care if it's hard or impossible, coz now it's a necessity.. I am ready to sacrifice my time. I wanna invest in myself (my skills).  So, please, I need your help to choose the right direction.  I’d really appreciate any honest suggestions, roadmaps, or personal stories from people who started in a similar place.  Thanks a lot.",

            "comments": "timle vaneko anusar networking best hola. ccna chai garnu paryo. paxi bistarai ccnp gare vayo|||f I were 23, broke, living in Nepal, and trying to start an IT career without a degree, I would choose one of three realistic paths: QA testing, IT support, or cybersecurity. QA is the easiest and fastest way to get a job because it’s not too saturated, Nepal hires many freshers, and you don’t need a portfolio or degree. IT support is the most stable long-term option because it’s beginner friendly, companies always need support staff, and it naturally leads to higher-paying roles like SysAdmin or Cloud Engineer. Cybersecurity is the most future-proof, global, and high-demand field, but it requires more effort in the first few months.  Things like frontend, full-stack, and freelancing are not the best starting point when you’re broke and need stability fast; they take longer and require portfolios or creativity. A simple one-year plan would look like this: for QA, learn manual testing first, then SQL/API testing, and later basic automation. For IT support, learn computer basics, networking, and ticketing tools, then move towards cloud platforms. For cybersecurity, start with networking and Linux, then learn security basics and practice SOC labs.  If you want something fast, choose QA. If you want something stable and practical, go for IT support. If you want long-term growth and international opportunities, choose cybersecurity. Any of these three can realistically change your life within a year if you stay focused|||You’re only 23, so you have time on your side. While I understand you want quick results, consider exploring online degree programs. Many are flexible and work-friendly. A degree can make a huge difference when applying for jobs abroad and competing for better positions - it might be worth the investment alongside building your skills. 🙂🙂|||If I were you, I’d start with IT support → networking → cloud. It’s cheap to learn, beginner-friendly, hires freshers in South Asia, and leads to real stable jobs. Once you get basic support skills, aim for CCNA, then AWS. It’s the most realistic path to a solid career without a degree.|||look for QA, devrel, dev advocate, project manager, sre/devops etc. what's the tech skill that u already know? |||Garo nai cha aile ko situation ma ta.

But looking at the situation of my friends and even myself when i was jobless for a while earlier, i wouldn't recommend staying here after +2.   Answering your other questions.. (In my POV)   Fees: private colleges ko 10 - 20 lakhs xa fees mostly. Aba scholarships paye sasto hola ig.   Quality: ja padhe ni mostly basics nai ho. Job lai chahine skills, experience / internships, self learning le matra badhxa.   Job opportunities: xa tara thorai xa and competition dherai with respect to opportunities.   Salary: depends. Ramro company mah ramrai xa. aru mah normally bare minimum bata nai suru bhairaxa. Private mah time mah nauune, increment nahune chai dherai suninxa and bhogya ni xu. Yo answer garho xa. All depends on your skills, YOE, job, company etc. Dherai factors hunxa.   Part time jobs: koi chinya manxey bata pasal, dept stores, basic accounting, part time paid intern or delivery, pathao, Indrive matra dimag mah auuxa. Ani studies nai garho xa.. exams and all bhane ta yo sangai garnu is too hectic.   Paying off debts: aba kati hunxa tesmah depends. Sakesamma linai hunna bhanxu cause slow poison jastai ho most cases mah. Tara aba linai pareko case mah tirna sakinxa but exceptional bhayera kamauna sakna parxa.   Aba sab uncertain kura haru ho.. sab ko aafno affno mehnat / bhagya anusar lekhya hunxa. So j garxau 100% deu. Ramrai hunxa. Best of luck.|||6 years since +2.

Traveled to two countries for free via a BIG COMPANY, Won so many tech competitions and made a good name in the tech community. I joined a fortune 500 company's student program and did so much for others in the community and not to mention that I made some good money too from tech clients.

I think its a huge mistake personally. I know there are many people who have done great in their lives. but I feel like (in the context of Japan) its a huge mistake to move after +2 because the cultural and language barrier is so high that even people with masters degree are working in convenient stores and other low paying jobs that need no academics. after +2 you just are so young and confused that you don't even know what you want in life and what are your options. at least after Bachelor's I'd guess you get what you should expect from life in general. also after Bachelor's its far easier to apply and get approved as opposed to after +2. also Bachelor's is very cheap compared to bidesh. Leaving the country as a teenager and growing up throughout my early 20s in bides has had me plant a doubt of growth in me. i feel like i have wasted my potential in Japan. I did 2 years of language and 4 years of graphic design and am currently studying 3d designing (1st year) as soon as i complete my study i wanna try and leave this country for good.   but I can also give a reason why you should move. 1. exposure at a young age. you get to experience things for the first time which is a doorway to learn many things about yourself and everything else. you see things that you have never even imagined. different languages and different cultures are important to live outside the bubble and see the world a little differently   2. privacy. in Nepal we have zero privacy. you do get total privacy and you can enjoy your alone time in solitude. this also comes with loneliness so be prepared to live a lonely life for the most part. loneliness also comes with anxiety and depression so try to keep yourself busy and in a circle.   3. life lessons. you start earning and learn to budget your expenses. you realize earning is easy and how much your parents had to sacrifice for you to be where you are. you also start getting very confident because now you are king of your own decisions.  4. You understand where you and your country lacks and how you can improve it. In Nepal there are many areas where change is necessary and if you never see it from others POV you will never know that it needs fixing. for example, i never cooked while i was in Nepal because mom did it all the time. but after coming here i have learned to cook some good food and also learned communication skills because of my work. also you see what exactly is not good in nepal and get the idea how you can fix it. for example lines in hospitals and other businesses like ward offices and banks. this can easily be fixed with a simple token and display. also supermarket like bhat bhateni can be improved with better staff training for efficiency  5.You can finally buy the things you couldn't afford as a kid. and you can buy the gifts for your family without having to worry about money so much. the face they make when you hand them the gifts is just priceless.  6. quality of life increases because you learn to keep yourself healthy and hygienic all the time. wearing nice clothes and with better styles uplifts your life by folds.   7. BAD SIDE  : you might also start drinking and smoking very often leading to sickness in the future when you are in your 30s and 40s|||I think it's the personal choice.

            "body": "Hello everyone,  I never thought I’d be writing this again. I wish our situation had gotten better since my last post… but reality has been harsher than I ever imagined.  My father is battling Stage 3 Gall Bladder Cancer, and his treatment at RGCI, Delhi is ongoing. We somehow managed to complete 5 chemo cycles , by selling whatever little we had, taking loans, borrowing from friends and relatives, and emptying every bit of savings. But now, we are completely drained .. emotionally, mentally, and financially.  The doctors say the next few chemo cycles are critical . If we stop now, everything we’ve fought for so far might go in vain. But the treatment cost has now gone beyond ₹20 lakhs, and we have nothing left to continue.  My father is a simple, hardworking man a small farmer and shopkeeper from a middle-class family. He spent his entire life making sure we never felt our struggles,have some good education. Only now do I truly see how much he silently sacrificed for us. I’m still in college, trying to study, trying to stay strong, but watching him in pain and feeling helpless is tearing me apart. i feel cancer is the worst thing you can ever deal with .  I’ve seen my mother cry silently in the corner every night, and my sisters trying to smile despite knowing how close we are to losing everything. I keep telling them we’ll make it that I’ll find a way but right now, I don’t know how much longer we can hold on without help.  In my last post, so many kind souls came forward. I’m truly, deeply grateful — we managed to raise about ₹1.5 lakh, which helped us cover chemotherapy and hospital bills. Every rupee meant the world to us. 🙏  But the journey is far from over. We still need around ₹20 lakhs more to continue his treatment and give him a real chance at life.  If you’re reading this please, help us if you can. Even a small amount, even a share, even a prayer it all counts.   I’m not asking for sympathy; I’m asking for humanity.

Even those who visit India often are treated as if we’re some kind of threat to the country. Sometimes, I feel it’s because of our weak passport and the way they perceive our country.

Bahrut stup - 2300 years old.   Buddha's story is  sculpted in this Stup. Mahamaya (Buddha's mother) is seen protected by Elephant. Another art shows her dreaming an elephant. There is also a story where buddha tamed Mad Elephant. So elephant holds importance in buddhism. You can google it.   As the time fly, scholars began their own narration and interpretation.  Mahavairocana tantra -7th/8th century. One of the foundational texts of esoteric buddhism. Here Ganesha appears as Vinayaka, often portrayed as an obstacle creating diety sub dued by the buddha's mantra. Yet once pacified. He becomes a protector.  Kanguyar - the tibetan buddhism canon, preserves several tantric texts where Ganapati is invoked. Toh 666, Toh 665 heart of mantra appears here.  Sadhanmala -a vast collection of tantric sadhanas compiled between 10th to 11th centuries include detailed rituals of Maha rakta Ganapati and other ganesha forms. These practice invoke Ganesha as a wealth bestowing and obstacle clearing diety.  In buddhism, the ganapati hridaya sutra also known as the arya maha ganapati hridaya dharani, is a sacred mantra given by shakyamuni buddha to his desciple Ananda.  Mostly Ganesha is seen in Tibetan and Vajryan with more than 4 hands.  All the buddhist countries as Japan, Thailand , indonesia (former), China see elephant head diety as buddhist god.  Ganesha images in China occur between 6th to 7th century.  Lets see where Ganesha appears in Brahmin religion (hindu).  Rigveda - 1464AD is the oldest surviving manuscripts (30 pages or folios of birch bark) submitted by Indian Governmet to UNESCO.  Ganesha does not appear in it.  And in later rigveda version also, Ganesha vagueley appears. In short, hindu Ganesha does not exist.  They may claim Veda is million years old, but we must stick with history not theories.  Ganesha Purana - 13 to 17 th century. It explains the story of Ganesha.  However , it seems the ganesha cult started form 9th/11th century.|||“Kaaaaa yesto Kura gareko hera,   Yo tah hamro Saan ani dharma ho ni ,  Hami ajhai every tourist destination ma religious sites banau parcha ,  Nepal and its natural beauty jawos Kholai khola .tyo ek dui Jana tourist naayera k huncha Hami Lai.”|||Desh tikekai India ra Indian tourists le ho ta saathi.

Or even Cambodian people won't, the key dispute between the Thailand and Cambodia is the Priya Bihar Temple of Shiva regarding its ownership. People from swornabhumi will come and that's enough.

Most of the tourists that these places receive are mostly internal tourist, which is Nepalese, and majority of Indians, and buddhist. These places aren't attracting any secular tourists as such, plus just because they suddenly declared Nepal is a secular country, doesn't erase it's civilizational history, any western tourist when he thinks of Nepal, the things that comes in his mind are mountains, buddha, temples, monastries and stuffs, that's what they expect.  So, when there is already enough reason, Temples are automatically going to be built.  Plus, we have more and enough evidences that after building temples or statues in such places, the tourism has actually gone up.  So, it makes no sense why you are mad here.  Regarding the shoes, except the main area of Temple, it's wrong to just dictate to open shoes, that's something we all can raise voice.  Regarding Bhajan, that's definitely wrong, no one can just blast any Bhajan in such open place whenever they like it. And, this issue is also solvable.  It's sad that just because of these two issue of shoes and Bhajan, you went on to attack the existence of Mandir and statues themselves without actually understanding the overall context.|||I was there this summer, they never said to take off my shoes and there wasn't any bhajan and stuff.|||What’s the meaning behind this is Pokhara not Janakpur?|||keta keti haru jun thau pani romanticize garne lul.

How is it possible to afford all of this when the family has nothing except civil service for the past 50 years?  Supriya Bohora, granddaughter of Deepak Bohora, former member of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and the House of Representatives, has recently come under the spotlight. Deepak Bohora was known for his strong hand in the Panchayat system and his unwavering support for the monarchy. His political journey is remembered not only for his allegiance to authoritarian structures but also for allegations of corruption. One of the most prominent accusations linked to Deepak Bohora is the illegal consumption of land where the Fun Park ice rink in Bhadrakali Road now stands. What was once a symbol of political maneuvering and alleged misappropriation of public assets is now being flaunted by his granddaughter as a mark of achievement, raising questions about how the spoils of corruption are normalized across generations.

Actually what these officer do is they heavily launder money and budgets which comes to their department . They practice “milijuli khane” . They also take funds from criminals to manage cases. Then they use these funds to bribe politicians for getting higher post like dsp to dig , from DIG to IG and so on . They conduct massive weddings and ceremonies spending crore of rupees. this is same with army generals as well.  `-`  **TLDR - REGISTER AND CONVINCE YOUR FRIENDS, COUSINS IF THEY STILL HAVE NOT MADE VOTER ID**  Read an interesting blog on this. Hamro lato politician le k bujhla esto. Chorra chorri lai instagram delete garna chai layo dhanna teti chai buddhi raicha.  >The corrupt ruling elites of the Third World, who used to steal everything, destroy economies, and create hell for their own populations, have now added one more thing: they openly allow their children to flaunt the spoils of corruption on Instagram, right in front of their starving people. Something previous generations never witnessed.  >The new rich have never gone through a revolution so they don't understand not to flaunt their wealth like the old bourgeoisie who have witnessed multiple revolutions throughout history. It's ironic that the Maoists instigated a revolution yet the children of said Maoists are now living the luxurious lives posting everything not knowing whats simmering in society. It looks like at least the kids have understood not to flaunt their stolen wealth to avoid angering the masses.  >In any ways what happened in Nepal highlights a trend I’ve discussed on here before, which is how Instagram utterly radicalizes youth heavy developing societies.  >Suddenly you as a poor but striving young man or woman have full visibility to how the elite/upper class of your country + diaspora live, but you have little access or hope of ever living the same for the most part. The impact of this on mental health, societal stability, and also fertility rates cannot be underestimated.  >Imagine going from a society with five state channels and a few cable options in the 2000s to Instagram in just five years. That’s what happened to all of South Asia + Africa + a lot of Latin America.  These guys were being exposed to the lifestyles of the baddie daughters and Chad sons of the fucktards ruling their country,  >You see their trip to Japan and London for the summer. See their parties at their elite mansions in the most posh suburbs and neighborhoods and you realize you’re just fucked and not getting there ever, your country simply does not have the mechanism to enable that for you, you’re unemployed even despite a college degree.  >**Upward mobility is like a pressure valve. Nepal never had that. The elites taxed people, slapped tariffs on imports & ignored building institutions that foster upward mobility. Instead, they assumed that sending their populace to the Middle East would be sufficient.**  >What’s surprising is how the corrupt politicians allow their kids to flaunt stolen wealth so brazenly. Kids of politicians in developing countries flaunting their extravagant lifestyles on public Instagram accounts is so foolhardy. Exposure to social media and bragging about your luxurious lifestyle risks fuelling resentment and envy.  >It's how uprisings have always been. Old bourgeoisie don't show off their wealth like those Nepali elites did. This behavior is what got both the iranian and russian noble families killed. This also happened in Mongolia earlier this year, although less dramatically. The Prime Minister had to step down due to protests that kicked off because his son was showing off his luxury holidays and clothes too much on Instagram.",

Trendy: they're brainwashed, selfish, came for masubhat  Reality: UML has strong foundation and institutions in every sectors, from education to workers, farmers, employees, businesses.   These organizations/institutions although have bad reputations, have done some apprecianle deeds too. From volunteering, blood donations, scholarship schemes etc. For eg. UML's student union was the first one to reach to Kalapani and put Nepal's flag on the land.   What we're doing is just bashing them on the internet with mostly baseless accusations. (Mostly, not all). That's not how you defeat an established and strong organization.

I wanted to take a moment to share something from the heart, especially for the Gen Z community here. I’m not here to lecture, judge, or pretend that I “know better.” In fact, it’s the opposite—I’m here because I genuinely admire a lot about Gen Z, and I’d love to learn from you if you’re open to talking or sharing your perspectives.  What I really respect about your generation is the honesty. The courage to say things out loud that older generations kept buried. The way you call out what doesn’t feel right, whether it’s in society, culture, work, or even in yourselves. The world is changing fast, and you all seem to face it with a unique blend of humor, vulnerability, and resilience. And honestly, that’s inspiring.  I’m not perfect, and I don’t pretend to fully understand everything about today’s trends, language, mindset, or struggles. But I’m here with an open mind. If any Gen Z member is willing to talk—to enlighten me, challenge me, laugh with me, or even correct me—I’d sincerely appreciate it.  I’m reaching out with respect and humility. I’m here to listen, not impose. Thank you to anyone who takes a moment to respond. 🙏🏽|||yesto sanskar vaka le kasto desh banauxan hola?

I’m truly grateful. Recently during an interview, I shared my personal political standpoint. I mentioned that I do not personally recognize K.P. Oli as a leader whose ideology I align with. I say this not out of disrespect, but from a place of accountability and responsibility toward our nation. After the recent Gen Z protests, I believe many of us expected honest conversations, acknowledgment of public concerns, and accountability for the injustices that occurred under his administration where many lives were lost. When leadership is unable to take responsibility for such serious matters, it becomes difficult for me to support or follow their ideology. My intention is not to attack individuals, but to stand for truth, transparency, and a future where leaders are answerable to the people. I believe Nepal deserves leadership that listens, learns, and upholds justice for every citizen. Thank you once again to everyone who resonated with my thoughts. Let’s continue pushing for a better and more responsible political culture together.|||So many Incel chicks in comment, are we even safe?|||Nepal is literally full of chutiyas like these, logic fact kei chaina 😂 .

            "body": "I swear, the more I watch Miraj Dhungana’s actions after the Gen-Z protests, the more pissed off I get. This guy went from saying “I’m not the leader, this is a collective movement” to suddenly announcing a whole political party under the Garikhana Deu banner like it’s some kind of personal promotion. Do you even realize how ridiculous that looks? We were told this movement was leaderless, built on the frustration of an entire generation, and now the SAME person who said he wasn’t leading anything is stepping into politics like he’s been preparing the whole time. It feels like the movement’s energy was used as a ladder.  And don’t even get me started on the way he handled the October 9 protest confusion. When young people were panicking, waiting for clarity, ready to go to the streets again because the country is literally suffocating under corruption, what does he do? He steps back. He shrugs it off and says Gen-Z wasn’t involved. Bro, if you’re going to speak for the movement when it’s convenient, then show up when shit gets chaotic too. That’s literally what leadership is. Instead, he pops up when the cameras are rolling and disappears the moment things get risky. That kind of pick-and-choose activism makes me angry because that’s exactly the political behavior we protested against.  Then there’s the whole “our office was attacked” episode. He went public with it, made it sound serious, and then the police said there was no official complaint, and everything was calm when they arrived. What are we supposed to believe? Either be transparent or don’t dramatize it. People actually suffered during these protests. People bled. People DIED. And watching someone drag the movement into half-explained drama with zero clarity is honestly insulting.  What makes me the most furious is how he keeps talking like he represents the entire generation, giving big speeches about unity, direct elections, overseas voting, and political reform, while his actions keep zig-zagging all over the place. You don’t get to call yourself the voice of Gen-Z while making moves that look inconsistent, self-centered, and convenient. The Gen-Z protests weren’t a TikTok trend. They weren’t a branding opportunity. They were a desperate cry from a generation that’s tired of being silenced and robbed of a future.  Watching someone turn that into a messy political ambition is heartbreaking and infuriating. We didn’t risk our safety so one guy could walk around looking like a “youth politician.” We marched for real change. For accountability. For a country that doesn’t chew its future generation alive. And right now, Miraj feels like he’s drifting so far from the soul of that movement that it’s honestly painful.  If he actually wants to stand for Gen-Z, then he needs to stop playing this half-activist, half-politician game and show some damn consistency, clarity, and courage because right now, all I’m seeing is another person using the movement’s energy to put himself in the spotlight.  Anyone else feel like this? Because I’m seriously done pretending this is okay.    And here are the straight-up questions people genuinely have for him:  Who is funding your movement, your events, and now this new political party?  Why did you claim there was “no leader” during the protests but suddenly step into a political role afterward?  When exactly did you decide to form a party during the protests or after?  If you didn’t intend to be a leader, why are you acting like one now?  Why do you vanish or disengage whenever things get tense, unclear, or dangerous?  Why was the October 9 situation handled so confusingly by you?  Why talk about an attack on your office but file no clear, formal police complaint?  Who keeps you accountable? Who checks your decisions?  What gives you the right to speak on behalf of an entire generation?  Are you building a movement or building a personal political brand?",

So support those who want corruption free nation, not a certain generation|||here's my 2 cents(you can check my post history to determine the kind of person I am)  He's from a well-off family. He's been doing 'media' stuff like making videos and shit from a while ago but he hasn't been 'in the streets' as a kid and it shows. Call me backwards or whatever but if you never got into fights as a kid, or even as a teenager, you don't have that 'bite'. That's him. That softness combined with good looks and branding made him the perfect mascot for non-violent 'gen-z'. He's great as a model but as a ruthless and calculating leader that can lead hundreds of people to bring a certain outcome? Nope.. he's a weak kid inside. Aba ko political events le uslai daro banauna chai sakcha hai in that regard.  He got scared after the sep 8/9 incidents, fearing that his good life could get stripped away from him. He's someone with a lot to lose. His family and relatives probably held him back. Tespachi he probably came back to the front ali pachi with some kind of a plan. Aile chai I just think he's trying to do what he thinks and knows is right - play by the political system's rules. And since we all have severe trauma related to anything 'political party' related, we hate to see it.  Sudan is the opposite of miraj - he's been in the field, has scolded corrupt officials to their face since 2015, has had literal dirt and blood on him. But he's not an eloquent speaker like miraj, he's got 'a look' but the kind of person he has become, branding himself online is not sth he cares about. Whatever he is, is his brand.  In any case, we gotta be careful and discerning and support where needed and criticize where appropriate. Let's get it 💪|||.|||Clips ki video xaina yo post KO?|||Sabai opportunistic cha kasai lai wastai chaina euta main leader nai chaina euta ley aafno party kholya cha arko yo vaye na tyo vayeh na arko paila ko party haru ley movement start garya cha genz yeta euta kei garna sakya chaina.|||movement was leaderless but quite not. but even then the aftermath can't go on like that leaderless, shapeless, formless, faceless. why don't u go take his job?|||He doesn’t know How politics works.|||so its oli/prachande/deuba jhole vs sudan jhole vs durga jhole vs miraj jhole vs ck raut jhole now   hahahahaha  mathi ko main madaari hasi ra hola goti haru ko activity dekhera|||k ho reason chai hate garnu ko? k kura garyo genZ movement represent nagarne?|||Kaam garne kaalu|||No doubt young generation is powerful and should be in politics too.

Intentions sahi hola but yinarle anarchy matra badauxan.|||Not a Zenzee and while I appreciate the revolution and all, they have slowly becoming Oli gang. What it demonstrates is the blood we have - thirsty for oneself, power, money, opportunity. I am particularly upset with Sudan Gurung who is hell bent at removing Home Minister and this guy called Miraj Dhungana. I will dismiss Miraj right off the bat because I don't see anything in his eyes and his face. He is a selfish person and anyone who is following him and all should think many times. Sudan Gurung - the guy is hell bent on removing home minister on such a stupid demand that he wants to arrest Oli and Lekhak. What the hell guys ? are you looking for rawanraj? we have laws and we want to enforce it fairly and strictly. Om Prakash is a lawyer and he is not trying to protect Oli or Lekhak - anyone thinks that is such a stupid Zenzee. Do you guys want to arrest someone just on a whim? without gathering sufficient proof? In western countries law enforcement officials spend years if not decades monitoring and gathering evidences against someone they think is culprit - they just don't  arrest someone and investigate - that wouldn't be rule of law. Om Prakash has that schooling. I don't care who Om Prakash is and all but he is definitely a capable guy and has proved it time and again - after all, he is chosen by PM.  Now, are you guys looking to change ministers and government leadership when we only have 4 months to go ? Its such a shame when every so called Zenzee goes to Singhadarbar and disturbs our government's actions. Just think if all the time they spend is meeting you guys.     Now listen to what Mahabir Pun said - please go to your constituencies and help new  political parties that align to your views win - why are you spending so much energies trying to meet the PM ? The Miraj Dhungana is such a scam guy - He is driven by his own ambition, I feel. I did like Sudan but he is also active childish and not a thing in near future.  Whatever everyone says and does listen and watch what Rachha Bam says and does. She is the one who walked out with Army Chief when he seemed to infer democracy was in danger. She is acting with passion and patience. I would recommend everyone to support behind Raswapa, Sagar Dhakal, Baburam, Kulman,  Sumana Shrestha. Sumana is the real deal.     Now if you believe in democracy and free and fair election, support Rabi. How can a person so beloved by people can be in jail without having an opportunity to go to people? is democracy is for the people and by the people?     I recommend please read. Watch what Swarmin Wagle said few days that Deuba was Zenzee, Oli was Zenzee and every popular leader was zenzee when they started politics. There has been tremendous progress but it was not enough. Just because you feel young and under 25 doesn't mean its your government and can do anything. Nope - no way until we have rule of law.     Now this government gotta focus on election and it has to happen. When I hear Miraj and Sudan that say it can't happen in current condition are not only naïve but foolish. They gotta go read what democracy is. Nothing happens without people's mandate which is vote.     And don't forget its not you guys who brought this change - it was a coincidence.  Someone else did on 24th so you really shouldn't overwhelmingly take any credit, especially Miraj who didn't even take part in the protest ! Hope it helps.|||Ani aaja bholi singa durbar bhitra baseka haru protocol follow garera aako hun ta ??|||miraj and party >>>>> yemale and other similar parties|||Yea the protest was headless/leaderless but we need people to lead you can't complain he gained from this protest of course he did and we want a capable leader to run office not military the argument that he was not in the protest is stupid this is exactly why we failed as national because we put fighters as leaders they can be leaders while fighting but in office we need people who lead office not mobs and arms   Not taking his side but this was a common argument against him and I disagree so this ... Btw I don't know why they want directly elected pm within 6 months like bring 2/3 majority and do what you want their ego will delay the election effectively pushing the country years backwards focus on NOTA and NRN voting rights and different policy and development plan for future|||All this shit is happening coz there was no leader during gen z protests. They did not achieve anything despite such massive movement except toppling Government.   Miraj Dhungana came into realization. An organised group is must to move forward. The most important thing a leader should have is a clean image and clear vision. The maturity he has shown not being political figure is admirable.   One of the good thing coming out of Gen Z movement is the youth having interest on politics and stepping forward to be incharge.  We should not discourage them, in the same time help them by giving healthy and constructive criticisms.|||आज उनीहरूले गरेको माग केपी र लेखक लाई सजाए को दायरा मा ल्याउनुपर्छ भन्ने विषयमा थियो। सायद त्यो माग राख्नु गलत भयो होला है।|||Yo sub pani flip bhaira hunxa harek bela.

At the end of the day, even though I scored 3.97 GPA, In the Kathmandu Metro Scholarship exam, I choked. I barely made it onto the second nomination list and ended up in a college that’s just “okay.” But honestly, I don’t blame the college I blame myself. There were others who got into better colleges than me, even though they had lower grades. So, I can’t say grades don’t matter, but the first term really showed me how tough things can get. I know I need to improve, and I’m determined to do so. I got an A+ in Computer Science, even though I didn’t study as much as I should have. I love Computer Science and building a lot of skills in the field. Right now, though, I’ve decided to take a break from everything every extracurricular activity, including learning JavaScript, React, and other things. I know I probably shouldn’t, but I feel like it’s necessary for now. Starting today, I’ll be locking my phone and using my laptop strictly for studying. I need to focus on my second terminal exams, and it’s time to set boundaries.If I’ve said anything wrong, I apologize. I don’t blame anyone or anything but myself, even though I studied harder than I ever have. My lack of proper note-taking has cost me. Right now, I’m just looking for advice from seniors who have gone through this and come back stronger, getting good results in the end.",

Around a year worth of income of an average Nepalese just for a 2 years of teen's study.  My experience with Kavya was that my mom went there just to check it out (ofcourse it was out of our budget) and sadly she entered her number in some survey they had.      The number of calls those nggas made during 2 whole weeks, fk. We kept on declining and blocking their numbers but everytime it was a new number lmao. When we first asked for discount, they declined for even a rupee but later on they started giving offers themselves, despo times for them ig. I shouted at them once and finally they stopped.|||Kavya na jau bhanxu hai Discount kei ma xaina +2 Ko lagi SXC ya sasto, ramro ma gaye hunxa for science Management ho bhane global|||Me who completed +2 in 1 lakh|||Esto mahango cha +2 aile?|||\\+2 colleges are overrated. colleges will contribute almost nothing to shape your future in +2.|||Kavya and Ace ko last year ko result kasto cha??

Reasoning: ABCD is a parallelogram (from the figure). Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. That means the diagonal AC and BD intersect each other at point P such that AP = PC and BP = PD. Now, in the parallelogram, Triangles △APD and △BPQ are on the same base PD (or same diagonal portion) and they lie between the same parallel lines AD and BC. Hence, Area of △APD = Area of △BPQ.|||Trauma, dhattt|||ABD and ABQ has same area. now ABP is common triangle in both of them.

Watch khan academy for general concepts. Use Perplexity AI or something like that for personal guidance. I got away with a 3.8+ GPA with only these resources.

For example: Use Fundamental Physics by Resnick and Halliday to understand the concepts in Physics, Thomas calculus for calculus, also most of the math is covered in BC Bajracharya's Basic of Mathematics.

And 12th is alll about organic ,yup almost all.The same teacher will teach u organic chem till the last day of 12th ,yup u heard it right.However, its not the matter to be intimidated .Personally i practiced organic each day,some day i took a break obviously .So, ya u should revise it from the first chapter. My organic chap teacher was amazing ,calm and gave notes and also provided ideas to make it easier to study while i was in KMC . If u dont have those ,study from youtube.  Ya and i got an overall 3.8  and ya forgot to mention, If u dont understand a topic than u have youtube .To be frankly honest,i used to watch a lecture from youtube everytime a topic or concept or terms even if its subtle. Without the teachers from youtube, well i wouldnt have scored even a 3.6.

Apparantely, Nepal doesn't allow you to apply for flight trainings abroad if you're from management background +2 ma. Whereas, the country where I'm planning to go for training doesn't have this requirement. Any open schools that I can join? I don't know if I'll fit in the class with regular +2 students. I'm just nervous. Any colleges that allow online tuition? I'm so confused. NOC nai didaina re +2 management lai. What do I do? +2 in management was a decision I took myself and regretting right now.",
