I don’t care if he doesn’t want to be Prime Minister or interim leader, but the youth were counting on his leadership at the very least, to give us some direction or unity. One post or tweet a day just isn’t enough to get us all on the same page while the current party leaders are trying to find the best way to sneak back into the system. I respect what he’s done so far, but right now his lack of communication is leaving everyone who believe in him to speculate and guess what he's thinking.  We’ve fought this hard for transparency in government. If he can’t communicate openly with the people, it’s going to be a tough road ahead with a leader who isn’t willing to be loud and clear.

Look at whats happening to Harka Sampang and his rampant posts.   I understand your skepticism and honestly I have a it as well. However, in this case Balen has shown commendable approach. KO oli resign garna vanda agadi Nepal ko prime minister lay you are a terrorist vaneyko ho. Dudes got a fucking balls of steel.   He hasn’t hesitated to speak up and publicly voiced his opinion like other Jholey people out there. But any unnecessary communication has probability of spreading false narrative. And I respect him to being careful with this approach.   Btw I am not Balen’s Jholey.

            "body": "I honestly can’t wrap my head around this. What did people like Meen Bahadur Gurung ever do to deserve mobs burning down his life’s work? This is a man who literally started from zero, a tiny store and we all saw him build Bhatbhateni with our own eyes. His progress was not some shady backroom deal; it was decades of grind in front of the public.  And then there’s Chandra Dhakal. This man created thousands of jobs, brought remittance services to Nepal, opened banks, gave opportunities when the government itself failed to. And for what? To have his businesses and family attacked by people who can’t even differentiate between someone who exploited the system and someone who actually gave back to the country?  Even Shekhar Golchha, who, by the way, has been Nepali for generations  is being called “Marwari” like it’s some crime to have roots elsewhere. If we really want to play that game, none of us are “pure Nepali.” Trace back 10–20 generations and we all came from somewhere, Brahmins, Kshatriyas, everyone. So who the hell are we to act like gatekeepers of nationality now?  And Binod Chaudhary — the ONLY billionaire Nepal has, who actually put Nepal on the global map, even he wasn’t spared. Like seriously, what are we doing? If people had some grudge against Marwari businessmen, fine, that’s your bias. But why lump Nepali-origin entrepreneurs like Dhakal and Gurung into this hate?  This isn’t a revolution. This isn’t justice. This is blind rage, misdirected and self-destructive. We’re tearing down the very people who built jobs, opportunities, and businesses in a country where the state has done jackshit for its citizens. Are we so lost in anger that we can’t even tell the difference between those who looted us and those who actually lifted us? Or do we just want to watch Nepal burn, no matter who it hurts?  This feels less like “justice” or “revolution” and more like misdirected rage that harms the very entrepreneurs who built jobs, opportunities, and international recognition for Nepal.  So, I’ll ask again: what exactly are we achieving by destroying our own businesses and vilifying people who’ve actually contributed to the country’s economy?",

            "comments": "If you go through Durga Prasai's old speeches, a major focus of his campaign has always been targeting the people you listed. According to people, Meen Bahadur Gurung has deep UML ties, some were of Indian origin and idk about Chandra Dhakal.|||We’ve grown up watching Nepali and Hindi movies where the rich guy is always the villain. Maybe that’s why people instantly see businessmen as the bad guys. Also add constant communist brainwashing about rich people.  Meen Bahadur Gurung yes he has political connections and has supported parties, but our so called high iq citizens forget everything about the jobs and opportunities he created. The same people who cried that social media bans would destroy our economy during Dashain destroued more by attacking businesses themselves.|||   In my humble opinion, the targeting of Nepali businessmen comes down to something very simple but very destructive: people’s resentment toward money, or more precisely, toward people who appear to be doing better than them. There’s this inability to comprehend what goes into building a stable family, a stable income, and ultimately a stable life.  I say this from my own experience. I come from what I’d call privilege, but not in the stereotypical “born rich” way. My parents are in their late 50s and still working, because it keeps them active and their brain sharp. Money is just the compensation. My grandparents on both side were educated and worked. My parents’ siblings are all working, either in Nepal or abroad. Nobody in the family was dependent on others to carry them, and that makes a huge difference. When every member of a family is educated and capable, the collective wealth grows naturally.  Now imagine the opposite: if my parents had to financially support multiple siblings, their families, their education, their livelihoods — our family’s financial stability would be completely different. So yes, having everyone in the family be self-sufficient is a privilege. And it compounds over generations.  That same foundation has given me freedom in my own life. I live with my parents, rent-free. My little brother graduated and earns his own money. My parents remain independent. Meanwhile, I work in tech and earn enough to live comfortably. At one point, I was working a full 9–6 job, freelancing, and managing a contract role—three income streams at once. Now I’ve scaled back to two, but it’s still more than enough to afford nice things.  But here’s the problem: people don’t want to hear that story. They don’t want to believe someone worked hard, or simply benefited from a supportive family structure. They jump to assumptions. I’ve literally seen comments recently accusing people (abroad or in Nepal) of corruption just because they change outfits in every video. That’s how narrow the lens has become.  And that’s why businessmen become such easy targets. Instead of being seen as individuals who worked, built, created jobs, and contributed, they’re reduced to symbols of “unfair wealth.” It’s not about corruption, it’s about resentment. And that resentment is fueled not by facts, but by the inability to comprehend how different backgrounds and family structures shape opportunity.  Ps: some of them can be sus but not everyone is sus by default. Good family helps raise each other up. Bad family take what’s meant to be yours and put you in debt. Family and the members makes all the difference. It is the same with the business houses and families too. Something to do for everyone. 🥸|||Nepali people are very envious and can’t stand when others do better than them|||I feel you on this. What happened to people like Meen Bahadur Gurung, Chandra Dhakal, Golchha, even Binod Chaudhary — that’s not “revolution,” that’s mob anger spilling over in the worst way possible.  You’re absolutely right: Bhatbhateni literally grew in front of our eyes. We all shopped there. Dhakal did open doors for jobs, remittances, financial services. Golchha and his family have been Nepali for generations. And Binod Chaudhary, for all his controversies, put Nepal on the global map in a way no politician ever has.  The problem, I think, is that the rage has become so generalized. For the youth out on the streets, every symbol of “big business” now feels tied to the political system they despise. Instead of distinguishing between those who exploited loopholes vs. those who actually built something, it all got thrown into one basket of “elites.” And once mob psychology kicks in, nuance disappears.  But here’s the dangerous part: if we start burning down our own entrepreneurs along with the corrupt politicians, we’re basically destroying the very few engines of opportunity this country has. Nepal already has weak state capacity. If private sector leaders who did create jobs and services are also demonized, we’ll be left with nothing but ruins and slogans.  I’m all for accountability and reform. Call out corruption. Demand transparency. But lumping every successful entrepreneur into “enemy of the people” is lazy, self-destructive politics. Like you said — it’s less revolution, more blind rage. And in the end, ordinary workers, employees, and citizens will pay the price, not just the tycoons.|||Min Bahadur Gurung's Bhatbhateni was caught in major tax evasion and in 2024, Supreme Court ordered to pay more than Rs 1.6 billion to the government. After the order of the Supreme Court, it was confirmed that Bhatbhateni conducted business through fake VAT bills. But, Bhatbhateni used the then ruling party Emale (CPN - UML) connection and didn't follow the order.  https://preview.redd.it/zut4wqtvznof1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=da1d31097045b054fcf189f61bab0681aa00a967|||There is no justification or condonation for the arson.

The current constitution is defined in a way that will benefit those corrupt parties to ensure their legacy forever. Let us unite in this matter. Lets not carry any political influence whatsoever in this situation and stop the country from failing. Let all come together and give pressure to the President of Nepal to find a way to remove the current deadlock and not get consultation from those party leaders who have already failed in different ways.

Why aren’t credible news outlets stepping up with real research? They should have teams of journalists digging deep into these figures, producing well-sourced profiles that cut through the noise. Instead, what we mostly see are shallow stories and recycled rumors.  This is exactly when we need journalism to do what it does best—slow down, investigate, and publish facts that can put an end to fake narratives. Chasing every whisper only fuels confusion.

            "body": "I think Nepal is heading toward a complete collapse — socially, economically, and politically. And sadly, it’s not because of outsiders, it’s because of what we are doing to ourselves.  Unemployment & lost opportunities: With businesses burned down and hotels destroyed, jobs are disappearing. Tourists won’t come, and locals will struggle to find work. Families that once invested here, like the Chowdhurys, are already looking abroad. Even Nepali-origin businessmen family don’t see a future here anymore.  We turned on our own: Instead of protecting and valuing the people who built opportunities for us, we attacked them. Look at what happened to entrepreneurs like Chandra Dakal — a self-made man who created jobs from nothing. Instead of respecting his contribution, mobs targeted him. Why would anyone want to invest or build here after seeing that?  Housing crisis incoming: In my own neighborhood, renters involved in vandalism were kicked out. While that might be justified, it points to a larger problem — jobs are gone, rent can’t be paid, and soon finding a place to live in Kathmandu will become even harder.  Foreign investment is gone: Even if foreign investment was never huge, now it’s practically impossible. We’ve burned down our pride — Singha Durbar, parliament, and businesses. Who will invest in a country that destroys its own foundations?  The future looks bleak: I’m already hearing of people moving abroad because they see no future here. Those who can will leave, and those who remain may face real hunger. Up until now, we thought things were bad — but real hunger is coming.  At the end of the day, Nepal will be left with nothing but regret and a population that feels like losers in their own country. We reap what we sow, and right now we’re sowing destruction.",

            "body": "Hey Gen-Z,  Hope you read my earlier article on “What is constitution.”  Now, Let’s learn about multiparty democracy.    There are different types of democracy: 1.  One party democracy like that of China. 2.  Two party democracy like that of USA. 3.  Multiparty democracy like that of India and Nepal. 4.  Dominant-party democracy like that of Singapore.    Nepal constitutionally practice multiparty democracy.  In multiparty democracy, we all can form a party as our fundamental rights.  Yes! Even KMAG can form a party.  (Cool ya, kholyo bhane join gara hai.)  And in multiparty democracy, you can’t ban or restrict any party from competing for power, which means you cannot constitutionally limit or restrict UML, Congress, Maoist or any party to compete for power.    Very principle is, a party in itself cannot be bad.  Its leaders can be but not the party.  And more importantly, in democracy actual perception of any party isn’t determined by group of people but election result.    Thus, you, me, Balen or anyone has no rights to say who get to compete for power and who don’t.  We can only influence but cannot and should not obstruct anyone, Not even Pappu Construction.  Basic concept of multiparty democracy is - everyone competes for power and people decide who get to rule per votes.  Interestin fact:  King Mahendra then didn’t like multiparty democracy and he introduced “party-less democracy.”  Not going to history but a ChatGPT assignment for you to expand the topic.    So, here we are back to square one.  We can’t function by restricting or limiting other political parties constitutionally.  Only way to get them out of power is by letting them compete yet never win.    If you are all for multiparty democracy, let me dissapoint you - UML/Congress/Maoist will be back in scene as rightfully so.  You can hate them but you can’t ignore them.  So better learn to accept their existence even if you hate them.  That’s what being a constitutionalist means and what will differentiate you from anarchist.    Hope you got the fundamental.    Now don’t even think of becoming Mahendra unless you are the joker from Batman.  In that case, hello there, Harvey here.  From KMAG",

If all the cabinet ministers are in army barrack then why the meeting is being conducted inside the barrack?  3. Why is there delay in dissolving parliament?  4. There is no common voice among Gen Z. It is starting to already fracture into different sub groups.   5. Sudden rise in anti- Gen Z sentiment in various online platform.  Democracy is your hands guys, protect it at any cost.

            "heading": "SORRY TO SAY THE TRUTH",
            "body": "I am sorry, but most of Gen Z’s source of information today is Facebook stories and Instagram reels. If they see any reel with *BALEN'S BALIDAN* or *MERO DESH HASEKO* song in the background, they won’t even think twice before sharing it. As a result, reels with the wrong message spread like wildfire, while the truth remains suppressed and ignored.  But here’s the reality: many in Gen Z don’t know the basics of how their own country functions. For example:  1. How is the parliament dissolved?! 2. What happens if the parliament is dissolved?! 3. What is the role of the president in the formulation and implementation of the Constitution?! 4. How strong—or vulnerable—is an interim government?! 5. Why is Balen not trying to be opportunistic and become a short-term Prime Minister?!  Right now, Gen Z is opposing party politics, especially targeting the new party—**Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP)**. But let me ask: do you even know who is in this party besides Rabi Lamichhane? People like **Sumana Shrestha (MIT graduate), Swarnim Wagle (Oxford graduate, one of Nepal’s most respected economists), Dr. Toshima Karki, Sobita Gautam (a lawyer who actually understands the law), Shishir Khanal, Manish Jha, and Hari Dhakal**—all highly educated individuals who bring credibility to the system. But let’s be real: most of them were elected because of Rabi’s popularity. Without him, their recognition would have been minimal. This is not party propaganda—it’s just fact.  At the same time, everyone is now praising **Sushila Karki**, who may soon become the first historic female Prime Minister of Nepal. But let’s be honest: did Gen Z even care about her before all this? Do they know who **Bhimarjun Acharya** is? This generation calls itself the “generation of change,” but how can you define change without even knowing how your country’s political and legal system truly works?  Here’s the hard truth: today’s youth are being pulled like sheep—one day someone tells you to support the monarchy, the next day someone convinces you that Balen or Harka should be Prime Minister. Without education and awareness, Gen Z is at risk of following trends instead of facts.  There are only a few young people who actually understand the truth—who know how the Constitution works, how the parliament functions, and what checks and balances exist. But most of them stay silent because the majority of the youth don’t care about facts—they prefer fiction wrapped in reels and stories.  So here’s the call: **Gen Z, educate yourselves. Not just for today, not just for one political event, but for the future of Nepal.** Learn how the system works, study the Constitution, understand party politics, and question the narratives you see on social media. Because without knowledge, this “generation of change” will end up being just another lost generation.",

Peacefully Take the Streets to Protect Our Revolution and Demand What’s Right ..  🛡️ How to Keep Gen Z Protests Safe & Unhijacked  1) No Masks, Helmets, or Big Bags Show your face proudly—this is a people’s protest, not a mob. No helmets, sticks, or large bags (they can hide weapons).   ⚠️🔴 Don't accept Anyone hiding face or carrying heavy bags = outsider; expose them and hand them to concerned authorities ( Or nagai dhulai han Testo Lai ) ✌🏽✊🏽  2) 🕊️ No Political Party Flags or Any Rajabadi: Carry only the Nepali 🇳🇵 flag and Gen Z slogans. Ban all UML, Congress, Maoist, or Raja Aau kera khau banners—clear signal it’s people-led, not hijacked.  3) Clear Identity of Protesters: Use Gen Z-specific symbols: (armbands, wristbands, flags, stickers, QR-code IDs) so that only real supporters are recognized.  ⚠️Contact with some wholesalers of printed shirt ,ID cards, banners/stickers makers to order them in bulk..baru paisa sab le fund garumla.   Make it easy to spot outsiders trying to blend in.  4) 🤝🕊️ Work With Community and local business in advance: Inform locals and businesses nearby about protest goals. When communities trust you, they’ll also help spot outsiders causing trouble. So that no damage of property is there if in case of Chaos.  5) Livestream Everything: Encourage protesters to film & livestream. Cameras discourage violence and expose provocateurs instantly.   Use Data Packs in bulk or share wifi/Hotspot from business near you to access internet.  🔴⚠️Record incidents and immediately point out infiltrators. ( We encourage and warn you infiltrators to please try not to  vulture our revolution or create any sorta uncessary chaos during or after it..feri yeti vanda ni aaeu vane chai Rest in Peace 🕊️ ✌🏽)  6 ) Transparent Communication ( Genz haru haru participate hunw easily milne social platform : Use Telegram/Signal/Viber groups with verified admins, to join those group you must be admitted by some parameters which will be discussed during the time of gathering.   Share real-time protest updates so fake news can’t spread inside/Outside the rally.   ⚠️✌🏽🔴Clear and last warning to every of those sold out Misinformation Failune media channel haru Janta vadkune news outlets haru ko ni list rakhirakhnu ..we will pay them back in the way they deserve 🙂‍↕️⚠️  7) 🔴⚠️Expose & Isolate Infiltrators: If anyone throws stones, burns property, or shouts violent slogans → everyone chants together: “Not With Us!”   Point cameras at them so the world knows they are imposters. After showing their face make sure their face is unrecognizable✌🏽🔴 ( k garnu parxa Testo haru Lai ;we will decide 🙂‍↕️) 🔴  ✅ By following these, the protest stays youth-led, peaceful, and unstoppable. Infiltrators fail when the movement is disciplined and transparent.|||Chor danka fatha GEN-Z|||How can you ask for something unconstitutional from a law maker her self.|||he is doing something nah koi muji haru jasto jo sirf haat jodna janya xan party ko.  ani k ho yo muji haru esto indian raw vanne herne garau k dai ko interview, details, really sad to see people hate to him.|||[deleted]|||[deleted]|||Satta ko bhog ingo Dalal ko and I'm not jhole bring back king.|||Yo Gang haru le aba ali Gen Z Gen Z vanda ni law bujeko experience vako lai rakhnu paryo side ma yetikai haude taal ma bolera hunna.

The Constitution outlines the qualifications for the Prime Minister under Article 76, which states that the Prime Minister must be a member of the House of Representatives and is typically the leader of the parliamentary party commanding a majority. If no party has a clear majority, the President can appoint a member who can secure a vote of confidence within 30 days. The key requirement is that the individual must be an elected Member of Parliament (MP). A former Chief Justice, who is not currently an MP, would need to be nominated to the Upper House (National Assembly) or elected to the House of Representatives to be eligible. There is no constitutional bar on a former judge holding a political office, including the Prime Minister, provided they meet the parliamentary eligibility criteria (e.g., being a citizen of Nepal, not holding an office of profit, and meeting age and residency requirements under Article 87). Recent developments, such as the consideration of former Chief Justice Sushila Karki for an interim Prime Minister role amid the 2025 political crisis, suggest a workaround where she could be nominated to the Upper House to qualify. This aligns with the Constitution's flexibility in crisis situations, where the President can appoint an interim leader subject to a confidence vote. However, some interpretations and public debates (e.g., from Gen Z protesters) argue against former judges due to perceived impartiality concerns, though this is not a legal restriction. In summary, a former Chief Justice can become Prime Minister if they secure a parliamentary seat, either through election or nomination, and gain the necessary support.|||boost|||Our constitution has been rigged by India. 2015 blockade allowed more citizenships to Madhissee Bihari Indians which is India's plan to silently replace Nepalese with their people.

Our future is a republic, not a relic.  #NoCrownsOnlyAccountability  2️⃣ NO to Old Parties & Fake Student Unions🚫🧑‍🎓  Please Share and remember this ,We didn’t burn down the old system to let the vultures pick at the pieces.🇳🇵Student wings of UML, Congress, and Maoists (NSU, ANNFSU) are crawling out of their holes to hijack our movement. They are lackeys of the corrupt. We must boycott them and build our own indpnt forums.  3️⃣ YES to Transparency & Real Gen Z Voice 🔍  Our movement is leaderless, but it must not be voiceless. We choose our own voice. No backroom deals. All talks must be public. We choose our reps through open polls, not NGO plants or party proxies.  4️⃣ STOP Foreign Interference & Division🌍⚠️  Nepal’s future = We must expose NGOs/INGOs spreading fake news and division.Our future is decided by Nepalis only. Expose disinfo, unite across caste/ethnicity/religion, audit NGOs.  🚀 Our Unified Demands:  Our Path Forward:  ✅ Interim Government: Support clean, trusted figures like Balen Shah to lead a short-term, neutral government to guide us to fresh elections. This is about transition, not dictatorship.  ✅ Hunt the Corrupt: Chase the old leaders who are still here posting in social media and trying to grab their last power.Confiscate their black money from Swiss banks and use it to rebuild our nation. They must face justice.  ✅ People's Power: Reform the constitution for more transparency, independent institutions, and power directly in the hands of the people.  The Final Call: Back to the Streets! 🚨  The conversation has moved from the streets to backroom shady deals. This is the most dangerous time for our movement and ou country.  To ensure our voices are heard loud and clear, and to stop the jholeys from hijacking our revolution, we must return to peaceful protest.  📢 Final Call:  Peaceful rallies, louder than ever. No monarchy, no mask,no bags ,no old parties, no imposters.

For Nepal to move forward, we need the full support of every single one of you.

They are shaping the narrative in a way that only benefits them. If we let their lies dominate, tomorrow they will win again, and all our protest, sacrifices, and unity will go to waste.  That’s why your support is absolutely critical. We can change their narrative — but only if we act together. The first step is to fight back with the truth. Make memes, share facts, expose their corruption, and flood social media with reality. Overwrite their lies with our truth.  This fight is not just about today — it will decide Nepal’s future. So do your part. Expose them. Overthrow their lies with truth. Don’t let their narrative fool us again.",

I have seen a few posts criticising their political movements, such as the ones they conducted in Maitighar (I believe it is related to the Maoists) or NSU getting on the street.   All they are asking is to save the constitution.  Nepal is currently facing a crisis it has never seen before. The vacuum is not just political but structural as well. There are people such as Prasai who are trying to repeal the constitution based on this vacuum.   The constitution has flaws, but it was made by us, the people. There are a few spaces which the political parties created to make sure they would always be on power. But the 2-day revolution has changed everything. Now we have the power to amend the constitutions in such a manner that it cannot be manipulated by anyone.  I urge you guys to make sure that our next steps does not harm the nation further. Buildings can be rebuilt, but the spirit of the country cannot be.  Save the constitution.  Note: I declare that I have never been a political cadre of any party.",

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen.

Try to restore all public infrastructures as much as possible and, scavenge for and safeguard any documents or information banks that have not yet been safeguarded  2. Of the 3 evils, one has fled, one has been ambushed but one is still free(Prachanda) and even thriving. This shouldn't be happening. He must either be imprisoned or killed. For this we will need to come together again.  3. Those that had fled in yesterday's prison escape(especially Rabi) along with those who helped them escape must be captured, investigated and imprisoned   4. Justice - those involved in the death of the students & those who infiltrated yesterday's protest to carry their selfish motives must be identified, arrested, imprisoned and investigated.  5. Leader - we need a leader even if it's a temporary one so that the country doesn't fall as well as to ensure that the evil doesn't return and to negotiate with the international bodies/countries in order to retrieve the assets hidden by those politicians and to ask for those who fled to be returned to the country for trial. And also to direct and manage the restoration of our country   From what limited I know, the top competitors for the leadership position are 1.Balen Shah(can be a bit extreme sometimes) 2. Harka Sampang(is known to be slightly dictorial) 3.Kulman Ghising(overall good but maybe a bit mild in temper) 4. Sumana Shrestha (Don't really know much)   But please understand that leadership is not limited to these four, any patriotic person who is determined to save and develop this nation, has the vision, is willing to learn, provides absolute transparency, engages in active communication and absolutely won't engage in nepotism/corruption as well as takes strict measures against any that do is more than qualified to lead. It may be any of us who dream of a better country and is willing to make the effort.  If there are any suggestions or opinions, please comment!! This is our nation, although it's in ashes now, we have to rise up again and rebuild this nation into one we can be proud of, feel safe in and live properly .  Edit, didn't know how to change the title but everything else, I tried. I'm not trying to confuse the mass, these are just my opinions that I think are very important.",

Its grand architecture and historical importance make it a true pride of Nepal.The news of Singha Durbar burning yesterday is more than just the loss of a structure it feels like the loss of a piece of our soul. This tragedy is a blow to our heritage, to our economy, and to our sense of unity as a nation. The damage cannot be measured only in money, but also in the irreplaceable cultural and historical value that has been destroyed.  I feel deeply saddened by this loss. Singha Durbar was more than walls and pillars it was a living monument of Nepal’s journey, struggles, and achievements.

Indians think KP Oli has- 1) Ruined ties with India, keeps making claims that Ayodhya is actually in Nepal  2) CCP puppet, keeps insulting India and chooses china  3) Hasn’t visited India in 4 years he’s been PM, even though India and Nepal are very important partners.   Guys the Modi government is NOT a supporter of KP Oli, the news articles are misinformed and have low knowledge & context about the events in Nepal.

If it was against corruption then the protest should have stopped after government stepping down. But what happened after that - people are destroying and burning their country’s asset, their parliament, airports and banks etc - this is not the way it should have gone down if this was about corruption only.

This person is a grade A propagandist of the anti-BJP front. All his tweets are made on the behest of his masters, and he has been called out multiple times for this.|||FYI—-> Social media isn’t just mirroring conflicts happening in schools and on streets – it’s triggering new ones!|||he is against modi gov only.|||Dhruv Rathee is one of the people who remains a part of opposition forever. That doesn’t mean he is wrong always but sometimes yes! It is not just Indian media it is international media but most of them are correcting themselves now which is good. Although his comments are still wrong in many ways. Social media ban was a ignition for this protest because corruption is going on from a longtime. But people should think what’s next? Youth leaders are going to step up and take positions to govern? Do they have that kind of unity? And do you think don’t they turn into corrupt due to powers? Great initiative by youth but think about what’s next |||All of us Indians know this. What are you saying?|||I don't know what are you talking about. Most coverage of Indian media is overtly positive.   This is because our love towards Nepal is same as our hate towards that Chinese puppet Oli.   If you see any doubt in our media or people, it is because we have a slight doubt if CIA or ISI will start using Nepal as a ground to disturb India.   Nepal can be a smaller country, but they are much more older nation state than us with full of brilliant souls and whatever Nepalis choose for their country, we respect that from core.  But never think this Rathee fellow has any love towards you guys. He's just putting gun over your shoulder to attack India. He is not even an Indian citizen.

I doubt anyone here believes that our Nepali brothers were protesting to assert their right to doomscroll.  People don't go to extremes in protesting against social media.  And govts don't ban all social media apps, just because the companies didn't \"register with them\". they do it, because they see the narrative has gone against them, and they desperately want to gain back the control.|||This guy ain’t even an Indian citizen|||[https://youtu.be/CXEMBDjnoWU?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/CXEMBDjnoWU?feature=shared) watch this|||This guy has some personal beef with modi and his party .

Even we don't entertain them. Each passing day their credibility is decreasing in India. 3. Dhruv rathi is also shit. Even his credibility is decreasing each passing day. One hypocrisy at a time. 4. From the bottom of our hearts we hope things calm down there and change for the better for the people of Nepal. I am sure if Nepal wants, the govt in India would love to help however possible (No strings attached) not unlike the hand we gave to srilanka in their time of need Because we understand what it is like to go through a state of political unrest.

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4. Retirement age and term limits: This is a must, we need a clear retirement age for the public positions just like other jobs.     These sort of things are fundamental of any country, without getting the fundamentals right we cannot expect our country to do better. We have a chance to make things better, lets take this chance.|||also i think! what lessons can be learned from Bangladesh last year?|||Garni nai ho vani presidency system lyauni.

Just wanted to express supreme respect to you from Ukraine.   You're really cool!   We had protests in 2014.   We made lot of mistakes after succeded in throwing down Yanukovich in 2014.

Everything is going to be transparent and everyone will have their own share.  We change our currency to crypto; Create AI based government;  Here AI isn't limited to LLM but all the rules and laws.

Constitutional legitimacy + protester acceptance = only viable option.  # 2. PROTESTER LEADERSHIP PIVOT  Gen Z groups must **immediately shift messaging**:  * \"Our revolution is being hijacked\" * \"Military rule = permanent corruption\" * **Name specific civilian demands**: New constitution, elections in 1 year  # 3. ARMY FACE-SAVING EXIT  New interim government must **publicly thank Army Chief Sigdel** for \"preserving democracy\" and **offer ceremonial role** in transition (advisory only, no executive power).  # 4. EMERGENCY UNITY GOVERNMENT  * Sumana Shrestha as PM * Balen Shah as Deputy PM * **3 Gen Z representatives** in cabinet * **Clear 12-month timeline** to new elections  # 5. INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION BLITZ  India, China, UN must **immediately recognize** any civilian arrangement. Every hour of delay gives military justification for intervention.  **THE WINDOW IS 6-8 HOURS MAX**. After that, the army's 10 PM ultimatum becomes permanent control.  **Key insight**: Don't fight the chaos - channel it into civilian transition before military \"restores order\" permanently.  **Act NOW or lose democracy for decades.**|||Is birgunj safe to visit today?

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

I know that indian media is misreporting the revolution as silly protests to reinstate scrapy social media and belittle the ambition of GenZ. Media wants the status quo in India forever. They belittled the Bangladesh protests similarly and painted it as Muslims vs Hindus in Bangladesh. They paint a high opinion of the fugitive Shaik Hasina but curse Nobel laureate Mohammed Yunus. Indian media is the judge, jury and executioner of all the happenings in Nepal, Bangladesh, Srilanka and Pakistan. According to them, India is Ramarajya but others were Raavan rajya. India has become a dead democracy in the past decade. We have no jobs, extremely costly education and no health. We are just scrapping by but nothing to show as the media paints cooked up Indian GDP. Baba's have become politicians, industrialists and millionaires. Politicians just encourage the industry of religion. Their children reap the benefits and others' children subsist on rationed rice.  I hope our youth draws the inspirations from all the other countries' youth around us.|||ke ho yaar comments ma nepali bhnda bdi indians chn , ysri bolnu hola trnslate garna nsakos|||It's classic.

AKA the daughter of a corrupt leader, the Chief Development Officer of Kathmandu, Nepal, Chhabi Rijal, who ordered gunfire in a peaceful protest that took place in Nepal on the 8th of September. The protest that took place against a corrupt government resulted in the loss of 20 individuals, some of whom were minors present in school uniforms, and hundreds were injured.   This is what we got for speaking against a government that has leeched off of taxpayers' money. We request an immediate dismissal of Sweta Rijal's candidacy at your esteemed institution. We, as Nepali people, condemn the actions of her immediate family and believe that her degree, funded by her very disliked father, will be of NO USE to our country.

A shift to a fully directly elected system for every seat would ensure greater accountability and public representation. 2. **Establish a Directly Elected Executive Head:** Instead of the parliament choosing the Prime Minister, the call is for a directly elected President or Prime Minister with full executive powers.

It’s tragic, because they also have families back home and face the same struggles as the rest of us. They should be victims of this system too, yet they show little compassion or critical thought about what’s happening around them. Why are there protests in the first place? I refuse to believe they're blind to people's frustration and the direction the country is heading.  I still remember when we joined a protest 14–15 years ago. The police confronted us aggressively, and as kids we were too confused to react. Fortunately, we just stood there processing and visibly confused, and they left — but I still shudder to think, *what if our reaction had been different?* Today’s young protestors are in the same position, pure in their intentions, simply voicing frustration without wanting harm.  And honestly, credit must go to these protestors. They know exactly what they are standing for, unlike us back then who needed adults to organise us. I don’t see how demonstrations could be any more peaceful than they already are — especially when the very leaders being protested against have blood on their hands from before this generation was even born.|||Yo bhatey haru kahi gayera sitcha holani|||randi baan machikne haru|||I mean this tracks, they only like when you're corrupt|||Its not andolan anymore its war|||We want death or at lease exile of KP Oli and other taukes.|||Randi haruko photo, name, address patta lagau.|||khate haru mug haru padne bela ma padenan aile mug ko mug ko chak sugera manche lai dukha dinxan. timi mug haru le esto dukha dekhnu paros jatha haru. maa gali pani dina sakdina timi haru ko aama ko galti haina timi haru jasta janmie. aama lai k thaaa. tara kailei bhalo nahos timi haru jasta ko. timi haru marna pani na paos bachna pani na paos.|||shamelss dogs of government|||Machikne radi harlai lakhetdai marnaparne|||Thuiyaa police vanauda haruuu|||you radiko ban harulai agolauno man xa|||ma sanga pani ganhune bhaye, kassam mardinthe radieekko ban|||Mathi bata aako order re ????

FYI.|||राम्रो leader choose गर्नु पर्छ अब|||Screwing up would be an understatement. Everybody abandoned their fucking humanity and any sort of morals. People are saying that 'those were not genz' stfu there DEFINITELY were genz in the crowd that beat up and killed these people. The moment buildings started getting burned down, people started becoming feral with the sense of collective power and destruction that they could bring, and they screwed up. They guided their anger and frustration of seeing kids killed into becoming the same species of monsters that they were initially fighting against. More than the corrupt government firing bullets toward us that day, the ignorant and aggrieved crowd scared me the most. Stealing and picking up guns from the chased police, i really thought that we might see the maoist reenactment that day. The mentality to bring 'an eye for an eye' made everyone senseless. People were celebrating their actions of arson, vandalism, theft, and destruction. If these people aren't the same as the maoist and criminals locked up in jail, then wtf are they?? Maoist also consisted of the young generation of that time. I believe its the ignorance and the petty sense of 'mauka ma chauka' that led these people to terrorise their own country. Sure, the angry crowd may have been incited by some wrong intended individuals at times, however, to feel satisfaction upon seeing beat up people and bloody bodies is insane. The reason bhatbhatini, Ncell, kantipur, imp govt buildings burned down is because of these IGNORANT SENSLESS FUCKING MORONS THAT COULDN'T EVEN DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN PROTEST AND VIOLENCE. There is a reason corrupt govt existed in this country, its the people that gave birth to them. And its going to happen again and again like it has always been in the history. It's the entire nepali population that's messed up. Fuck you all, we can all just die in the embers of our own fire.|||The youth of Nepal was played and deceived in the name of GenZ. There are international players in the game. The whole revolution thing was a regime change operation like which happened in Ukraine, Libya, Bangladesh. They used the youth for regime change to install their puppet government. Sad to say that our leaders are groomed to be used in the politics in the future. Looks like our neighbor used their proxies in Nepal to overtake Deep state regime change operation from the west. If we are not vigilant, we are going to get another Zelenski and Nepal may turn into another Ukraine. UN forces and Indian forces are very active to get into Nepal. Things change rapidly in geopolitics. Achieving this revolution within 24 to 48 hours is in itself very suspicious. All seems like preplanned operation. Our youth needs to be more vigilant. |||how they punched that old woman was uncalled for...Nepal sinked to a new low.

In this case, it is not like that. Protestors ( violent non gen z's) they had given everyone time to evacuate the building, but she did not evacuate. Most likely cuz she was scared of the mob outside. The people outthere assumed it was empty, hence they started burning it. When people realized that women was inside the building, people came to her rescue. Unfortunately, she suffered from burn, reported to be 15% do far. Fortunately, she survived and is recovering. Even though I do not agree with what happened, I hate the narrative of us just burning a women.   Second where was this empathy for the kids that got shot? Where was this empathy for mothers and fathers that lost their children? Where was this empathy for grandfather and grandmother that lost their kids and grandkids? Where was this empathy when millions of people suffered? Where was this empathy when our voices about to be silenced?   Yes, we screwed up but before coming out and trying to shame or guilt trip us, ask yourself are you empathetic cuz you saw the video of her or are you genuinely empathetic cuz of the act? Do we all need our sufferings recorded and made public for people to feel empathetic?   Also ask yourself, people chased, dragged and beat corrupted politicians, but not of them were killed. Do you think people would burn and kill some corrupted politicians wife? If they would, then you would have seen lots of dead politicians by now.  Also I just checked your profile, you are an Indian. How can an Indian citizen empathize with Nepali people when you have not suffered under the regime we suffered. Don't just blindly follow what is being shown in your media. Do some research and you will find the truth yourself.|||Fuck, People are starting to say Save the Constitution. Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):** The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):** If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):** If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):** If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||I totally agree with this .|||Aa judai vako mancha lai kati coti marchas, sala indian godi media ko Veda.|||[deleted]|||Why are indians interfer in our business again?

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):** The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):** If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):** If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):** If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

And I'm really sad to see that innocents are dying there for just protesting against corruption and standing by the side of the truth... But, I'm also happy to see that they're so brave enough to do this and sacrifice their lives for this... Their sacrifice, their fights, their rebellion, and the desire for a better future by ending corruption will be remembered forever 🕯.... And the people who are still alive and still in good health condition, i just want to say to y'all that... More power to you guys ❤🔥... I don't live in Nepal so i can't really do anything, but... More power to every single one of you who are still protesting against these and fighting against these... I know and i believe in all of you that y'all will win and the corruption will end in Nepal... Though in my opinion, corruption shouldn't just end in Nepal, corruption should end in every country that's suffering from corruption... And i hope that it will happen soon without losing any more innocent lives... But for now, all the power and more power to every one of you who are protesting against these.

People watched her speech where she said stuff like, “What’s my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?”  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still don’t have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we don’t have the right connections.  We don’t get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, it’s still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? That’s probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  We’re out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor people’s kids not boil?  On top of that, there’s already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent. Because this have  been suppressed for so long, and now the mindset is like — “If we can’t reach anywhere through the system, then we might as well destroy it.”  And even if some third party tries to trigger people, the truth is, it was already there deep down in their subconscious.

This is the only way to cleanse the system and rebuild Nepal’s future.   ✊ Nepalese youth did not rise for chaos. ✊ We rose for truth, accountability, and real change. ✊ The time for excuses is over. Return what you stole — or step aside forever   #copied|||Nepal’s youth are not protesting for Facebook or YouTube ban. They are rising against corruption, nepotism, and a political system that has betrayed them. Their voices were met with bullets—yet the world reduces it to a “social media ban.” This is not about platforms. This is about justice. Stand with Nepal’s youth.",

We need people elected leader not mob selected leader and think of it when any of these guys go to foreign countries for visit will anyone take them seriously they won't because mob selected leaders are ignored just like Md.Yunus is ignored by major world leaders(except China).  Considering we're in a democratic system with democratic framework, I suggest Chief Justice of Supreme Court of Nepal should be given the interim power because Legislature-Executive-Judiciary are the head of country, since President is said to be planning to resign and PM has resigned best would be to get Judicial head.

I know Harka from close, I voted for him. He isn't even capable of being the mayor. The position of Prime Minister is far beyond his dreams.He should have been elected as a ward member first, and then he should have practiced for a higher-level position.However, due to the frustration of the people, voters chose him.

The nation need a leader who can proudly say yes this is my country I will die or live for it. He is the one. My suggestion is do not judge based  on sentiments.|||His position is great till the mayor, no need to drag him any further.|||This needs to spread forward, he is a narcissist, somebody who has no sense of how to speak , god complex.  publicity stunt doesnot makes person a great leader.|||We’re falling into the same trap again. Don’t buy into the smooth talk and fake charm — check their track record instead. Balen and Harka might be moody, but at least they’ve been tested in real battles.

That drive inevitably brings with it shades of narcissism and opportunism. So rather than fixating on intentions, it makes more sense to judge politicians by their results. On that front, Harka has proven he can deliver. His rough almost mobster-like style may be off-putting to some but in a city like Dharan which is home to hotheaded Kirati / Hill Janajati majority that kind of toughness isn’t just useful, it’s necessary.  That said, he is neither qualified nor capable enough to be considered an ‘ideal’ Prime Minister. Nonetheless, when compared to Rabi Lamichhane Harka represents a comparatively more credible alternative. Personally not a fan of either.|||Tei ta Mayor ko pani layak xaina veda janta lai pm chaiyo re|||Dherai yo jaat ko haru furkirako cha muji haru K hi pachi k huncha kei tha chaina gu bhareko muji haru ko|||Guys Primeminister is not joke role.

If a person has done good work, both of them will be appreciated hands down. You have to look at the picture from both sides. Secondly, please ask your senior citizens or elders from a different generation. They have seen history and faced the consequences. The real issue is bringing change in the constitution, i.e., a representative should not be above a certain age and should be allowed to seek votes only for one term. Take that in writing from the concerned representative, live, and show it to the world clearly. Also, please do not discriminate by saying someone is from the “Stone Age,” as such remarks can hurt the sentiments of people who are not from cities.|||He is not educated, he does not have the capabilities of being head of government.

Even he ignored and disagree with the Loan to be used from ADB ( Asian Development Bank ) . 6) He speaks and protest on his own way BUT still he has some flaws unlike us even the moon has flaws then he is still human . ra usko flaws we can ignore . May be he isnt eligible for primeminister as the lacks some level of diplomacy and its skill but he can be best suited in ministries like : Industry and commerce , Infrastructure, Agriculture .

(**Bank run** is a situation where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a bank simultaneously, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or financial stability. This can lead to liquidity problems for the bank, as it may not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands. Bank runs can create a cycle of panic, potentially leading to the bank's failure.)  The real pain starts after the protests have calmed. Economic crash is certain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh both went through it. Stock market/real estate crash, inflation and what not.  Whoever takes charge next, likely Balen, will need to address the pointless 'Greater Nepal' rhetoric and become a moderate on this issue. Thanks to Trump, India-China relationship is stable for the first time in ages. The only way Nepal has a future is pledge allegiance to both neighbour's.  Bangladesh under Yunus has been a pain in the ass for India. Nepal cannot make the same mistake. Any wrong steps and a free floating Nepali rupee against the dollar would go from 140 now to 25,000 like similar countries in our GDP range. Probably worse since our economy is in much worse shape.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.   Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.   Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||How credible is this info?|||Use bitchat for conversation.

            "comments": "We are living in a moment where anger is boiling over. People are tired of corruption, censorship, and being silenced. Many of us are ready to take to the streets on Sept 8. But before we move forward, we must stop and think carefully.  History has shown us what happens when we rush in without preparation. In Bangladesh last year, in Sri Lanka not long ago, ordinary people gave their lives while corrupt leaders fled the country with protection and comfort. Their deaths were forgotten within weeks, while the guilty walked free. If we are not careful, Nepal risks becoming the next chapter in that same tragic story.  That is why this movement must be different. We cannot afford to be reckless. We must protect our people, keep our voices peaceful, and make sure the world is watching every step so that accountability cannot be erased.  Here is what we need to do before Sept 8:  * Get international human rights groups, UN observers, and peace monitors involved beforehand so there are eyes on the ground. * Publish clear and peaceful agendas so nobody can label us as rioters or mobs. * Document everything with photos, videos, and testimonies. Every arrest and every injury must be recorded and shared. * Avoid following local leaders who are affiliated with political parties. Big parties will try to infiltrate, hijack, and twist this movement for their own gain. * Know who is truly standing beside you. Trust matters because infiltrators can turn peaceful protests into chaos.  This movement is about dignity, rights, and accountability. It is not about violence. It is not about revenge. If we lose focus, if we let anger replace strategy, then we risk repeating the same cycle where the powerful walk free and ordinary people pay with their lives.  Nepal deserves better. The world must see us not as mobs, but as citizens united for freedom and justice. If we do this right, our voices will be impossible to silence. If we do this wrong, we risk being forgotten like so many before us.  Stay safe. Stay peaceful. Stay smart.",

She is the daughter of Chabi Rijal, a communist leader and Chief District Officer in Nepal, who recently ordered a shoot-on-sight against youth peacefully protesting corruption in Nepal. His orders have killed over 18 innocent people, injured more than 100 students, and more deaths are expected. This is pure fascism and a gross misuse of power. Young people in a peaceful protest were shot dead, which is totally unacceptable. While our brothers and sisters die in Nepal, Sweta Rijal has no right to study in the US with money from corruption. Her entire funding is from the money from corruption. The US, as a democratic country and a voice for the UN, stands for freedom and justice. Allowing her to stay contradicts everything the US represents. We are struggling to fight this battle in Nepal, and she must be held accountable. I urge you to investigate her visa and take necessary action to send her back to Nepal. Regards, Concerned Citizen from Nepal",

I think you've never seen what corruption can cause, or you pretend not to!  I'm from Brazil, and I'll give you an example of what corruption can do to a society.    Here, I saw young people being shot in favelas just for supporting opposition politicians, yes, ordinary people being killed for supporting the other side.  People were and are arrested, tortured, and killed on the unjust orders of corrupt politicians and judges.  The media, also corrupt, manipulates public opinion with false narratives or half-truths, always favoring the state, especially abroad. This has caused enormous polarization in the country, in addition to promoting many unjust laws.  My country is overrun by crime, and there are criminal factions that control entire regions (with the explicit support of the state), and you run a risk when you go out at night, you know? You can be robbed and killed at any moment, and nothing will be done to the criminal.  Education is also of extremely low quality, which has caused an absurd cultural and moral degradation among my people, who today lack even the capacity to think critically.  Salary increases for politicians without social approval are frequent here, and nothing happens. Search the amount of benefits they receive here.  We recently had a scandal involving millions of retirees being stolen against their will by banks and public agencies. What was the government's solution? To create more taxes to pay without punishing those who stole, and to try to inhibit investigations by using public funds to buy off those who would investigate. Search for \"INSS Scandal\".  The current president (rejected by the majority) has actively provoked other countries, especially the US, to create an open conflict between the two countries, precisely to use this as an excuse to remain in power while putting the lives of millions of people at risk.    Anyway, I could spend all day here giving examples of the harm corruption has caused in the society I live in. I recommend imagining how many future geniuses, entrepreneurs, inventors, and exemplary people for humanity could exist here, but won't, thanks to the corruption of some.  Imagine how prosperous societies would be if there weren't corrupt representatives making absurd and selfish decisions to benefit themselves and control others.    I understand that violence blinds people, and it's unpleasant to see someone in this situation, but we need to understand that in today's societies, we have two sides, one side that wants to live and enjoy life peacefully, and the other that wants to use your life to live like gods.   So, what would you prefer?    The people of Nepal are absolutely right to act as they are, and their politicians need to see what true justice is. They acted wrongly, harming thousands of people, and now they need to be punished, something that would never happen without the use of violence.   The corrupt state would never punish itself, and military forces serve and exist precisely to defend the state and its interests, meaning they would never be punished fairly, and even if they have surrendered, the disaster has already been caused, this surrender is just a way for them to try to avoid punishment, however, sooner or later, they will stab society in the back, and guess what, if society doesn't act, nothing will happen to them and their crimes!  Soon my country will go through something similar, and you will be able to see that it is not about revenge, it is about justice, something that unfortunately is disappearing in societies.  There's no point in trying to appear morally superior, evil people exist and will continue to commit atrocities, and if there are no violent reactions against them, everything will only get worse.|||Ajai kutnu partyo mardeko bhaye huntyo.

I am just a sincere, hardworking youth who remained silent because too many opinions create a ruckus. That's what I believed till September 8. When I went to the protest, it was all fine until they started firing. When you're in the battleground, all moralities go out the window. Yet, I did not throw a single stone at anyone and I am proud of that. I remained with the group who were peacefully protesting infront of the army van, I helped people with water to wash their face, tried picking up litters. The main point is I tried being a responsible person. But the moment I saw people being carried to the hospital with their blood spattering the streets, I fucking lost it. In retaliation, my protests became more louder. I came home late at night, tried my best to repost as many information I could. At one point, I felt like people should burn down the entire ministry down, all these nepo-babies should be brought to the streets to teach their parents how it feels to kill someone's child. I was furious, the word being an understatement. But seeing this people getting mob justice was what I never wanted. They don't deserve the least of anyone's sympathies, but we still have humanity in our hearts. That's what differs us from them.  I'm trying my best to control the narrative of why the protests happened, so that the opportunistic Indians, Chinese and the entire West may not take undue advantage of us.

Gen z’s true motive was to overthrow the government and that was achieved. they never intended to take up guns or engage in vandalism and that was not their goal. but many other people, parties or elements took advantage of the moment to cause destruction for their own selfish interests like Looting, hiding behind the anonymity of the crowd.  Because of this, even their own people are now suffering from security issues like the release of 1200 prisoners due to prison breaks. And now when crimes, harassment or problems occur, all of it is blamed entirely on Gen z  So please, stay cautious, awake, and.

I mean gross national happiness instead of gross national product. I believe every single country on this planet should take Bhutan as a role model a little bit more. Where else in the world are citizens asked what their main problems are and what they want from the government? And later, citizens are asked how satisfied they were with the government's performance. I know it's a bit naive of me to make such a suggestion from afar, as a sheltered European who is not really familiar with the form of government in Nepal.

And in the media, they try to appear close to the people, to be there for them, to advance the country by investing in infrastructure or new hospitals, etc. But no, a large part of your taxes ends up with the rulers themselves.

Experience isn’t a flaw, it’s literally the one thing that tells you someone can handle the chaos. You want to hand the country over to a rookie who has no clue how the system works, how politics works, or how to deal with the mess we’re already in? That’s not bravery, that’s stupidity.  We keep repeating the same mistakes because people get blinded by shiny new faces and ignore anyone who actually knows what they’re doing. Experience doesn’t mean someone is corrupt it means they’ve been in the trenches and survived. Throwing it away just to see if a “fresh face” can magically save everything is how you crash a country.  Nepal isn’t a playground. Leadership isn’t about hype, popularity, or being young and “green.” It’s about surviving the chaos, making tough decisions, and knowing where the landmines are. If you think a rookie can do that better than someone experienced, you’re dreaming and the whole nation will pay the price for it.",

Even if they have the intention and will to do so (like many of us want), they do not know how to run a country.

The thing is they have a lot more to learn and they will, with time.       This situation would not have happened if there were transfer of power to youth in timely manner. Now the rising youth leaders do not have experience because these corrupt politicians did not allow that.      What we need is a system where corruption should now be absolutely dreaded, seeing how corrupt politicians had to run away for thier life. They have to realize that people will not just punish the corrupt polticians, they will also punish whoever was responsible to prevent that.       There now needs to be a collaborative development with young leaders like Balen and experienced people like Sushila.

I truly want Sushila Karki to be prime minister, but according to our constitution it's not possible. And if we ditch our constitution our country is open for invasion from other countries. So, what's the best option it's BALEN. I know that he won't be able to run for prime minister for the next election but it is a risk we have to take. It's already proven that our protest was the result of different politicians 'parties'involvement. So, let's play it safe and try to choose the best result for us. Already many Indian politicians are saying that they are ready to deploy an army if needed. It's not goodwill but an invasion. So it's best we know what we do for the country.  But if it's possible for her to be prime minister without disturbing our constitution then I'm all for it. I also want a good leader who will work for the development of the country.   Indian is already eyeing the district like Lipilekh and Limpadhura. If we take too long to make a responsible decision, they are favourites to win the case.   The country is already in chaos. So we must do our best to calm it down. We protested against corruption and got unexpected results. We are not ready for it. And we don't have time to think about it and make a decision. But, we must make a decision and make it work, isn't it all there is to it ?    It's not that I don't support \"Sushila Karki\" . She has my full support. But if it is disturbing our core rules set by our constitution. I just thought it isn't right. So it's my request all my fellow citizens ( not just gen-z ) to make a right decision.   But my final warning is that if we defy our current constitution ourselves. It will not be a suprise other countries take advantage of it. So we shall make a decision ourselves and take the best route possible. But you've my support to make her ( Sushila Karki) intrim prime minister. It is the best result seeing her experience on political field.   It might have been a bit long for the attention span of gen-z but i just want to say that, neither the constitution nor the national rules be any shorter 😊.

So make a few preparations and make our country great again.|||Divide and rule going on same old tactics which works everytime.|||This stupid ando Balen supporter haru.

People are saying someone with no political background like KULMAN GHISING to directly elect a prime minister?? We need leaders, we need measures, we need to know what's good and bad. Most of the youths want to change countries I understand but they really don't know how. I fully support her for the interim one until further steps are taken.|||Absolutely agree. Sushila Karki is the perfect candidate for interim leadership. As Nepal’s first female Chief Justice, she has already proven her ability to lead with integrity and impartiality under immense political pressure. Her reputation for upholding the rule of law and fairness makes her uniquely qualified at a time when credibility is everything. Most importantly, she understands the mechanics and urgency of holding a fair election which is the single most crucial step to stabilizing the country right now. If we want an interim leader who is both capable and trusted by the public, there’s no better choice.|||people saying balen shoud be PM but in my opinion he is not suited for PM, not saying he is bad guy but i doubt he is good at making good relation with other countries, especially one we depend on the most.   she might be a good choice but as people says we need youth to lead the country so i cant say the otherwise,    but as a temporary PM i believe in her, at this time we need someone who can stablize the current situation, development is not the first priority for now,|||I agree for her.

Jalaide|||Yes thus is TRUE LOOK AT MY MOST RECENT POST|||please do this email to UN and OHCHR   To: registry@ohchr.org        info@ihrcworld.org        petitions@ohchr.org   Subject: Urgent Appeal: Violation of Human Rights in Nepal – Police Shooting School Studentsj   Dear United Nations Human Rights Council, I am writing to raise an urgent appeal regarding the grave human rights violations currently occurring in Nepal. Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.   Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.   Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||Jaha Bhetyo tehi thok saley madarchod lai...|||Aaos na india ma ni nepali xan birsyo kya|||Bro timro yo pic use garey haii Tiktok ma vid halchu|||kun desh jala teta bebasta garnu parxa|||yo machikne lai samatna paryo jasari bhaye ni yellai bachne kunai adhikar xaina|||Bhagey ra canada nai ja la, canada ma nee xodnu hudaina.

Lets first make sure state security, tax, bureaucracy and banking system be under central government. Then every other remaining ministry which needs localization be under province government.    Let there be 1 president directly elected by everyone to handle state security and 7 governor to handle province security, and 1 premier and 7 Magistrate to handle state & province tax, banking and bureaucracy. This way we will have clean central government in which no one can capture state function and minimize corruption.    Since we don't have any functioning people in power, either let lower house to vote for temporary governor and magistrate. No minister, let bureaucracy handle them under strict scrutiny of Governor and Magistrate.    Then start a fresh election, 1 President, 7 Governors, 1 Premier, 7 Magistrates, Lower House or Province Parliament member, then from each Province send 10 representative in Upper House/Federal Parliament 3 voted by Lower House/Province Parliament, 5 directly elected in Upper House and 2 votes each from Province Governor and Province Magistrate. Let the bill for Upper House be registered by directly elected member of Upper House. Upper house will vote for foreign minister, ambassadors and diplomats.   For now, either make Mayor and Deputy Mayor of each capital of Province to be interim Governor and Magistrate to bring law and order in state-province security and function. After election they will go back to be Mayor and Deputy Mayor.     Why all this?

I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both.

BTW, Gen Z doesn’t just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didn’t exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who weren’t even present for the protests claim we don’t know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldn’t even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, ‘We have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server you’re all listening to is just for public discussion’. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal. Now that it’s been confirmed everywhere and with Balen posting that the Gen Z’s choice former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Sushila Karki is the right choice for interim prime minister of Nepal, we look forward to what comes next.|||https://new-nepal-voting.vercel.app/  Vote here or suggest names I can add|||For interim formation CJ Sushila Karki would be the perfect choice.

Nothing was going to change if things didn’t go south. Personally, I didn’t see the government making any changes with a peaceful protest. Even when we look at history of the world, majority of peaceful protest start peaceful and end violently. No entity in power ever gives it up easily.  Change was what we asked for and change is what we are getting. Not exactly the way we wanted things to go but seems clear from the comments that we all knew, in the back of our minds, it was never going to be a straight road to Rome.  So I believe it’s high time we look ahead and bring the same energy we did to the protests to ensure that we see the change we want to see happen and bring in leaders we believe in.

My soul hurts to see violence, arson, anarchy, and the loot and burning of our national properties. We, Gen-Z, seem to have won, yet feel lost. Hope feels lost. Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? I’ve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we can’t let our nation fail.** We can’t let our nation burn. We can’t let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**     **1) We lay down our weapons.**   We came in peace, we protested in peace, and we’ve always wanted peace. We shall end this in peace. Be it known that anybody inciting violence isn’t part of our movement.     **2) We extend love.**   Love towards our brothers and sisters, love towards our nation, love towards our neighbours, our society, and the opposing side. The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.     **3) We wear white.**   White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that we’ve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.     **4) We have hope.**   Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.     Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.     Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.     Sincerely,   Pantji, a Gen-Z |||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Why not sagar Dhakal?|||Yesss|||Just promote it in your social media handle|||K bhairacha yarr discord ma pm choose bhairacha|||Ahile non political manxe thik huncha...her or Dr सन्दुक Ruit.

The president on her cabinet's recommendation dissolves the house of Representatives, 5. Her cabinet carries forward the corruption investigation and reconstruction. 6.

A message from a clear headed Indian with zero agenda. Please understand these below points very well: 1. While activism is a great way to excel IDE agency understand that it’s a double edged sword.  2. More often than not, vested interest groups will take this sword and swing it at people in power to cause unrest under the protection of protestors, bringing the protestors a bad name  3. Never under estimate the collective stupidity of a society, it is very easy to get a mob of moderately charged people to go crazy and get into arsony 4. Even a coward will act like an opportunistic lion in a mob  5. Get a hold of your ngo sector that is spreading anti govt hate. Every government is corrupt in this world but your echo chamber is so strong that some vested group could take so much advantage of your youths mind. This is very dangerous.  6. They have to make an example of all the people who have damaged the state property. In India yogi the CM of UP rounded everyone up and bulldozed their homes over night and has warned that if you destroy govt property govt will destroy your property 7. Even now in India we keep seeing anti social elements working in the “social” sector and trying to topple Modi or bring disreputation but Modi Ji is a master in handling these people and he has kept a special name for them “andolan jeevi”  Please take care of your country folks.  I’ve known a lot of Nepali friends in India, all of whom are very friendly, proud, hard working people. This riot is definitely not to be allowed to form an image of your country.  Just look at the optics of it all as an international person. Protesting isn’t bad but who will want to project an image of Nepal where your parliament is on fire? Is this a message? Or is this symbolic?   Decide better dear friends.|||We are fucked up now things are going out of hand we should stop for now .

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen. When the police and the army refused to shoot, the old order was already finished.__  **I am not a political scientist, just a hobbyist, I may be wrong.**|||High possibility OF THISSS|||Maybe but not entirely garnu bela tod fod garyeu parliament jalayeu manxe jalayo ani accountability line bela ma aru lai dosh,Kati economical crisis hunxa aba|||Prachanda and men who are into dopamine shits|||No|||Him or Gyanendra.

Rather than looking outwards to pin 📌 the chaos, it's important that we self reflect. This movement was started to hold those who've wronged our nation accountable but if we ourselves don't hold us accountable for yesterday's actions then we've lost the cause.  I beg that we don't dilute the blood spent in the last 48 years to any conspiracy.  जे भयो, गलत भयो । हामीले हिजोको घटनाक्रबाट आम नेपाली नागरिकको मनस्थिति भुज्यौं, हामीमा अझै पनि सुझबुझ छैन भनेर प्रमाणित गर्यौ।  तर अब के गर्ने भन्ने प्रश्न महत्पूर्ण छ - अब को छलफल त्यसमा हुनु पर्छ जस्तो लाग्छ।  We need law and order to end this chaos otherwise opportunists will prevail.   I might be wrong, but I believe, dissolution of the current parliament, an interim government led by candidates \"from the people, by the people, for the people\" - in it's truest sense, followed by a constitution reform for a directly elected state head is the answer.|||Prachanda has a history of working with RAW agency|||CIA?|||U janme Dekhi Nepal ma ashanti aako ho.|||even if he isn't he still needs to be brought to justice. kata lukeko xa yo chor.|||https://preview.redd.it/5spe7l1kqaof1.jpeg?width=945&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff0d5c200ef042d362e6344ad5b4e5d44dfd8e5e|||Probably|||https://preview.redd.it/qa507b014bof1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=594aa8a1c71a75c3eed28738e71393a88338e07f|||Yes he is one of them, mass murderer 😡😡|||Yes maathi inquiry garna mildaina without any influence aba.

I think we can't really blame them if they are taking information form joley media of Nepal.|||I hope people of Nepal are not falling for the same trap that destroyed Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. What looked like a well organised protest against govt, soon uncovered itself as regime change operations by deep state.|||We Support Nepal 🇮🇳|||He hardly has any reach tbh. He is rather seen as a clown who has been trying to incite youth against the establishment since more than 7 years now but fails terribly at it. Most of his views on youtube are manipulated & paid (bots etc). & a chunk of his viewership is rather from Pakistan & Bangladesh.  Edit: Also he is lying.|||Most well informed Indians are aware that this dissent had been brewing for quite sometime. Wish my Nepali bros and sis the best of luck and kudos for taking back what is rightfully yours . Hopefully the guilty are brought to justice, order is restored and right representatives are assigned to take Nepal forward for all its wonderful people. As for our media, they sell whatever gets views from the masses, tomorrow if Sita maa has comeback to be the Queen of Nepal sells, they'll start posting that, organizing debate sessions with clown for cheap entertainment. 🤡 I pray the martry RIP, their families fairly and properly compensated , justice is fast tracked, and a votes held  new govt formation.  Goodspeed Nepalis. 🇳🇵|||Dhruv Rathee is fucking sellout.  He is scam, biased and no body takes him seriously.  His startup was also a scam.|||This mf is just an islamist puppet. We don't need him.|||Bruh, this guy is a charlatan.|||Broken clock moment for Agent Dhruv Rathee - do not fall for his propaganda. I am not sure which media is being blamed here but what I see is that the media channels are saying the “Anti corruption “ protests.   Low IQ news media doesn’t count as even Indians know that they are sensationalise everything|||I’m Indian! There is no propaganda. KP Oli is hated by India and Indians, so Infact we support it.  Indians think KP Oli has- 1) Ruined ties with India, keeps making claims that Ayodhya is actually in Nepal  2) CCP puppet, keeps insulting India and chooses china  3) Hasn’t visited India in 4 years he’s been PM, even though India and Nepal are very important partners.   Guys the Modi government is NOT a supporter of KP Oli, the news articles are misinformed and have low knowledge & context about the events in Nepal. I hope our Nepali brethren understand this on our behalf. Thank you 🙏|||Don't fall for him Nepali brothers , he has his own personal interests. Indians are with You 🇳🇵🇮🇳|||OP more than india he has more reach in pakistan and bangladesh 🤣|||Indian media is saying that this was a protest against corruption. dhruv rathee always has his agenda. He is the one who is misleading|||Right message, wrong messenger|||Even Indians don't take Dhruv Rathee seriously. We only care about peace and tranquility in Nepal.|||I don't trust him lol, he is a hardcore communist|||He is late as always trying to prove his clowness , media already started to show the true reasons for the protest|||There seems to be no valid narrative. If it was against corruption then the protest should have stopped after government stepping down. But what happened after that - people are destroying and burning their country’s asset, their parliament, airports and banks etc - this is not the way it should have gone down if this was about corruption only.   Now instead of corruption in the office it’s anarchy on the streets.|||total international media is reporting it as social media but india ==godi  the reason i hate these nepalis|||Western media were reporting the same no?|||His favorite president Trump can't wait to start acting as president of Nepal. Definitely US is definitely behind this.|||Don't believe in this joker.|||Why nepalis are so obsessed with what indian and indian media is saying, why don't they focus on what chinese media is saying as they consider china as their friend so why worry or think about what indian are saying, they don't consider india as their friend so why so much focus on india?|||If you think Dhruv Rathee is telling the truth, then I have an Eiffel Tower to sell you. This person is a grade A propagandist of the anti-BJP front. All his tweets are made on the behest of his masters, and he has been called out multiple times for this.|||FYI—-> Social media isn’t just mirroring conflicts happening in schools and on streets – it’s triggering new ones!|||he is against modi gov only.|||Dhruv Rathee is one of the people who remains a part of opposition forever. That doesn’t mean he is wrong always but sometimes yes! It is not just Indian media it is international media but most of them are correcting themselves now which is good. Although his comments are still wrong in many ways. Social media ban was a ignition for this protest because corruption is going on from a longtime. But people should think what’s next? Youth leaders are going to step up and take positions to govern? Do they have that kind of unity? And do you think don’t they turn into corrupt due to powers? Great initiative by youth but think about what’s next |||All of us Indians know this. What are you saying?|||I don't know what are you talking about. Most coverage of Indian media is overtly positive.   This is because our love towards Nepal is same as our hate towards that Chinese puppet Oli.   If you see any doubt in our media or people, it is because we have a slight doubt if CIA or ISI will start using Nepal as a ground to disturb India.   Nepal can be a smaller country, but they are much more older nation state than us with full of brilliant souls and whatever Nepalis choose for their country, we respect that from core.  But never think this Rathee fellow has any love towards you guys. He's just putting gun over your shoulder to attack India. He is not even an Indian citizen. He is a compromised soul to the highest bidder.|||German shepherd....he only spreads propaganda...beware of him .... Nepal|||This dhruv rati guy is himself an idiot 🤣🤣|||If you consider German/US funded Dhruv Rathee as flag bearer of honest opinion then you have fallen for exactly the narrative that the 'west' wants you to believe.  Mental colonization happens much before the physical one, this has already happened in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Pakistan look where they are at this time  Beware whom you trust and what you believe.|||It's actually USA, they did the same to Bangladesh last year |||Yesterday I saw a nepali post on Instagram where an Indian mentioned in the comment that the same protest should be done in India and everyone was bashing that guy and calling him out for bringing India in the topic. I hope they see this post|||[removed]|||[removed]|||I'm from Bihar India idk about this situation so I'm here for reading what's going on|||India has (rightly) stayed out of this. It's an internal issue of Nepal and we wish them peace and prosperity. Let normalcy be restored soon.|||Why you even taking him seriously.|||It's quite obvious to everyone in India, except the media narrative. I doubt anyone here believes that our Nepali brothers were protesting to assert their right to doomscroll.  People don't go to extremes in protesting against social media.  And govts don't ban all social media apps, just because the companies didn't \"register with them\". they do it, because they see the narrative has gone against them, and they desperately want to gain back the control.|||This guy ain’t even an Indian citizen|||[https://youtu.be/CXEMBDjnoWU?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/CXEMBDjnoWU?feature=shared) watch this|||This guy has some personal beef with modi and his party . He links every issue to modi and his fellow colleagues.|||My opnion as an Indian here(this is the mainstream feeling.) 1. Even though Nepal is a separate country, we are the same people. We have civilization connect that exists for thousands of years. Far before countries as a concept existed. Seeing our people in pain hurts us. 2. Indian mainstream media is shit. Even we don't entertain them. Each passing day their credibility is decreasing in India. 3. Dhruv rathi is also shit. Even his credibility is decreasing each passing day. One hypocrisy at a time. 4. From the bottom of our hearts we hope things calm down there and change for the better for the people of Nepal. I am sure if Nepal wants, the govt in India would love to help however possible (No strings attached) not unlike the hand we gave to srilanka in their time of need Because we understand what it is like to go through a state of political unrest. India did not have the help it needed in our time of political unrest. We will make sure our friendly neighbors dont face the same.|||German Shepherd is here|||And here is the video I made on Nepal and it’s issue with Nepal government.   What’s wrong with Nepal? | GenZ Revolt | Nepal Protests Explained | MysteryKiAwaaz https://youtu.be/6Pj6jBY4n40|||Nepal, you are dealing with dangerous, insecure, violent crybullies who don't care about reasons and motives because they'll just come up with fake news and use that is their motive. Good luck.|||Man , this guy is cursed. Whenever his name appears , chaddis flock to it like screaming \" PROPAGANDA\" ,  like moths to a flame.   Stay safe, Nepali bros.|||Lol i m from india as thought that this was abt social media in the morning🤦🏻‍♂️ now understood the real motive...|||I believe Nepal needs a revolution. I have visited the country many times and have relatives involved in politics, so I am aware of the real situation. People are struggling to find jobs, there is a shortage of roads, and corruption levels are too high.||| so proud of your protested and how your new generation handled the currupt officials but sadly indian youth are still stuck bootlicking|||Because that's what the Godi media does. Indian politicians must either be shitting themselves or laughing knowing this won't happen in India as long as they continue building temples and not schools.|||To my Nepali brothers, any Redditor who is more focused on the messenger rather than the message mentioned, click on their profile and block them. They are more concerned about their agenda's useless buffons.   To the people of Nepal, I hope a better and stronger government arises from the ashes that focuses on development, literacy and is corruption-free.|||When has godi media shown reality?|||Because the Indian govt wants Nepal to be destabilized enough to be too weak, divided & afraid to challenge India when it can use the crisis as a pretext to invade & annex Nepal.",

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4. Retirement age and term limits: This is a must, we need a clear retirement age for the public positions just like other jobs.     These sort of things are fundamental of any country, without getting the fundamentals right we cannot expect our country to do better. We have a chance to make things better, lets take this chance.|||also i think! what lessons can be learned from Bangladesh last year?|||Garni nai ho vani presidency system lyauni.

Just wanted to express supreme respect to you from Ukraine.   You're really cool!   We had protests in 2014.   We made lot of mistakes after succeded in throwing down Yanukovich in 2014.

After five years people were tricked and during war elected complete scammers after watching \"servant of nation\" series with current president in main role.   Now we get kidnapping peoples on streets by police and conscripted forcely to war or you can get out for $10k until kidnapped next time. People get beaten and sometimes murdered in basements by military guys supported by police.   Escaping from country costs minimum $10k, but sometimes 20 and more just for crossing border without guarantees of success.

No consultation, no delay. Constitutional legitimacy + protester acceptance = only viable option.  # 2. PROTESTER LEADERSHIP PIVOT  Gen Z groups must **immediately shift messaging**:  * \"Our revolution is being hijacked\" * \"Military rule = permanent corruption\" * **Name specific civilian demands**: New constitution, elections in 1 year  # 3. ARMY FACE-SAVING EXIT  New interim government must **publicly thank Army Chief Sigdel** for \"preserving democracy\" and **offer ceremonial role** in transition (advisory only, no executive power).  # 4. EMERGENCY UNITY GOVERNMENT  * Sumana Shrestha as PM * Balen Shah as Deputy PM * **3 Gen Z representatives** in cabinet * **Clear 12-month timeline** to new elections  # 5. INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION BLITZ  India, China, UN must **immediately recognize** any civilian arrangement. Every hour of delay gives military justification for intervention.  **THE WINDOW IS 6-8 HOURS MAX**. After that, the army's 10 PM ultimatum becomes permanent control.  **Key insight**: Don't fight the chaos - channel it into civilian transition before military \"restores order\" permanently.  **Act NOW or lose democracy for decades.**|||Is birgunj safe to visit today?

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

They belittled the Bangladesh protests similarly and painted it as Muslims vs Hindus in Bangladesh. They paint a high opinion of the fugitive Shaik Hasina but curse Nobel laureate Mohammed Yunus. Indian media is the judge, jury and executioner of all the happenings in Nepal, Bangladesh, Srilanka and Pakistan. According to them, India is Ramarajya but others were Raavan rajya. India has become a dead democracy in the past decade. We have no jobs, extremely costly education and no health. We are just scrapping by but nothing to show as the media paints cooked up Indian GDP. Baba's have become politicians, industrialists and millionaires. Politicians just encourage the industry of religion. Their children reap the benefits and others' children subsist on rationed rice.

AKA the daughter of a corrupt leader, the Chief Development Officer of Kathmandu, Nepal, Chhabi Rijal, who ordered gunfire in a peaceful protest that took place in Nepal on the 8th of September. The protest that took place against a corrupt government resulted in the loss of 20 individuals, some of whom were minors present in school uniforms, and hundreds were injured.   This is what we got for speaking against a government that has leeched off of taxpayers' money. We request an immediate dismissal of Sweta Rijal's candidacy at your esteemed institution. We, as Nepali people, condemn the actions of her immediate family and believe that her degree, funded by her very disliked father, will be of NO USE to our country.

A shift to a fully directly elected system for every seat would ensure greater accountability and public representation. 2. **Establish a Directly Elected Executive Head:** Instead of the parliament choosing the Prime Minister, the call is for a directly elected President or Prime Minister with full executive powers. This would provide a stable government for a fixed term, preventing the \"share-the-power\" politics that have led to instability.|||Also follow what's in constitution, according to constitution of Nepal, people outside of Nepal should be able to vote through embassy, but in reality we can't.|||No regegnation, country out|||So y'all are asking for resignation after kids dead in their school uniform.

It’s tragic, because they also have families back home and face the same struggles as the rest of us. They should be victims of this system too, yet they show little compassion or critical thought about what’s happening around them. Why are there protests in the first place? I refuse to believe they're blind to people's frustration and the direction the country is heading.  I still remember when we joined a protest 14–15 years ago. The police confronted us aggressively, and as kids we were too confused to react. Fortunately, we just stood there processing and visibly confused, and they left — but I still shudder to think, *what if our reaction had been different?* Today’s young protestors are in the same position, pure in their intentions, simply voicing frustration without wanting harm.  And honestly, credit must go to these protestors. They know exactly what they are standing for, unlike us back then who needed adults to organise us. I don’t see how demonstrations could be any more peaceful than they already are — especially when the very leaders being protested against have blood on their hands from before this generation was even born.|||Yo bhatey haru kahi gayera sitcha holani|||randi baan machikne haru|||I mean this tracks, they only like when you're corrupt|||Its not andolan anymore its war|||We want death or at lease exile of KP Oli and other taukes.|||Randi haruko photo, name, address patta lagau.|||khate haru mug haru padne bela ma padenan aile mug ko mug ko chak sugera manche lai dukha dinxan. timi mug haru le esto dukha dekhnu paros jatha haru. maa gali pani dina sakdina timi haru ko aama ko galti haina timi haru jasta janmie. aama lai k thaaa. tara kailei bhalo nahos timi haru jasta ko. timi haru marna pani na paos bachna pani na paos.|||shamelss dogs of government|||Machikne radi harlai lakhetdai marnaparne|||Thuiyaa police vanauda haruuu|||you radiko ban harulai agolauno man xa|||ma sanga pani ganhune bhaye, kassam mardinthe radieekko ban|||Mathi bata aako order re ????

The worst were not burnt alive or shamed publicly or got stripped off their clothing. While innocent kind person like jhala nath khanal's wife had to suffer intoxication, suffocation, excessive heat, first degree burns and later succumb to the injuries. The motive of movement was needed and right, the approach can be justified but the actions and aftermath were just unnecessary overkill.

People are saying that 'those were not genz' stfu there DEFINITELY were genz in the crowd that beat up and killed these people. The moment buildings started getting burned down, people started becoming feral with the sense of collective power and destruction that they could bring, and they screwed up. They guided their anger and frustration of seeing kids killed into becoming the same species of monsters that they were initially fighting against. More than the corrupt government firing bullets toward us that day, the ignorant and aggrieved crowd scared me the most. Stealing and picking up guns from the chased police, i really thought that we might see the maoist reenactment that day. The mentality to bring 'an eye for an eye' made everyone senseless. People were celebrating their actions of arson, vandalism, theft, and destruction. If these people aren't the same as the maoist and criminals locked up in jail, then wtf are they?? Maoist also consisted of the young generation of that time. I believe its the ignorance and the petty sense of 'mauka ma chauka' that led these people to terrorise their own country. Sure, the angry crowd may have been incited by some wrong intended individuals at times, however, to feel satisfaction upon seeing beat up people and bloody bodies is insane. The reason bhatbhatini, Ncell, kantipur, imp govt buildings burned down is because of these IGNORANT SENSLESS FUCKING MORONS THAT COULDN'T EVEN DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN PROTEST AND VIOLENCE. There is a reason corrupt govt existed in this country, its the people that gave birth to them. And its going to happen again and again like it has always been in the history.

There are international players in the game. The whole revolution thing was a regime change operation like which happened in Ukraine, Libya, Bangladesh. They used the youth for regime change to install their puppet government. Sad to say that our leaders are groomed to be used in the politics in the future. Looks like our neighbor used their proxies in Nepal to overtake Deep state regime change operation from the west. If we are not vigilant, we are going to get another Zelenski and Nepal may turn into another Ukraine. UN forces and Indian forces are very active to get into Nepal. Things change rapidly in geopolitics. Achieving this revolution within 24 to 48 hours is in itself very suspicious. All seems like preplanned operation.

In this case, it is not like that. Protestors ( violent non gen z's) they had given everyone time to evacuate the building, but she did not evacuate. Most likely cuz she was scared of the mob outside. The people outthere assumed it was empty, hence they started burning it. When people realized that women was inside the building, people came to her rescue. Unfortunately, she suffered from burn, reported to be 15% do far. Fortunately, she survived and is recovering. Even though I do not agree with what happened, I hate the narrative of us just burning a women.   Second where was this empathy for the kids that got shot? Where was this empathy for mothers and fathers that lost their children? Where was this empathy for grandfather and grandmother that lost their kids and grandkids? Where was this empathy when millions of people suffered? Where was this empathy when our voices about to be silenced?   Yes, we screwed up but before coming out and trying to shame or guilt trip us, ask yourself are you empathetic cuz you saw the video of her or are you genuinely empathetic cuz of the act? Do we all need our sufferings recorded and made public for people to feel empathetic?   Also ask yourself, people chased, dragged and beat corrupted politicians, but not of them were killed. Do you think people would burn and kill some corrupted politicians wife? If they would, then you would have seen lots of dead politicians by now.  Also I just checked your profile, you are an Indian. How can an Indian citizen empathize with Nepali people when you have not suffered under the regime we suffered. Don't just blindly follow what is being shown in your media. Do some research and you will find the truth yourself.|||Fuck, People are starting to say Save the Constitution. Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):** The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):** If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):** If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):** If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||I totally agree with this .|||Aa judai vako mancha lai kati coti marchas, sala indian godi media ko Veda.|||[deleted]|||Why are indians interfer in our business again?

People watched her speech where she said stuff like, “What’s my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?”  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still don’t have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we don’t have the right connections.  We don’t get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, it’s still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? That’s probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  We’re out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor people’s kids not boil?  On top of that, there’s already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent. Because this have  been suppressed for so long, and now the mindset is like — “If we can’t reach anywhere through the system, then we might as well destroy it.”  And even if some third party tries to trigger people, the truth is, it was already there deep down in their subconscious. This is just it coming out.

All our neighbourhood is in chaos be it Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and now Nepal. We have seen a similar hostility in Maldives as well as toppling of govt in Myanmar. I am unsure about the politics of Prachanda but from different forums are calling him out as villian which makes me wonder if he really is or someone/ some entity is framing him.

The real issue is bringing change in the constitution, i.e., a representative should not be above a certain age and should be allowed to seek votes only for one term. Take that in writing from the concerned representative, live, and show it to the world clearly. Also, please do not discriminate by saying someone is from the “Stone Age,” as such remarks can hurt the sentiments of people who are not from cities.|||He is not educated, he does not have the capabilities of being head of government.

            "body": "What comes next? The only reason Nepal isn't going through a complete currency de-valuation and a bank run is because of the rupee peg. We need to tread water carefully. (**Bank run** is a situation where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a bank simultaneously, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or financial stability. This can lead to liquidity problems for the bank, as it may not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands. Bank runs can create a cycle of panic, potentially leading to the bank's failure.)  The real pain starts after the protests have calmed. Economic crash is certain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh both went through it. Stock market/real estate crash, inflation and what not.  Whoever takes charge next, likely Balen, will need to address the pointless 'Greater Nepal' rhetoric and become a moderate on this issue. Thanks to Trump, India-China relationship is stable for the first time in ages. The only way Nepal has a future is pledge allegiance to both neighbour's.  Bangladesh under Yunus has been a pain in the ass for India. Nepal cannot make the same mistake. Any wrong steps and a free floating Nepali rupee against the dollar would go from 140 now to 25,000 like similar countries in our GDP range. Probably worse since our economy is in much worse shape. ($1 = Lao Kip 21,631.66 LAK)  Nepal needs one stable leader for the next 40 yrs. No interim gov paving way for elections bullshit. Forget the democracy experiment. It does not work in poor, illiterate countries.",

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.   Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.   Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||How credible is this info?|||Use bitchat for conversation.

            "comments": "We are living in a moment where anger is boiling over. People are tired of corruption, censorship, and being silenced. Many of us are ready to take to the streets on Sept 8. But before we move forward, we must stop and think carefully.  History has shown us what happens when we rush in without preparation. In Bangladesh last year, in Sri Lanka not long ago, ordinary people gave their lives while corrupt leaders fled the country with protection and comfort. Their deaths were forgotten within weeks, while the guilty walked free. If we are not careful, Nepal risks becoming the next chapter in that same tragic story.  That is why this movement must be different. We cannot afford to be reckless. We must protect our people, keep our voices peaceful, and make sure the world is watching every step so that accountability cannot be erased.  Here is what we need to do before Sept 8:  * Get international human rights groups, UN observers, and peace monitors involved beforehand so there are eyes on the ground. * Publish clear and peaceful agendas so nobody can label us as rioters or mobs. * Document everything with photos, videos, and testimonies. Every arrest and every injury must be recorded and shared. * Avoid following local leaders who are affiliated with political parties. Big parties will try to infiltrate, hijack, and twist this movement for their own gain. * Know who is truly standing beside you. Trust matters because infiltrators can turn peaceful protests into chaos.  This movement is about dignity, rights, and accountability. It is not about violence. It is not about revenge. If we lose focus, if we let anger replace strategy, then we risk repeating the same cycle where the powerful walk free and ordinary people pay with their lives.  Nepal deserves better. The world must see us not as mobs, but as citizens united for freedom and justice. If we do this right, our voices will be impossible to silence. If we do this wrong, we risk being forgotten like so many before us.  Stay safe. Stay peaceful. Stay smart.",

They could've ended the war after getting what they wanted to, but they didnt. Some noticed this but most were busy fighting.  Finally, Shanks (A big personality in the show) came and stopped the war.

Emails: grad@uci.edu reportfraudtips@uscis.dhs.gov Subject: Urgent Concern Regarding Sweta Rijal’s Status Dear Graduate Office/USCIS/ICE, I am writing about Sweta Rijal, a political science student at your university. She is the daughter of Chabi Rijal, a communist leader and Chief District Officer in Nepal, who recently ordered a shoot-on-sight against youth peacefully protesting corruption in Nepal. His orders have killed over 18 innocent people, injured more than 100 students, and more deaths are expected. This is pure fascism and a gross misuse of power. Young people in a peaceful protest were shot dead, which is totally unacceptable. While our brothers and sisters die in Nepal, Sweta Rijal has no right to study in the US with money from corruption. Her entire funding is from the money from corruption. The US, as a democratic country and a voice for the UN, stands for freedom and justice. Allowing her to stay contradicts everything the US represents. We are struggling to fight this battle in Nepal, and she must be held accountable. I urge you to investigate her visa and take necessary action to send her back to Nepal. Regards, Concerned Citizen from Nepal",

I have made a change where a non-technical person can report a case anonymously using Google forms and I (or someone who wants to volunteer) can update the data manually. This is the easiest way for now.   2. I am on a vacation right now so I am working on this on my free time so I might respond slowly. But I will continue on reviewing/making changes.  3.

It would be powerful to add a feature that sends daily push notifications counting the days since justice has not been delivered in major cases—like the Nirmala Panta murder, the Bhutanese refugee scam, the Budhanilkantha hit-and-run, and other unresolved cases in Nepal. This way, people don’t just raise their voices once and forget; they receive a daily reminder that keeps public attention and pressure alive until justice is served.|||Dammi initiative but contributions are too technical.

I think you've never seen what corruption can cause, or you pretend not to!  I'm from Brazil, and I'll give you an example of what corruption can do to a society.    Here, I saw young people being shot in favelas just for supporting opposition politicians, yes, ordinary people being killed for supporting the other side.  People were and are arrested, tortured, and killed on the unjust orders of corrupt politicians and judges.  The media, also corrupt, manipulates public opinion with false narratives or half-truths, always favoring the state, especially abroad. This has caused enormous polarization in the country, in addition to promoting many unjust laws.  My country is overrun by crime, and there are criminal factions that control entire regions (with the explicit support of the state), and you run a risk when you go out at night, you know? You can be robbed and killed at any moment, and nothing will be done to the criminal.  Education is also of extremely low quality, which has caused an absurd cultural and moral degradation among my people, who today lack even the capacity to think critically.  Salary increases for politicians without social approval are frequent here, and nothing happens. Search the amount of benefits they receive here.  We recently had a scandal involving millions of retirees being stolen against their will by banks and public agencies. What was the government's solution? To create more taxes to pay without punishing those who stole, and to try to inhibit investigations by using public funds to buy off those who would investigate. Search for \"INSS Scandal\".  The current president (rejected by the majority) has actively provoked other countries, especially the US, to create an open conflict between the two countries, precisely to use this as an excuse to remain in power while putting the lives of millions of people at risk.    Anyway, I could spend all day here giving examples of the harm corruption has caused in the society I live in. I recommend imagining how many future geniuses, entrepreneurs, inventors, and exemplary people for humanity could exist here, but won't, thanks to the corruption of some.  Imagine how prosperous societies would be if there weren't corrupt representatives making absurd and selfish decisions to benefit themselves and control others.    I understand that violence blinds people, and it's unpleasant to see someone in this situation, but we need to understand that in today's societies, we have two sides, one side that wants to live and enjoy life peacefully, and the other that wants to use your life to live like gods.   So, what would you prefer?    The people of Nepal are absolutely right to act as they are, and their politicians need to see what true justice is. They acted wrongly, harming thousands of people, and now they need to be punished, something that would never happen without the use of violence.   The corrupt state would never punish itself, and military forces serve and exist precisely to defend the state and its interests, meaning they would never be punished fairly, and even if they have surrendered, the disaster has already been caused, this surrender is just a way for them to try to avoid punishment, however, sooner or later, they will stab society in the back, and guess what, if society doesn't act, nothing will happen to them and their crimes!  Soon my country will go through something similar, and you will be able to see that it is not about revenge, it is about justice, something that unfortunately is disappearing in societies.  There's no point in trying to appear morally superior, evil people exist and will continue to commit atrocities, and if there are no violent reactions against them, everything will only get worse.|||Ajai kutnu partyo mardeko bhaye huntyo.

I am just a sincere, hardworking youth who remained silent because too many opinions create a ruckus. That's what I believed till September 8. When I went to the protest, it was all fine until they started firing. When you're in the battleground, all moralities go out the window. Yet, I did not throw a single stone at anyone and I am proud of that. I remained with the group who were peacefully protesting infront of the army van, I helped people with water to wash their face, tried picking up litters. The main point is I tried being a responsible person. But the moment I saw people being carried to the hospital with their blood spattering the streets, I fucking lost it. In retaliation, my protests became more louder. I came home late at night, tried my best to repost as many information I could. At one point, I felt like people should burn down the entire ministry down, all these nepo-babies should be brought to the streets to teach their parents how it feels to kill someone's child. I was furious, the word being an understatement. But seeing this people getting mob justice was what I never wanted. They don't deserve the least of anyone's sympathies, but we still have humanity in our hearts. That's what differs us from them.  I'm trying my best to control the narrative of why the protests happened, so that the opportunistic Indians, Chinese and the entire West may not take undue advantage of us.

Legacies don’t entitle children to power. Competence, accountability, and public trust do.  You’re not being attacked, you’re being questioned. And if your only answer is to call others “small-minded” and “ungrateful,” then maybe you’re not as prepared to face criticism as you think. Respect is earned in every generation, not inherited like land or a business.  The days of hiding behind the achievements of the past are over. If you want respect for your family, prove it through your own actions, not by silencing criticism or demanding loyalty based on history.|||French revolution Bata sikna paryo kei|||I fwwww it.

One should not act out of rage; the government will try to justify its shooting with it. This is a serious matter; lives were lost. People need to give this situation a lot of thought and ensure there's an agenda. A country cannot always be in conflict. If we are seeking a new government, there should be a manifesto, a goal, and an aim worth fighting for. Where are we going from there? What's our next step?|||aba next step vaneko political parties free nepal ho...harek taha ma no political parties...local level dekhi pradesh ra kendra savai ma independent umedwar matra uthnu paryo...political parties ko life ma kahilei membership liyeka haru lai boycott garum...savai politicos ra higher position ma baseka savai ko property investigation hunu parcha...aba feri yehi political patry system ma farkera hunna na ta yehi corrupt bureaucracy ko continuation le huncha|||Bro, is slowly understanding what democracy is.|||these tyrants are just abusing their power and keep getting away with it...such cruelty...|||So true.Resignation is not enough.

I mean gross national happiness instead of gross national product. I believe every single country on this planet should take Bhutan as a role model a little bit more. Where else in the world are citizens asked what their main problems are and what they want from the government? And later, citizens are asked how satisfied they were with the government's performance. I know it's a bit naive of me to make such a suggestion from afar, as a sheltered European who is not really familiar with the form of government in Nepal. But it seems to be similar in many, many countries. Those in power often hold office and positions of honor for decades through their family ties. And they are similar in their decadence. The most expensive clothes, the biggest cars, houses, and palaces. Flying to New York for dinner in a private jet, or to Monaco for F1, or around the globe in a yacht as long as a soccer field. And in the media, they try to appear close to the people, to be there for them, to advance the country by investing in infrastructure or new hospitals, etc. But no, a large part of your taxes ends up with the rulers themselves. The rich and powerful acquire more wealth and more power. Money rules the world!

Experience isn’t a flaw, it’s literally the one thing that tells you someone can handle the chaos. You want to hand the country over to a rookie who has no clue how the system works, how politics works, or how to deal with the mess we’re already in? That’s not bravery, that’s stupidity.  We keep repeating the same mistakes because people get blinded by shiny new faces and ignore anyone who actually knows what they’re doing. Experience doesn’t mean someone is corrupt it means they’ve been in the trenches and survived. Throwing it away just to see if a “fresh face” can magically save everything is how you crash a country.  Nepal isn’t a playground. Leadership isn’t about hype, popularity, or being young and “green.” It’s about surviving the chaos, making tough decisions, and knowing where the landmines are. If you think a rookie can do that better than someone experienced, you’re dreaming and the whole nation will pay the price for it.",

Even if they have the intention and will to do so (like many of us want), they do not know how to run a country. I see them as ineffective in running even a municipality (maybe that was because of politics and in-cooperation from party elected ward heads). The thing is they have a lot more to learn and they will, with time.       This situation would not have happened if there were transfer of power to youth in timely manner. Now the rising youth leaders do not have experience because these corrupt politicians did not allow that.      What we need is a system where corruption should now be absolutely dreaded, seeing how corrupt politicians had to run away for thier life. They have to realize that people will not just punish the corrupt polticians, they will also punish whoever was responsible to prevent that.       There now needs to be a collaborative development with young leaders like Balen and experienced people like Sushila.

I truly want Sushila Karki to be prime minister, but according to our constitution it's not possible. And if we ditch our constitution our country is open for invasion from other countries. So, what's the best option it's BALEN. I know that he won't be able to run for prime minister for the next election but it is a risk we have to take. It's already proven that our protest was the result of different politicians 'parties'involvement. So, let's play it safe and try to choose the best result for us. Already many Indian politicians are saying that they are ready to deploy an army if needed. It's not goodwill but an invasion. So it's best we know what we do for the country.  But if it's possible for her to be prime minister without disturbing our constitution then I'm all for it. I also want a good leader who will work for the development of the country.   Indian is already eyeing the district like Lipilekh and Limpadhura. If we take too long to make a responsible decision, they are favourites to win the case.   The country is already in chaos. So we must do our best to calm it down. We protested against corruption and got unexpected results. We are not ready for it. And we don't have time to think about it and make a decision. But, we must make a decision and make it work, isn't it all there is to it ?    It's not that I don't support \"Sushila Karki\" . She has my full support. But if it is disturbing our core rules set by our constitution. I just thought it isn't right. So it's my request all my fellow citizens ( not just gen-z ) to make a right decision.   But my final warning is that if we defy our current constitution ourselves. It will not be a suprise other countries take advantage of it. So we shall make a decision ourselves and take the best route possible. But you've my support to make her ( Sushila Karki) intrim prime minister. It is the best result seeing her experience on political field.   It might have been a bit long for the attention span of gen-z but i just want to say that, neither the constitution nor the national rules be any shorter 😊. So make your protest and blood of many worthy of something great. You've already done impossible without any preparations. So make a few preparations and make our country great again.|||Divide and rule going on same old tactics which works everytime.|||This stupid ando Balen supporter haru.

I doubt Most people who are begging will have any olace to take shower and get themself wear nice suitable for work.   Hardly anyone would get some hard labour like Tyo ghar banauney dai and all ani they will hardly get minimum wage ..  Its impossible for em to escape the cycle of poverty unless some miracle…   Anyways back to your post  Proud of you and Proud of him aswell for staying strong ..

It’s about the future of our nation.|||Most people are here for fun, just to give their opinions that don't even sound right or sensible. the only politicians they ever knew were Oli shere prachanda and newbies like balen harka and shits. People are saying someone with no political background like KULMAN GHISING to directly elect a prime minister?? We need leaders, we need measures, we need to know what's good and bad. Most of the youths want to change countries I understand but they really don't know how. I fully support her for the interim one until further steps are taken.|||Absolutely agree. Sushila Karki is the perfect candidate for interim leadership. As Nepal’s first female Chief Justice, she has already proven her ability to lead with integrity and impartiality under immense political pressure. Her reputation for upholding the rule of law and fairness makes her uniquely qualified at a time when credibility is everything. Most importantly, she understands the mechanics and urgency of holding a fair election which is the single most crucial step to stabilizing the country right now. If we want an interim leader who is both capable and trusted by the public, there’s no better choice.|||people saying balen shoud be PM but in my opinion he is not suited for PM, not saying he is bad guy but i doubt he is good at making good relation with other countries, especially one we depend on the most.   she might be a good choice but as people says we need youth to lead the country so i cant say the otherwise,    but as a temporary PM i believe in her, at this time we need someone who can stablize the current situation, development is not the first priority for now,|||I agree for her.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.   Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.   Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||Jaha Bhetyo tehi thok saley madarchod lai...|||Aaos na india ma ni nepali xan birsyo kya|||Bro timro yo pic use garey haii Tiktok ma vid halchu|||kun desh jala teta bebasta garnu parxa|||yo machikne lai samatna paryo jasari bhaye ni yellai bachne kunai adhikar xaina|||Bhagey ra canada nai ja la, canada ma nee xodnu hudaina.

Lets first make sure state security, tax, bureaucracy and banking system be under central government. Then every other remaining ministry which needs localization be under province government.    Let there be 1 president directly elected by everyone to handle state security and 7 governor to handle province security, and 1 premier and 7 Magistrate to handle state & province tax, banking and bureaucracy. This way we will have clean central government in which no one can capture state function and minimize corruption.    Since we don't have any functioning people in power, either let lower house to vote for temporary governor and magistrate. No minister, let bureaucracy handle them under strict scrutiny of Governor and Magistrate.    Then start a fresh election, 1 President, 7 Governors, 1 Premier, 7 Magistrates, Lower House or Province Parliament member, then from each Province send 10 representative in Upper House/Federal Parliament 3 voted by Lower House/Province Parliament, 5 directly elected in Upper House and 2 votes each from Province Governor and Province Magistrate. Let the bill for Upper House be registered by directly elected member of Upper House. Upper house will vote for foreign minister, ambassadors and diplomats.   For now, either make Mayor and Deputy Mayor of each capital of Province to be interim Governor and Magistrate to bring law and order in state-province security and function. After election they will go back to be Mayor and Deputy Mayor.     Why all this?

Personally I have next to no clue who Sumana is, and normally I'd think that makes her a good candidate because there's nothing but positive vibes so far. I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both.

She is the one who has been abroad for so long and has so many foreign connections and relations that even if she  doesn't want interference, there will be far more foreign interference with her as a leader.  We can not deny that .   3. Sumana did absolutely nothing as a health minister apart from stunts. Ministers are supposed to amend laws and execute them. could have done so much more .   4.

BTW, Gen Z doesn’t just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didn’t exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who weren’t even present for the protests claim we don’t know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldn’t even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, ‘We have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server you’re all listening to is just for public discussion’. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal. Now that it’s been confirmed everywhere and with Balen posting that the Gen Z’s choice former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Sushila Karki is the right choice for interim prime minister of Nepal, we look forward to what comes next.|||https://new-nepal-voting.vercel.app/  Vote here or suggest names I can add|||For interim formation CJ Sushila Karki would be the perfect choice.

The world doesn’t run on kindness. It runs on power, survival, and who’s willing to fight or cheat to stay alive. Sitting there whining online, hoping people will listen, makes you irrelevant.

Nothing was going to change if things didn’t go south. Personally, I didn’t see the government making any changes with a peaceful protest. Even when we look at history of the world, majority of peaceful protest start peaceful and end violently. No entity in power ever gives it up easily.  Change was what we asked for and change is what we are getting. Not exactly the way we wanted things to go but seems clear from the comments that we all knew, in the back of our minds, it was never going to be a straight road to Rome.  So I believe it’s high time we look ahead and bring the same energy we did to the protests to ensure that we see the change we want to see happen and bring in leaders we believe in.

My soul hurts to see violence, arson, anarchy, and the loot and burning of our national properties. We, Gen-Z, seem to have won, yet feel lost. Hope feels lost. Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? I’ve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we can’t let our nation fail.** We can’t let our nation burn. We can’t let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**     **1) We lay down our weapons.**   We came in peace, we protested in peace, and we’ve always wanted peace. We shall end this in peace. Be it known that anybody inciting violence isn’t part of our movement.     **2) We extend love.**   Love towards our brothers and sisters, love towards our nation, love towards our neighbours, our society, and the opposing side. The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.     **3) We wear white.**   White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that we’ve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.     **4) We have hope.**   Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.     Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.     Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.     Sincerely,   Pantji, a Gen-Z |||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us.

Make the president declare her lawful member of parliament through Proportionate Representation System, 3. Declare her the interim prime minister, 4. The president on her cabinet's recommendation dissolves the house of Representatives, 5. Her cabinet carries forward the corruption investigation and reconstruction. 6. The elections will be declared immediately. 7. The new parliament decides the constitutional amendments. (directly elected prime minister etc. and others ) 8.

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen.

Rather than looking outwards to pin 📌 the chaos, it's important that we self reflect. This movement was started to hold those who've wronged our nation accountable but if we ourselves don't hold us accountable for yesterday's actions then we've lost the cause.  I beg that we don't dilute the blood spent in the last 48 years to any conspiracy.  जे भयो, गलत भयो । हामीले हिजोको घटनाक्रबाट आम नेपाली नागरिकको मनस्थिति भुज्यौं, हामीमा अझै पनि सुझबुझ छैन भनेर प्रमाणित गर्यौ।  तर अब के गर्ने भन्ने प्रश्न महत्पूर्ण छ - अब को छलफल त्यसमा हुनु पर्छ जस्तो लाग्छ।  We need law and order to end this chaos otherwise opportunists will prevail.

Built in 1908, it has stood as a symbol of our sovereignty, democracy, and national identity. For generations, it has been the place where decisions shaping our country’s future were made. Its grand architecture and historical importance make it a true pride of Nepal.The news of Singha Durbar burning yesterday is more than just the loss of a structure it feels like the loss of a piece of our soul. This tragedy is a blow to our heritage, to our economy, and to our sense of unity as a nation. The damage cannot be measured only in money, but also in the irreplaceable cultural and historical value that has been destroyed.  I feel deeply saddened by this loss. Singha Durbar was more than walls and pillars it was a living monument of Nepal’s journey, struggles, and achievements. Watching it go up in flames is heartbreaking for every Nepali who loves their country.",

If the government wants registration, fine — negotiate with Google, set up rules, whatever. But don’t cut off an entire nation from one of the most important platforms on the internet. This hurts students, creators, and businesses way more than it helps anyone.  Instead of solving the issue, they’ve basically told Nepali people: “too bad, no YouTube for you.” That’s not regulation that’s censorship.",

By colliation  3. By the member of party who has most seat in the parliament  4. Anyone who can obtain vote of confidence  Now here is the point, everyone but Prachand has resigned and the party who has most seat in the parliament is Moist and before dissolving the parliament he will become the Prime Minister if president is dissolving the parliament.

But there are some fools who do not understand these things and are opposing Karki to be care taker of the country.  I hope you understand the mind of the mastermind 'Prachad' and spread this message as soon as possible so that interim government can be formed led by Sushila Karki.",

I think we can't really blame them if they are taking information form joley media of Nepal.|||I hope people of Nepal are not falling for the same trap that destroyed Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. What looked like a well organised protest against govt, soon uncovered itself as regime change operations by deep state.|||We Support Nepal 🇮🇳|||He hardly has any reach tbh. He is rather seen as a clown who has been trying to incite youth against the establishment since more than 7 years now but fails terribly at it. Most of his views on youtube are manipulated & paid (bots etc). & a chunk of his viewership is rather from Pakistan & Bangladesh.  Edit: Also he is lying.|||Most well informed Indians are aware that this dissent had been brewing for quite sometime. Wish my Nepali bros and sis the best of luck and kudos for taking back what is rightfully yours . Hopefully the guilty are brought to justice, order is restored and right representatives are assigned to take Nepal forward for all its wonderful people. As for our media, they sell whatever gets views from the masses, tomorrow if Sita maa has comeback to be the Queen of Nepal sells, they'll start posting that, organizing debate sessions with clown for cheap entertainment. 🤡 I pray the martry RIP, their families fairly and properly compensated , justice is fast tracked, and a votes held  new govt formation.

We don't need him.|||Bruh, this guy is a charlatan.|||Broken clock moment for Agent Dhruv Rathee - do not fall for his propaganda. I am not sure which media is being blamed here but what I see is that the media channels are saying the “Anti corruption “ protests.   Low IQ news media doesn’t count as even Indians know that they are sensationalise everything|||I’m Indian! There is no propaganda. KP Oli is hated by India and Indians, so Infact we support it.  Indians think KP Oli has- 1) Ruined ties with India, keeps making claims that Ayodhya is actually in Nepal  2) CCP puppet, keeps insulting India and chooses china  3) Hasn’t visited India in 4 years he’s been PM, even though India and Nepal are very important partners.   Guys the Modi government is NOT a supporter of KP Oli, the news articles are misinformed and have low knowledge & context about the events in Nepal. I hope our Nepali brethren understand this on our behalf. Thank you 🙏|||Don't fall for him Nepali brothers , he has his own personal interests. Indians are with You 🇳🇵🇮🇳|||OP more than india he has more reach in pakistan and bangladesh 🤣|||Indian media is saying that this was a protest against corruption. dhruv rathee always has his agenda.

We only care about peace and tranquility in Nepal.|||I don't trust him lol, he is a hardcore communist|||He is late as always trying to prove his clowness , media already started to show the true reasons for the protest|||There seems to be no valid narrative. If it was against corruption then the protest should have stopped after government stepping down. But what happened after that - people are destroying and burning their country’s asset, their parliament, airports and banks etc - this is not the way it should have gone down if this was about corruption only.   Now instead of corruption in the office it’s anarchy on the streets.|||total international media is reporting it as social media but india ==godi  the reason i hate these nepalis|||Western media were reporting the same no?|||His favorite president Trump can't wait to start acting as president of Nepal. Definitely US is definitely behind this.|||Don't believe in this joker.|||Why nepalis are so obsessed with what indian and indian media is saying, why don't they focus on what chinese media is saying as they consider china as their friend so why worry or think about what indian are saying, they don't consider india as their friend so why so much focus on india?|||If you think Dhruv Rathee is telling the truth, then I have an Eiffel Tower to sell you. This person is a grade A propagandist of the anti-BJP front. All his tweets are made on the behest of his masters, and he has been called out multiple times for this.|||FYI—-> Social media isn’t just mirroring conflicts happening in schools and on streets – it’s triggering new ones!|||he is against modi gov only.|||Dhruv Rathee is one of the people who remains a part of opposition forever. That doesn’t mean he is wrong always but sometimes yes! It is not just Indian media it is international media but most of them are correcting themselves now which is good. Although his comments are still wrong in many ways. Social media ban was a ignition for this protest because corruption is going on from a longtime. But people should think what’s next? Youth leaders are going to step up and take positions to govern? Do they have that kind of unity? And do you think don’t they turn into corrupt due to powers? Great initiative by youth but think about what’s next |||All of us Indians know this. What are you saying?|||I don't know what are you talking about. Most coverage of Indian media is overtly positive.   This is because our love towards Nepal is same as our hate towards that Chinese puppet Oli.   If you see any doubt in our media or people, it is because we have a slight doubt if CIA or ISI will start using Nepal as a ground to disturb India.   Nepal can be a smaller country, but they are much more older nation state than us with full of brilliant souls and whatever Nepalis choose for their country, we respect that from core.  But never think this Rathee fellow has any love towards you guys. He's just putting gun over your shoulder to attack India. He is not even an Indian citizen. He is a compromised soul to the highest bidder.|||German shepherd....he only spreads propaganda...beware of him ....

I doubt anyone here believes that our Nepali brothers were protesting to assert their right to doomscroll.  People don't go to extremes in protesting against social media.  And govts don't ban all social media apps, just because the companies didn't \"register with them\". they do it, because they see the narrative has gone against them, and they desperately want to gain back the control.|||This guy ain’t even an Indian citizen|||[https://youtu.be/CXEMBDjnoWU?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/CXEMBDjnoWU?feature=shared) watch this|||This guy has some personal beef with modi and his party .

We have civilization connect that exists for thousands of years. Far before countries as a concept existed. Seeing our people in pain hurts us. 2. Indian mainstream media is shit. Even we don't entertain them. Each passing day their credibility is decreasing in India. 3. Dhruv rathi is also shit. Even his credibility is decreasing each passing day. One hypocrisy at a time. 4. From the bottom of our hearts we hope things calm down there and change for the better for the people of Nepal. I am sure if Nepal wants, the govt in India would love to help however possible (No strings attached) not unlike the hand we gave to srilanka in their time of need Because we understand what it is like to go through a state of political unrest.

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4. Retirement age and term limits: This is a must, we need a clear retirement age for the public positions just like other jobs.     These sort of things are fundamental of any country, without getting the fundamentals right we cannot expect our country to do better. We have a chance to make things better, lets take this chance.|||also i think! what lessons can be learned from Bangladesh last year?|||Garni nai ho vani presidency system lyauni.

Just wanted to express supreme respect to you from Ukraine.   You're really cool!   We had protests in 2014.   We made lot of mistakes after succeded in throwing down Yanukovich in 2014.

After five years people were tricked and during war elected complete scammers after watching \"servant of nation\" series with current president in main role.   Now we get kidnapping peoples on streets by police and conscripted forcely to war or you can get out for $10k until kidnapped next time. People get beaten and sometimes murdered in basements by military guys supported by police.

No consultation, no delay. Constitutional legitimacy + protester acceptance = only viable option.  # 2. PROTESTER LEADERSHIP PIVOT  Gen Z groups must **immediately shift messaging**:  * \"Our revolution is being hijacked\" * \"Military rule = permanent corruption\" * **Name specific civilian demands**: New constitution, elections in 1 year  # 3. ARMY FACE-SAVING EXIT  New interim government must **publicly thank Army Chief Sigdel** for \"preserving democracy\" and **offer ceremonial role** in transition (advisory only, no executive power).  # 4. EMERGENCY UNITY GOVERNMENT  * Sumana Shrestha as PM * Balen Shah as Deputy PM * **3 Gen Z representatives** in cabinet * **Clear 12-month timeline** to new elections  # 5. INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION BLITZ  India, China, UN must **immediately recognize** any civilian arrangement. Every hour of delay gives military justification for intervention.  **THE WINDOW IS 6-8 HOURS MAX**. After that, the army's 10 PM ultimatum becomes permanent control.  **Key insight**: Don't fight the chaos - channel it into civilian transition before military \"restores order\" permanently.  **Act NOW or lose democracy for decades.**|||Is birgunj safe to visit today?

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

AKA the daughter of a corrupt leader, the Chief Development Officer of Kathmandu, Nepal, Chhabi Rijal, who ordered gunfire in a peaceful protest that took place in Nepal on the 8th of September. The protest that took place against a corrupt government resulted in the loss of 20 individuals, some of whom were minors present in school uniforms, and hundreds were injured.   This is what we got for speaking against a government that has leeched off of taxpayers' money. We request an immediate dismissal of Sweta Rijal's candidacy at your esteemed institution. We, as Nepali people, condemn the actions of her immediate family and believe that her degree, funded by her very disliked father, will be of NO USE to our country.

It’s tragic, because they also have families back home and face the same struggles as the rest of us. They should be victims of this system too, yet they show little compassion or critical thought about what’s happening around them. Why are there protests in the first place? I refuse to believe they're blind to people's frustration and the direction the country is heading.  I still remember when we joined a protest 14–15 years ago. The police confronted us aggressively, and as kids we were too confused to react. Fortunately, we just stood there processing and visibly confused, and they left — but I still shudder to think, *what if our reaction had been different?* Today’s young protestors are in the same position, pure in their intentions, simply voicing frustration without wanting harm.  And honestly, credit must go to these protestors. They know exactly what they are standing for, unlike us back then who needed adults to organise us. I don’t see how demonstrations could be any more peaceful than they already are — especially when the very leaders being protested against have blood on their hands from before this generation was even born.|||Yo bhatey haru kahi gayera sitcha holani|||randi baan machikne haru|||I mean this tracks, they only like when you're corrupt|||Its not andolan anymore its war|||We want death or at lease exile of KP Oli and other taukes.|||Randi haruko photo, name, address patta lagau.|||khate haru mug haru padne bela ma padenan aile mug ko mug ko chak sugera manche lai dukha dinxan. timi mug haru le esto dukha dekhnu paros jatha haru. maa gali pani dina sakdina timi haru ko aama ko galti haina timi haru jasta janmie. aama lai k thaaa. tara kailei bhalo nahos timi haru jasta ko. timi haru marna pani na paos bachna pani na paos.|||shamelss dogs of government|||Machikne radi harlai lakhetdai marnaparne|||Thuiyaa police vanauda haruuu|||you radiko ban harulai agolauno man xa|||ma sanga pani ganhune bhaye, kassam mardinthe radieekko ban|||Mathi bata aako order re ????

People are saying that 'those were not genz' stfu there DEFINITELY were genz in the crowd that beat up and killed these people. The moment buildings started getting burned down, people started becoming feral with the sense of collective power and destruction that they could bring, and they screwed up. They guided their anger and frustration of seeing kids killed into becoming the same species of monsters that they were initially fighting against. More than the corrupt government firing bullets toward us that day, the ignorant and aggrieved crowd scared me the most. Stealing and picking up guns from the chased police, i really thought that we might see the maoist reenactment that day. The mentality to bring 'an eye for an eye' made everyone senseless. People were celebrating their actions of arson, vandalism, theft, and destruction. If these people aren't the same as the maoist and criminals locked up in jail, then wtf are they?? Maoist also consisted of the young generation of that time. I believe its the ignorance and the petty sense of 'mauka ma chauka' that led these people to terrorise their own country. Sure, the angry crowd may have been incited by some wrong intended individuals at times, however, to feel satisfaction upon seeing beat up people and bloody bodies is insane. The reason bhatbhatini, Ncell, kantipur, imp govt buildings burned down is because of these IGNORANT SENSLESS FUCKING MORONS THAT COULDN'T EVEN DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN PROTEST AND VIOLENCE. There is a reason corrupt govt existed in this country, its the people that gave birth to them. And its going to happen again and again like it has always been in the history. It's the entire nepali population that's messed up. Fuck you all, we can all just die in the embers of our own fire.|||The youth of Nepal was played and deceived in the name of GenZ. There are international players in the game. The whole revolution thing was a regime change operation like which happened in Ukraine, Libya, Bangladesh. They used the youth for regime change to install their puppet government. Sad to say that our leaders are groomed to be used in the politics in the future. Looks like our neighbor used their proxies in Nepal to overtake Deep state regime change operation from the west. If we are not vigilant, we are going to get another Zelenski and Nepal may turn into another Ukraine. UN forces and Indian forces are very active to get into Nepal. Things change rapidly in geopolitics. Achieving this revolution within 24 to 48 hours is in itself very suspicious. All seems like preplanned operation. Our youth needs to be more vigilant. |||how they punched that old woman was uncalled for...Nepal sinked to a new low. Women and children should not be target...especially old women...she could be your mother and grand mother. If you want to punch someone, punch KP Oli...he was the one responsible for the killing of 19 students and signed the country over to MCC.|||Watched DSP video not sure if he was truly culprit for ordering to shoot people but it was very hard to see. any update on his name would like to know who he was.|||how the flip do i even join discord, who even gate these fliping kids the rights to decide the future of nepal, who doesn't have a 1% of idea what would happen if the other country try to interfere we are walking the path of doom with no return|||First of all I do not agree with ehat occured with that poor lady but i do want to put some context.Setting a woman in fire is when you grab her and set on fire. In this case, it is not like that. Protestors ( violent non gen z's) they had given everyone time to evacuate the building, but she did not evacuate. Most likely cuz she was scared of the mob outside. The people outthere assumed it was empty, hence they started burning it. When people realized that women was inside the building, people came to her rescue. Unfortunately, she suffered from burn, reported to be 15% do far. Fortunately, she survived and is recovering. Even though I do not agree with what happened, I hate the narrative of us just burning a women.   Second where was this empathy for the kids that got shot? Where was this empathy for mothers and fathers that lost their children? Where was this empathy for grandfather and grandmother that lost their kids and grandkids? Where was this empathy when millions of people suffered? Where was this empathy when our voices about to be silenced?   Yes, we screwed up but before coming out and trying to shame or guilt trip us, ask yourself are you empathetic cuz you saw the video of her or are you genuinely empathetic cuz of the act? Do we all need our sufferings recorded and made public for people to feel empathetic?   Also ask yourself, people chased, dragged and beat corrupted politicians, but not of them were killed. Do you think people would burn and kill some corrupted politicians wife? If they would, then you would have seen lots of dead politicians by now.  Also I just checked your profile, you are an Indian. How can an Indian citizen empathize with Nepali people when you have not suffered under the regime we suffered. Don't just blindly follow what is being shown in your media. Do some research and you will find the truth yourself.|||Fuck, People are starting to say Save the Constitution. Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):** The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):** If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):** If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):** If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||I totally agree with this .|||Aa judai vako mancha lai kati coti marchas, sala indian godi media ko Veda.|||[deleted]|||Why are indians interfer in our business again?

People watched her speech where she said stuff like, “What’s my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?”  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still don’t have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we don’t have the right connections.  We don’t get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, it’s still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? That’s probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  We’re out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor people’s kids not boil?  On top of that, there’s already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent. Because this have  been suppressed for so long, and now the mindset is like — “If we can’t reach anywhere through the system, then we might as well destroy it.”  And even if some third party tries to trigger people, the truth is, it was already there deep down in their subconscious. This is just it coming out.

He is asking people that he can bring the change so what the bid deal in that. So people need a leader who is just become a puppet of other, no transparency. The nation need a leader who can proudly say yes this is my country I will die or live for it. He is the one. My suggestion is do not judge based  on sentiments.|||His position is great till the mayor, no need to drag him any further.|||This needs to spread forward, he is a narcissist, somebody who has no sense of how to speak , god complex.  publicity stunt doesnot makes person a great leader.|||We’re falling into the same trap again. Don’t buy into the smooth talk and fake charm — check their track record instead. Balen and Harka might be moody, but at least they’ve been tested in real battles. I’m done with sugar-coated leaders; give me someone who spits facts and takes action. Doing the right thing in a rotten system is never easy, and that’s why tried-and-tested leaders matter. Supporting Rajesh Hamal? That’s just a fantasy.|||Harka Sampang? you guys cant handle now i am sure|||तिमीहरुको कुरा सुन्दा अचम्म लाग्यो ।प्रकृया के हो , कसरी चल्छ केहि थाहा रहेनछ । देश जोक हो? चुनाव गराउनलाई सम्रचना छैन , चुनाव सजिलो कुरा सोच्या छौं ?? भोली चुनावको बैधताको को कुरा आउँछ , देश बिदेश बाट inspection हुन्छ । हल्का रुपमा नलेउ है । जति चाडो डिसिजन गर्यौ बुझेर त्यति फाइदा हो अलिक पछि त यो पाराले पानी पनि भन्न पाउँदैनौं , बर्षौदेखि राज गरेका पार्टि र तिनका कार्यकर्ता निक्लन्छन नै, उनिहरुसँग नेक तिकडम हुन्छन जुन तिमिहरुले बुझ्न पनि सक्दैनौ । if you need right suggestion and whole process i can help to brief.|||Harka Sampang ta 100% garnu hunna , Ko Mula Haru ho k tai na Tui ko name agadi lyaune ?|||Constituion should be ammended so politicians are no longer called leaders and they cannot enjoy a career.|||He would make a good dictator and actually do good for the country. But unfortunately for him, the public is educated. 100 years ago and this guy would have started the Sampang regime 😂|||Anyone who actively seeks power does so because they want to be seen and heard. That drive inevitably brings with it shades of narcissism and opportunism. So rather than fixating on intentions, it makes more sense to judge politicians by their results. On that front, Harka has proven he can deliver. His rough almost mobster-like style may be off-putting to some but in a city like Dharan which is home to hotheaded Kirati / Hill Janajati majority that kind of toughness isn’t just useful, it’s necessary.  That said, he is neither qualified nor capable enough to be considered an ‘ideal’ Prime Minister. Nonetheless, when compared to Rabi Lamichhane Harka represents a comparatively more credible alternative. Personally not a fan of either.|||Tei ta Mayor ko pani layak xaina veda janta lai pm chaiyo re|||Dherai yo jaat ko haru furkirako cha muji haru K hi pachi k huncha kei tha chaina gu bhareko muji haru ko|||Guys Primeminister is not joke role. It is representative of country. He must have some internal support and dealing capacity.|||The common thing between Harka and Balen is that both are independent and hardworking, and that is what people recognize and that is what the revolution wants. If a person has done good work, both of them will be appreciated hands down. You have to look at the picture from both sides. Secondly, please ask your senior citizens or elders from a different generation. They have seen history and faced the consequences. The real issue is bringing change in the constitution, i.e., a representative should not be above a certain age and should be allowed to seek votes only for one term. Take that in writing from the concerned representative, live, and show it to the world clearly. Also, please do not discriminate by saying someone is from the “Stone Age,” as such remarks can hurt the sentiments of people who are not from cities.|||He is not educated, he does not have the capabilities of being head of government. Balen it is.

Even he ignored and disagree with the Loan to be used from ADB ( Asian Development Bank ) . 6) He speaks and protest on his own way BUT still he has some flaws unlike us even the moon has flaws then he is still human . ra usko flaws we can ignore . May be he isnt eligible for primeminister as the lacks some level of diplomacy and its skill but he can be best suited in ministries like : Industry and commerce , Infrastructure, Agriculture .

            "body": "What comes next? The only reason Nepal isn't going through a complete currency de-valuation and a bank run is because of the rupee peg. We need to tread water carefully. (**Bank run** is a situation where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a bank simultaneously, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or financial stability. This can lead to liquidity problems for the bank, as it may not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands. Bank runs can create a cycle of panic, potentially leading to the bank's failure.)  The real pain starts after the protests have calmed. Economic crash is certain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh both went through it. Stock market/real estate crash, inflation and what not.  Whoever takes charge next, likely Balen, will need to address the pointless 'Greater Nepal' rhetoric and become a moderate on this issue. Thanks to Trump, India-China relationship is stable for the first time in ages. The only way Nepal has a future is pledge allegiance to both neighbour's.  Bangladesh under Yunus has been a pain in the ass for India. Nepal cannot make the same mistake. Any wrong steps and a free floating Nepali rupee against the dollar would go from 140 now to 25,000 like similar countries in our GDP range. Probably worse since our economy is in much worse shape. ($1 = Lao Kip 21,631.66 LAK)  Nepal needs one stable leader for the next 40 yrs. No interim gov paving way for elections bullshit. Forget the democracy experiment.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.   Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.   Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||How credible is this info?|||Use bitchat for conversation.

            "comments": "We are living in a moment where anger is boiling over. People are tired of corruption, censorship, and being silenced. Many of us are ready to take to the streets on Sept 8. But before we move forward, we must stop and think carefully.  History has shown us what happens when we rush in without preparation. In Bangladesh last year, in Sri Lanka not long ago, ordinary people gave their lives while corrupt leaders fled the country with protection and comfort. Their deaths were forgotten within weeks, while the guilty walked free. If we are not careful, Nepal risks becoming the next chapter in that same tragic story.  That is why this movement must be different. We cannot afford to be reckless. We must protect our people, keep our voices peaceful, and make sure the world is watching every step so that accountability cannot be erased.  Here is what we need to do before Sept 8:  * Get international human rights groups, UN observers, and peace monitors involved beforehand so there are eyes on the ground. * Publish clear and peaceful agendas so nobody can label us as rioters or mobs. * Document everything with photos, videos, and testimonies. Every arrest and every injury must be recorded and shared. * Avoid following local leaders who are affiliated with political parties. Big parties will try to infiltrate, hijack, and twist this movement for their own gain. * Know who is truly standing beside you. Trust matters because infiltrators can turn peaceful protests into chaos.  This movement is about dignity, rights, and accountability. It is not about violence. It is not about revenge. If we lose focus, if we let anger replace strategy, then we risk repeating the same cycle where the powerful walk free and ordinary people pay with their lives.  Nepal deserves better. The world must see us not as mobs, but as citizens united for freedom and justice. If we do this right, our voices will be impossible to silence. If we do this wrong, we risk being forgotten like so many before us.  Stay safe. Stay peaceful. Stay smart.",

Our motive was to make Nepal corruption free, not to have that dirty master mind guy's involvement. He have lots of records on corruption like Sahakari Kanda. Ani Few weeks ago Prachanda b**ch also visited him in the jail. Who knows what do they discuss. Maybe this all is the plans of him to release Ravi. And a question for those blind supporter of Ravi, \"Pahila Aafnai Haat Le Deko Vote Le Aaja Hamra Dai Vai Guma Gumaisakyeu Aajhai Chitta Bujheko Xaina ? Aajhai Nepal Lai Pahila Kai Situation Ma Kina Dhakalne Kosis Gardai Xau?\". Please not this time. Don't support Dirty politics. We have already lost a lot. Our Motherland is crying and this hurts a lot Yaar.  Due to burnt down of Supreme Court and Singha Durbar now we don't have any proofs to identify who the fk is actually criminal and who have played this game with Genz's.

September 8 at least 50% unrelated moles enter protest incite violence the police plays along then came the ones using actual bullets.  September 8 nighttime every single one of thugs for hire was paid to do organized premeditated almost military level planned attacks.  Sep 9 they straight up start attacking ( high rank officials usually have a ton of armed police and stuff which cannot be seen anywhere )  The lack of police on the streets says a lot maybe the ones holding the guns are the police working for prachandey or some other forces , most of the ones holding guns knew how to use it straight away so. .

Emails: grad@uci.edu reportfraudtips@uscis.dhs.gov Subject: Urgent Concern Regarding Sweta Rijal’s Status Dear Graduate Office/USCIS/ICE, I am writing about Sweta Rijal, a political science student at your university. She is the daughter of Chabi Rijal, a communist leader and Chief District Officer in Nepal, who recently ordered a shoot-on-sight against youth peacefully protesting corruption in Nepal. His orders have killed over 18 innocent people, injured more than 100 students, and more deaths are expected. This is pure fascism and a gross misuse of power. Young people in a peaceful protest were shot dead, which is totally unacceptable. While our brothers and sisters die in Nepal, Sweta Rijal has no right to study in the US with money from corruption. Her entire funding is from the money from corruption. The US, as a democratic country and a voice for the UN, stands for freedom and justice. Allowing her to stay contradicts everything the US represents. We are struggling to fight this battle in Nepal, and she must be held accountable. I urge you to investigate her visa and take necessary action to send her back to Nepal. Regards, Concerned Citizen from Nepal",

I think you've never seen what corruption can cause, or you pretend not to!  I'm from Brazil, and I'll give you an example of what corruption can do to a society.    Here, I saw young people being shot in favelas just for supporting opposition politicians, yes, ordinary people being killed for supporting the other side.  People were and are arrested, tortured, and killed on the unjust orders of corrupt politicians and judges.  The media, also corrupt, manipulates public opinion with false narratives or half-truths, always favoring the state, especially abroad. This has caused enormous polarization in the country, in addition to promoting many unjust laws.  My country is overrun by crime, and there are criminal factions that control entire regions (with the explicit support of the state), and you run a risk when you go out at night, you know? You can be robbed and killed at any moment, and nothing will be done to the criminal.  Education is also of extremely low quality, which has caused an absurd cultural and moral degradation among my people, who today lack even the capacity to think critically.  Salary increases for politicians without social approval are frequent here, and nothing happens. Search the amount of benefits they receive here.  We recently had a scandal involving millions of retirees being stolen against their will by banks and public agencies. What was the government's solution? To create more taxes to pay without punishing those who stole, and to try to inhibit investigations by using public funds to buy off those who would investigate. Search for \"INSS Scandal\".  The current president (rejected by the majority) has actively provoked other countries, especially the US, to create an open conflict between the two countries, precisely to use this as an excuse to remain in power while putting the lives of millions of people at risk.    Anyway, I could spend all day here giving examples of the harm corruption has caused in the society I live in. I recommend imagining how many future geniuses, entrepreneurs, inventors, and exemplary people for humanity could exist here, but won't, thanks to the corruption of some.  Imagine how prosperous societies would be if there weren't corrupt representatives making absurd and selfish decisions to benefit themselves and control others.    I understand that violence blinds people, and it's unpleasant to see someone in this situation, but we need to understand that in today's societies, we have two sides, one side that wants to live and enjoy life peacefully, and the other that wants to use your life to live like gods.   So, what would you prefer?    The people of Nepal are absolutely right to act as they are, and their politicians need to see what true justice is. They acted wrongly, harming thousands of people, and now they need to be punished, something that would never happen without the use of violence.   The corrupt state would never punish itself, and military forces serve and exist precisely to defend the state and its interests, meaning they would never be punished fairly, and even if they have surrendered, the disaster has already been caused, this surrender is just a way for them to try to avoid punishment, however, sooner or later, they will stab society in the back, and guess what, if society doesn't act, nothing will happen to them and their crimes!  Soon my country will go through something similar, and you will be able to see that it is not about revenge, it is about justice, something that unfortunately is disappearing in societies.  There's no point in trying to appear morally superior, evil people exist and will continue to commit atrocities, and if there are no violent reactions against them, everything will only get worse.|||Ajai kutnu partyo mardeko bhaye huntyo.

I am just a sincere, hardworking youth who remained silent because too many opinions create a ruckus. That's what I believed till September 8. When I went to the protest, it was all fine until they started firing. When you're in the battleground, all moralities go out the window. Yet, I did not throw a single stone at anyone and I am proud of that. I remained with the group who were peacefully protesting infront of the army van, I helped people with water to wash their face, tried picking up litters. The main point is I tried being a responsible person. But the moment I saw people being carried to the hospital with their blood spattering the streets, I fucking lost it. In retaliation, my protests became more louder. I came home late at night, tried my best to repost as many information I could. At one point, I felt like people should burn down the entire ministry down, all these nepo-babies should be brought to the streets to teach their parents how it feels to kill someone's child. I was furious, the word being an understatement. But seeing this people getting mob justice was what I never wanted. They don't deserve the least of anyone's sympathies, but we still have humanity in our hearts. That's what differs us from them.  I'm trying my best to control the narrative of why the protests happened, so that the opportunistic Indians, Chinese and the entire West may not take undue advantage of us.

Nepalese people cannot be proud of their tolerance anymore its a flaw not pride, passed down by generations who were suppressed by Rana, the panchayat, monarchs and so on, one generation has to sacrifice, plant seeds if tree not for us but for so that the future can bear the fruit.

I agree they were already rich, but not *that* rich to the point where they could afford four international trips a year!

Damn!|||It’s about whether that legacy is being used today as justification for unchecked privilege, unearned positions, and continued control over public resources.  You say their work has benefited generations “like me” but what about the millions still without quality education, clean water, jobs, or justice? If that legacy was truly built for the people, then why does inequality keep growing? Why is access to opportunity still limited to a select few families like yours?  No one is attacking your elders for their hard work but using that work to claim political or social superiority today is exactly the kind of dynastic thinking that holds progress back. Legacies don’t entitle children to power. Competence, accountability, and public trust do.  You’re not being attacked, you’re being questioned. And if your only answer is to call others “small-minded” and “ungrateful,” then maybe you’re not as prepared to face criticism as you think. Respect is earned in every generation, not inherited like land or a business.  The days of hiding behind the achievements of the past are over. If you want respect for your family, prove it through your own actions, not by silencing criticism or demanding loyalty based on history.|||French revolution Bata sikna paryo kei|||I fwwww it.

Gen z never planned to burn or destroy public property and jails. I believe this happened due to the presence of other opportunistic groups.  Gen z’s true motive was to overthrow the government and that was achieved. they never intended to take up guns or engage in vandalism and that was not their goal. but many other people, parties or elements took advantage of the moment to cause destruction for their own selfish interests like Looting, hiding behind the anonymity of the crowd.  Because of this, even their own people are now suffering from security issues like the release of 1200 prisoners due to prison breaks.

I mean gross national happiness instead of gross national product. I believe every single country on this planet should take Bhutan as a role model a little bit more. Where else in the world are citizens asked what their main problems are and what they want from the government? And later, citizens are asked how satisfied they were with the government's performance. I know it's a bit naive of me to make such a suggestion from afar, as a sheltered European who is not really familiar with the form of government in Nepal. But it seems to be similar in many, many countries. Those in power often hold office and positions of honor for decades through their family ties. And they are similar in their decadence. The most expensive clothes, the biggest cars, houses, and palaces. Flying to New York for dinner in a private jet, or to Monaco for F1, or around the globe in a yacht as long as a soccer field. And in the media, they try to appear close to the people, to be there for them, to advance the country by investing in infrastructure or new hospitals, etc. But no, a large part of your taxes ends up with the rulers themselves. The rich and powerful acquire more wealth and more power. Money rules the world!

This is literally just her side of the story. Anyone can sit behind a keyboard, write a long emotional post, and instantly turn public opinion against someone. That doesn’t make it the full truth.  We’ve seen this before — remember the Sandeep Lamichhane case? A girl accused him, media and public went wild, and people treated him as guilty before trial. Later, so many loopholes came out. It’s the same pattern here — society naturally sides with the girl because we have an inbuilt bias that says “the girl must be the victim.” But is that always true? No.  Let’s also not ignore that sometimes girls do play emotional games. They ghost, they manipulate, they test how much a guy will “chase” them — and when he does, suddenly it becomes “stalking.” Where’s the line? Maybe she had past relationships, maybe she’s not telling the full story about her own actions that led to this fallout. Why should we blindly believe only her narrative and not even question what really happened?  And now people are targeting not just him, but also his family. That’s disgusting. Whatever the issue is between two individuals, why should parents, brothers, or sisters be dragged into it? People forget that when you destroy someone online, you destroy their whole family’s dignity too.  Everyone’s commenting with sympathy for her and anger towards him. But let’s be honest — most of that is just because she’s a girl and he’s a guy. If the genders were reversed, would people still believe the story this blindly? I doubt it.  Look, if he’s actually guilty of harassment, the law should punish him. No question about that. But until then, it’s not fair to publicly assassinate someone’s character based on one-sided claims. Social media is not a courtroom, and we shouldn’t let feelings override facts.|||:D|||https://www.facebook.com/share/1JV5hYfP6t/?mibextid=wwXIfr  don’t bully her. Only message her.

Experience isn’t a flaw, it’s literally the one thing that tells you someone can handle the chaos. You want to hand the country over to a rookie who has no clue how the system works, how politics works, or how to deal with the mess we’re already in? That’s not bravery, that’s stupidity.  We keep repeating the same mistakes because people get blinded by shiny new faces and ignore anyone who actually knows what they’re doing. Experience doesn’t mean someone is corrupt it means they’ve been in the trenches and survived. Throwing it away just to see if a “fresh face” can magically save everything is how you crash a country.  Nepal isn’t a playground. Leadership isn’t about hype, popularity, or being young and “green.” It’s about surviving the chaos, making tough decisions, and knowing where the landmines are. If you think a rookie can do that better than someone experienced, you’re dreaming and the whole nation will pay the price for it.",

What is done is done we stood as one not divided we achieved what many could only dream of ! Let that sink in . Yes balen is popular and the youths favor him but he lacks experience in international politics that so heavily effects our countrys day to day activities we have loans dating back decades and treaties that are not in our favor,we need some one who has been in the sidelines of these treaties and  the loans that our country has  signed up for by our currupt politicians we need a total reevaluation of the treaties . Personally I believe sumana shrestha is a gd pick but we need experienced personals with her to guide her through, don't even think about harka sampang the guy is not in the level of leading our country. He may be patriotic but we need someone who understands diplomacy and finance to get our country through these though times I would also like to say put out a interpol red notice to the previous ministers personal assistants and their department heads as they can show us all of their misdeeds and how we can overturn this situation into a generational win not just for the Genz but for all the people of Nepal .

Even if they have the intention and will to do so (like many of us want), they do not know how to run a country. I see them as ineffective in running even a municipality (maybe that was because of politics and in-cooperation from party elected ward heads). The thing is they have a lot more to learn and they will, with time.       This situation would not have happened if there were transfer of power to youth in timely manner. Now the rising youth leaders do not have experience because these corrupt politicians did not allow that.      What we need is a system where corruption should now be absolutely dreaded, seeing how corrupt politicians had to run away for thier life. They have to realize that people will not just punish the corrupt polticians, they will also punish whoever was responsible to prevent that.       There now needs to be a collaborative development with young leaders like Balen and experienced people like Sushila. Each and everyone's characters will show with time, for now, we have to seek for stability as soon as possible.|||If we fail to appoint her then external along with internal force will play and bring more chaos to the country.

I truly want Sushila Karki to be prime minister, but according to our constitution it's not possible. And if we ditch our constitution our country is open for invasion from other countries. So, what's the best option it's BALEN. I know that he won't be able to run for prime minister for the next election but it is a risk we have to take. It's already proven that our protest was the result of different politicians 'parties'involvement. So, let's play it safe and try to choose the best result for us. Already many Indian politicians are saying that they are ready to deploy an army if needed. It's not goodwill but an invasion. So it's best we know what we do for the country.  But if it's possible for her to be prime minister without disturbing our constitution then I'm all for it. I also want a good leader who will work for the development of the country.   Indian is already eyeing the district like Lipilekh and Limpadhura. If we take too long to make a responsible decision, they are favourites to win the case.   The country is already in chaos. So we must do our best to calm it down. We protested against corruption and got unexpected results. We are not ready for it. And we don't have time to think about it and make a decision. But, we must make a decision and make it work, isn't it all there is to it ?    It's not that I don't support \"Sushila Karki\" . She has my full support. But if it is disturbing our core rules set by our constitution. I just thought it isn't right. So it's my request all my fellow citizens ( not just gen-z ) to make a right decision.   But my final warning is that if we defy our current constitution ourselves. It will not be a suprise other countries take advantage of it. So we shall make a decision ourselves and take the best route possible. But you've my support to make her ( Sushila Karki) intrim prime minister. It is the best result seeing her experience on political field.   It might have been a bit long for the attention span of gen-z but i just want to say that, neither the constitution nor the national rules be any shorter 😊. So make your protest and blood of many worthy of something great. You've already done impossible without any preparations. So make a few preparations and make our country great again.|||Divide and rule going on same old tactics which works everytime.|||This stupid ando Balen supporter haru.

Most of the youths want to change countries I understand but they really don't know how. I fully support her for the interim one until further steps are taken.|||Absolutely agree. Sushila Karki is the perfect candidate for interim leadership. As Nepal’s first female Chief Justice, she has already proven her ability to lead with integrity and impartiality under immense political pressure. Her reputation for upholding the rule of law and fairness makes her uniquely qualified at a time when credibility is everything. Most importantly, she understands the mechanics and urgency of holding a fair election which is the single most crucial step to stabilizing the country right now. If we want an interim leader who is both capable and trusted by the public, there’s no better choice.|||people saying balen shoud be PM but in my opinion he is not suited for PM, not saying he is bad guy but i doubt he is good at making good relation with other countries, especially one we depend on the most.   she might be a good choice but as people says we need youth to lead the country so i cant say the otherwise,    but as a temporary PM i believe in her, at this time we need someone who can stablize the current situation, development is not the first priority for now,|||I agree for her.

Jalaide|||Yes thus is TRUE LOOK AT MY MOST RECENT POST|||please do this email to UN and OHCHR   To: registry@ohchr.org        info@ihrcworld.org        petitions@ohchr.org   Subject: Urgent Appeal: Violation of Human Rights in Nepal – Police Shooting School Studentsj   Dear United Nations Human Rights Council, I am writing to raise an urgent appeal regarding the grave human rights violations currently occurring in Nepal. Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.   Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.   Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||Jaha Bhetyo tehi thok saley madarchod lai...|||Aaos na india ma ni nepali xan birsyo kya|||Bro timro yo pic use garey haii Tiktok ma vid halchu|||kun desh jala teta bebasta garnu parxa|||yo machikne lai samatna paryo jasari bhaye ni yellai bachne kunai adhikar xaina|||Bhagey ra canada nai ja la, canada ma nee xodnu hudaina.

Lets first make sure state security, tax, bureaucracy and banking system be under central government. Then every other remaining ministry which needs localization be under province government.    Let there be 1 president directly elected by everyone to handle state security and 7 governor to handle province security, and 1 premier and 7 Magistrate to handle state & province tax, banking and bureaucracy. This way we will have clean central government in which no one can capture state function and minimize corruption.    Since we don't have any functioning people in power, either let lower house to vote for temporary governor and magistrate. No minister, let bureaucracy handle them under strict scrutiny of Governor and Magistrate.    Then start a fresh election, 1 President, 7 Governors, 1 Premier, 7 Magistrates, Lower House or Province Parliament member, then from each Province send 10 representative in Upper House/Federal Parliament 3 voted by Lower House/Province Parliament, 5 directly elected in Upper House and 2 votes each from Province Governor and Province Magistrate. Let the bill for Upper House be registered by directly elected member of Upper House. Upper house will vote for foreign minister, ambassadors and diplomats.   For now, either make Mayor and Deputy Mayor of each capital of Province to be interim Governor and Magistrate to bring law and order in state-province security and function. After election they will go back to be Mayor and Deputy Mayor.     Why all this?

I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both.

BTW, Gen Z doesn’t just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didn’t exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who weren’t even present for the protests claim we don’t know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldn’t even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, ‘We have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server you’re all listening to is just for public discussion’. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal. Now that it’s been confirmed everywhere and with Balen posting that the Gen Z’s choice former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Sushila Karki is the right choice for interim prime minister of Nepal, we look forward to what comes next.|||https://new-nepal-voting.vercel.app/  Vote here or suggest names I can add|||For interim formation CJ Sushila Karki would be the perfect choice.

The world doesn’t run on kindness. It runs on power, survival, and who’s willing to fight or cheat to stay alive. Sitting there whining online, hoping people will listen, makes you irrelevant.

Nothing was going to change if things didn’t go south. Personally, I didn’t see the government making any changes with a peaceful protest. Even when we look at history of the world, majority of peaceful protest start peaceful and end violently. No entity in power ever gives it up easily.  Change was what we asked for and change is what we are getting. Not exactly the way we wanted things to go but seems clear from the comments that we all knew, in the back of our minds, it was never going to be a straight road to Rome.  So I believe it’s high time we look ahead and bring the same energy we did to the protests to ensure that we see the change we want to see happen and bring in leaders we believe in.

My soul hurts to see violence, arson, anarchy, and the loot and burning of our national properties. We, Gen-Z, seem to have won, yet feel lost. Hope feels lost. Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? I’ve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we can’t let our nation fail.** We can’t let our nation burn. We can’t let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**     **1) We lay down our weapons.**   We came in peace, we protested in peace, and we’ve always wanted peace. We shall end this in peace. Be it known that anybody inciting violence isn’t part of our movement.     **2) We extend love.**   Love towards our brothers and sisters, love towards our nation, love towards our neighbours, our society, and the opposing side. The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.     **3) We wear white.**   White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that we’ve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.     **4) We have hope.**   Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.     Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.     Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.     Sincerely,   Pantji, a Gen-Z |||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us.

The president on her cabinet's recommendation dissolves the house of Representatives, 5. Her cabinet carries forward the corruption investigation and reconstruction. 6. The elections will be declared immediately. 7. The new parliament decides the constitutional amendments. (directly elected prime minister etc. and others ) 8.

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen. When the police and the army refused to shoot, the old order was already finished.__  **I am not a political scientist, just a hobbyist, I may be wrong.**|||High possibility OF THISSS|||Maybe but not entirely garnu bela tod fod garyeu parliament jalayeu manxe jalayo ani accountability line bela ma aru lai dosh,Kati economical crisis hunxa aba|||Prachanda and men who are into dopamine shits|||No|||Him or Gyanendra.

Rather than looking outwards to pin 📌 the chaos, it's important that we self reflect. This movement was started to hold those who've wronged our nation accountable but if we ourselves don't hold us accountable for yesterday's actions then we've lost the cause.  I beg that we don't dilute the blood spent in the last 48 years to any conspiracy.  जे भयो, गलत भयो । हामीले हिजोको घटनाक्रबाट आम नेपाली नागरिकको मनस्थिति भुज्यौं, हामीमा अझै पनि सुझबुझ छैन भनेर प्रमाणित गर्यौ।  तर अब के गर्ने भन्ने प्रश्न महत्पूर्ण छ - अब को छलफल त्यसमा हुनु पर्छ जस्तो लाग्छ।  We need law and order to end this chaos otherwise opportunists will prevail.   I might be wrong, but I believe, dissolution of the current parliament, an interim government led by candidates \"from the people, by the people, for the people\" - in it's truest sense, followed by a constitution reform for a directly elected state head is the answer.|||Prachanda has a history of working with RAW agency|||CIA?|||U janme Dekhi Nepal ma ashanti aako ho.|||even if he isn't he still needs to be brought to justice. kata lukeko xa yo chor.|||https://preview.redd.it/5spe7l1kqaof1.jpeg?width=945&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff0d5c200ef042d362e6344ad5b4e5d44dfd8e5e|||Probably|||https://preview.redd.it/qa507b014bof1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=594aa8a1c71a75c3eed28738e71393a88338e07f|||Yes he is one of them, mass murderer 😡😡|||Yes maathi inquiry garna mildaina without any influence aba.

Built in 1908, it has stood as a symbol of our sovereignty, democracy, and national identity. For generations, it has been the place where decisions shaping our country’s future were made. Its grand architecture and historical importance make it a true pride of Nepal.The news of Singha Durbar burning yesterday is more than just the loss of a structure it feels like the loss of a piece of our soul. This tragedy is a blow to our heritage, to our economy, and to our sense of unity as a nation. The damage cannot be measured only in money, but also in the irreplaceable cultural and historical value that has been destroyed.  I feel deeply saddened by this loss. Singha Durbar was more than walls and pillars it was a living monument of Nepal’s journey, struggles, and achievements. Watching it go up in flames is heartbreaking for every Nepali who loves their country.",

If the government wants registration, fine — negotiate with Google, set up rules, whatever. But don’t cut off an entire nation from one of the most important platforms on the internet. This hurts students, creators, and businesses way more than it helps anyone.  Instead of solving the issue, they’ve basically told Nepali people: “too bad, no YouTube for you.” That’s not regulation that’s censorship.",

            "body": "Here me out We all know the condition of the nation right now. Things to be legit and accepted internationally should be constitutional. Balen is not coming until the parliament is not dissolve.  Parliament cannot be dissolved. Parliament can be disslove by Prime Minister and currently no one is Prime Minister. Other way to dissolve parliament is by president. But president has to try and appoint PM before dissolving the parliament, how can he appoint  1. By the party holding majority seat  2. By colliation  3. By the member of party who has most seat in the parliament  4. Anyone who can obtain vote of confidence  Now here is the point, everyone but Prachand has resigned and the party who has most seat in the parliament is Moist and before dissolving the parliament he will become the Prime Minister if president is dissolving the parliament.  Best thing is to not dissolve the parliament and form interim government leaded by Sushila Karki. But there are some fools who do not understand these things and are opposing Karki to be care taker of the country.  I hope you understand the mind of the mastermind 'Prachad' and spread this message as soon as possible so that interim government can be formed led by Sushila Karki.",
