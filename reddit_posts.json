I mean yesterday when trying to choose a representative for GenZ nai testai vayo, everyone questioning everyone, representative candidates fighting with each other, and mind you there were less 1000 people there. Went to another server, same thing there. And of course no common interest in these two channels as well. I did raise that concern since everyone was fighting, in the chat because no one was ready to listen, just shout, that there are thousands of people who were involved, even if someone did get elected in that very server, what's to say others who were not there will follow. I left after that, have not joined it today. I see representatives of GenZ already doing interviews elsewhere so what is the point here. Also I refrain myself of any opinions since I have absolutely zero knowledge on any politician or their views or visions or nothing, but was just there to see who got elected and what was the conclusion.|||brother with whole heart, we do not but we're trying our best to include all of our voices.|||CHAT GPT ma search gari gari answer bandai theyo...lol.|||Just saw in the news that one of the groups representing genz are raising the voice for bringing the king back like what the actual fuck.

The world now sees us as a \"Discord nation\" , not of brave activists, but of violent anarchists plotting chaos on a gaming app. This isn’t revolution; it’s delusion.  These so-called GenZ leaders call for burning airports and killing leaders, with no plan to govern or build. They play revolution like a video game shielded at home, fed by parents, but clueless about real struggle or sacrifice.  Their reckless actions don’t fight corruption ,they invite foreign intervention and destroy our global reputation. This isn’t change. It’s national suicide.  True change requires wisdom, unity, and hard work , not hateful messages from behind a screen. Wake up, Nepal. Reject the chaos.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):** The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):** If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):** If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):** If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

People watched her speech where she said stuff like, “What’s my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?”  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still don’t have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we don’t have the right connections.  We don’t get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, it’s still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? That’s probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  We’re out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor people’s kids not boil?  On top of that, there’s already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent. Because this have  been suppressed for so long, and now the mindset is like — “If we can’t reach anywhere through the system, then we might as well destroy it.”  And even if some third party tries to trigger people, the truth is, it was already there deep down in their subconscious. This is just it coming out.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):** The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):** If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):** If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):** If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Army should not interfere in internal problems|||आर्मीले कति माया गर्छन् नागरिकलाई? जम्मा २/२ झापड, त्यही ठाउँमा आन्दोलनमा खटिएका प्रहरी भए बेहोस नहुन्जेल कुट्ने थिए ।|||asti belai ma aayera yo radaban harlai yesari handeko bhaye singhadurbar jaldainathyo|||my 2 cents as an Indian.

Former Chief Justice Sushila Karki has agreed to act as a representative if supported by the youth.    Under Nepal’s Constitution, elections must be held within six months if a stable government cannot be formed.

Harka and Mahabir for direct involvement in restorations. Sagar Dhakal flexible in advisory and reformation (But doubt due to links with RSP) .

Much has been lost and it saddens me greatly. Although I expected violence to erupt to a certain extent but what happened can’t be rationalized. People need to take responsibility for took place due to their own actions and inaction. I am not exempt from any of the guilt either, I supported this movement and accept what transpired should have been avoided, no matter how difficult.  As far as looting is concerned, although I am not trying to justify their actions, it is not just a Nepali protest thing. It happens almost every time a protest is organized no matter in whichever part of the world you look at.   And banning social media, restricting freedom of speech (a fundamental human right btw) is never the solution.|||Same things I used to mention here and most of the peoples were pissed off!!!

It set us back at least 10-20 years. |||Yeah it was a series of unfortunate events. From what I understand, the protests were originally supposed to be peaceful but that all changed when the police shot non-violent protestors. At that point, the protestors wanted vengeance, and chaos ensued. No one thought the police would shoot at protestors, so the situation understandably turned chaotic.  I was rooting for the protestors and I felt so cathartic watching them:  - beat the shit out of deuba and his wife  - drag the finance minister out onto the streets in his underwear  - burn the politicians' houses and reveal stacks and stacks of money   But then things went too far when someone decided to:  - burn public government buildings (e.g. central bank, singha durbar, parliament, supreme Court). People complain that the politicians waste their tax money, and yet they go and destroy public buildings, which will take years (and taxpayers' money) to rebuild.  - burn hotels and resorts (e.g. Hilton). There were innocent people there including tourists.  - release criminals from prisons. This is the most egregious and low IQ move I've ever seen like what on earth were they thinking? Now there are armed criminals and opportunists roaming the streets, robbing banks and businesses.  - use discord chat to decide who the \"leader\" of the Gen Z protestors is lol. Discord. The glorified online chatroom where anyone can join and spam propaganda, and sow discord (pun not intended). I joined the server to see what they were doing and... It's exactly what I expected -- trolling, spamming, rage-baiting, everyone talking all at once but nobody listening, etc. What a mess. Why was there no moderation? Why weren't there bots that detected and prevented spam messages? People are deciding on an interim PM as if they're choosing the best answer on a multiple choice question on an exam lmao. What a joke.|||It's true, people are just as problematic as their leaders. We feel hopeless|||Ulta they are walking around proud.

Our hearts are crying. |||What was necessary happened, but at the same time, things escalated, and a lot of unnecessary things happened as well. Whats done is done, there is no way to salvage the milk that has boiled over. Please let us stop with the blame game and finger pointing here.   Nobody is perfect and not everything will be perfect, but the young generation did start something with good intentions. Let's not let he crazy ones who did wrong things dictate the movement. Now is the time to get together and and make better choices moving forward and not go back to the same mindset that nothing will change, blame the other, and sit doing nothing ourselves.   In life an opportunity to start over does not come easily, so we should urge everyone to stop the violence, pause and think properly and make decisions that will work for every working people.|||Nepali le afno calibre kai neta payeko thiye aba jhan pattur auchan.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):** The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):** If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):** If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):** If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Peaceful protest my ass.  They were all so happy the next day when people starting burning politicians house.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):** The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):** If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):** If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):** If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Put him back to jail |||All members of Ghanti are Conspirators. All should be tried for treason and jailed.

That’s the only way the army can step in, hand over authority to the people’s choice, and let the process run fairly.  Under our Constitution (Section 76), if the current PM resigns, they can either form a new group or pick another PM from the same pool of politicians. There’s no option outside of that. This means the army can’t directly appoint a main PM unless the existing government is dissolved. At most, they can set up an interim PM to handle things until the next election.  Here’s the catch: if Balen accepts the interim PM role, he won’t be eligible to run for Prime Minister in the main election. That’s why the smarter move isn’t to push him into that spot—but to put pressure on the President to dissolve the current setup.  Let’s not forget: the old politicians built the Constitution with loopholes to keep themselves on top. They know that as long as the President doesn’t act, they stay in control.

The president on her cabinet's recommendation dissolves the house of Representatives, 5. Her cabinet carries forward the corruption investigation and reconstruction. 6.

        "body": "Dear Nepal  You just got rid of all the politicians. Congratulations—a feat that is very difficult to achieve, and you successfully toppled a very old government that needs reformation. But this is the problem: government consists of executive, legislative, and judicial branches, and they work together to make your country run. Now you have gotten rid of the people sitting in the seats that represent the government but even if you've burned down the building, the seats are still there. Whatever people you now elect to go and sit in those seats, your outcome will be the same. In a couple of years, those new people will succumb to the pressures and incentive structures of those seats, and your country will be again in the same place where it has been for many years—in the s\\*\\*thole. If you truly want to change the game, you need to change the incentives. Doing nothing won't change the seat; killing or replacing people on the seat also doesn't work—it's still the same seat. You need to change the pressures that the people who sit in the seat feel.  Greetings from Switzerland  Switzerland has an exceptionally effective system balancing the interests of the government, wealthy individuals, and the general public. This takes too long to explain here in detail but here is why it's the best system:  First, your local government collects most of the taxes and provides most services; the federal system collects fewer taxes and handles national responsibilities, including defence, foreign affairs, and major economic policies.   Second, we have initiatives and referendums at the local, regional, and federal levels. How you want to determine what people should vote on—that's up to you. In Switzerland we collect signatures from the general public but it's sketchy and it's a problem Switzerland hasn't really figured out yet, but you have a young, revolutionary mindset, and you can use these new open-source, token-based digital tools to put pressure on the seats in government. It's a balance on how often you want to let people vote on issues: there is too little, like in Britain, and there is certainly voting too much, but you will figure it out.  What I'm trying to say is, don't just replace the people with new people. The government is like an internal combustion engine, and you're just replacing the fuel—the engine still runs the same way. Try to change the machine itself instead, take inspiration from nations that do have functioning government engines, and try to innovate on those.  All the best!",

I agree on removing proportionate voting.  2) There is ample proof that political effectiveness and political stability is more significant factor which influence corruption, while e-governance can help in efficiency ,but we should strive for stability and political effectiveness   3) Parliament should be able to pass the vote of no confidence to check the powers of executive prime minister, or we can also adopt the parliamentary system of France.  4) most of the things already exist, loksewa is fairly good institution, ciaa is also good institution, and judiciary is also fine, what we really lack is independent appointees  currently appointees are loyalist of politicians, so there is no need for complete overhaul, we can add more opposition leader, more veteran judges, in the selection committee, in this way we can curb self interest of parties.  5)   what i think can truly curb corruption is by legalizing political party funding from a transparent channels, and regulate it strictly through this we can monitor who are the actual funders, and if a party is found guilty of receiving money from illegal channels, they should be punished according to law.  6) capital punishment should be banned, it is inhumane and can be used for political witch hunting, but we should reconsider presidential pardons, only political prisoners should get pardoned, only if they served at least 6yrs in prison.     Overall wants are good, but in reality implementation of these kind of things, takes huge political will, we should be realistic, we can make best rules and laws, but its functioning depends upon institutions.|||I think there should be Major changes.

In return, they would receive lenient punishment—such as reduced jail time—while still being held accountable for their actions. This approach would encourage voluntary disclosure and reduce the need for coercive investigations.  By incentivising self-reporting, we could save significant administrative resources and avoid prolonged legal battles. However, this initiative must be time-bound, with a clear deadline, and should only be implemented once we have a fully functioning and trustworthy government in place.  In parallel, we should establish a whistleblower helpline to empower citizens to report corrupt individuals. If a whistleblower provides credible evidence that leads to a successful prosecution or recovery of illegally accumulated assets, they should be rewarded with a percentage of the recovered funds. This would not only promote civic engagement but also strengthen accountability across institutions.  Together, these measures could play a transformative role in rebuilding Nepal and restoring public trust in governance.   Just my opinion, but i could be wrong and happy to be corrected.|||I would like to highlight the following points, which I  believe need amending accordingly if everyone agrees:  1.

That's the only realistic way. Every other route, people will regret. You can try explaining the rationale but Nepali people don't understand.   We have a complex country geographically and we are poor. Corruption was never a political problem but a deep rooted cultural problem.

Euta manche jasko pachadi andabhakta vayera lagne|||Very rightfully pointed,Balen is not a borne leader, he is a choice of \"defiance\" by the people of Kathmandu against the main team political parties. I have called him the moment when he tried to hide behind the \"age window\" of not being a generation Z. this guy literally was fearing for his life, this is why he did not show up in the protest.  Granted, he had done some meaningful things in Kathmandu Metropolis, it would be a mistake to think him as a visionary leader who does not dare to put his life , for that matter, put his foot or it matters, he is a table warrior.  What generation Z is doing right now, focusing so much and few leaders such as him and others is like missing a forest for a tree. We need leaders who have bold vision, intellectual capability, integrity. It is not hard to find several such leaders and persons in our community outside of the main parties.  We do need to bring everybody from all political spectrum under the roof of national great good, mind you, only those who are remorseful, and understand that the greater good can be achieved by working together, rather than in the party line.|||I'm not against anyone, but the thing is, we have to realize everything that happened to us during that time. Please, people, don't justify anyone's decision. What if there are more capable people, too? I was disappointed with Balen, not because he wasn't there. (His life is more vital than others, I get. I can die for him, but he can't do the same). This era is way more advanced. Instead of posting a status on Facebook, he could do a live, put up a video, or do anything other than that. Desh ko laghi bhancha bhandai ma desh kae laghi garni soch cha bhanera nabujhnu. Boli ko haina action value huna paryo. It's not only about him, it's about everyone take a credit who is suitable for this position.|||Being telling this since a year watching his works.  Only thing he has done is not being corrupt like others and putting our taxes on development, that was enough for us before. But now, handling the government is a different thing and yes he's not competent for it and that's a fact|||We need a working system right now. Thik cha Balen ko auta kura vaneko usle afno bhadas status bata pokhcha tara aele ko case ma sabai kura khulera vannu pani west le next move pani herirako huncha, he stays private so neither of janta or any foreign power get to know what he will do next.  Aba paila jasto autocrat hunchu vanera mildaina kina vane janta le aba sadak mai auna nadaraume vayesi aba manipulaton garna garo parcha.

Because the problem is you and us. You only judge a person's morale on your ground. If he hadn't said anything,you would be the first to critic him. He clearly stated this movement is not his to begin and his to end.  Let be clear, if he somehow had involved in selecting susila karki ,the sole purpose of movement becomes void. She is choosen through internal fights and struggles between zen z that means they will protect her even till end. Otherwise if balen had major role in taking such decision, when going becomes tough they would have blamed balen not themselves.   The sole reason I see it here is , maturity and responsibility must be taken by zen z not balen. Now if he had disapproved they would have fought against him to justify their choise. This will be major in upcoming scenarios.|||After Prachanda, Balen is probably the smartest politician right now. Or at least he surrounds himself with smart people.

        "body": "Hey Gen-Z,  Hope you read my earlier article on “What is constitution.”  Now, Let’s learn about multiparty democracy.    There are different types of democracy: 1.  One party democracy like that of China. 2.  Two party democracy like that of USA. 3.  Multiparty democracy like that of India and Nepal. 4.  Dominant-party democracy like that of Singapore.    Nepal constitutionally practice multiparty democracy.  In multiparty democracy, we all can form a party as our fundamental rights.  Yes! Even KMAG can form a party.  (Cool ya, kholyo bhane join gara hai.)  And in multiparty democracy, you can’t ban or restrict any party from competing for power, which means you cannot constitutionally limit or restrict UML, Congress, Maoist or any party to compete for power.    Very principle is, a party in itself cannot be bad.  Its leaders can be but not the party.  And more importantly, in democracy actual perception of any party isn’t determined by group of people but election result.    Thus, you, me, Balen or anyone has no rights to say who get to compete for power and who don’t.  We can only influence but cannot and should not obstruct anyone, Not even Pappu Construction.  Basic concept of multiparty democracy is - everyone competes for power and people decide who get to rule per votes.  Interestin fact:  King Mahendra then didn’t like multiparty democracy and he introduced “party-less democracy.”  Not going to history but a ChatGPT assignment for you to expand the topic.    So, here we are back to square one.  We can’t function by restricting or limiting other political parties constitutionally.  Only way to get them out of power is by letting them compete yet never win.    If you are all for multiparty democracy, let me dissapoint you - UML/Congress/Maoist will be back in scene as rightfully so.  You can hate them but you can’t ignore them.  So better learn to accept their existence even if you hate them.  That’s what being a constitutionalist means and what will differentiate you from anarchist.    Hope you got the fundamental.    Now don’t even think of becoming Mahendra unless you are the joker from Batman.  In that case, hello there, Harvey here.  From KMAG",

Everyone got violent. vandalizing public property, business houses building, and other more important public and private assets. Why because some invaders who invaded into protest as a sense of free will to do what so ever they like because police department has backed off. Events like releasing the Ravi Lamichhane caused the prisoners to escape those where caught for there deed they did like literally rapist, murderer, goons, mafias, theft, robbers, other criminals who have did wrong deeds all are now free and roaming freely around nation. May be right beside they might be there. As day passed we saw what ideology those old politicians have placed in our mind that we must loot our own nation, our own brothers our own sisters. And I strongly believe that until and unless this ideology won’t change nation can’t be rebuild or be developed. I also liked to add we see terrorist organization leader like Osama, Bhagdadi, they all are dead but there ideology still persist and haunts the whole world so, real change begun with our mindset not through violence and violent protest, —Think of Japan for this instance, during World War II it was totally burnt into ashes, now it stand strong and with global power why because of their mindset, philosophy, ideology there old generation gave them. So I again say the “You can kill ideal but not ideology”",

        "body": "So, who should be the next PM? Or, I think a better question should be, who is the leader that we can say is fit for Nepal? Or even better would be, what kind of leader do we need right now?  # 1. A Visionary Leader for the Long-Term  So I would say: We need a leader who is a visionary, who is able to control short-term noise. This is because people will want to see something that makes them feel like Nepal has suddenly become different. But short-term development or stunts will not be the ultimate future for us and for future generations. So, we need a leader who can handle short-term criticism and who is able to take Nepal towards long-lasting stability and development.  To be clear, I am not saying that we should ignore short-term agendas or projects. But to truly have a great country, Nepal needs to have long-term, big projects or ideas which are not theoretical, but which are grounded in reality things we can achieve within the next 20 years. This is necessary, while we also need the short-term development that is necessary.  So yes, we need someone who is able to do both, while also being able to maintain peace, able to give people hope for a better future, and also able to avoid stunts and theoretical or dreamy hopes for the future.  # 2. Excellent Geopolitical Understanding  So, another thing has to be an excellent geopolitical understanding. A leader has to have an excellent understanding, or be someone who is able to understand geopolitics deeply, and is able to maintain harmony between other big countries while also not allowing too much influence of foreign powers in Nepal. So, we need someone who is able to handle geopolitical pressure and also able to maintain a good relationship while not being their puppet.  Guys, we are a small country and we are always in between India and China, so it's very necessary that we maintain geopolitics. We cannot just say \"f you\" or \"we will ignore you,\" and act like we are independent and nobody can touch us. In reality, we can never be without the political influence of these two countries and other major countries like the USA. But we need to have a leader who can ensure we have the least influence from them, and who is able to think for the people and for Nepal while maintaining the geopolitical balance of Nepal.  # 3. Political Stability is On Us  And the last thing is, but most important, political stability in Nepal. And guys, it's on us. It will be on us who we elect and how we behave. Because no matter how good or visionary or truly patriotic a leader you have, without laws and action you cannot have prosperity and development in the country.  So, we need to have a stable government. For this, we need to elect the right people, and we also need to act with discipline. And we need to work by ourselves to make our Nepal the best. So people will play a role, and we Gen Z will play a big role.",

Experience isn’t a flaw, it’s literally the one thing that tells you someone can handle the chaos. You want to hand the country over to a rookie who has no clue how the system works, how politics works, or how to deal with the mess we’re already in? That’s not bravery, that’s stupidity.  We keep repeating the same mistakes because people get blinded by shiny new faces and ignore anyone who actually knows what they’re doing. Experience doesn’t mean someone is corrupt it means they’ve been in the trenches and survived. Throwing it away just to see if a “fresh face” can magically save everything is how you crash a country.  Nepal isn’t a playground. Leadership isn’t about hype, popularity, or being young and “green.” It’s about surviving the chaos, making tough decisions, and knowing where the landmines are. If you think a rookie can do that better than someone experienced, you’re dreaming and the whole nation will pay the price for it.",

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Why not sagar Dhakal?|||Yesss|||Just promote it in your social media handle|||K bhairacha yarr discord ma pm choose bhairacha|||Ahile non political manxe thik huncha...her or Dr सन्दुक Ruit.

The president on her cabinet's recommendation dissolves the house of Representatives, 5. Her cabinet carries forward the corruption investigation and reconstruction. 6. The elections will be declared immediately. 7. The new parliament decides the constitutional amendments. (directly elected prime minister etc. and others ) 8. Then, the prime ministerial election happens. 9. She resigns as the interim prime minister. 10. New prime minister and the cabinet are sworn in. 11. The current president resigns. 12.

His involvement in fraud is not even proven — he is only in custody for investigation. Yet, instead of standing with him, Gen Z is choosing Sushila Karki, who has no political stability or proven leadership of her own.  This is shameful. If we really want change, why sideline someone like Rabi who has shown courage, and hand the interim government to someone with no accountability in politics?  As for Balen, the question about why he isn’t responding is simple: if he responds, the interim government would have to be formed by him right now, as most support him. But he doesn’t want to take the interim role because he plans to get elected in six months’ official government elections.

I kindly request everyone to convey these suggestions to the Gen-Z representatives participating in the talks.  Demands from Gen-Z that must not be ignored:  1. Leaders currently under protection by the Nepal Army must not be released immediately. Their properties must be investigated, and the strictest action should be taken.   2. The properties of leaders from all political parties must be investigated, and they must not be allowed to sell their properties or leave Nepal.   3. The illegally amassed properties of senior leaders of political parties must be nationalized.   4. Parliament must be dissolved.   5. For the current transitional period, a small cabinet must be formed under the leadership of a person with a clean image and broad public acceptance (for example: Balen). This government should then conduct parliamentary elections.   6. The newly elected parliament must amend the constitution to adopt a directly elected presidential system (where the President is directly elected by the people).   7. Once a directly elected President is chosen by the people, the interim government must hand over power.   8. The interim cabinet should consist of 5 or 7 members, with the majority representing Gen-Z.   9. There must be no compromise that takes the country backward from the achievements gained so far. The nation must be led on a progressive path in line with democratic norms and values.   10. All freedom fighters who sacrificed their lives in the Gen-Z movement must be declared martyrs. Their families must receive fair compensation, monthly social security allowances, and reservations for inclusion in state institutions.   11.

My reasons for doing so are:  1. An interim PM would be encumbered by how to handle the election. They would need to do everything to show that they are not favoring themselves. Hence, they can't properly market themselves while they are in the interim position. As I want Balen and others to get bigger pie of parliament in the next election, I don't want their prospect to be affected by this temporary position.  2. Sushila Karki, to me, is less corrupt than the current and other prevoius Chief Justices. I would trust an election ran under her.  3. As you said, her knowledge of law would be very helpful in running a fair and properly organized election.  As for influence from India, China, US, etc. I don't think she would be much help. In order to deal with superpowers, one has to be cunning and wise and I feel like Sushila is more straightforward than cunning. If she can hire people who can counter foreign influence, then that's good. I should say, I think Balen is in the same category. I have always believed that you should hire a thief/think like a thief to counter actions of other thieves. Balen/Sumana/whoever else with lack of craftiness but who comes into power should have some diplomatic person ready for the foreign minister post.|||Let there be new topic for Loksewa :- First Female PM of Nepal:- Sushila Karki|||Why सुशिला कार्की Now ?  - कानुन बुझ्नुभएको छ । - संबैधानिक कुराहरुमा जानकार हुनुहुन्छ । - संबैधानिक मुद्दाहरुमा Experienced हुनुहुन्छ । - संविधान बचाउनु छ ।  २-४ महिना पछि के गर्ने भनेर यो बिचमा सोच्न सकिन्छ , आन्तरिक चुनाव लगायत अन्य , तर देशलाई अविभावक को खाचो भैसकेको छ ।  कोहि नहुनु भन्दा हामीले विश्वास गर्न सक्ने पात्रलाई अगाडि सारौ।|||People need to understand that not all the old generation people are bad and not all the new generation people are good .

But but for this situation and as interim pm she is the best.|||So yeah, I personally think Sushila Karki will be the best choice for now. I did some research on her,  didn’t find anything shady in her record. She has experience, she has stood up against wrongdoings in the past, and as a former Chief Justice she knows the law better than most politicians out there. Right now our priority should be stability for the next 6–12 months. If we don’t manage that, we’ll become weak internally and that only increases the risk of pressure from India, China, or even the US. Yes, young leaders like Sagar have energy and vision, but they don’t yet have the geopolitical experience to handle such a sensitive situation. For an interim government, I think it makes sense to go with someone who has already proven themselves under pressure.  Most importantly  elections within a year must be mandatory. Interim government should only be a bridge, not a destination.  Right Now we should focus on being stable and let not India, China and US take any advantage of this situation.|||mani best lagcha but sushika ko against ma hune haru what are your reasons?|||Yes as a temporary prime minister.

But, he thinks whatever he has in his mind is perfect. He madly insisted to build airport in Dharan without consulting with experts or conducting any kinds of feasibility study. Still, him beihg PM wouldn't be disasterous.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal:  1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Tyo social media ko posts fan account bata ho rey.

Try to restore all public infrastructures as much as possible and, scavenge for and safeguard any documents or information banks that have not yet been safeguarded  2. Of the 3 evils, one has fled, one has been ambushed but one is still free(Prachanda) and even thriving. This shouldn't be happening. He must either be imprisoned or killed. For this we will need to come together again.  3. Those that had fled in yesterday's prison escape(especially Rabi) along with those who helped them escape must be captured, investigated and imprisoned   4. Justice - those involved in the death of the students & those who infiltrated yesterday's protest to carry their selfish motives must be identified, arrested, imprisoned and investigated.  5. Leader - we need a leader even if it's a temporary one so that the country doesn't fall as well as to ensure that the evil doesn't return and to negotiate with the international bodies/countries in order to retrieve the assets hidden by those politicians and to ask for those who fled to be returned to the country for trial. And also to direct and manage the restoration of our country   From what limited I know, the top competitors for the leadership position are 1.Balen Shah(can be a bit extreme sometimes) 2. Harka Sampang(is known to be slightly dictorial) 3.Kulman Ghising(overall good but maybe a bit mild in temper) 4. Sumana Shrestha (Don't really know much)   But please understand that leadership is not limited to these four, any patriotic person who is determined to save and develop this nation, has the vision, is willing to learn, provides absolute transparency, engages in active communication and absolutely won't engage in nepotism/corruption as well as takes strict measures against any that do is more than qualified to lead. It may be any of us who dream of a better country and is willing to make the effort.  If there are any suggestions or opinions, please comment!! This is our nation, although it's in ashes now, we have to rise up again and rebuild this nation into one we can be proud of, feel safe in and live properly .  Edit, didn't know how to change the title but everything else, I tried. I'm not trying to confuse the mass, these are just my opinions that I think are very important.",

This has left the nation in a state of uncertainty, with the pressing question: who will be the new Prime Minister, and what comes next for our governance system?  In my personal view, Nepal should think beyond temporary solutions and reimagine its political structure. I believe that the post of President should be held by the King, while still maintaining our parliamentary democracy. The King would serve as the Head of State, while the Prime Minister, chosen by the people through Parliament, would continue to lead the government and daily administration.  This system would combine the stability of monarchy with the inclusiveness of democracy. The King could symbolize unity, national identity, and continuity, while elected leaders would remain accountable for policymaking and governance. Such a structure could bridge the gap between tradition and modernity in Nepal.  However, I also recognize a challenge. If the King were restored with too much authority, there is always the risk of a return to absolute monarchy, which Nepal has already struggled against in the past. To prevent this, the constitution must be amended clearly so that:  1. The King acts only as a ceremonial head of state, similar to monarchs in the UK, Japan, or Sweden.   2. All executive powers remain with the elected government.   3. The King cannot interfere in parliamentary or judicial affairs.    This would give Nepal the best of both worlds: a symbolic monarch to uphold our cultural and historical identity, and a democratic system to ensure accountability and representation of the people.  At this critical moment, when corruption has weakened faith in politics, reintroducing the King in a constitutional role could provide much-needed stability—but only with strict safeguards. Our future should not return to absolute monarchy, but rather move toward a balanced model where tradition and democracy strengthen each other.",

Like that same monarchy didn't try forcefully converting people to Hinduism, like the same dynasty wasn't the one who cut noses off of enemies. Most ethnic groups in Nepal are descendants conquered people who had their cultures damaged and homelands looted by invaders. Why should they bow to the King who represents that. Also, this just adds another factor to create problems in politics.   The only good that's gonna happen is a slight tourism increase.|||King lyaune kei justifiable reason nai xana...
