On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.  I (21M) and my sibling (15F) are taking care of our parents during the day and our cousins help at night. Because of this, we’ve missed months of classes but we don’t really have a choice right now.  If anyone is able to help even a small amount, it would mean a lot to us.  I’ve verified the case with two of the mods and I’ll be posting medical reports in the comments as well.  Please DM or comment if you can help in any way. Even sharing this post would really help.",

            "body": "Hi, I am a retail store owner and also sell on Daraz. Lately, it feels like Daraz is squeezing small businesses like ours. They frequently run multiple campaigns with heavy discounts—likely driven by their own algorithms. While this may benefit customers, the burden clearly falls on sellers. Daraz itself appears to take no loss.  Currently, Daraz is running a new campaign called **“1.1 New Year Sale.”** I did **not** sign up for this campaign because I chose not to participate. However, I am still receiving orders under this campaign, and many of them are discounted. This surprised me, so I checked the campaign section in my seller panel. It clearly shows the message:   **“Oops, it seems you haven’t signed the agreement yet.”**  Out of curiosity, I contacted Daraz support. After repeatedly asking for clarification, I was given two explanations:  1. *“Sir/Ma’am, since you agreed to a previous campaign, you are automatically enrolled in new campaigns.”* 2. *“From our side, it shows that you have a vendor manager who may have joined the campaign on your behalf.”*  I want to clarify that I did not receive any call from Daraz regarding this campaign. In fact, whenever Daraz representatives called me in the past, I clearly informed them that I do not want to join any campaigns.  My simple and logical question to Daraz is this:   If I did not join the campaign myself, and if the campaign was either auto-joined or joined by a vendor manager, **why does the system still show that I have not signed the agreement?**  There are currently **20 of my products selected for this campaign**, and I cannot even see what discount percentages have been applied to them. This lack of transparency is extremely concerning.  Isn’t this a potential case of **fraud or unethical business practice**?   What options do I have to formally complain, and what is the **legal way** to address this issue?",

            "body": "Some time ago, I got a fake job offer letter for a job at a hotel in Turkey. They sent a long PDF with my name and details. It promised a one-year job, help with work permit and visa, and free place to stay.  They added papers like a letter to the Nepalese consulate, old company records, a chamber certificate, notary papers, and a manager's ID card.  It looked real at first, but I saw problems: wrong phone number (not matching the hotel's real website), old rules that don't fit now, and all papers are very old.  I think it's fake – the hotel is real, but someone is pretending to be them. I believe one man (or a group) is sending this same fake offer to many people from Nepal.  Has anyone else got a fake job offer letter like this for a hotel in Turkey? Or heard about it happening to others?  What should I do? Can I report to police in Nepal (Cyber Bureau or DOFE) even if I didn't pay money? Should I tell the real hotel?  Any advice? I want to stop them and help others.",

A few specific questions: * Is doing Kathmandu + Pokhara in 5 days rushed, considering travel time? * If I have to choose only one, which would be more worth it for a first-time visit? * Does either place have enough sightseeing / activities to comfortably fill all 5 days? * Are there any must-visit spots or must-do experiences you’d strongly recommend in either city * Any hotel recommendations for stay? Considering that we have a female friend accompanying us.  For context, I enjoy:  * Scenic views and nature * Walking around cities / cafés * A bit of culture and temples (but not rushing through too many) * Snow adventures.  I’ll be entering Nepal from the India side (Sunauli/Gorakhpur route) if that matters.",

You dont get to decide who is a fool|||You have 4 years of experience but you don't seem to understand that writing formatted code syntax was never the hard part. When you know exactly what to do it's pretty easy to write the code for it. The hardest part of IT is trying to find out what the right questions to ask is so that you have a semblance on what exactly to code. It's trying to understand what the users of your software want. Have AI figure that out for you and then tell me.|||with the increase in AI expect to get shitty codes delivered faster than we have ever seen. Shitty code, more bugs and more opportunities for IT devs. Not every company can afford AI that is going to cost fortune in long run. Mid-level devs would collapse, there would be junior then senior. Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||[https://sip-club-webier.vercel.app/](https://sip-club-webier.vercel.app/)  Bro yettiko website with cms, bina problem kaam garney AI le banau ani manum la bro ko kura.|||Aba Cybersecurity, AI/ML kun tira jada thik hola higher studies ko lagi?|||AI chalauna janne pani hunu paryo.

DO NOT do follow along tutorials. Use documentation and use AI to explain it to you if you feel confused. Make sure you understand at least 80% of what you're doing.  Backend specific: think everything in terms of :can this be handled by an API? can I offload this task to the backend? Do I need a DB to store this data? would I need a persistence? can this action be asynchronous?\" questions like this will give you a lot of clarity even before writing a line of code.   Do not get choice paralysis, just take something and get going. Problem solving skills are highly transferable.

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

I left my job after a year because of a toxic culture. I swear, I couldn't find a position (I was even applying for internships) at any tech company in Kathmandu. I thought it wouldn't be that difficult since I have decent projects and a year of experience, but I remain jobless for next three months. It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NepalSocial) if you have any questions or concerns.*|||2nd is bullshit|||As a regular member of this sub, here are my humble feedback. This is not and isn't supposed to be any sort of personal or accusational message to anyone, just a humble feedback with due consideration to the nature of the subreddit and reddit as whole.  Pahilo, What post stays should be defined.   My suggestion is to discard absolutely low tier low effort post like ig tiktok and reel ss unless they're of unique nature to avoid a boring feed. I mean general question should be allowed like typical address, location, how to file return, my neighbor doesn't pickup his dog poo, I am tired from work, padna manlaunna etc etc you get it. It also includes those My gf/bf doesn't love react my story, gm/gn texts etc etc  too, you get it.  Second is on the topic of serious or sensitive matter like feminism, patriarchy, social problems and all. Post with good enough body text as opinion of the OP should be made mandatory, tyo 1 liner title garne haru kamm kaaj buddhi chaina, feed wahighat matra huncha plus it creates unnecessary & misunderstanding led arguments and debates. It was fun but now it's boring as hell. Okay like make a post calling out whatever you like but avoid to title it horrendously & ultra vaguely and insensitive as to deem you as jackass. This rule will make the discussion fair and not hinder freedom of speech either, freedom of speech doesn't recommend being stupid, insensitive and jackass.  Third is to totally not allowing use of swears in TITLE, do whatever in body text just don't be Hitler. Ani typical swears like sale, gadha, yk, murdar etc other than those of heinous or demeaning nature should be allowed. Like come on these are needed to make funny and snarky comments. A little bit of fun, considering majority of the sub is of goofy, unsrs, causal nature: casual 'off words' should be let it be 😭  Fourth, Strong moderation of Serious and help flair. I see people using it as shitpost alternative. These two flair should be limited to very very serious matter. Unnecessary use will make people less sensitive to these flair, leading to increased ignorance and loss of that feeling i describe as 'alertness factor' like the feeling or alertness you get when you hear a ambulance siren. Punishment too, ipso facto, Immediate 2 day ban.  Fifth, more mods, in a way atleast one is active at all timestamp of the day. Should be of neutral nature for objectivity, or someone that isn't too deep into his position in compass, is capable of gauging both side appropriately, keep the bias (of any kind) aside when in the role or position or to exercise as moderator.  Six, to create a kinda fashion for post, making people used to the rules of sub without being a dickhead like r/nipples, in short consistency.  Seven, for any international or nationwide event, no post other than those that are well written in a manner it's seems the writer actually knows what he/she/rest is speaking, isn't generic repetitive mess like just typing the event title and saying thing like 'that is good/bad' yeahhh this gotta go. Rest of those just rewriting the title without anything strong or aren't well opinionated should be discarded too. No more of the spams. It doesn't have to be accurate or u being a Martin Luther King to get posted. Just put effort in your opinion or thing you want to say. It's much more fun to engage in such post. This will be crucial to construct the subject mention in point six.  While I respect the mods, moderation and the growth this sub saw, We're a quite the big boy sub yet the state of is little disorganized and inconsistent by moderation & feed standards, the above mention QOL changes should be enforced. In coming months or so people and users will adapt. And for the way it is written was intented and to make it little off to ensure it feels little entertaining for regular viewers.

When I used to post in r/Nepal, where flairs are mandatory, I was usually torn between which flair to choose as sometimes what you want to post does not fit into a specific category. For example, I want to post about a news, but I also want a discussion but the news is related to politics, which flair should I choose? Politics? News? Discussion? I had to try to guess which flair mods would have least problem with and would be less likely to delete my post. This was hard.

As of yet, It doesn’t have the capacity to examine the economic background of each individual in the scholarship application it seems. It’s unfair but it’s a mechanism to promote equality in the society, so that groups who have been severely underserved in the past get a fair chance today.|||Ffs, just look at the video of guy who recently got scholarship who used to do a manual labour. He belonged  so called lower caste of madhesi community there was whole media praising him in his house and in the background there were little kids who were seeing him with pride, they found a role model for them in some ways that's how the community who were abused for generations will be back at the same level, also we are not doing any favour by giving quota that's the least any one can do after centuries of exploitation|||Stop having a victim mindset.

Tyo thaha na paayi kasari meritocracy ko question uthauxhau?  Speaking as a devil's advocate: tesko bau pardada lai timro bau pardada ley kasari achhut bhanera treat garey, tesko answerable timi aafai na holau.  But remember, the system is trying to correct that systemic oppression by allowing a percentage of people who never really stood a chance in the first case just to achieve equality. To stand eye to eye, shoulder to shoulder despite the horrors they faced out of divisive cruelty by a select few elites with out-of-touch values.  Just proudly admit \"despite my generational advantage, I failed you as an offspring, father\".  Speaking as a title holder upadhyaya bahun, btw. I do not believe I'm a different breed than the ale bhai I befriended in my cowboy days, just because we spawned out of different wombs. Equity doesn't need to sniff for financial conditions.

            "body": "Recently was with friends. One of their 11 year old daughter was eyeing me from far. We've met a few times before. I called her and she came and sat next to me. I thought she wanted to say something but she was hesitating.  I began asking stuff related to school and she was replying. She's just a little kid. She doesn't look at my face but stares off, muttering and sometimes she doesnt seem to be listening to my question at all.  Suddenly starts saying stuff like, \"My school friends are weird.\" And went on to talk about the tall girl in class who has her own iPhone and shows it off.  Then she says the girl who is the top of the class worships the devil. I was like what? And she says, yeah, one day she told us that the reason she became first was because she worships the Illuminati. And that she told the class, if you want to succeed, then you have to worship the Illuminati and that you can do it \"through the laptop.\"  I really laughed out loud as I thought it was so funny. But she was serious. So i told her to continue and she said her friends make Illuminati hand signs and she really seems to believe that her friends seriously \"worship the devil.\"  I asked her, so have you tried it as well? She said No.  Then she began asking me, Do you know that the Nasa scientists actually are priests of Satan? I couldn't help burst out laughing again. \"No, well, are they? Did your friends tell you this as well?\"  She said no, its on Youtube. And said you can search it too and you can see it for yourself. I said, Sure, I would.  She told me a lot of things, including how Queen Elizabeth has an altar for the devil, selling your soul to the devil, and that sea salt isn't actually from the sea.  I actually didn't know what to tell her. But I left feeling stunned and amazed at the amount of \"information\" she had... how the Internet has filled kids minds with such conspiracies, fears, fascinations.  I remembered what she told me and was curious. I actually googled up \"Nasa scientists worship devil\" but couldn't find anything.  What's going on with these kids though. They are okay, right?",

Entrance dose is the good platform if you really want to start with basics. Also, you still got enough time so u can bring good marks to get into a good college but you need to study consistently. Dont procastinate at all. Give mock tests regularly.",

            "body": "This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

            "body": "It’s 2026 now, and we’re still having to deal with this.  A few days ago, early in the morning, I was on the street and saw a public bus with people literally hanging from the door. It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

This problem needs to be adressed and public transportation should be well organized and planned.|||Finally, someone spoke about this. This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this. This issue really needs more attention and more noise.|||KTM has enough budget with 40 percent going unused. these transportation comes under metropolitan ko authority. ask Mayor balen.

Here is one story of his conversation with his nephew Naresh Koirala.   *Naresh himself had been puzzled by his uncle’s decision to accept the result. On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP.

This is the same for food. etc. You won't need to worry about safety at all in Nepal, it's much safer than anywhere in the west, but you will have to be careful about everyone seeing you as a walking wallet which can be tough but you learn pretty fast.

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.

You can rent a really nice house in Lalitpur and hire 2 maids for help around the house. That'll cost you like 100-200k per month   But there are other things you need to consider if you decide to permanently move to Nepal.  How will you keep yourself busy? You barely have a social network if you've been living away for so long. You'll come across many people and groups who are after your money. They'll befriend you until you keep giving them what they want. And you'll actually need some of them for networking, helping you with govt bureaucracy/corruption things.  Air quality is one of the worst in the world especially in cities like Kathmandu and Pokhara. Your medical costs may increase and insurance is a scam. But I guess you probably know more about it since you've lived in the US.  Driving is hectic and stressful so get a driver for Rs 25-40k a month who can also help around.  For all these services, try to use a trusted source and not just agencies.|||i think 620,000 Npr per month  is way more than enough.|||Public transportation may overwhelm you, so maybe you could have a ride of your own or even a small car if it goes with your budget. Having own vehicle helps a lot.|||If you’re planning a retired life, I wouldn’t really recommend settling in Kathmandu itself. The city is busy, noisy, and getting more congested every year. A better option would be to live slightly outside the city in a quieter area that’s still easily accessible for hospitals, markets, and the airport.  If you enjoy nature and scenery, areas around Pokhara are great. Beautiful views, a slower pace of life, and a good expat and tourist-friendly environment. Another option is the Terai region, especially if you like the idea of growing your own vegetables and fruits. Renting a house with some land for small-scale farming can be very rewarding, and you could even keep a few chickens or goats.  That said, if you still want to be close to Kathmandu, places on the outskirts like Budhanilkantha, Godavari, Bhaktapur or Kirtipur can offer a good balance between city access and a calmer lifestyle. Wherever you choose, just make sure healthcare access, road connectivity, and daily essentials are within reasonable distance.  Honestly, I think I just described my own retirement plan too haha|||Lalitpur is an accessible elite place.|||It's more than enough..Bhaktapur is starting to get polluted..but Lalitpur and Kirtipur are livable rn..there are bars and pubs in jhamshikhel if you wanna avoid crowded Thamel|||Wear a mask.|||What you have is more than enough for a extremely good life here. Cost breakdown could look something like this  Rent - Rs. 40,000 for a flat. (2BHK) in city area  Food - Depends but if you plan to cook yourself for most meals I would say Rs. 30,000 is enough  Utility - Electricity/internet water etc - Rs. 12,000   Education? - Do you have kids? If so, a high class Nepali standard school would probably be around 30,000 per kid  Misc (transport, eat out etc) - 20,000  Total - 162k say 170k per month (assuming 2 kids education). And this is extremely generous level of spending.   Lalitpur area is good. If you want night life may be stay close to Jhamshikhel area or area close to thamel.|||How We Left Australia to Start a Farm in Nepal with No Experience - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evJX2RekWvI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evJX2RekWvI)|||see , money is a different thing ,you will have learn to adjust things like narrow and unsafe roads , broken and insufficient services etc, but  but !  once you learn the ways here and kinda slow paced life over her I strong believe you will enjoy.|||600000k per month? bruh you can live like a king here with that kind of money|||She moved to her new world at 19 bro, so chill you guys will find ease here.|||620k is more than enough for really good lifestyle. No amount of inflation in coming years will make this insufficient, otherwise 95% Nepalese are doomed.  Buying house is kinda expensive in nepal but you can get decent amount of house with about 300k usd. When buying house, check if the land has enough spaces for road, near river, previously land was swamp and u should be good. Use google map historical data for this and you should be good. Harder part would be the cultural aspect for you, though having Nepali wife, you might have gotten the taste of it. Lalitpir is livable compared to kathmandu. Best of luck|||Student here can get Lavish life if they get Rs.20,000 per month. He can pay rents, hang out, buy groceries, clubs, drinking, anything.     You are getting that money Rs.20,600 per day. I can't imagine what a lavish life you will get here.|||Yup lalitpur is great, look into more upscale sanepa or jhamsikhel areas|||You will have a very good life with that amount monthly, you can also get a house as you said you have enough saving. AC and hot water no problem as well. You can ideally look to stay around patan, lalitpur or even shankhamul area if you get a house. If i was you than I will move to pokhara for a better cleaner and quite life.there is now a new higway which will now connect kathmandu and pokhara in just 3,4 hours, I think construction will finish soon. There is plenty of night life there near lakeside. I live in abroad and my plan is similar, to move back home. My home is in kathmandu, my parents migrated from pokhara.|||Hey man,  Same situation, you’ll have PLENTY of money and live a very very lux lifestyle with how much you make per month.   The biggest thing you need to realize is 1. Your access to everything drops significantly. If youre my size (5’11 205) you will have a hard time finding clothes and shoes. 2. The pollution here is beyond rough. Most days are in the hazardous levels. 3.  No beef (there are some places but its not very good) 4. Lalitpur is amazing, we live in thecho and there is no crime in our area. We have AC in the bedroom and a solar water heater for the full house.   Good luck and i hope you enjoy living here!|||At 620000 NRS per month, you should be able to leave a pretty luxurious life. You can but will struggle to spend that much unless you are going after all the highest of high end stuff.   Lalitpur is relatively calmer, quieter than some Ktm city centres and should be as good as anywhere else. I've seen a lot of high rises with apartments very similar to American / European ones in Sanepa area but not been there in a couple years.  I suggest one or both of you to learn to drive in Nepal. Assuming you both have a US driving license, it may take a few months to get used to the Nepali driving style, but it's totally worth it. Then you can get vehicles of your own because public transport sucks.  AC and hot water should be easy enough to get installed. If you are not bound to Ktm, I suggest you get a farm house in the outskirts / small hilly towns (dhulikhel, dhading, etc.) to escape ktm heat and pollution.  Keep your finances private, DO NOT fall into guilt trap and lend money. Do not tell how much money you have, not even those you consider close. Make sure your wife is able to handle the bureaucratic stuff because you may get taken advantage of (you'll learn as you go along). Make sure you know what the local rates for stuff are. No tipping in general, round up to next 100/500 if you're feeling generous but not as much as in the US. Do not trust the water, even the bottled ones outside, especially at first. Life is relatively slow and everything takes a lot of time and patience, especially paperwork, and bureaucracy. Invest your money in US as much as possible. Only keep a comfortable amount in Nepal. NRS deflation against dollars is crazy. Be careful during night time, crimes are not that high but still vigilance is warranted. Beware of the street dogs.  Hope you have a pleasant life in Nepal. Good luck and keep us posted.|||That’s awesome man. I think $4k/mo is plenty to live off. I haven’t been back in a while and others can correct me but basically beside rent and food and a bit of misc expenses there really isn’t anything else. No insurance. No taxes if you rent and don’t work (foreign income). So if I were in your shoes I’d save an outright 50% in a bank account giving like 6% interest and splurge the rest.   Nepal, and especially Kathmandu, is like anywhere else on the planet. You could live frugally and save a load of money or be high flying in elite circles that will have you broke just supporting your lifestyle.    Cheers man. You living the dream a lot of us dream of lol. Good stable income awesome Nepali life.|||Join some expat groups when you come (WhatsApp/FaceBook) so you can ask where to find things you miss from home. If you have any questions from an American living in Nepal perspective feel free to DM me. Good luck. 👍|||Your monthly retirement pay might be enough for sufficient lifestyle in lalitpur  , night life in lalitpur is not big as in thamel and is mostly surrounded by temples , buying house in lalitpur might be expensive but living in rent there might be frugal , i dont know much about house prices here and about transport , it is easily accessible|||this is decent for a good life here!|||I advise you to stay outside the valley, where there is good road access to Kathmandu, and it is quicker. Your retirement can leave a very good life in Nepal. Choose a good location where you get fresh air, which is impossible in Kathmandu valley|||With that much money you could di lot of things here ! Start a animal husbandry to retire.|||[removed]|||You wont need air conditioning (as an American who lives north of Canada) but I do recommend you look at somewhere like Pokhara due to the air pollution. I do really like Kathmandu but having spent a lot of time there its my one place in Nepal where I wont stay for long periods of time.|||620k you’ll live lavish lol dont worry|||Just curious. What leads to retirement pay like that ? 401 v|||Thats more than my yearly salary.     Try to get home in jhamsikhel/dhobighat, Lalitpur. Its best for your requirements.|||6.2lakh per month is enough for a family to live in luxury here.  So, I think you can retire here easily.|||Since you are retiring, I assume you do not have kids to take care of. Given that, 600k a month is more than enough in Nepal. To give some context, a friend of mine retired in Nepal, his 4 servants and full time driver together costs him 125k a month.|||620k/mnth will give you a royal life|||Is there any specific reason to be at Kathmandu otherwise I would suggest Chitwan, Bharatpur!|||620k is enough to live like a king. lalitpur is the safest. I have always felt super safe in Nepal. never taken any precaution. walked at midnight. got home super late. only needed to worried about stray dogs lol. again I am a fairly tall nepalj guy so my experience might not be typical but overall its very safe.|||[removed]|||150k-200k is more than enough to live a good life anywhere in nepal for a family of 3.  buy a second hand car if you got kids, or buy a bike if its only you two and transportation is sorted too.|||Its equivalent to earning 20k-25k a month in US  You can hire maids, travel to places, afford finest things that Nepal has to offer. And still be able to save big chunk.  So idk man|||Yeah just don't   If you wanna enjoy retirement, don't   Best thing you could do is change your mind|||Too polluted|||Lalitpur will drain you fast. Expensive and tight the money is good and should last you life time if spent properly.  You should consider staying in Raniban Kathmandu its safe and has a good expat community its clean fresh air and relatively cheap.  Rent for first 3 month and consider buying a house. Realestae in kathmandu is the safest investment. You could sell it with ease if needed.|||Money wise you are good. That is surplus money for living a decent life in Nepal. You might need to consider reinvesting surplus back in the US or invest here in Nepal to multiply further.  But major thing is what will you be doing here in Nepal? You can try to utilize your US skill here to engage and help Nepal and Nepali people.|||From a financial perspective,  you are quite well settled.  Lalitapur, good choice. For your budget I would prefer somewhere around the sanepa, jhamsikhel area, there are many embassy and other high profile residents so you won't get bad company, and live a lifestyle you want  From a social point of view. Since you mentioned retirement era, you could learn Nepali if you want which is optional btw   To make a retirement life. There are plenty of groups organizing hikes, trek and events, you along with your wife would join and enjoy the retirement life. Until you feel comfortable on your own.  Mostly, we Nepalese are kind towards foreigners, so you mostly should receive good hospitality. (Few exceptions could be anywhere )  Lastly, Welcome to Nepal. Hope you enjoy it here !!|||Its better to stay there|||If anyone around Balkumari/Lalitpur wants to play badminton casually, I’m looking to form a small group. DM me",

            "body": "This is not rage bait.  Contrary to popular belief, it is actually possible to earn well and build real wealth in Nepal. What “earning well” or “being rich” means will differ from person to person, but if you are creative and think a bit differently, there are genuine opportunities to make good money.  I am 24M, and I have already earned enough to build a new house, buy land, and make investments that are giving steady returns. My rental income / interests alone now matches what many consider a minimum wage job in Nepal. Aba eslai flex jasari vanea haina, but line vae you are welcome.  I agree that building one massive company or unicorn in Nepal is hard. But it is equally easy to build multiple small or medium income streams and make them work together. Tyo chai dherei le sochdaina. Ofcourse next Facebook is hard to be build in Nepal but Nepal can build 2 school management software sell it to 2 school ani also starting exporting them finger print device (this is very lame example but you get where i am going)  One big problem I see is how conventional people are about careers. Many wait for college to end, then wait for internships, then wait for referrals. Ani feri last maa nepotism vo vanera ultai runxan.  Send that email to an industry leader asking for work. Apply for remote jobs that pay in USD. Build skills that can be exported. Network aggressively. Be uncomfortable. Opportunities rarely come through formal paths in Nepal, but they do come if you knock hard enough.  People in my friend circle have achieved even more than I have, and I see this trend growing. More young people are figuring out how to combine remote income, local investments, and multiple side bets.  If things go right, building a 5 crore corpus while maintaining strong cash flow is not unrealistic. I am not saying 5 crore is some magical number, but starting from nothing and reaching that level in Nepal gives you freedom. Tespaxi i think its more of a choice if you want to work specifically for money or not. Hunata sabko afno life ra dream hunxa  Yes, it is not easy. And yes, people will say this only applies to tech. I disagree. Any field with a solid global market works. Nepal has an advantage: relatively cheap labor and living costs. If you can export your skills, services, or products to a stronger economy, the money is there.  Also $ huda sano sano investment opportunity cash in garna ni easy hune raixa. Nepal maa opportunity huda manxe snga lagani garne opportunity hudaina, so having some $ constantly coming through one work , you can fund another opportunity.  Aba new khojdai aaune lai ta k vannu ra but koi serious xa vane i am open to share more details. Malai few domain ko idea chai vaisako on how to go past that typical earning range chai. But again this post is not about specific field, so it depends on your skill and industry. But i can help with some strategies i took and you can see if anything you can apply from it, so maybe you can achieve even better result.  Edit (IMPORTANT) - This is not about something specific or me trying to sell any course etc LOL. I achieved this with my tech + investment + some side business skill ani i was trying to tell how euta primary job + some smart investment can open door in Nepal vanera. I am not trying to promote any specific skill or industry. I was bit happy today hence shared this, take it as motivation or feel free to DM/ask me about anything specific if you think that can help. I posted this etikai.     Edit 2 - Maybe this all thing will be more relavant if you are from tech background. Because that helps to get USD earning which can be invested in Nepal better. But not impossible for other industry.",

More often than not, they got 1000% decimated because men are programmed to attack & protect.  And what do you think the wives of the warriors who died did? Do you think they fought? All of them? Fk nah. Maybe 5-10% of the women fought and died with honour. What about the remaining 90-95% ? They did what they’re biologically programmed to do. SURVIVE. They survived however necessary.

Treacherous she was, Anck-Su-Namun didn't bother to build a good image upon Nefertiri who harbored misgivings toward her and began an affair with Imhotep, the High Priest of Osiris, which was forbidden because no other man was allowed to touch her.  Having foreseen that Seti I would discover their forbidden love, Imhotep and Anck-Su-Namun conspired to kill the Pharaoh. The two then killed Seti I and when Seti's bodyguards the Medjai rushed in to aid the pharaoh on Nefertiri's orders, Anck-Su-Namun convinced Imhotep to flee from the scene as she committed suicide in a bid to distract the guards, trusting his powers as the high priest of Osiris where he would resurect her.  Imhotep and his priests were ordered to perform the concubine's funeral services shortly after her death. It entailed casting soul-condemning spells on her corpse, removing her heart (normally left within a mummy) along with the rest of her vital organs, and burying her remains in the middle of the desert. In addition, the slaves present were ordered to bury the body and be killed by the soldiers present. The priests murdered the soldiers in order to keep the location of Hamunaptra a secret forever. Imhotep broke into Anck-Su-Namun's crypt at night and stole her body. He then took it to the necropolis Hamunaptra, also known as the City of the Dead. Here, the blasphemous priest attempted to resurrect her using the forbidden Book of the Dead, unaware that he was being watched by the Medjai. The ritual was cut short before Anck-Su-Namun's soul could properly return to her mortal body, the canopic jar containing her heart was smashed, and her soul was returned to the Underworld. Destroying her heart ensured that the ritual could never be completed. Imhotep's followers and the city guards on duty that night were sentenced to be mummified alive as a form of retribution, while Imhotep himself was cursed with the dreaded Hom-Dai and buried alive beneath Hamunaptra.  Imhotep was accidentally brought back by a librarian named Evelyn Carnahan who was Nefertiri's reincarnation in 1926 A.D. and set out to repeat the ritual that had been botched so many centuries before. Imhotep had been close to completing the ritual the previous time, requiring no sacrifice, but after three thousand years, he needed a human sacrifice to provide Anck-Su-Namun with fresher flesh. After taking the Book of the Dead, finding Anck-Su-Namun's five sacred canopic jars, and choosing Evelyn, as his sacrifice, he found Anck-Su-Namun's body and tied Evelyn by her ankles and wrists to a sacrifice altar in Hamunaptra. Imhotep was about to kill Evelyn with a ceremonial dagger and carve out her heart as a replacement after reuniting Anck-Su-Namun's spirit and body, bringing her back to life, when Evelyn's brother, Jonathan, entered the chamber with the Book of Amun-Ra, the only force capable of killing the High Priest.|||That is a difficult name for a native speaker.",

            "body": "I was going through some debates about Islam and their worldview, but I could not shake off how radical the religion is. Mind you, I am not inferring all Muslims are inherently radical, but the religion shows tenets of extremism and oppression against women throughout its religious text.   i. Quran is supposed to be the word of god, divine and infallible. It is actually Allah speaking to us through the written texts by Muhammad. So there can not (or at least is very little room for) ambiguous interpretation of controversial things in it.   ii. Discrimination and violence against women is inexorably intertwined throughout the text. Here are some examples,   a. Surah An-Nisa 4:34: This verse states that men are guardians over women because Allah has made some excel others and because men spend their wealth on them. It advises men to admonish disobedient wives, separate from them in bed, and, as a last resort, ***strike them*** lightly if they persist in rebellion. (But, wives striking back at husbands is not permissible)     b. Surah Al-Baqarah 2:282: In financial transactions requiring witnesses, it specifies calling two men or one man and two women, so if one woman makes an error, the other can remind her (implying women's intellectual worth is exactly half as that of men).     c. Surah An-Nisa 4:3: Men are permitted to marry up to four wives if they can treat them justly, but women have no such polygamous rights.     iii. Discrimination and violence against 'non-believers' is called for multiple times. Here are some examples,   a. Surah At-Tawbah 9:29: Commands fighting those who do not believe in Allah or the Last Day until they pay the jizya tax in submission (tax acts as a deterrent, if you have to pay tax to believe in or worship god of your choice, you would just say fuck it in most cases).  b. Surah Al-Bayyinah 98:6: Describes disbelievers (those who reject Islam) as \"the worst of creatures,\" destined for Hell.     c. Surah At-Tawbah 9:5: Instructs killing polytheists wherever found after sacred months, unless they repent and convert.     These are only few examples that is readily available everywhere. Yet, we cannot even have open conversations about it due to 'political correctness'. The pillar of Islam is radical and is based on discrimination, violence and rejection of things non-islam. Tolerance is not part of the religion (just look at all the muslim nations and how they treat their women).   The percentage of Muslim population as the share of the country has been steadily growing. They are notorious for rejecting family planning and birth control measures and consistently have the highest fertility rates. Is there not a conversation to be had?      Disclaimer - This is not a 'hate-speech' or anything. Other religious scriptures have plenty of amoral or downright immoral tenets. This is just to understand more and create positive discussion. I believe Nepal should he secular with the right to religious freedom.",

Boycott them. Boycott religion. They are anti-freedom.|||Pashupati nath le Allah ko rakshya garun|||Oh boy!! Discussion about religion never goes the right way my brother. But anyways!!  1. If interpretation was minimal or not allowed, there would not be multiple schools. (Hanafi, maliki, hanbali). Islam in itself has been changing historically to fit context(famine), culture(india), geo-politics (iraq, egypt).   2. Islamic ethics is not derived from isolated verses alone, but from the Quran and the Prophet’s lived example. And it is mostly societal prejudice, lack of education, more than cultural. Have you seen rural india or even inner terai of nepal?   3. Mostly for written debt. And mostly as women were not heavily involved in economy. But the women always could inherit property, initiative divorce, and were considered independent moral agents accountable to God directly.  4. The other part matters maybe?  ``` If you fear you cannot be just, then marry only one.```   ``` You will never be able to be just between wives, even if you strive. ```  Again it is all about interpretation and was mostly for post war context (men died more women). Still better than sati that we had maybe?  5. Christianity flourished in Jerusalem. Hinduism strived under muslim empire in india. It is easier to find a church (egypt) or temple (Bangladesh) in islamic nation than to find a mosque in deep rooted hindu or christian area/nation (china?).   6. Every religion does this? Christianity - eternal damnation (wahtched vikings?), hinduism - karmic punishment, buddhism - rebirth in hell.  7. If state behaviour = religion then, Christianity- colonial genocide, Hinduism- caste oppression, Buddhism- Rohingya persecution.  Political power corrupts religious ideals. See turkey vs afghanistan, Indonesia vs Iran, saudi vs Bangladesh.  8.  Fertility drop sharply with education, urbanization, and women’s employment. Iran’s fertility collapsed after female education expanded. Bangladesh’s fertility fell dramatically without abandoning Islam.  Basically religion no good or bad, power corrupts people and corrupted people very bad. When this continues for long, the bad becomes the norm.

One of the main things they did was kill all left leaning political movements hence making it easier for far right movements to take power. For eg Turkey 🇹🇷 has not had the type of western interference that other Muslim countries have and is a secular country. It gave women the right to vote in 1934. This question is like asking Bahuns hey do you secretly hate everyone because your religion has told you that you are genetically and spiritually superior to everyone else. And also Indonesia and Malaysia are both Muslim countries as well. And are more stable than the oil rich Middle East even though they both have faced CIA interference. Especially Indonesia.

Equality is not part of many religions (just look at the non-muslim nations like Nepal or India for example and how they treat/have treated their women, i.e. child marriage, dowry, kidnapping women for marriage, chhaupadi, domestic violence, sati pratha, etc.). Like quran, even bible or garud puran and swasthani include lots of sexist content. It sounds like you do hold a stereotypical and generalised perception about muslims but it's good that you are open for conversation.  Every religion and culture has its good and bad side. It's important that we see both, choose to follow the good, and continue challenging the bad from our end. - A non-muslim|||There is no understanding religion. Everyone will say their interpretation is right and other bad things are not what their religion preaches.   But it’s just weak people clinging to something. All religions.|||I also started learning about islam from debates with atheists, christians and ex-muslims. Ex-muslims are the most unhinged ones (understandably so). I might be biased against Islam but I don't know where the unbiased line is. Here's my two cents:  I think your intuitions are largely correct. I think the issue with islam is not of good or bad but of how to assimilate incompatible belief systems.  Your point (i) is the main issue 'good' muslims face with. Two statements \"Quran is truth\" and \"Mohammed is perfect\" are not conclusions but the premise of their belief system. Its a monumental challenge to defend the problematic parts you mentioned for them compared to christians and hindus; too less wiggle room for alternative interpretation.  I would also appreciate more muslims come forward and discuss these issues. I don't see this happening and I think I know why. I see only two outcomes of such discussions: get exposed being intolerant or change the belief.  There are couple of examples: \"Muslim guy admitting he would happily watch an apostate executed if he was in islamic country\" and \"Another guy saying is okay to marry and have sex with 5 yo\". Mind you both of them are youtube celebrities with large followings. Which is why good muslims are mostly silent or resort to disingenuous arguments nowadays. I vaguely remember seeing Jakir Naik in TV when I was kid.  Islam is filled with anti jewish sentiments and even necessitates muslim to kill them before end of time. Which explains why israel-palestine war gets a lot of attention and why all the muslims sides with palestine.  I know there are many muslims who coexist and don't believe the verses you mentioned or choose not to act upon but this will not change the fact that those verses exist and they claim to follow the book that contains them. I will always be skeptic unless islam and quran goes through radical reformation which I don't see happening given their premise.  I also find this \"alternative interpretation\" argument hard to digest. If your book clearly says kill the non-believers and you have to perform a mental gymnastics to get non-violent interpretation then maybe the peaceful muslims are the radical ones.  Now to address your points. Don't let the label of political correctness or hate speech stop talking about things you are concerned about. I should be able to criticize and absolutely shit on any ideas. Thats the fundamental of scientific process. If anyone gets offended that their problem. I don't agree with right to religious freedom because religion has vague definition and it can contradict with other rights.|||If u take it seriously, u r a problem.|||I guess, you just read few verses without interpretation. You have to read ups and downs on what circumstances surah of Quran was revealed. Also, don’t seem like you are interested in learning about Islam. I am Muslim women and I have all the right, I don’t feel oppressed. It’s just that people of other religions think we are oppressed.  If I have to be honest about oppression, people around all religions try to oppress women which go against the teaching of all religions. It’s patriarchy that took over religious leaders and they mislead people.  If you really wanna learn about Islam, purchase these three books; the sealed Nectar, Quran and then, a book called, ‘ A Commentary on Ash-shamail al-Muhammadiyyah’. If you read these books, Inshallah you gonna cry and gonna fall in love with Prophet Mohommad and Allah.  Your curiosity makes sense, as people called themselves slave of Allah and follower of prophet Mohommad and goes on doing exact opposite of what Prophet mohommad taught us.|||I have the same questions   And as i got more into the rabbit hole   I found out every religion is extremist with islam being extreme on this.  How to hide this :  Below is just my personal opinion :   I like to be called (a)thiest.  I mean i follow hinduism but .... Idk i am not that frustrated when someone says hindu this hindu that , cause i immediately assume someone was extreme.|||OP:  'I want to understand more.'  Also OP: Proceeds to explain exactly why the religion is evil, radical, and intolerant while citing specific verses to support your pre-existing bias.  Let’s be real, OP. You didn't write this to learn. You wrote this to lecture. You have clearly already made up your mind, so why pretend otherwise?  If you actually wanted to understand, you would ask, 'How do you interpret Surah An-Nisa 4:34 in a modern context?' or 'How does the community view these specific verses?' Instead, you dumped a list of grievances and demographic fear-mongering about fertility rates. You haven't come here for a conversation; you’ve come here to validate a conclusion you’ve already reached.|||If you want to learn about islam in general, I would start with some of these.   [Crash course islam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpcbfxtdoI8)  [Crash course islam and politics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka8csjsmX6I)  Also generally when the scriptures are around a thousand years old, think how much conservative our society was just until 20 years ago.  Now how much worse it is for the people in the past.|||If you really wanna learn better talk to grok than redditors.  Islam does have tons of problems. But there are also many schools and many interpretations. Islam was designed to incorporate every aspect from day to day life to government. There is islamic jurisprudence, quran, haddith, fiqh.  From my observation, what i found out was that. There is main text quran. Its their most important one. Then later compiled ones haddith, which are sahil (Authentic), hasan (good), daif(weak) regarding its authenticity. Then there are jurisprudence books. Which they use to run a society or use for the basis of sharia law.  You seem to be cautious or bothered by all the fucked up things on islam. Its true. There are many. It's better to know the history. Islam was spread mostly through conquest and they developed highly apartheid society when of you weren't a Muslim. Or a non Muslim who didn't pay jizya, you had little rights and slavable. Religion is a big part for them, and worshipping an idol was the biggest crime in their religion (shirk). They punish apostasy and blasphemy with death. And these aren't fringe practices. If you look at history. This has been the norm for most of Islamic states. This is why there is so much radical aspects to islam. This is just the tip of the iceberg. You can read the book of Islamic jurisprudence, like tahir al washilah, which was a book used for Islamic state in iran. To get an inking of how Islamic states ran. You will likely find 100 problematic stuff like pedophilia, apartheid status, barbaric punishments or capital punishment, treatment of women.  However there is many interpretations in islam. Sects like shia ans sunnis. Traditions like suffisim, druze. Each country has a different flavor of islam. However they are the most consistent and dogmatic religion. Btw, suffism is mostly a spiritual traditional stuff so less of that poltical and jihad stuff which is radical.  It's also important to notice that there are plenty of non radical mulsims. Who view islam as a peaceful religion. Who believe in tolerance of other religions. Its mostly getting prominency in modern days. Where people usually only believe in the Quran and reject all the haddiths and fiqh. And quran can be interpreted in a peaceful way. It's not bad compared to books like bible. Could even be relavent to today's world.  Also important to notice that. Most people who suffer due to radical islam are muslims. Before anyone stereotypes all muslims.|||I think religions are basically cultures sugar-coated with some god's stamp of approval. But nobody knows that god.",

The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

Most of the teachers in school and college all of the are pedophiles.|||I'm not aware of the definition - is it like somebody who's grooming girls under 18? Are you using the term loosely?  It's an individual-thing and not a profession-thing. Girls sending DMs to get referred (when they have no skills) is also more common than you think. I get many DMs asking for free help (refactors)/ referrals (barely know them/ barely seen their code) and I just ignore them. I help many people (m/f) on a daily basis, and I've never met most of them. I know many of my 'male' senior friends (no female senior dev friends) do the same.  You should clear your exams first. Last bullet point sounds like a good plan.  Most people here will be happy to review 1-2 projects for free. I'll jump in if it's Python/ Next.js/ ML. Just post your github repo on some relevant community and they'll do free reviews.   Edit: I dont do free mentorships, happy to review repos/ coding practices.|||I get what you r saying but the term pedo applies to people who r way older and trying to groom n trap minors (under 18).

I thought it wouldn't be that difficult since I have decent projects and a year of experience, but I remain jobless for next three months. It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason.

I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||[https://sip-club-webier.vercel.app/](https://sip-club-webier.vercel.app/)  Bro yettiko website with cms, bina problem kaam garney AI le banau ani manum la bro ko kura.|||Aba Cybersecurity, AI/ML kun tira jada thik hola higher studies ko lagi?|||AI chalauna janne pani hunu paryo.

            "comments": "Hop|||After reading a few of the replies here, my suggestion is simple: secure yourself first.  Hand in your one-week notice only after you’ve signed an agreement with the new company. Get everything confirmed before you mention anything to your current employer.  Once that’s done, approach HR or management and let them know you’ve received a better opportunity elsewhere.. ideally one offering around 4× your current pay and that you’ve decided to move forward with it. If you feel it’s appropriate, apologize for the short notice. You can also give them a chance to match the offer (though realistically, they probably won’t).  Most likely, they’ll accept the resignation.  If they’re the difficult type, they may threaten to hold your pay. In that case, try to get paid before resigning or be mentally prepared to walk away from the remaining amount. Legally, there isn’t much they can do anyway, especially if they were paying below minimum wage.  If you don’t want to go down that route, there’s another option:  You can simply inform them that a personal issue has come up and you need to return to your village for a few months (say, at least five). Explain that this is why you’re giving a week’s notice instead of disappearing. They can’t take action against you in this situation either… at most, they’ll process your exit.  Things to keep in mind:  - Try to ensure you don’t have many unpaid days before handing in your notice. - Don’t share any details about your new employer.. no names or any hints. If they’re toxic, they can try to sabotage it. - Give at least a week’s notice. Two weeks is better if you can manage it. - Don’t get manipulated into staying for a minor raise. If they can’t offer at least 3× what you’re earning now, the new role is clearly the better move. Be firm about leaving.   I’m saying this as someone who’s been on the employer side and dealt with situations like this regularly. We expected high performance and strong work ethics, and while we paid slightly above the market average, the pressure wasn’t for everyone. Many people left as soon as they got paid and that’s understandable. What we did appreciate was honesty and advance notice.  A proper 14-day resignation helps the employer transition work, hand over projects, or train replacements. Disappearing without notice only creates problems for everyone, and I wouldn’t recommend that approach despite what some comments suggest.  You don’t owe the company anything beyond basic professionalism. Just as they can terminate you immediately for violating terms, you also have the right to leave at any time. If you want to stay ethical and professional, give a 14-day notice. If not, at least give a week so the transition is smoother for you and them.  All the best with whatever route you choose and good luck with what’s next. Cheers!|||Just leave, they will find an replacement. Estai ho corporate ma, if you don't hop, you don't progress|||That's why always be sure and do proper research before signing up the contract.

I am doing a WFH job that doesn't pay much, and isn't good for my technical growth as well, as I am handed mostly marketing tasks. I have a choice to do this part time and get the new onsite job which requires me to relocate to Kathmandu, which I am much more than okay to do.  But my dad isn't supportive of this. He strictly wants me to complete my bachelor's and prepare for loksewa, whose perks I understand. But I feel I can do much better in tech itself and don't enjoy thought of prepping for Loksewa and doing a sarkari jaagir.   I am an academic person and will definitely pursue my studies till phD or more, might as well move to abroad, if my finances are strong enough till then and I get scholarship with assistantship.  My father is narcissist person, an angry man, not open to 2 way conversation, and any action I take has consequences over rest of my family, following along with consistent distress, fights and chaos at home. What should I do? Has anyone been through this before?",

If you have trustworthy relatives, ask for their advice and help, if your grandparents are alive ask them for help.   Before joining this job, just go to that office and ask some of the employees about the office, nature of the senior and working environment. If you like the place and believe that it is a good place to work, join it, but tell them your story (optional).   If you have some relatives there, then ask your dad you want to visit them and explore Kathmandu, because you're bored staying home.  If the job is a sure shot and not a scam then you may have some friends in Kathmandu, ask them to find a room or hostel. Ask your relatives as well and some people close to your dad for your help.|||Talk with him and make him understand that’s the only option you have else you’ll have chaos in your home this way.

Threaten you will take your sibling and never look at him again if he keeps being abusive for a year.   Then do it anyways and rub it in with a \"ANGXA MUDDHA\" if you have family property.     Stop giving abusers power over you, youre an adult, if he doesn't respect you you should not respect him.

But FIRST: Calculate on what things you are dependent on your father/family. Gradually eliminate the dependency, take responsibility. Move out.  Also, remind your father that government jobs are not as beneficial as they used to be. No pension, even if they have CIT, so do private jobs, you can allocate more portion since private pay more.  Do multiple job.   The disclaimer: I value freedom of choice without stepping over someone else's freedom. So it might be extreme but this is what I would have done.  Forget your father, if you are just another 'responsibility' to him then release him of this burden. Plan for years, move to Kathmandu IF you don't have to ditch bachelor.   Your father is going to complain regardless. So do not stress over making waves in your family.   Again; plan ahead. What COULD you do if you are thrown out? Do you have proper identity documents?...... Complete your bachelor and move out.|||Hey I have an idea Go tell your father that it is some kind of karar job and after 1 year they will make me permanent like sarkari jagir and get out that's the first step !!

            "comments": "What a shit take! AI is there to make your learning easier, to make you understand concepts faster and better. Learning and understanding is important! How? Doesn't matter|||Oh it is the most useful thing in terms of learning. You can quickly learn things that would take hours before.  It will tell you line by line what each piece of code does. So if you don't understand something, just ask it will tell you in as much detail as you require. But you have to sit there and read.|||Not much. I don’t like hallucinated “ best practices “ examples|||adapt or perish|||Lol. I made it through my masters with AI. I would ask it questions and it would answer. Sometimes they were wrong. So I'd repeatedly ask until the answer made sense to me. I would definitely not take AI's word 100%   The thing that AI helped in was it directed me towards the right path. So if there was a concept I didn't know, I'd ask it and then I'd independently Google the terms AI mentioned. Then read research papers that explained it in more detail. If I didn't understand the paper, I copied the paragraph, pasted it in AI and asked it to explain it to me in simpler terms.   You just gotta know how to use AI.|||I do use it but not that much for new concepts, mostly to get sorta reminded as to how this thing worked or smtg like that. The times that i use ai for new concepts are when i am reading a book or have a cerdible src of information but i  cant get my head around a topic/concept. I dont particularly like it but why not use it if its available. I never use it for things that are completely foreign to me as i wont be able to tell hallucinations apart and will have to search for a credible src anyway.|||AI is helpful and it saves a lot of time . Now a days , I use chatgpt and grok first then move to youtube videos for better understanding .|||it is such a shit take, it's like saying i'd rather read from books then ever use google, first things first you should never use AI to try to thoroughly learn something. AI is for bits and pieces of information that otherwise would've taken ages to accumulate.  For example if i am reading a book or docs on anything and say i don't understand a given part , it could be some code logic or mostly it's me not understanding how certain concepts are \"worded\" as in the structuring of sentences not just the meaning of a word is quite complex certain times , i'd ask chatgpt (mostly for my lack of comprehension of certain sentences) to explain me the same thing in brief and i'd try to make sense of it with the actual text. So this is the first use case. Since my goal here is to learn certain programming concepts not english language it to me occurs like a compromise between my learning process and developing reading skills.  The second use case would be say if i was learning backend of something like that and i wanted to do something that'd require me to code up a frontend to execute certain api calls (i know you've got thunderclient or postman for the same use but for form data or images or audio files i'd always prefer a simple html form element be presented ) instead of coding that same thing from scratch i'd ask claude to generate me a simple frontend. In this regard it's simply more sensible to save time using AI rather than be too egoist to use it.  Really you can't learn a certain concept to its core using AI, it's just not possible so i agree with what the post says those three bulletins , but not the title of the post.  p.s. it has been easier to ask chat-gpt to find me a resource to learn something. Infact i started reading O'Reilly's because chat-gpt recommended me their books once and i started look around more about this publication. It's really easy to gather resource. I'd hundered percent use AI to help me learn something. And just a little hint if you ask any LLM for certain things and you are confused about the validity of the answer you can narrow your questions to that particular thing. Since it's a LLM it's can't possibly say \"i can't \" or \"i don't have information about it\" because it works on probabilistic model so it sends any result that gives the highest probability for a sequence of words as a response to a request. So you can't easily see the LLM struggling when even after a ton of clarification it sends the same result again and again it's just that amongst all the possible sequence of word it has the one sequences which is inherently wrong has the highest value of probability and since there are no other better sequences than that wrong one the LLM sends it back over and over|||my steak is too juicy and my lobster too buttery|||I upload my book and interact with it , Yea it's AI tool. I upload my solution and ask it for the way to make it better|||If you don't use it to learn, you're living under a rock. And you don't deserve this field.   Using it to do things for you instead? A very grey road, you are replacing yourself and losing your skills.|||I have learn things I would never have in my life is there wasn't Ai|||Weird take, I mean if he enjoys the struggle then good for him. But I personally lose motivation to study if I encounter too many setbacks like getting stuck in a math problem or not understanding some concept etc. So I use AI all the time.",

Even if indirectly and directly the same rich people employ the working class.   It doesn't mean you need to suck up to rich people. You do need to call them out for their corruption and lobbying but you need to understand that not all rich people are corrupt.   There's this very troubling mentality among Nepalis that if you're rich you must be corrupt but they have it backwards. One doesn't imply the other.

So my suggestion, get some experience in Nepal first, learn how to communicate, show up your skills and build your portfolio.|||Don’t come to conclusion with just  one  example. Earlier I saw a post where a nepali guy had $80k in his portfolio while working as student. These both are extreme examples.The guy in this post came to USA to study bachelor with full financial and social responsibility. Doing bachelor is always tough while working illegally for 4 years. I don’t encourage people to go for bachelor degree with their sole financial responsibility. With more effort and research, people end up in scholarship and low tuition fee college. This will change the whole dynamic of this situation. However, the grass is not greener at other side too. There will be challenges related to immigration and getting green card. Anyone can come embracing those challenges and keeping open mind.|||Its tough for students and it always has been. Struggle is part of life. Consistency is the key i think.

Every now and then,we get a crashing news:(|||Not an expert, but with whatever knowledge I have for following aviation industry, I have some conclusions   1) The plane has almost gone 300m off the runway, if it was a late touchdown and if the Pilots knew it wouldn't stop why didn't they go for a go around, not blaming the pilots but I also think they didn't attempt a go around cause the other side has Indian border and they would have to take a steep left turn and might even enter Indian border, and file new IFR.   2) If the plane had touchdown normally then, as shown in the photos, no flaps extended is seen, either they retracted the flaps early or the flaps weren't extended at all, this suspects for a hydraulic failure.   Adding to the 1st point, it was a layover flight, maybe the intensions of pilot was a quick landing, I am not at all shifting the blame at anyone but it's just my take.

At first I genuinely thought he was asking for a lift, so I stopped without thinking much. Then he started talking about money. He asked if I had esewa or not. I was confused because in my head I was thinking, why would I charge someone for a lift?  He told me his bike had crashed badly and he urgently needed cash right there on the road. He said he had money in his e-wallet and would send it to me immediately.I believed him. I gave him 1500 in cash. After that he said he’d return it in an hour instead. To make me trust him, he even showed me cash in his hand, maybe around 10k, and said something like, “Why would I scam you just for 1500?” I even told him how important that money was for me college, rent, living alone and all that. He kept saying no worries, reassuring me, talking nicely, making it sound genuine. Now it’s been hours. He’s blocked my number.  I honestly don’t know what I was thinking at that moment. I just thought a fellow Nepali rider was asking for help and I didn’t want to turn my back. For someone living alone, 1500 is a big hit. It’s not just the money, it’s the feeling of being fooled so easily.  Posting this mainly as a warning. If someone asks for urgent cash on the road and promises to pay later, please think twice.

What I meant to say is that Balen has to resign from his mayoral position, and by bringing all this chaos, he would be nowhere and a nobody.   But also, from another point of view, what I came to know was that he doesn't have that many suitable candidates either to put on that Samanupatik list (Prakash Saput - who we've seen rallying for KP Oli in the past -  a Balen side's candidate), and similarly, seeing Kulman's relatives on that list tells the opposite.   It's a whole messed-up situation, I guess. Some people and the media are trying to establish the narrative that no one is perfect and that what's important is correcting mistakes on time. On the other hand, some people and the media are setting the narrative that they are no different from those old political parties.      Absolutely get the point that when top leaders team up at the last minute, there would be a whole lot of mess. But they are in no position, considering the political experience they have, to act as if they don't know what they are doing. They are in the public limelight (every step they are taking, people are following super closely) right now, rightly so, cuz people have started to believe that this is the one & only alternative force that can dethrone those 3 faces from politics that we have been hearing/seeing since we were kids.

            "body": "Nepal Electricity Authority needed to buy electricity from India to avoid load shedding during winter. When bids were invited, an Indian government company called PTC offered electricity at 6.74 Indian rupees per unit. Hitendra Dev Shakya was a director at that time. He believed the price could be reduced further and asked the company to lower it. Before any final decision was made, there was a political change. Kulman Ghising returned to power and Hitendra was removed from his position. The very next day, the same Indian company suddenly sent a new proposal at a higher rate of 6.95 rupees per unit. This proposal was not even requested by NEA. NEA quickly signed a contract at this higher price to buy 180 megawatts of electricity. Because of the higher rate and extra charges like leakage and wheeling fees, this deal would have cost Nepal more than 40 crores extra. The deal was also signed without proper approval from the Electricity Regulatory Commission. Kulman Ghising later defended the deal in public. He said the old offer had expired and prices were rising fast. He even claimed that waiting longer would push prices up to 10 rupees per unit. However, data from the Indian market showed that electricity prices were actually falling during that period. Later, the court reinstated Hitendra Dev Shakya. After returning, he questioned why NEA was paying more than the original offer. He stopped the expensive agreement and asked for new bids. As a result, another Indian government company offered electricity at 6.60 rupees per unit in December. This was cheaper than both the earlier offers and directly proved that prices were not rising as claimed. By cancelling the costly deal and pushing for a fair price, Hitendra helped prevent a loss of over 40 crores to the country. Whether corruption was involved or not is for investigators to decide, but the financial difference is clear.  (Translated and Simplified version of Narayan Gaule Post)",

It's called STETH COURSE of entrance dose. Pretty nice and affordable but you need to be disciplined as it's online. 3 ota classes hunxa everyday. Sometimes 4, mock test happens every Saturday. Not too late. They teach everything from basics and you get lectures videos too from app if you miss your class and pdfs too. If you join now you will have to see old lectures since class started about 1 month ago. Not too late to begin you can of course do it if you try.|||I suggest Private lecture liu. Institutes are just scam. One of my friends bought name ko lectures but still found it not enough and private lectures kinnu paryo feri. I dont really know about other institutes but i believe its similar. Jn milan for physics, Milan gahire for biology, chem ko I took rajesh chem, chem chai I beleieve there are better teachers out there, look into it. Estari padhda, Made me secure a bds scholarship seat atleast. Still lectures only guide you.. Better to aim for scholarship so that youll get your desired college paying ma, if not scholarship.|||Hi, i was an cee aspirant too. Entrance dose is the good platform if you really want to start with basics. Also, you still got enough time so u can bring good marks to get into a good college but you need to study consistently. Dont procastinate at all. Give mock tests regularly.",

Just a group of students trying to do something real.  Most tech communities here focus only on coding or only on CS students. But that never felt right to us. In real life, growth doesn’t happen in silos. So CodeYatraNP is for any student — science, commerce, bio, CS, A-levels, +2 — anyone who actually cares about building themselves.  We do things like: learning tech & AI in a very practical way workshops & small events outdoor learning & exposure community projects (including working with kids and under-resourced students) helping students collaborate, not compe  And honestly, that’s what CodeYatraNP is about: giving students the exposure we wish we had earlier. No pressure. No fake motivation posts. No “hustle culture”.   If you want to:  meet people who actually build things work on real-world ideas contribute, learn, or even just observe quietly  You’re welcome.  You can check it out or join here:  Even if you don’t join, I’d love to hear thoughts from others who’ve tried building communities like this. We’re learning as we go.  Thanks for reading 🤍",

He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

Required fields - **vehicle_id** - **trip_id** - **route_id** - **latitude** - **longitude** - **timestamp**  Update rate - Every **10–20 seconds**  ---  **TripUpdates feed (optional)** Used to calculate delays and ETAs.  Optional fields - **trip_id** - **delay** (in seconds) - **stop_id**  ---  **ServiceAlerts (optional)** Used for strikes, diversions, or road closures.  Fields - **route_id** or **stop_id** - **alert text**  ---  **Absolute minimum stack** - Static GTFS with fixed IDs - VehiclePositions real-time feed  **Reality check** - Exact timetables not required - Ticketing systems not required - Stable IDs + live GPS is enough for Google Maps|||its too small, i cant read the words, tried the drive pdf too",

            "body": "It’s 2026 now, and we’re still having to deal with this.  A few days ago, early in the morning, I was on the street and saw a public bus with people literally hanging from the door. It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this. This issue really needs more attention and more noise.|||KTM has enough budget with 40 percent going unused. these transportation comes under metropolitan ko authority. ask Mayor balen.

I realized it was a VIP or a politician's vehicle.  They wanted us to move, but we didn't. Why should we? Why should we give way to them when the pace of the traffic is slow, we didn't have enough space to let them pass.   ​I don't know who was in that car, but I am tired of this.

On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP.

I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have.

Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.

Single man, single constituency Ra executive elections and legislative elections are very different things, to run an organisation of over half a million supporters is a HUGE HUGE task .

He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

Most of the teachers in school and college all of the are pedophiles.|||I'm not aware of the definition - is it like somebody who's grooming girls under 18? Are you using the term loosely?  It's an individual-thing and not a profession-thing. Girls sending DMs to get referred (when they have no skills) is also more common than you think. I get many DMs asking for free help (refactors)/ referrals (barely know them/ barely seen their code) and I just ignore them. I help many people (m/f) on a daily basis, and I've never met most of them. I know many of my 'male' senior friends (no female senior dev friends) do the same.  You should clear your exams first. Last bullet point sounds like a good plan.  Most people here will be happy to review 1-2 projects for free. I'll jump in if it's Python/ Next.js/ ML. Just post your github repo on some relevant community and they'll do free reviews.   Edit: I dont do free mentorships, happy to review repos/ coding practices.|||I get what you r saying but the term pedo applies to people who r way older and trying to groom n trap minors (under 18). The person u r referring r called blackmailers or gooners (in current terms i think)|||In my experience, Girls seem to help girl only when they are on some “female tech organization” and it’s rarely a technical mentorship. They should be helpful without such aids too. I am sorry that you had to deal with these. that’s extremely disgusting.  Still there are bunch of female led tech groups - they have ties with it company - approach them.|||Other side - back in Nepal I used to work for a compant that paid well and had better reputation. A young girl in her early 20s reached out to me for a referall for associate engineer. I hesitated a bit seeing her technical knowledge. She offered sex plus 1 months of her salary if I referred and she got hired. Was a weird encounter. I am still not sure if she qas serious or not. But I immediately got off connection.|||Dark side is on both side ! If male posted this not a single person would have asked i have connection i can refer vanera !! Sorry you had to go through that. Refer bina kehi chaldaina vanera fail banaunu I selected one random cv and happy that he is doing good job.|||Always try to keep personal and professional life separate. Never give you phone, WhatsApp or other social media except LinkedIn and email. Networking is fine but tech skills and problem solving skill is important. Focus on those if you are getting no success in job hunt.|||If you have confidence sit on PSC exam do better.|||you don't add coworkers on your insta unless you're really close. There are numerous reasons. That's the norm, has been for quite a while for me.

If you looking for real help, my suggestion is build your skillset - reach out to small companies based outside Nepal - US based sakey samma have great communication skills both written and speaking and get a job. Dont “network” its pointless|||Well, now I don't feel so bad about not getting any response to begin with. Much better than what you are having to endure.|||I remember when my gf wanted to rent a flat and called the broker ,the broker was very professional at the beginning then slowly he STARTED calling my gf to inform about deals and such later he started  flirting with her ,ya we scolded that guy and he blocked my gf .|||We no friends, no gf, no job, no money type of male are relax in home haha|||i wonder where will nepal place if we made top 10 countries with most  pdfs i see them everywhere these days|||Start better to freelancing market. Try to refactor your code with AI tool. For reference section put if required, I will provide. I have not worked since 10 years here in Nepal.

I left my job after a year because of a toxic culture. I swear, I couldn't find a position (I was even applying for internships) at any tech company in Kathmandu. I thought it wouldn't be that difficult since I have decent projects and a year of experience, but I remain jobless for next three months. It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

You in your need for a job and them in their need for someone.|||Muji haru",

Also, the *cost of vehicles* in Nepal is much higher than in India. Cars that cost ₹7–10 L in India often cost 2–3× more in Nepal (sometimes even higher when taxes + import duties are added), and this is widely reported.  This means:  1. The same car/automobile can cost roughly 2–3 times more in Nepal because of heavy import taxes and logistics costs. 2. Almost everything (especially cars, electronics, imported goods) is more expensive in Nepal, except for some basic categories like food and rent, which are generally cheaper compared to big Indian cities.",

You should go two ways:-  1) Report at police's cyber bureau.  2) Do self investigation. Police is slow, case like yours is matter of everyday for them. So, try following:-  - Is their phone still ringing? If yes try as a new client from new number, new voice (friend) and try to meet before paying. If one guy is ready to meet then you can get them nabbed. - If you have family or friends in any of the banks scammers used, then ask them to find their original name, number, location, if account still has any money (this worked for me, I got number and names)  If you got details you can ask police to help by scaring them or freezing the amount etc. You can try these and come back to me here to proceed.|||cyber bureau ma report garne all details .|||haha movies haina ni bro. reverse hack hanera location track hanera firta linu sounds good in fantasy only . only logical option is to go to police/bank or whatever institutions involved|||Sakyeo no chance ull ever recover ur amount..but register ur case to cyber bureau|||First do register police complaint.

You dont get to decide who is a fool|||You have 4 years of experience but you don't seem to understand that writing formatted code syntax was never the hard part. When you know exactly what to do it's pretty easy to write the code for it. The hardest part of IT is trying to find out what the right questions to ask is so that you have a semblance on what exactly to code. It's trying to understand what the users of your software want. Have AI figure that out for you and then tell me.|||with the increase in AI expect to get shitty codes delivered faster than we have ever seen. Shitty code, more bugs and more opportunities for IT devs. Not every company can afford AI that is going to cost fortune in long run. Mid-level devs would collapse, there would be junior then senior. Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||Skill issue. While i agree to most part, if AI is already suggesting you things you can never think of or think you are not writing / thinking yourself - i dont think you are 4yoe of engineer. Maybe you need to level up your game.   Also, tech is passionate field. The whole reason you are being beaten down by AI already is you are here for money.  Dont get me wrong i have earned fortune from tech but if it was not for my passion, i would have been average guy with average payout in tech too.

Ravi will feel suffocated every single night, unable to do anything within yet another coalition government with Congress and UML. Rise and fall.

He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

Static GTFS (mandatory)** Without this layer, real-time tracking will not work.  **Core IDs** - **stop_id** - **route_id** - **trip_id** - **service_id**  **Required GTFS files** - **agency.txt** - **stops.txt** - **routes.txt** - **trips.txt** - **stop_times.txt** - **calendar.txt**  **Critical rule** - IDs must stay **stable forever** - Real-time data links directly to these IDs  ---  **2. GTFS-Realtime (minimum usable set)**  **VehiclePositions feed (most important)** Used to show moving buses on Google Maps.  Required fields - **vehicle_id** - **trip_id** - **route_id** - **latitude** - **longitude** - **timestamp**  Update rate - Every **10–20 seconds**  ---  **TripUpdates feed (optional)** Used to calculate delays and ETAs.  Optional fields - **trip_id** - **delay** (in seconds) - **stop_id**  ---  **ServiceAlerts (optional)** Used for strikes, diversions, or road closures.  Fields - **route_id** or **stop_id** - **alert text**  ---  **Absolute minimum stack** - Static GTFS with fixed IDs - VehiclePositions real-time feed  **Reality check** - Exact timetables not required - Ticketing systems not required - Stable IDs + live GPS is enough for Google Maps|||its too small, i cant read the words, tried the drive pdf too",

I realized that whenever I spoke Hindi around some Indians, they treated me differently. One employer even started talking to me like I was some “inferior Indian” they could insult anytime. That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.  Growing up in Nepal, almost all TV channels were in Hindi. Indian serials and movies basically forced Hindi onto us. Now I’m choosing to learn Newari and other Nepali ethnic languages instead. I want to promote my own culture, not get mistaken as part of another country.  I don’t want foreigners thinking Nepal = India just because we speak Hindi in movies or daily life. We have our own languages, our own culture, our own identity.  Speaking English abroad and promoting our own languages at home feels like the right direction",

Since hindi is not your identity, you have a disadvantage. They look down on you if you speak their language with them. That’s literally saying: you are my master, i will follow you.   You will only be a sidekick on someone else’s story.   You have more control and power over your own language. You can say anything in Nepali and no one can correct you cus you are the native speaker. You are fluent and can express yourself better. That gives you the leverage to take a stand for yourself.

But i am glad you realised your mistake.|||Agree completely. I never entertain anyone who assumes I speak Hindi and doesn't see a difference between our cultures and languages.

To tell someone to stop speaking that language isn't going to fix the issue. You should be confident and talk to the people who make you feel this way that Hindi is not your native language and you can only converse in a limited way. Any person who insults you by considering you \"inferior\" is stupid and arrogant. You have to call them out on it.   Since you are in Canada, there are many people who speak French. And French is the 6th most spoken language in the world. If you can learn it and speak, that'd give you a boost in talking to more people. It doesn't always have to be English.   Language is just a medium to communicate. It doesn't belong to any particular nation or a group of people. Don't be afraid to speak out your thoughts.   In Nepal, if you can't speak English well, the people consider you illiterate. It doesn't matter how good you can speak Nepali or a native language.  It's the behaviour and expectations of people in language that's judged.|||Bruh you need job application|||I dont think hindi is the problem here,instead that emploer.|||We should tell that to Nepali wanna be Bollywood’s artists also.|||This but speaking in hindi for indian tourist, why do we do that?|||It always depends on personal experience.

No need to hide the hate behind the words like 'our own identity's or ' our culture' or anything else.

Whereas many local languages are marginalised.|||Whenever I’ve switched from English and then spoken to someone in Hindi, I’ve felt a commonness and even respect. Being tri-lingual is a skill, not a downgrade.   I go to small family owned grocery store, I greet them in Hindi and they say namastey, and my usual the liquor store guy asks me how I’ve been doing and gives me discount.   Language was invented by humans to make connections. Rather than saying dont speak a particular language, maybe saying something about how to develop relationships would have been better.|||This post and the comments just reek of inferiority complex.|||Learning any language is good not speaking them in front of them is your choice.  If you don't want to speak in Hindi, that's fine, although Hindi and Nepali words are so much similar just the structure of sentences is what makes the difference between them(These similarities  made me understand the language more , listen to the song and even sing them as if I were an native speaker) .   If you show some love to the language outside of the valley will be even more meaningful as most of the language spoken out of the Valley is at a decreasing rate.  It will help save the culture and language, I would like you to focus on that.  Hey, just to be cleared I'm not trying to force you here. It's your choice at the end.|||I speak Hindi to my Nepali family for fun. but with exaggeration|||After reading all the comments I got to know that nepalis hate indians to the core just one bad instinct is enough to rage them against indian.

            "body": "It’s 2026 now, and we’re still having to deal with this.  A few days ago, early in the morning, I was on the street and saw a public bus with people literally hanging from the door. It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this. This issue really needs more attention and more noise.|||KTM has enough budget with 40 percent going unused. these transportation comes under metropolitan ko authority. ask Mayor balen.

At the moment, i would suggest you to keep doing your jobs and garnering your skills so you land up one job with a handsome pay. Good luck.|||dude you're just like me, but 10 years ago. i've been exactly where you are and it sucks ass. i had to maintain multiple jobs because none would pay on time, and i had to support my parents and two siblings. so when i say i know what you're going through, i mean it. and as much i appreciate people being nice here, no one (except for one) is trying to help you navigate this shituation.  the one thing that you need more of isn't money or opportunities, its time. **you need more time**. more time for proper sleep, more time to gather your thoughts, more time to pause and evaluate your current situation, more time to plan out the next few months. you're like a engine that's constantly running 24/7, and you haven't had the chance to rest for a single moment, and it sucks soooo much because as much as you want to stop, you just can't. its all on you, everything depends on you, and you have to keep moving, or else everything will fall apart. and this will only end one way, and its not good dude.  thats why you have to take your time back. you need at least 2 more hours of sleep (sleeping an hour early and waking up 30 minutes late). at least 1 hour of free time to plan your next steps. you weekends need to be for yourself, and yourself alone. whatever precious time you have, you keep it and don't let anyone or anything take it from you.   if you have college every morning, talk with the administration and ask them to let you check-in an hour late - explain your situation, tell them that you have no other option; this worked for me, and will work for you.  if you have small spare time where its not too long to start working but not too short to just sit around (like 25-40 minutes of downtime), just get to the next task/next job. baru duita day shifts ko bich ma kei downtime hunai nadeu. inform your office you'll arrive early and leave early. explain that you have a tight schedule and you don't want to waste your time. companies will try to make up some nonsense about proper timing and all that bullshit but don't let them bully you to submission. ask them to understand your situation, and make up shit like you also study and go to college everyday and do your assignments daily because you're a weak student, and normally don't get enough sleep because of that, so instead of just wasting time after college, you just come to work early - you know, make it sappy if that helps. but whatever you say, make sure that they let you leave early. take back your time.  if this helps you gather even 1-2 hours extra everyday, thats the time you can invest on yourself now. if you can get home by 5pm instead of 6:30pm, thats around 3 hours before your night shift starts. you can use that time to either plan your next move. work on your portfolio. add things to your showreels that you wish you could but weren't allowed to. talk with your parents about what you're going through and ask them to help you with planning for the future. like the other user said, actually start tracking all your expenses and see where all your money is going. excel is free in the browser, and you can search for \"excel free budget templates\". categorize all your expenses and see where the money is being wasted. do you smoke regularly? are your lunches expensive? is your electricity bill too high? not a single rupee goes untracked. you need every penny to be accounted for. if there's an unnecessary expense, cut it out completely. the more you can save, the easier it will be for you.  you can also request your night shift company to let you start early, and end early. sounds like it's a remote job, so your reasoning could be that you're already free by 6pm, and instead of waiting around, you'd like to start early when you're still feeling energized and not drained of energy by 3 in the morning. you can give your work report by 12 midnight and go to sleep 30 minutes early, even.  if you travel by bus or micros, take that time to complete errands that can be done via your phone. create a checklist for what you need to do before you can apply for better jobs. look for potential companies that have a good company culture (normally has better pay too). connect with past colleagues online just to say hi (this one might feel weird at first but its better to say hi how are you rather than hi do you have a job in your company). update your expense tracking sheet. look for templates and plugins that can help your portfolio be better than the rest.  spend every single free minute to get yourself on a better situation.  you're drowning every hour every day, but you're taking the first step towards pulling yourself out. it's going to be difficult the next few months and you may feel more drained than ever, but if you do all these for yourself, you'll be in a much better mental state in the next couple of months. here's to hoping that you update us in a few months that you got a job that pays as much as all three jobs combined 🤞  all the best. do yourself proud.|||On person told me, rather focusing making money from 2-3 small jobs.

Everything will be same but you will be different  Try meditating, clearing your mind. Once you have a clear mind you can think.  The more you panic, the more it gets worse. Thinking about the future and trying to make life better is good but when you over think the same thing over and over, that thought is what making you demotivated not the situation. If you can’t change the situation, don’t over think it.  I know its hard, but don’t loose the hope.  Stay calm, plan and proceed and will be a matter of time you see the changes.  It is a process not an immediate action. At the end its you and I know someone who is handling everything as you said can do lot better in life. Don’t forget, Some people dream to be in your place. Be positive. You got this.|||I hear you can make more with pathao or similar ride services as a rider.|||Keep the hustle going.

If you have any debts, create a small, steady repayment plan so they don’t keep snowballing.      Separate essential and non-essential expenses, even small adjustments can make a difference. And try to save at least a tiny amount each month. Even a symbolic sum gives a bit of control and stability.      Look at how much free time you have outside of work and try to set aside a small, consistent window to learn skills that are in demand. Little steps add up and can help you increase your income over time.      I’ve been in a similar situation myself, and I know how heavy it can feel. But it is possible to climb out of it slowly, with small steady actions. You’re already doing an incredible amount, don’t be too hard on yourself.

The Koteshwor traffic jam finally started moving, and I was riding slowly when I noticed three people inside the car infront of me were staring and gesturing aggressively at me and fellow vehicles.  ​Then, the high beams flickered from the car behind me. I realized it was a VIP or a politician's vehicle.  They wanted us to move, but we didn't. Why should we? Why should we give way to them when the pace of the traffic is slow, we didn't have enough space to let them pass.   ​I don't know who was in that car, but I am tired of this. It is disappointing to see someone enjoy \"special facilities\" while ignoring the basic infrastructure the rest of us struggle with every day.

We can advocate for legal reforms to ensure excessive security isn't granted to those without genuine threats or controversies. However, for the sake of national security and peace, such measures remain essential for VVIPs. Whether we like them or not, an attack on a high profile figure can disrupt our national peace and damage our international reputation for years to come.  ​We can never be certain who might be planning an attack on a VVIP or for what purpose. These individuals hold their status for a reason, and they will have followers regardless of whether we perceive their character as good or bad. There will always be those who fight for their \"masters\" or those who have something to gain from these VVIPs, for them, personal interests and loyalty will always take priority over the country’s wellbeing. If an attack occurs, our country’s stability can derail overnight and Western media and racists in west love to make fun of \"third world countries\" to feel superior regardless of fact that they have been through worse.

On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP.

While BP simply believed that Nepali people irrespective of their education, culture, caste, religion, sex or whatsoever are capable to choose their leaders themselves and make them responsible.|||Good writer.

Seeing it firsthand creates empathy, respect, and a deeper appreciation for what women endure to bring a life into this world.

            "body": "As it says, I recently got this and was hoping for some help, especially on the markings. There isn’t a ton of info on these in English so I figured I’d do to the source. My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6. This is probably the longest shot of them all, but any ideas what species of critter might have eaten up the stock at one point?

Key Manufacturing Factories  The Ranas established several sites for arms and ammunition production, primarily centered in the Kathmandu Valley and some regional hubs:   Nakkhu (Lalitpur): Notable for producing copies of the Martini-Henry rifle, specifically the \"De-Rifle\" in the late 1880s.  Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.  Jangi Megjin: Originally founded in 1793, it continued to function during the Rana period as a government foundry for manufacturing cannons and military equipment.|||You need someone from the Hanuman Dhoka Museum in Kathmandu.

There is a saying if it acts like a duck and quacks like a duck it is a duck. Basically new parties old methods. Bhagbanda ko rajniti, nothing more.  But what I don't understand is why RSP needed to have this agreement? RSP is capable of getting good election result and Rabi is well loved by people so he is as strong a candidate for PM as Balen. I smell something fishy! Balen basically built the current government with his man as Home Minister. There is a good chance Rabi was given a way out of prision for agreeing to this bullshit arrangement.

With that said, you have to be careful where you rent. You can get ripped off pretty easy and there is a wild difference in price for rental apartments depending on your location and standards. This is the same for food. etc. You won't need to worry about safety at all in Nepal, it's much safer than anywhere in the west, but you will have to be careful about everyone seeing you as a walking wallet which can be tough but you learn pretty fast. In my opinion the quality of life far exceeds the life in the west, but the learning curve for everything is VERY steep!  I would very seriously suggest just spending a month or two there first to see if it's for you, life in Nepal is 100% opposite from the western world in every way, so it's definitely not for everyone.|||2000 euros will give you a good upper middle-class life.

Social life: People are very approachable if you are a foreigner. You will easily meet fellow europeans, americans etc too who work in international organisations.

Esto kaam ekdum kam huncha hamro desh ma|||Kudos to subham vai.

He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

I left my job after a year because of a toxic culture. I swear, I couldn't find a position (I was even applying for internships) at any tech company in Kathmandu. I thought it wouldn't be that difficult since I have decent projects and a year of experience, but I remain jobless for next three months. It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit.

            "body": "I’ve been holding this inside for a long time, and I just want to let it out.  I wasn’t a “smart kid” in school. I never understood things as fast as my friends did. I struggled even to read a paragraph and find the right answer, even in class 10. I used to feel dumb every single day. Some of my friends got things so quickly, but I didn’t. I still feel cringe thinking about it.  I also had tics. I don’t know if it was Tourette’s or something else, because I never checked. When I get excited or angry, my eyes blink hard and my back twists. It was embarrassing, and it distracted me so much in school. I used to wish I could just be “normal.”  But after my S.E.E., something changed. That 3-month break gave me a new life. I had my “aha” moment. Somehow, I finally started understanding things. Maybe it was the silence, maybe it was being away from all the noise, maybe it was just loneliness giving me space to think. But everything shifted.  I taught myself how to code. I got a job as a software developer. I didn’t finish my degree because my college wouldn’t let me work while studying, so I said “forget it” and focused on work. It was well paid, and nobody asked for a degree anyway. So yeah, I’m a dropout who made it this far.  I’m still not “super smart,” but I’m definitely smarter than the version of me back then. I still have tics, they still distract me sometimes, but I’m living with it.  I just needed to get this off my chest. I’ve kept it inside for too long.  **And to anyone reading this who feels like they’re slow, or not smart, or different:**   I hope you find your moment too. I hope you realize that you’re not broken. Sometimes loneliness or silence gives you a new life. You grow in ways you don’t even notice at first. You don’t have to be a genius to make it. You just have to keep going. If I can do it, anyone can.  Stay strong. You’ll get your moment too.      ***Note: Yes, I did use ChatGPT to improve this text, mainly to fix grammar mistakes. I hope that’s alright.***",

The same car/automobile can cost roughly 2–3 times more in Nepal because of heavy import taxes and logistics costs. 2.

We normally don’t jump into public threads, but after reading this post and the comments, we felt it was important to share our side honestly and respectfully.  First, we want to say this clearly: we’re not here to fight anyone or deny their feelings. If someone feels disappointed, that matters. At the same time, one side of the story doesn’t always show the full picture.  1. Not all students are the same Every batch has students with very different abilities, discipline levels, and learning speeds. Some push themselves hard and grow fast. Some struggle, skip practice, or expect results without consistent effort. That difference affects outcomes, and it’s something no institute can fully control.  2. Many students come from very weak foundations A lot of students who join us come from backgrounds where code is still taught by writing it on the board, not by actually building things. No real tools, no projects, no industry exposure. They don’t come job-ready. They come to become job-ready. And despite these gaps, we genuinely try our best to upgrade them, change how they think about learning, and push them toward practical skills. On top of that, we take responsibility by providing guaranteed internship opportunities so they at least get real-world exposure.  3. Internships are where most people get stuck in Nepal The harsh truth is this: a huge number of IT graduates in Nepal never get an internship at all. Without that first step, they never discover what they’re capable of. Many eventually give up, leave the field, or leave the country believing Nepal has no scope. We may not be perfect, but if we can at least help someone start, that matters to us.  4. We are transparent from day one Before anyone joins Mindrisers, we explain things clearly, how the course works, what’s expected from the student, how internships are handled, everything. We use written agreements so there’s no confusion later. If, despite that, posts like this come up, all we can do is stay honest and let time speak. We truly believe karma catches up to both good and bad intentions.  We’re still learning. We’re still improving. And we’re open to real feedback. But please understand, we’re not here to scam, exploit, or sell fake dreams. We’re trying to do something meaningful in a system that already has many problems.  Thanks to everyone who took time to read this. Team Mindrisers",

His books have changed the entire learning journey of school level mathematics in Nepal. That even for decades. His name used to be in every student's tongue. I am no genius in mathematics but I use it in my daily work (ML stuff) and if I have to give some credits for my skills in applying math, I can give his name. And you know what was it like back then when he started writing first book? There was literally no internet, he collected past question papers and had from like 2065. And he even categorized questions, contents based on level like basic, intermediate, advanced and so on. And he even used to add the most prominent mathematician in each chapter. That I even consider a some form of research. Not every research has to wear a PhD hat. So for me, I consider his contributions in mathematics to be highest in Nepal.   But I do not know what goes inside his head and now his fourth masters? This I find weird. May be he should have done PhD and finally become a correct Dr.?|||Stop the hate.

Why is it that other communities are literally filled with intellectual posts but here, we have people like you berating the work of others. You're getting downvoted for a reason. That's the general consensus.  \"What has he done to contribute for mathematics?\" His books are influential. He's an educator not a researcher. Probably a faculty at KU or some place.   That makes me curious. Are you \\*sponsoring\\* him to do research? \\*Why\\* does \\*he\\* have to contribute? Are you trying to prove he's inferior to you somehow? What's the bloody point.  Yashavant Kanetkar is a common name - his books are barely technical. But you'll find many many people who started out with his books. You can hate all you want; doesn't change a thing.  People pursue multiple degrees for many reasons. I plan on getting several. PhD isn't interesting to everybody. Literally anybody can publish papers. I've seen folks in PhD programs who've made me question the bar in Science.  If you think about it, you can do more contribution as an entrepreneur. Or by relocating to a remote village and educating kids. There's a book called 80000 hours that breaks this down. I'm sure it's free shipping. Look into it.  I care more about earning than the number of papers I publish. Or having a PhD to my name. I care more about what makes me happy. The last thing on my mind is what you'd think of it.

So, try following:-  - Is their phone still ringing? If yes try as a new client from new number, new voice (friend) and try to meet before paying. If one guy is ready to meet then you can get them nabbed. - If you have family or friends in any of the banks scammers used, then ask them to find their original name, number, location, if account still has any money (this worked for me, I got number and names)  If you got details you can ask police to help by scaring them or freezing the amount etc. You can try these and come back to me here to proceed.|||cyber bureau ma report garne all details .|||haha movies haina ni bro. reverse hack hanera location track hanera firta linu sounds good in fantasy only . only logical option is to go to police/bank or whatever institutions involved|||Sakyeo no chance ull ever recover ur amount..but register ur case to cyber bureau|||First do register police complaint.

But when it comes to GTM, growth, marketing, or just figuring out how to actually sell and scale a product… there’s a huge gap.  Most startups here are run by tech engineers, and naturally, the focus is on building the product perfectly. That’s great, but then things like growth strategy, customer acquisition, positioning, and distribution get ignored. People just assume if you build it, users will come. Spoiler: they don’t.  Most of the startups here in Nepal fail less because the product is bad, but instead because the distribution/game-plan is weak.   Here in Nepal, GTM skills aren’t really taught, nor are they considered “cool” compared to coding. Most people in IT industrychase programming jobs, freelancing gigs, or outsourcing contracts because that’s a safer bet financially.  I think this is actually a huge opportunity. Someone who can master GTM skis here like: user research, acquisition channels, funnel optimization, sales psychology could easily dominate the startup scene.   Instead of just learning yet another JS framework, you should also learn GTM skills.   What do you guys think?",

When you know exactly what to do it's pretty easy to write the code for it. The hardest part of IT is trying to find out what the right questions to ask is so that you have a semblance on what exactly to code. It's trying to understand what the users of your software want. Have AI figure that out for you and then tell me.|||with the increase in AI expect to get shitty codes delivered faster than we have ever seen. Shitty code, more bugs and more opportunities for IT devs. Not every company can afford AI that is going to cost fortune in long run. Mid-level devs would collapse, there would be junior then senior. Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||Skill issue. While i agree to most part, if AI is already suggesting you things you can never think of or think you are not writing / thinking yourself - i dont think you are 4yoe of engineer. Maybe you need to level up your game.   Also, tech is passionate field. The whole reason you are being beaten down by AI already is you are here for money.

I will add if I remember any others later.  \\- Lightweight Inventory, CRM, ROI, Campaign, Finance tracking setup using google sheets/app scripts for my non-tech side hustle which can be used easily in real-time by multiple users. It features algorithm to suggest product prices, auto sorting, stock filters, auto sum and so on.  \\- PS5, Ubuntu, Android, Windows, IMDB data one tap cumulative sync/backup to a external drive using freefilesync and other tools which I run every 3 months. Retains changed files into seperate Versioned folder upto 3 years.  \\- Phone pictures one tap sync with deletions to google drive which then can directly mounted to windows/ubuntu as a drive and used for any uploads straight away.  \\- Acer laptop had kernel level issue on ubuntu with earphones input/output so reported it in launchpad and helped the devs to test out potential fix for months using custom kernels. At last a real fix was found and now it's launched as part of recent kernel update. Real proud of this one.  \\- Not sure this counts but I block every useless repetitive notifications for all apps on my phone unless it's a direct message. With this I get notifications only if someone wants to reach me directly. This helps with digital minimalism and to focus when needed.

Look at Indonesia it follows Sufism mixed with agakhani sect do we hear minorities being treated badly? No. Mostly it's the south Asian Muslims who are radical because they follow a very strict islam of deubandi and wahabism school of thought which has caused problem historically it's moderate example would be creation of Taliban and extreme example is creation of Pakztan. Now contrary to that you've Indonesia which is also a majority Muslim nation but follows Sufism school of thought which is why they are much more liberal. They're okay with currency having Ganesha, okay with garuda being national symbol(coat of arms), and even okay with naming kids from Sanskrit derived names like majority of their head of the states have Sanskrit origin names there will be some ups and downs in writing because Indonesia didn't follow devanagari it followed the Brahmi script earlier, in that way it's still preserving the culture. But if you tell this to a MUSLIM.from south Asia he will say it's shirk/haram in islam and that being associated with polytheism is bad and that they are a lost tribe of Turks and Arabs who had invaded our land. So, wahabism and Deubandi unless remained will not allow for inclusivity among the people islam factor will be there no matter what|||Can't decide which is the worst religion - Islam or Hinduism.

I agree.|||First thing I do is I ask them if they can speak English. It will hurt their little ego and they’ll switch immediately.|||You do you and I'll do me, I guess.    I spoke Hindi with a bunch of Bangladeshi tourists, because I don't understand Bangla, they don't understand Nepali, and they were more comfortable with Hindi than English.    I spoke Hindi with some Indian tourists because they were more comfortable with it than with English.    I continued to speak in English with an Indian visiting Nepal when I and a friend were interacting with him. The thing was, he switched code. I understood him and could have communicated well in Hindi with him, but my friend doesn't really understand Hindi, so I had to keep it in a language everyone understood, and I just told him I am not very good in Hindi.    I would happily speak Nepali in places like Darjeeling, where they speak Nepali, because I am most comfortable in it, and I know most people there would be more than comfortable in that. I assume that it is a comfort thing for them as well.  They're just more comfortable with Hindi than English, and I am accommodating, and fluent enough in Hindi, to extend the courtesy of speaking in their language.    I have come across Indians who look down on Nepal and Nepalis, and unfortunately, that attitude is more common among Indians than it should've been. It is not a pleasant experience, I admit. But, I refrain from putting all of them in a single box. I've met some wonderful Indians as well.   What I have to say is, we are individuals first, I, you, and anyone else, regardless of our nationality, or the languages we speak. Treat each individual on their merit, not their national identity. In fact, the shittiest person I've ever met is a fellow Nepali, and for obvious reasons—I live in Nepal.   The people who treated you bad were shitty people. The same attitude could very well be found in an Englishman, a Frenchman, or even a Nepali. That doesn't mean every Nepali, or Englishman, or Frenchman, is like that.    We are individuals first, in our lived experiences, not just a nationality, and in essence, expressions of existence, far greater than just a nationality. Treat people for who they are in that moment, not a label attached to them.    This is exactly the kind of subtle hate and/or prejudice I am against, whether it is based on lived experiences or influenced by rhetoric.   Use all the languages you know, as much as possible, I say. It is much better to open one's horizons than be insular. And no, I am not just a Nepali. My nationality is just one aspect of who I am, one which is more happenstance than chosen and curated with careful thought. So is yours, if you are actually willing to see it, along with anyone else's. |||I am in Dubai and I speak fluent hindi except for friends if someone asks I just say I understand but can’t speak.

Vanxan, hami haru Indian ko vasa sikxau, gore le ni Indian vanxa, I'll start to learn newari. Thanks OP.|||Language is a powerful tool. I’m here in the US and I speak Spanish with folks who speak Spanish and obviously when there is a language barrier people will banter by saying things that can feel personal. Even greetings come down to culture like cunado (sala) in Nepali.  Most of our generation I am 27 years old watches anime Korean series and picks up words the same way we grew up with Hindi serials. It’s not about speaking Hindi being inappropriate but about the mindset and stigma attached to it. While speaking Japanese Spanish Korean Chinese or French gives you brownie points Hindi often doesn’t and that’s a failure in how Indian people and Hindi have been framed.  I relate to your concern and I have seen firsthand what you’re saying where it can make someone feel inferior and I believe that comes from perception not the language itself.  I say use language in your favor when you can. Draw your boundaries when needed and if something feels insulting say it clearly in English and they usually won’t repeat it. This applies to all languages.  Cheers!|||100%, i live in Canada and I have faced these situations too much. I don’t speak hindi anymore. These people see me brown and come up to me speaking hindi.

You can speak Hindi and still set boundaries if they treat you like shit. I don't see why speaking any other language will make you inferior. I did my Bachelors in India and never had a problem putting people in their places in their own language. I think uneducated illiterate and entitled people are everywhere including India and Nepal, I have had similar experiences with different ethnic communities within Nepal. I actually have problems speaking to Nepali people in Australia as they'll cross every boundary and think I'm liable for them just because we're from the same country.. Its a regional issue.  I watched a interview of Sonam Wangchuk in Nepal and he speaks Nepali throughout the interview. I think as reasonable people we should use whatever language we want depending on the circumstances. Having Hindi in our language arsenal is honestly a superpower as we get access to soo much resources and forms of art that otherwise we wouldn't have been exposed to and as someone from Nepal where we already have a lack of such resources, I'd be sad if I hadn't known Hindi.  So, maybe lets practice putting people in their places if they behave rudely to us and not blame the language. I have many friends from India who I am very close with and many that I had to tell them to show their entitlement elsewhere. It can be the same with English very soon with sentiments of immigration shifting alot and will be with Nepali within Nepal as well.

They are too busy with their own lives and the immediate world around them to specifically think anything about Nepal. India is a country of 1.3 billion people. And even in India, many people don't speak Hindi. Yeah, many in older generation are more racist, but they are racist to each other too. Many people fight over language in different Indian states, and discriminate with people of different states. But as I said, there are 1.3 billion people and a large majority will be as friendly to Nepali people. No, they don't think of Nepal as their little bro, but if asked, would actually hold some affinity towards Nepal in comparison to what they think of other nations.  Feel free to learn Hindi, feel free to forget, it's every one's personal choice. I honestly almost never need to learn it, but I like Nepali songs so much that I'm picking up on Nepali words now. (Kasari Bhanu, Bardali, Sarangi, Timi ra ma are among my favourite)  Lastly, this sub is quite Anti Indian, just saying,  generalizing India and Indians is ridiculous as the population is much more than most people can think of. And bad will always be highlighted more than good.|||It's not just Nepalis. North Indians act like this towards south Indians too.

I openly say that I understand it but don’t speak it, and I’ve never been treated like garbage because of that. I’m guessing you’re a man, because Nepalese men constantly put themselves in an inferior position, always with the “bhai, bhai” nonsense. That alone tells people how to treat you. I’m a 22-year-old woman in Canada, and there are two other Nepalese girls where I work. We carry ourselves with confidence. Our Indian manager can’t talk down to us, and neither can any coworker. But the Nepalese guys? They’re always talked down to like kids. They’re 27 and 28 years old and still get called “sala Nepali.” That never happens to us and it’s not a coincidence. We have more filipino co workers than Indians but they always hangout with Indians and say sh like , “ chalo bhai daru pitey hai aj “ in worse hindi accent possible.  This has nothing to do with language. It’s about presence. It’s about how you carry yourself. When you look unsure, dress badly, and act small, people treat you that way.

I'm unable to understand...saw three post of similar kind..we indians treat or consider Nepalis as our brothers..what has happened to Nepal...we don't have any issues rather connected through religion, culture and tourism too... it's perfectly fine to save ur indigenous culture and languages but there should be no hate ...|||I agree. As a Bangladeshi growing up i also learned hindi. After coming aboard I realised whenever i spoke hindi with Indian they started behaving differently. Then I completely stopped talking in hindi and still continue to do so. I only speak hindi to my close Indian friend and no one else.   Also from my experiences I don’t consider people from punjab indian. They’re very different and welcoming people. I love them. Also i have friends from south india and they literally hate hindi or never tells they’re from india.

And Have deicided to tell everyone that I can understand Hindi(little little) but I don't know how to speak because of much grammatical and syntax differences between my mother tongue and hindi. So, Indians in my class talk in hindi and think I don't know but in reality I know but am hiding the stuff|||India supported Nepal a lot and now these Nepali trying to think they are better than us wow.India should stop free aids immediately.No need to throw food at dog that bite it's own feeding hands|||What kind of delusion are some Nepalese living in?

It had been a month since she's been taking home tuition from this one teacher. He comes to her house and teaches her. Usko chai aahiley renovation chali rako cha ghar ma so me being the nice bf that I am, told her she could come over to my house and ask the teacher to come there to teach. I would be all day in my classes as well so disturb ni hunthena(she has morning classes I have day classes)  So for few hours a day, she was getting tuition from the teacher in my room. Or so I thought. Ekdin chai mero classes haru chito sakkiyo and I went home about an hour early. Room jada it was locked from the inside so I thought bahira bata noise aayera room lock gareko hola bhanera. Tei ni I got curious and went around the window to see what was going on.  My gf was on her my bed with her teacher cuddling inside the blankets and what not like wtfff bhaira ma ta. I couldn't believe my eyes I thought I was having a nightmare. I got really furious, told her to open the door and we had a huge fight I was really heartbroken. Riss ma aayera I threw the damn blankets, comforter, duvet, even the rug. Ghar bata sabai faldiye and told them to leave.  So can you guys please tell me where can I get some good rugs and comforters in Nepal? Its winter and I cant sleep without the blankets yk. Especially Im looking for a warm fluffy white/creamy type of rug tyo fur wala. Online shops testo kei cause im not from valley. Help guyss!!",

You are the biggest fucking cuck Nepal has ever produced, bar none.  You literally heard “ghar renovate bhairacha” and your smooth brain went: “Aww baby, aaile mero room ma aaija na, teacher lai ni bolau, ma ta class ma hunchu, disturb pani hudaina.” Bro you didn’t just hand over your room, you handed over your entire bed for their afternoon fuck-session like a 5-star hotel receptionist. You set the mood, locked the door from outside and paid the electricity bill while that randi was getting railed on your own pillow.  You’re not a “nice boyfriend”, you’re a walking doormat with Wi-Fi. The moment she said “home tuition” alarm bells should’ve rung, but no, timi ta “disturb nahos” bhanera uniharulai honeymoon suite diyau. Teacher le timro girlfriend ko “syllabus” cover gardai thiyo ani timi bahira “nice guy” badge polish gardai basyo.  You came home early and still had to play detective like some Bollywood hero, peeking through the window because your own room was locked from inside. Bro even Nepali serials don’t have this level of chutiya plot.  And the cherry on top? You threw the blankets and rugs instead of throwing hands. Blanket jalaunu parne thiyo, timi chai “winter aaucha, kasari sutne” bhanera Daraz ma fluffy white rug khojdai chau. Bro your girlfriend got piped on your bed and your biggest concern is staying warm?? Priority thik cha baba.  You didn’t just get cheated on, you got professionally scammed by a third-class tutor and a third-rate girlfriend. Block her, delete everything burn the mattress and never ever say “disturb nahos” to a girl again.  You’re not heartbroken, you’re brain-dead. Wake the fuck up king, your crown’s on fire and you’re still asking for new rugs. 😂😂😂|||Japa hari ram lai Maya jaal ma nabhula|||Bhina bhina k padhnu parxa go to jamal bajar teha pauxa babbal blankets|||7/10 rage bait.

What is wrong is wrong, I dunno what the procedure for BSF to enter each other countries is, with the open border and all, but I'm sure they are only able to enter after some permission from each other's authorities. If that is not the case here, then it's wrong and us Indians should accept that. 3. Nepal is a beautiful country. People have more civic sense and overall better sense of community and cohesion from what I have seen.  4. What Nepali people have to understand is India is a big country 1.4 billion people is a lot. So, of all the counties in the world, India is probably the only one you should never generalize. 6. Both Nepali and Indian people can have good relationship with each other, just learn to talk properly and not take things to ego. 6. Yes, India is a bigger economy, and has more resources, but it is not in competition with Nepal. Nepal has it's own strengths that it should not forget.  7. Open border has it's pros and cons. Yes, many Nepali are in India, do they get to build a life, yes. Do they get discriminated, yes, and so are Indians from other states. And Nepali also discriminate against Indian tourists and workers. 8. Always remember, most average Indians will probably only have good will towards Nepal and no hate.  9. It is very important that rather than spreading unnecessary generalized hate, we judge people on individual basis.

            "body": "Namaste everyone,  I want to share an incident that happened to me in the last two weeks here in Germany.  My name is … Khadka, and I’ve been doing an Ausbildung at a Hofladen for the past 7 months. My chef treats me really well, like family.  Last week, I was at an Indian roadside café with my sister and some German friends, waiting for my chef to pick me up before visiting the Weihnachtsmarkt. We were waiting , suddenly two indian boys came to us and we had a short conversation . They were annoying so we started ignoring but they soon started making disrespectful comments like calling me MOMO and then mocking Nepal, our size, economy, and poverty. I didn’t respond with racism, though the conversation got heated.  Coincidentally, my chef was nearby, noticed something was wrong, and later asked if I was okay. I explained everything to him. He took it seriously and suggested legal action.  With the help of my chef’s lawyer, a legal letter was sent demanding an apology and €270 from the men. After a few days, they agreed to pay the money and apologized so the case would not go further.  Fun Fact : I and my sister literally eat MOMO after getting that 270 euro 😭😆  So reason of writing this post was just to sharing the possibility of what wrong can happened and how to handle this things.  Edit : For OC (https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204052999996390/permalink/2475725379495816/?mibextid=rS40aB7S9Ucbxw6v)",

Congress and UML will form a coalition government with RSP, telling Ravi that failing to do so could mean the death of “democracy” in Nepal and urging him to put aside his ego for the greater good. Ravi will feel suffocated every single night, unable to do anything within yet another coalition government with Congress and UML. Rise and fall. There will be chaos and anarchy within one year after the formation of the new government following the election, and the King will take the throne again.|||balen should compete in the area wherever oli will put his name on.

            "heading": "Went to India recently and it was immensely traumatizing",
            "body": "So I (27M) went to India for the first time. I was traveling solo turns out it was a bad idea. It was for work related events. After the event, I decided to explore a few places.   Until the work event, everything was fine. It was great learning and networking in the event. I actually speak Hindi very fluently so communication wasn’t an issue at all. After the event, I wanted to travel and explore.   I had booked a pretty average room for my accommodation. Nothing fancy, just the most budget friendly one I could find. There were a couple of people in the lobby and they greeted me nicely and asked for my ID. I showed them my passport and their faces instantly changed after seeing my Nepali passport. The guy said oh you’re from Nepal. I said yes and the another man said, this doesn’t work, we need to see an Indian ID. They weren’t smiling anymore and were giving me very skeptical looks. I tried not to overthink it. He kept insisting for an Indian ID and I explained to him that I am not from India, it’s my first time here so it’s not possible for me to have an Indian ID. Then they asked me for my contact number and I gave my phone number (didn’t have Indian number). Once again, they kept on asking for an Indian number. I was really surprised seeing their hospitality instantly changed after learning about my identity. Not sure if they did that because I was a foreigner to them or because I was specifically a Nepali guy.   While I was exploring the local market, I went to buy some souvenirs. One shop guy asked me where I was from and I said Nepal. He then started lecturing me saying don’t be close with China. They will do the same to you what Pakistan is doing to us. He kept yapping about how Nepal is a small part of India and that we should be grateful that we have a “bada bhai” like India. I left the shop without saying anything.    I wanted to travel by train but had absolutely zero idea about it. The people weren’t helpful there either. I was asking the various staff in the train station saying I wanna go here where can I find a ticket. They just vaguely pointed go there, it’s over there. Finally one guy at the ticket counter helped me get tickets after nearly couple of hours of running frantically here and there. I told him I’m not from India, traveling by train for the first time. The counter guy gave me a ticket saying this is for general class, it’s not safe to travel there..very crowded and chaotic, after your train arrives, meet the ticket guy and ask him to upgrade to AC compartment. I thanked him and went to the platform. There was a police officer whom I asked about upgrading the ticket. He too said the same thing i.e. meet the ticket guy once your train arrives and he will help you.   I still had about 3-4 hours before my train arrived. I just stayed in the platform watching movie. After the train arrived, I was frantically searching for the ticket guy. One police officer came near me charging with his baton. I was shit scared. He almost charged me saying why are you in the AC compartment with a general ticket in your hand. I was literally shaking at this point and with a shaky voice, I explained him my situation. He said haven’t you been in a train before where are you from. I said I’m from Nepal and he laughed saying oh you guys don’t even have trains there haha. Are you really from Nepal, your eyes don’t look like Nepalese. (I think he was referring to Mongolian eyes). I saw the ticket guy and went to him. He said me go to this seat and I’ll come. Later, he came to me and upgraded my ticket. The journey was a little over an hour long. And I was constantly replaying the entire experience from the hotel to the local market to the train station police guy.    Not sure if I just happened to meet all the wrong people or that everyone is the same there. Either way, I’m not going back to India for a long time. And I haven’t even mentioned the kids constantly following you begging for money, the dirt and litter everywhere, people peeing and even pooping in the open, unnecessary horns, air pollution.

Which cities did you visit, by the way? and as far as I know, many hotels in India especially smaller ones usually avoid foreigners because of paperwork and FRRO/police registration requirements. It’s better to stay at big hotels or resorts while traveling. I personally mostly stay at resorts, especially Club Mahindra ones they’re quite good, with solid service.  Also, try to do everything online in India train bookings, hotels, cabs. That way you’re much less likely to get scammed or harsh treated. Offline train ticket booking is honestly very hectic, even for Indians, so always book train tickets online. Use the official IRCTC website or authorized partners like MakeMyTrip, ConfirmTkt, or Paytm then you won’t face these problems.  And if you remember the time, location, duration, or the office name, you can also register a complaint on the Rail Madad portal or app. Lastly, there’s a huge generation gap in India you’ll mostly hear such racist things from older people or those in the 30–40 age group, but the younger generation is usually nicer and more helpful .You can even see this generation gap while speaking English. If you start speaking English in front of older people, they often treat you like some different person almost a ‘raja sahab’ type. But with the younger generation, it usually doesn’t make much of a difference. Anyway, I hope your journey was safe.|||Mods, how much racial abuse is tolerated here?

You feel lost in those reactions and might even get out of your mind just looking at them. But listen to the tale, the story of how learning really happens. I don't know if you play games like Free Fire, PUBG, Royale, or something else. Ask yourself how you remembered all the gun names, location names, and the different things in them. How you remembered a whole 3-hour-long story you watched years ago? Treat these things the same way. Connect with them. Practice writing out the reaction yourself. Guess how they could pair up and react to give products. In the beginning, you will make mistakes, but slowly you will get used to it. Just know the reaction types: what acid-base rxns do, salts, catalysts, how oxidants and reductants work in any reaction. Try to understand these basics, and then you will not have to blindly learn rxns.|||On youtube watch pw lecture |||Old is gold ma vako haru pada yo sabb padna maile ta sakena yrr thett|||Haina ho sab Chinese letter dekhchu ta|||dont read all just read half the syllabus tara tyo half chai purai aunu paryo ......and u will pass|||Heri raakhnu parxa, kasto ma displacement, kasto ma substitution vanne crack vayesi sajilo hunxa|||I skipped the all organic portion but still got B+|||I didn't.

            "body": "My college head and a friendly botany teacher who has seen thousands of students always says just do enough to pass all subjects. Thats it. Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

The most niche movies/shortfilms that I've watched and probably only a few Nepali people have watched is probably **La Jeteé**, **Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take One** and **Meshes of the Afternoon**.  I'm only trying to name good ones here. These are probably not the most niche Shortfilms and movies out there that I've seen. But all 3 of them are incredible and I'd definitely recommend to everyone. Especially La Jeteé and Meshes of the Afternoon.   Also curious if anyone here has watched **In The Mood For Love** by Wong Kar Wait?|||I have watched the whole Ray filmography and also read his Feluda book, and this would be true even 10 years ago. So yeah you are not alone on this one at least. Edit: btw my answer would be some of the lesser known Vonnegut like Cat's Cradle or something, or maybe Antkind by Kaufman.
