Seeing it firsthand creates empathy, respect, and a deeper appreciation for what women endure to bring a life into this world.

In my opinion, it is mainly because in the context of Nepal, most people choose the teaching profession as a last option to escape unemployment. It is mostly chosen when every other door is closed. I also think it has to do with accessibility too! For example, if you want to be a doctor or engineer, you have to give a \"tough\" entrance exam. The courses are expensive and \"very difficult.\" The level of difficulty and hard work decides how great or cool your career is in most asian countries. Medical is hard, or engineering is hard, which means those subjects deserve respect and prestige. I mean, medicine and engineering are noble careers; they are our life savers; they treat us, they build homes, roads, and infrastructures for us. So, it is natural to command respect. But we, as a collective, also have to understand that every doctor, engineer, scientist, or public service worker is standing in front of us because of teachers and their guidance. I mean all of those successful people became successful based on their own merit or privileges, but they were guided by teachers.  Tara aba situation yesto bhaisakyo ki dherai manche haru le sabai bato bandha bhako dekhera teaching profession maa aaunu huncha, but not everyone in them is passionate about teaching. They are just doing it for the sake of employment. Bhitrai dekhi ichhya bhayera teaching garne kam nai hununcha tei bhayera ni euta bad reputation bandai gako cha about this profession. Euta four-walled room maa 30 dekhi 50 impressionable children lai padhauna, guidance dina immense knowledge, passion, patience, and dedication chahincha. Ajhai higher level maa padhauna ko laagi, you are literally teaching future doctors or engineers, so teachers must be exceptionally gifted and patient. But in most cases, they themselves don't value the profession because they had some other dreams or because society values other, more technical or vast professions.  But I hope our generation and the next generation realise the importance of a guru as an individual and as a society.|||Because everyone thinks teaching is the last option.. \"aru kei vayena vane padauna painxa \" is the general stereotype. Esma reasons are unfair hirings in the past, terrible transfer policies , political interference and salary .. mahina ko 1 lakh plus hunu ho vane sabaile ramro vanthey hola tara yo only earn around 40/50k as a starting teacher even in high school levels , no side incomes no corruption.. aru jobs ma side income hunxa corruption garna painxa teivayera ho|||I think how much society respects you depends on how much money you make.

Along the way, I learned many skills—graphic design, video editing, MERN stack, Flutter, and WordPress, digital marketing—but instead of mastering one thing, I kept jumping between many. I never truly focused on a single path. For a few months, I was active on LinkedIn and applied to more than 50 jobs. I received positive responses, but none of the job timings matched my college schedule. I also tried freelancing platforms like Upwork and Fiverr, but I kept getting banned repeatedly, and I still don’t fully understand why. When I look back, I realize how much effort I actually put into all of this. And now I keep thinking—what if I had put this same level of effort into just one platform or one skill? Maybe by now, I would have achieved something meaningful. That thought makes me regret my past choices.",

Yes, she did leave RSP for her own reasons, which I think were valid. Let’s not get into that again.  I got the sense that she might be joining Kulman Ghising, since she was present at the launch of his party, Ujyalo Nepal. That makes it seem like a real possibility. She has also been teaming up with Sagar Dhakal recently. They even posted a video urging young people to come forward and participate.  I checked the news as well as her social media, and she is quite active right now, especially around discussions related to elections. She has been vocal about election reforms, such as allowing Nepalis living abroad to vote from their host countries and making it easier for people in remote areas to vote. She seems to be actively working on these issues, attending meetings and discussions.  So yes, she is active, but I am curious about how exactly she is preparing for the election and which party she plans to represent.  I also read on Onlinekhabar that Balen, Kulman, and Rabi might officially announce their collaboration today after signing some papers. If that happens, I assume Sumana’s and Sagar’s plans will also become clearer afterward. So let’s see how it goes.",

            "body": "I worked at a company in Nepal for 1 year. My gross salary was NPR 25,000 per month, but every month I received only NPR 20,598 after tax deduction and CIT contribution. So roughly NPR 4,000 was deducted every month → 4,000 × 12 = ~48,000 per year After I left the company, they gave me only NPR 57,000 as my total CIT amount. They said “this is all our accountant calculated” and did not provide any payslips, tax statements, or CIT breakdown. My questions: Is it normal/fair for around NPR 4,000 to be deducted monthly from a 25k salary? How does CIT work in Nepal? How much should be employee contribution? How much should be company contribution? Shouldn’t the company also contribute to CIT separately? Should I receive official payslips or CIT statements? Has anyone faced a similar situation? Am I possibly being underpaid or scammed? I’m confused about the accounting rules and would appreciate advice from anyone familiar with Nepal salary tax & CIT system. Thanks in advance 🙏",

            "body": "Hey everyone,  I’m looking to sell my **MacBook Pro M2 Pro (16GB RAM / 512GB SSD)** and wanted to ask if anyone knows **reliable shops or resellers** that buy MacBooks directly. I bought it around a year ago for 2.5L. Willing to sell for 1.5L with room for negotiation.  Quick transparency about the condition:  * The MacBook has a **weird display flickering issue** * The **entire display has been replaced, but the issue still comes up once in a while** * The new display is **under a 3-month warranty from iRepair Nepal** * The issue is **intermittent and comes and goes** * The device **works perfectly with external displays** and has no issues there * Performance-wise, everything runs smoothly * **The device comes with a 96W Magsafe charger**  The only reason I’m selling is that I’m constantly **on the go, meeting clients**, and the occasional display flicker has become inconvenient for my workflow.  I don't mind selling to either stores or individuals who might use it with an external display, so if you know any stores in Kathmandu or elsewhere that deal in used Macs, please let me know. Personal experiences would be appreciated.  Thanks 🙏",

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NepalSocial) if you have any questions or concerns.*|||2nd is bullshit|||u/Sure_Car_4654 add a flair for ai slop/generated content|||As a regular member of this sub, here are my humble feedback. This is not and isn't supposed to be any sort of personal or accusational message to anyone, just a humble feedback with due consideration to the nature of the subreddit and reddit as whole.  Pahilo, What post stays should be defined.   My suggestion is to discard absolutely low tier low effort post like ig tiktok and reel ss unless they're of unique nature to avoid a boring feed. I mean general question should be allowed like typical address, location, how to file return, my neighbor doesn't pickup his dog poo, I am tired from work, padna manlaunna etc etc you get it. It also includes those My gf/bf doesn't love react my story, gm/gn texts etc etc  too, you get it.  Second is on the topic of serious or sensitive matter like feminism, patriarchy, social problems and all. Post with good enough body text as opinion of the OP should be made mandatory, tyo 1 liner title garne haru kamm kaaj buddhi chaina, feed wahighat matra huncha plus it creates unnecessary & misunderstanding led arguments and debates. It was fun but now it's boring as hell. Okay like make a post calling out whatever you like but avoid to title it horrendously & ultra vaguely and insensitive as to deem you as jackass. This rule will make the discussion fair and not hinder freedom of speech either, freedom of speech doesn't recommend being stupid, insensitive and jackass.  Third is to totally not allowing use of swears in TITLE, do whatever in body text just don't be Hitler. Ani typical swears like sale, gadha, yk, murdar etc other than those of heinous or demeaning nature should be allowed. Like come on these are needed to make funny and snarky comments. A little bit of fun, considering majority of the sub is of goofy, unsrs, causal nature: casual 'off words' should be let it be 😭  Fourth, Strong moderation of Serious and help flair. I see people using it as shitpost alternative. These two flair should be limited to very very serious matter. Unnecessary use will make people less sensitive to these flair, leading to increased ignorance and loss of that feeling i describe as 'alertness factor' like the feeling or alertness you get when you hear a ambulance siren. Punishment too, ipso facto, Immediate 2 day ban.  Fifth, more mods, in a way atleast one is active at all timestamp of the day. Should be of neutral nature for objectivity, or someone that isn't too deep into his position in compass, is capable of gauging both side appropriately, keep the bias (of any kind) aside when in the role or position or to exercise as moderator.  Six, to create a kinda fashion for post, making people used to the rules of sub without being a dickhead like r/nipples, in short consistency.  Seven, for any international or nationwide event, no post other than those that are well written in a manner it's seems the writer actually knows what he/she/rest is speaking, isn't generic repetitive mess like just typing the event title and saying thing like 'that is good/bad' yeahhh this gotta go. Rest of those just rewriting the title without anything strong or aren't well opinionated should be discarded too. No more of the spams. It doesn't have to be accurate or u being a Martin Luther King to get posted. Just put effort in your opinion or thing you want to say. It's much more fun to engage in such post. This will be crucial to construct the subject mention in point six.  While I respect the mods, moderation and the growth this sub saw, We're a quite the big boy sub yet the state of is little disorganized and inconsistent by moderation & feed standards, the above mention QOL changes should be enforced. In coming months or so people and users will adapt. And for the way it is written was intented and to make it little off to ensure it feels little entertaining for regular viewers.

For example, I want to post about a news, but I also want a discussion but the news is related to politics, which flair should I choose? Politics? News? Discussion? I had to try to guess which flair mods would have least problem with and would be less likely to delete my post. This was hard.

He isn’t saying education itself is useless; he’s saying that nothing much will happen if you stay in Nepal even if youi've got degree, and he isn’t exactly wrong. A small minority reach high roles in government or companies through nepotism/family connections, while only a very few manage to get in purely on merit.  Meanwhile, the majority of students in Nepal do their bachelor’s here and almost immediately aim to go abroad for a master’s, a job, or a career because opportunities at home are limited and often low quality. Time and again, it’s been pointed out that the quantity and quality of jobs being created in Nepal don’t meet the needs and aspirations of young people, which pushes most of our daaju/bhai and didi/baini to look for opportunities overseas.  Every year, dehari vanda dehrai Nepalis seek work abroad, and remittances ltierally make up a significant share of Nepal’s GDP now, showing just how dependent the economy has become on foreign employment rather than domestic jobs. Unemployment has also been rising, especially among young people, and many more than capable graduates struggle to find stable, well paid work in Nepal. Even when they do land a role, they get shitty salary and toxic internal work environment.  So when someone says “Nepal ma bachelor padey rw kehi hudaina,” it might sound harsh, but until conditions in the country improve significantly, it’s the truth for majority.|||He is stating truth.

This will silence people who dislike him or are on the fence about him.  - if RSP couldn't manage a negotiation, his image will further degrade among the public for being power hungry and not giving up for the \"greater good of the nation\".  But there's also a problem. They might join hands and contest the election under RSP for immediate benefit, but there's also a threat of Balanization of RSP, it will be the end of the Rabi era in RSP. We might see internal clash within the party down the line.|||Because without Balen and Kulman, rabi has 0 chance of majority. Even with their support it will be difficult. Just becoming largest party means nothing. You have to get 50 percent support in House of Representatives. Also, there are about 10 lakh new voters, most of them young and probably lean towards Balen support. Why should Balen and Kulman willingly agree to become minority in Rabis party? People forget that Balen was the first big alternative independent force. Rabi basically tried to capitalize on Balen’s swotantra ummedwari. I don’t even get the name, how can a party be swotantra? Its basically trying to associate with Balen, Harka, Gopi Hamal who were the real independents|||Currently it seems better to wait for the final negotiation conclusion.   10-10 minutes ma new update garirako cha yo news site + social media ley.

My brain is thick|||Since it's in a remote village, id say the most realistic way to make use of it is through agriculture, but in a more planned and commercial way rather than traditional subsistence farming that is usually carried out.  Because the land size is fairly large, you have room to think beyond just growing crops for household use. You could focus on shit like: cash crrops, organic farmindg, or even a mix of farming and livestock. Things like seasonal vegetables, mustard, lentils, turmeric or ginger can work well, and adding goats, buffalo, or poultry can help bring in more stable income even when crop prices fluctuate.  If the village is quite remote and transport is difficult, it usually makes more sense to grow crops that are low maintenance or can be stored for longer, instead of highly perishable vegetables. Over time, if things go well, you could slowly move towards organic produce or supplying nearby markets and cooperatives.  Overall, for land of that size in a remote area, agriculture is probably the most practical option, especially if you approach it like a small business rather than just farming for survival.  mannn if only cannabis was legal in Nepal, it would’ve been an extremely lucrative opportunity, especially with that much land sitting in a remote village, the climate and conditions are already perfect for it.|||Kata ho bro?|||Plotting garera Bech deu|||Kasto cha?

            "body": "I’m a Grade 12 Science student looking for group tuition centres in Kathmandu, preferably around Gongabu, Samakhushi or Balaju.  I have a hard time focusing at home. From grades 8–10 I took home tuition, but for +2 it’s really expensive, so I want to switch to group tuition at a centre. I’ve also tried online tuition before, but I honestly couldn’t focus well. In a proper class setting, I do much better, so a tuition centre is what I’m looking for.  I’ve looked on Facebook, but all I find are home tutors. I want to know where I can actually look for tuition centres that offer group classes.  Also, for people who have been to such centres before, I wanna ask how much do they usually charge and are the classes held every day or around 2–3 days a week?",

            "body": "My college head and a friendly botany teacher who has seen thousands of students always says just do enough to pass all subjects. Thats it. Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

Whether we like them or not, an attack on a high profile figure can disrupt our national peace and damage our international reputation for years to come.  ​We can never be certain who might be planning an attack on a VVIP or for what purpose. These individuals hold their status for a reason, and they will have followers regardless of whether we perceive their character as good or bad. There will always be those who fight for their \"masters\" or those who have something to gain from these VVIPs, for them, personal interests and loyalty will always take priority over the country’s wellbeing. If an attack occurs, our country’s stability can derail overnight and Western media and racists in west love to make fun of \"third world countries\" to feel superior regardless of fact that they have been through worse.

            "body": "As it says, I recently got this and was hoping for some help, especially on the markings. There isn’t a ton of info on these in English so I figured I’d do to the source. My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6. This is probably the longest shot of them all, but any ideas what species of critter might have eaten up the stock at one point?

During the Rana regime (1846–1951), gun manufacturing in Nepal was driven largely by the innovative efforts of Gehendra Shumsher, the eldest son of Prime Minister Bir Shumsher, who is widely regarded as Nepal's first scientist and modernizer of the military.   Key Manufacturing Factories  The Ranas established several sites for arms and ammunition production, primarily centered in the Kathmandu Valley and some regional hubs:   Nakkhu (Lalitpur): Notable for producing copies of the Martini-Henry rifle, specifically the \"De-Rifle\" in the late 1880s.  Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.  Jangi Megjin: Originally founded in 1793, it continued to function during the Rana period as a government foundry for manufacturing cannons and military equipment.|||You need someone from the Hanuman Dhoka Museum in Kathmandu. They’ll be able to clarify for you. Your next best bet is if you can convince one these redditors (or they do it out of sheer curiosity) and visit the museum to see if they can glean more info about your gun.

But looking at the scenario right now, Balen really holds huge power.  I was just going through the news, and today alone he has been meeting with all kinds of groups. He met Rabi Lamichhane again, he’s in discussions with Kulman Ghising, the Gen Z Group, Baburam Bhattarai, and some people from Congress. He’s been busy all day, even till late evening, I saw updates that he was meeting with Kulman, and he had another meeting scheduled with Rabi that was postponed to tomorrow due to timing issues.  Everyone, be it Rabi or Kulman, seems to understand that Balen must be taken into account. That’s why the main focus has been on him. No alternative force can move forward without Balen at this point.  I originally thought he wouldn’t contest the upcoming election and would instead support someone else, continuing as mayor. But looking at the news now, he has officially announced that he’s entering politics. He has asked everyone to come forward and join him. I also read that Kulman and Balen are on the same page, but talks with Rabi haven’t been finalized. He mentioned that if discussions don’t go smoothly with either Ujjyalo Party of Kulman or RSP of Rabi, he would move forward with his own party, which is already set up.  Man, the amount of power this guy holds right now is insane. We saw it during the protests as well, on the second day, literally the entire country was chanting for Balen to step up and take the prime minister’s seat.

I like Balen dai a lot, but he should remember that he won only 38% (60K Votes) of the votes in the mayor election in Kathmandu while the RSP got around 11% of the NATIONAL vote (11 Lakhs!!!). Currently, the RSP has a wayyyyy bigger mandate to lead the country than Balen or any other alternative force. I hope Kulman dai and Balen dai understand this. I am not going to include Harka dai in this because he seems off the rails.  It's so sad to see alternative parties bickering over who gets power even after the carnage of september 8.

If people could they would give him unchecked power and make him a dictator and tell other people the beauty of democracy.

They would be the first to complain that nothing would change in this country and all are bhedas.|||I don’t doubt the intentions of either Balen or Ravi but I think they including their fans and followers have descended into Olipath just as much.

Having said that, I too am tempted by the idea of the new and the ‘alternatives’ coming together but I find it very hard to believe that this will lead to anything more than an instant gratification for many Nepalis.

This will be the final symbolic victory over the incumbents.|||Alternative patti janey ho bhaney balen first RSP last|||Yes Balen holds huge power right now but is that only the perception or reality?? He's Mayor of KMC which is huge but KMC doesn't represent all of Nepal and it is not easy to run a political party in Nepal like you have to be hyper active and not be insulated. So I wonder if Balen decides to go it alone and join this Desh bikash party and fight election either on his own or at least ally with Kulman,'s party, what will be the result of that??   I think it will help Balen a lot if he joins RSP and becomes their PM candidate like Ghanti at this point is a well known election symbol, Balen can leave party management to Rabi and maybe Kulman (if he joins) and solely focus on winning his constituency and then planning on what he will do once he becomes PM. Alternatively, he can do alliance with RSP whereby he and some of his people will run on lauro election symbol but then RSP won't field candidates in areas where they run. Desh bikash party may get 10 to 15 seats or more and RSP can support Balen there. Of course in this situation Balen also has to manage a party with lots of different people.   So let's see what happens.|||He holds this immense power because he is the only person that has got this gut to change the future of Nepal at this point! And he has shown that he can maintain and enforce change as he did by being a Mayor alone.

Kulman is similar, with a communist mindset - *free electricity after 10 years* and so on. Yes, many privately owned hydropower projects are going to be nationalized under the BOOT model, but free electricity? Really? Why would elites need free electricity? Does no one have the idea of using that money to create a fund for social security like Norway did?  A wave of populism leads nowhere. We saw that with Prachanda’s Maoists, we saw that with Oli, and now we might witness the same fate again.  People in Nepal hate capitalism, people hate FDI, but at the same time they want the country to be like Norway lol. They need to see how Norway utilized its resources, invited FDI to and created a trillion-dollar fund that backs social security. Without creating capital, nothing is possible. There is no one in Nepal doing politics by explaining this reality—not Rabi, not Balen, not Harka. Kulman is literally a communist.  Nepal’s general mindset needs to be reset, and we need a strong political figure to do that. Rabi, Kulman, and Balen *can* do that, I honestly think so. Nepal is a country where if FDI comes in, people start saying \"desh bechyo\". With this communist mindset, the country is not going anywhere, no country ever has, nor will. Even China had to open its markets to progress. Deng Xiaoping took a step forward to reset the mindset; he said, *“To be rich is glorious.”* We need leaders who can make people understand this. In Nepal, if someone becomes rich, they get abused. Politics needs to be grounded in reality. Free schools, cheap housing, free healthcare all sound cool, but Nepal is a country running a current-account deficit.  Even youth don't understand this reality, leave alone the older generation. All we want is free stuffs but have no damn idea where'll that come from. So we need political figures whom society trusts to explain this. Right now, that’s Rabi, Balen, and Kulman.  So yeah, you can be as excited as you want, but economically Nepal isn’t going anywhere with this mindset.  I want RSP balen kulman to come together and win, not because I’m optimistic about them (yet), but because I want the arrogance of the old parties to die. I want them to lose badly.

He said it can be done if we have enough will power. Nepal still need big hydro project to fulfil the demand.

He barely speak against anyone.  He has never single handedly taken credit for the end of loadshedding. A communist mindset won't do that.   He has shown great managerial skill.  He dedicated trunk line for the industries. He cut the expenses. He sold the excess energy to neighbours. Voila, for the first time in history NEA turns profitable. They are investing in many hydro project without the help of foreign aid. How amazing that sound. That 's not the communist mindset.  He has shown great leadership skill. A leader must decide. People are afraid to decide. They do not want to be in bad page. A leading person must do what is necessary. He should not be scared of criticism. A leader is action oriented.  MCC was needed.

And knows how to sort it out.  He knows how beurocracy work.  For Rabi and Balen, it will take time to understand the system. Kulman Ghising came out from that system. Beurocracy can't fool him. He knows the procedure, mindset, the people. He cancelled hundreds of bad contracts.  He himself is working 16/18 hours a day. Kulman Ghising is the best choice.  There are many countries with free health, free school, free housing, free transport etc. Even UK has it. Is UK a communist country.  No, They are socialist.

In a short run, that could work out but it won’t last forever as we all know.   Nepal can only be revived with a clear mindset and a strategic plan to take the responsibility of every consequence that occurs, be accountable, be aware, with honesty, dignity, a mindset reset (THAT’S BIGG, like you mentioned), honesty is a big part, investments, help from our neighboring countries, and with a commitment to build this nation on the ground it was formed.

The reason is simple: the college bus takes a very long route and ends up consuming almost three hours of her day just in travelling. We live in Budhanilkantha, and she studies in Baneshwor, so commuting is already tiring enough. For the next few weeks, I’ll be out of town, and she isn’t comfortable using ride-hailing services like Pathao or inDrive. This made me think—why can’t these platforms introduce a feature where both the rider and the passenger are women? On top of that, the company could waive its commission for female drivers and passengers. Such a step would promote women empowerment, provide an added sense of safety for the women in our families, and also strengthen the company’s CSR initiatives. Taxis are an option, yes, but since we live in Budhanilkantha, using taxis regularly isn’t practical. It’s not really about affordability—I just feel the pricing is often unjustifiably high.  Edit : if you guys have any other alternative please suggest",

Huge gap in supply and demand as there are very very low female riders and it wont rise drastically even if female-only features are introduced.

            "body": "I want to share something that happened today. As we all know, pickpocketing is extremely common on public transportation. If you’re a regular public transport user, chances are you’ve witnessed it at least once. I’ve been using public buses for a long time, so I’ve seen this pattern many times.  Usually, these people come in groups. They act like they’re all friends, sit close to each other, talk loudly, and keep changing seats.  The same thing happened today. I was on a bus (Mayur Yatayat), when a group of four or five guys got on. I don’t know how to explain it exactly, but you could immediately feel that something was off. They sat near each other, kept talking, and kept switching seats, one moment here, the next moment somewhere else. That alone raised red flags.  What made it very clear was what happened near the Tinkune area. A group of passengers, they were from Terai region, got on the bus. As soon as they entered, one of these guys said, “naya manche chadyo, manche chadyo.” Immediately, one of them stood up, and the group moved close to the new passengers as if they were trying to get past them.  One of the passengers then said he felt someone’s hand inside his jacket pocket, trying to take his phone. A confrontation happened. They couldn't speak clear Nepali but you could easily understand them saying that they were pickpocketers. Immediately after that the group got off bus, as if nothing happened, ultei attitude ka sath.  What was even more frustrating was that another passenger (who was at the last seat) came forward and told the driver and conductor that he had seen these same people many times on this same route. According to him, they usually get on at Gausala and get off around Koteshwor. He said the drivers, conductors, and even the police knows about them, but nothing is done.  This is something I’ve been witnessing since I was a kid. These groups often create distractions, sometimes even fake fights, to divert attention. I still remember an incident from around 12/13 years ago when a group acted like they were fighting, and during that moment, a woman shouted that someone tried to pull the ring off her finger.  What made today even more depressing was that The driver as well as the conductor knew about these people. The guys later confronted the conductor asking him questions like: what about safety of passengers? Why do you let them get on despite of knowing who they are? And the conductor just hussed them off.  Even cops knows all this. We only hear about arrests during their Dashain operations, natra barsa bhari matlab gardeina police le pani.  Some might say, “Why didn’t you confront them?” By the time it became clear, they were already leaving. One of them was drunk, they were all huge and kept cursing, were aggressive, were in group. Getting into a physical fight with them isn’t realistic or safe. Yes record chai garna sakinthyo, but tyo bela dimag chalena.  This problem is way too common, and yet nothing changes. So in the end, we have to be responsible for our own safety. Because as the other guy said, groups like these are regular and he can even recognise them at this point.  If you’re a regular public transport user in Kathmandu, please stay alert and be careful.",

After that, my parents would collect the passport once it’s ready and courier it to me in India.  I wanted to ask:  Is third-party collection (parents) allowed after biometrics?  Did anyone here do something similar recently?  Do passport offices usually allow parents to collect with an authorization letter?  Any issues with couriering the passport to India?

I’m already an adult, and starting music seriously at this age feels risky and maybe unrealistic.

I’m not expecting instant success or fame. I just want a life that doesn’t feel empty or forced.

Acknowledge that it is going to be very very very difficult. It will take its toll mentally. You'll have days/weeks/months/years of frustration where it will just be you and the piano. The audiences come later. You and your craft and the process. That is all you'll have to live with for a very long time.   2. People in your lives will constantly question your choice. Your family, your siblings, your friends, your loved ones. Almost everyone will tell that you're not being realistic. This will continue for the rest of your life. Be prepared for that.  3. Think hard what success means to you. Being rich and famous through arts is pretty rare in this country. You'll most likely never make a lot of money, have a rich lifestyle. Are you willing to change the definition of success to 'waking up every day and getting to do what you love'? It is okay if you want a more comfortable life. You'll have to decide.   4. It will take you a long time to get good at your craft. Get a formal training if you can. Once things get to a higher level, you might discover that you don't like it all that much.  5. If you want a more comfortable path to transition, you'll have to work twice as hard. Get a job and train yourself. Build savings and switch.  6. Build a good support system around you because that will be the difference between plunging into depression and staying mentally healthy.  6. Most importantly, have fun. None of this matters if you are not enjoying it, have a great set of friends around to share it with.  This is what I have for now. Cheers!|||23. How much do you watch social media? These things influence you a lot more than you realize. Planting ideas into your head about people living the live without having to give up anything. Yeah right.   I’m 45. Let me tell you. Anything worthwhile in life is going to be tough to get. A good spouse? You gotta put in a lot of work into the relationship. A nice big house? Be prepared to sink 10+ years of your life working your ass off to pay for it. A shiny degree? 2-4 years of your life being absolutely miserable learning all you can about your subject. A good physique? You guessed it. Sweat and tears at the gym for months before you see anything.   Engineering is not easy. Music is not easy. You can do the easy parts of it and feel good about it but mastery of anything is hard. Because it is mastery.  Rethink your decision. Base it on what really matters to you. Because either way you’re gonna have to put a shitload of work in.   Whatever you’re imagining putting into your engineering field imagine going through it again but for your piano. It’s not the easy way. You’ve already spent so much energy and pain into graduating in eng. think very carefully if you wanna go through the exact same thing with music cuz the grass will always look greener on the other side.   My recommendation is to do both. Work and find time for your hobbies. Focus on financial stability. You’re 23. Your choices now will resonate into your later years.|||Bro realistic kura garum hai ta, as you are already aware of the Uniq Poet scenario, he is working in the software fields along with music creations, rapping writing songs and so on.

My uncle just have to do the job nothing else as everything is managed by the company. Every year a month of vacation etc.   Are we missing out good opportunities ? Whereas its tough in the west as you don't even land a white collar job most of the time you have to stick with blue collar jobs even if you graduate or have to work in nursing homes, child cares etc. Would love to see insights from other people who have been working somewhere in gulf countries.",

I’ve been applying for jobs and internships, but I keep facing rejection, mainly because I don’t have experience.

I really want to stay in Nepal and build my career here, but I’m unsure if that’s the right decision given the current job market and my lack of skills. I’m trying to understand whether I should continue searching for opportunities in Nepal or if there are specific entry-level jobs or paths that would make more sense for someone in my position.  I’m not afraid of starting small, learning from scratch, or even taking low-paying roles if they help me gain experience and skills. I just want to move forward instead of feeling stuck.

It is only required to enter to US & it is stamped on the passport which US immigration use to verify that you're a legal alien entering the country. If your visa stamp is expired but your visa status is not expired, you can legally be within the US but you cannot enter US if you travel outside the country. For most of the country, visa stamping needs to be done from their own home country. It can done from US as well but it's a very lengthy process, so most H1B holders prefer stamping in their own country. Yes, Nepalese also need to do this from US Embassy in Kathmandu. The reason why we don't see such thing in Nepal is because 70% of H1B holders are from India and Trump is now cracking down on immigration and making it harder for non-US citizen to live and work.",

So I want to ask:  * Is it **realistically possible** to get an IT job without an IT degree? * Do companies actually hire based on **skills, projects, and portfolio**, or is the degree a hard requirement? * Should I continue pushing into IT and build strong projects, or would it be smarter to **switch to a different career path**?  Feeling a bit lost, but still motivated. Would appreciate real talk from experienced devs.  Any honest advice, personal experiences, or guidance would really help.   Thanks in advance 🙏",

Many companies now focus more on what you can actually build and how well you solve problems. A strong portfolio of real projects often matters far more than a formal degree, especially for junior roles or in smaller teams and startups.  The key is showing that you truly understand what you are building. When you create projects with Python and Django, make sure you can explain every decision, why the code works that way, and how you fixed bugs along the way. Interviewers notice quickly if someone has deep understanding or just followed tutorials without grasping the concepts.  If you are genuinely interested and enjoy the process, keep going. Passion makes learning faster and helps you push through tough parts. But if you are forcing yourself into IT just for the job prospects without real curiosity, it can become very hard. Even people with degrees struggle and burn out when the interest is not there.  Your current path of self-learning and building projects is one of the best ways in. Focus on finishing a few solid applications, put them on GitHub, and start applying widely. Many developers broke in exactly this way. Stay motivated and keep building.",

The issue is Bank's apps don't show the name of person you are sending the money to unlike when u transfer esewa-to-esewa , you see the hint of the name at least ex. Hi\\*\\*\\* Basnet .    So, If you send money to wrong number and transaction is successful then :     1. Contact Esewa First in their contact number . I did a mistake by contacting Bank first. Bank said that once transaction is done , they can't do anything about it & told me to ask Esewa. U need to tell customer support the wrong number u sent money too so that they can freeze the money asap.    2. The support agent might ask u to write a email. so, I sent a email but then they said to send a handwritten one. So, Just send both typed & handwritten email in address below. Write ur details , send your transaction details and in which account you want it back (best to specifiy esewa account) and **Signature**.    3. After this, If you want to take other precautionary steps (Just in case) then you can call the bank if u want to But they will probably give same cliche rejection.    You can send a **formal message** in Sms & whatsapp to the wrong number to send you the money back IF his esewa account hasnt been froze and If s/he sent your money to some other account so that s/he doesnt need to return you the money. This message is important in case you might have to go through a police case or cybersecurity case.   4. Hopefully & usually, you don't need to go to police. If u contacted esewa support quickly and wrong account has been frozen then you will get a return email with a customer ticket. You or the number where you want the money back will be called by esewa for Confirmation. This might take 3-5 days. Then, the money is returned.    If you were anxious like me, you can call them in 1-2days interval to ask your ticket status.   https://preview.redd.it/yd070i71839g1.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=82349ba235af07e8d2fe2b3061bd43c8cece5499  https://preview.redd.it/pmkej30z839g1.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7c757d57b6061bac4acf5a0f4cd1708a258bea5  https://preview.redd.it/nu9q1otz839g1.jpg?width=3358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ce0f0cdfb3e2afeee5ede4eb6d53564ac154d09",

Having more languages is an advantage. Knowing Hindi can open doors of possibility so it is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, I think people should be taught Mandarin as well.  2. Most of our channels are in Hindi. We need to have some of the popular ones dubbed in Nepali. It will also provide job to translators and dubbers.  People should also keep in mind that Nepal is not just Kathmandu. Outside Kathmandu, when people say abroad - it is either India, Malaysia, or Gulf Nations.

It's better to learn Chinese than Hindi from a purely logical pov|||Lol.  Firstly, I think Nepalis being able to speak Hindi is a plus point. It makes us multilingual, which makes them comfortable. We've always prided ourselves for being more tolerant than India and also hospitable. I don't see a problem in using a language that we know. If you go to Spain and you talk to people in English, are you expecting people there get offended too? And before you say English is an international language, Spanish has more speakers than English.   Secondly, Nepal is not just Kathmandu. There are communities in the south that use Hindi as their language. Even Nepali marwadis in Kathmandu use it. It is one of the 120+ languages used in Nepal. You saying Hindi bad kinda implies they are not Nepalis.   Thirdly, you make an issue with Indians assuming Nepalis are Indians, while you're similarly assuming India is just north India. South Indians generally don't speak Hindi. They speak English. South Indians have a much better impression of Nepal.   Indians generally don't think Nepal is a part of India. But we're bordered with UP and Bihar, which are not exactly places that are particularly respectful. A lot of them think Nepal is a place with similar cultures so it's a safe and beautiful place to visit where they don't have to deal with much cultural shock. It's just that they often overstep boundaries (pun intended) and try to get overly close, which kind of freaks us out because Nepalis are more reserved than Indians imo.|||Yeah.

I was surprised to learn that China and Korea mandate all their cartoons to be in their own language and that is just one example but for me Nepali feels quiet foreign and as someone who did my entire schooling in Nepal upto +2, I don't know how to read Nepali fluently and have a terrible handwriting. I dont even think in Nepali for the most part as most of the cartoons back in my day were all in English.   So, I think what is happening now is that we are trying to rescue a building that is already burned to ashes and blaming things that have nothing to do with us. India is a massive country and just a few encounters with a few assholes shouldn't be generalized. I lived in India for 4 years for my Bachelors and I would find a few of such people that were illterate and assumed Nepal speaks Hindi but I had the vast majority that did not have that assumption. What we need now is to rebuild what has been burned as atleast I feel like I have already suffered the damages. We need to focus on teaching kids to be comfortable with Nepali just as much as Hindi and English. I think having Hindi as an additional language is almost like a superpower as you get access too all their free educational content on Youtube and its always a better thing to know a few extra languages. I think this anti Indian sentiment will really hurt us in the long run and we need to make sure we have diplomatic and peaceful ties with both our neighbors|||Yes, we should not normalize Hindi..

He was associate professor (lowest) in ITP-CAS. He has only 3 years of teaching experience and that as a foreign ASSISTANT professor in COMSATS. Being an associate professor in a research institute doesn't give you \"experience\" to be recognized in university where teaching a class is essential. So his real experience is only 3 years. Also there are requirements for every job in every institute.  Hiring someone on higher rank just because of their reputation isn't professional in any organizations as it is unfair to other employees. Everyone will have to start from the same level.  First, he doesn't even have the eligibility to be considered anything higher than Assistant Professor since his teaching experience is insufficient.

I come from a really happy loving family, my grandparents love my mother more than their own daughter (something I shouldn't say but it's true and my fupus love her more than them k. my grandpa is so proud of my mother. it's so wholesome) my parents are really great.

A lil bit of my story id like to share here. My dads sorta nonchalant and doesnt really show much love to my mom every now and then but its not that he doesnt love her. Ofc he does but he has become a lil more expressive in these few years. Thats maybe cuz when i was a kid, no one would be there to guide him or at least teach him how to show love. Ani mero mumma chai ekdamai childish and clingy cuz shes the youngest and most loved. Ani as my dad didnt really like those things being all clingy, romantic stuffs and every other couple things earlier, they used to fight a lot verbally not physically. But growing up, i defended my mom, became her best friend to talk to and to visit places and also involved my dad in those things and then he started doing all those romantic and cute stuffs like bringing flowers sometimes, gifting her something sweet or like just talking to her sweetly and showing a bit more of love and affection. And to see that change on my dads behavior is something that ill cherish forever. Ani aile aba they know that im able to identify many things and they actually believe that i can teach them something, ani ma papa lai yesto garshyo mumma will like it type of advice haru and all dirakhthe ani my nonchalant and baap wala dad has become a more softer, lovable and cutiepatotie version in these years.   So, i feel like my dad just followed what my grandfather did to my grandmom. He didnt know how to show love cuz he never saw what it looks like but after these many years and with my little bit of guidance and direction, he has changed and my mumma really really likes the way he is right now and is happier than ever.|||Great that you see the great example for men and also having similar standard. But it is a 2 way street. I believe your mother is an incredible woman thus he is showing so much care and effort. You have to be that type of woman to expect that type of men.

This behavior will have you be the toxic one in your relationship. Every one is different and their way of showing love is different. Not all that shows affection the way you mentioned are honest and also vice versa.|||Yei matra bhako bhaye hunthiyo.

I vote yes.|||Gaarai hunxa sustain garna. Cause not many movies are released on IMAX, only mostly Hollywood blockbusters. And few cinephiles and movie enthusiasts maybe willing to pay extra and enjoy the IMAX experience but it's a very small number.|||It is extremely difficult to have a true IMAX theater. The Imax film is insanely huge. Transporting it safely, then a team who can actually operate IMAX is needed and the cost is obviously gonna be off the charts. Plus, most people in Nepal won't even be able to afford tickets. So it's highly unlikely we'll get IMAX thetre anytime soon. Even most (if not all) the IMAX theatres in India aren't true IMAX theatres. They're all projected digitally I think. Testo khalko IMAX chahi maybe we can get sometime in the future. Idk about that. Hopefully we do.|||Nope: imax is expensive tech. License will cost millions: tickets will be in thousands. It’s impossible to achieve scale with this technology.|||Who's gonna invest? Who's gonna watch? I also think IMAX would be great and would like to watch movies there, but I don't see a big market for both investors and people who watch it. Normal Hollywood movie nai 600+ xa tickets aile. Jhan IMAX ayo vani 1800+ hunxa sure. Who's gonna watch paying that much? Maybe there are some rich people BUT not big enough market for investors to feel secure of ROI.|||IMAX ma movie herna paunu would be a dream come true. I think it’s a dream for many of us cinephiles. But to be realistic, there’s no way we’re getting IMAX here in Nepal.  As many people in the comments have already mentioned, it’s expensive, hella expensive. Bringing IMAX itself is costly. Then there’s the cost of maintenance and operation, which is huge. I don’t think any sane investor would want to take that risk.  Even the cinema halls we have right now, which I won’t say are great, but are at a decent level, aren’t able to upgrade themselves properly or even run consistently. So there’s no way IMAX is happening.  I also read some of your other comments where you said many cinephiles would be willing to come to Kathmandu to watch movies in IMAX. I agree. For any cinephile, watching their favorite movie in IMAX would be a dream come true. But IMAX isn’t a one-time thing; it needs regular footfall. No one is going to keep coming to Kathmandu every time just to watch a movie. It’s not time-feasible, money-feasible, or practical in any way.  Even in India, with such a massive population, maintaining IMAX is a big challenge. Now think about Nepal. Nepal is a small country with a relatively small population. There’s simply no way IMAX could sustain itself here.  On top of that, I recently read that many youth-focused businesses, movies, restaurants, cafes, clothing stores, are already struggling because the youth population is decreasing. Compared to decades ago, there are far fewer young people in the country now. Even these businesses are finding it hard to survive.  In a situation like this, there’s no chance anyone will invest in bringing IMAX to Nepal. Realistically, we’re never getting IMAX here because we just can’t sustain it.  That said, like you, I also wish I could watch my favorite movies in IMAX. IBut yeah I was just being realistic.|||if there was market to justify the investment, we'd have IMAX already.|||I don’t think there’s a market lol. Even regular prices are expensive, imagine double triple that.|||We don't need that shit. We just need a 4k native screens.|||It does not|||No, the maintainance cost is too high for IMAX|||No|||Skyrocket on Popcorn, and cold drinks price|||Nope.|||Noo lmao  Probably wouldn't succeed to run it|||yes we do and people worry about a their wallet. imax provides movie experience than any other cinema they use cameras used for space the quality of the is 4k from a projector the sound is ass shattering and i think a 1000rs is justifiable|||I votes yes cus I would also want those exclusive popcorn buckets and even some freebies and the most important of all those 4d seats|||Unless Nepali film industry makes 10 imax movies atleast a year, it will never happen, it’s that simple.|||No. You would be in the minority who would pay 1000+ for imax tickets. There's a reason why even places like australia, the vast majority of the population does not care about imax. Also, how many movies are actually made for imax, very few so its really not that important.|||Have you watched avatar 3 ?|||Bro these comments. 1000rs ma Imax re bro are u fr? India 1000 ic ma herya yaad cha malai.

Atleast in sl, the tickets are double the price. If it's worth it or not is upto the individual but it's for sure a different experience. If u dont like cinema's in general then Imax won't change it. If u do, then yes it's worth it but for select movies which are almost all Hollywood ones.|||Yeahh broo Nepal ma ni auta imax theater ta hunu parni ho k manchhe haru lai India janu parchha|||Not a big enough market to sustain. Maybe during big blockbuster releases they might be able to sell a few tickets. But most of the year they'd have to endure a huge operating cost. Maybe in a few years it might be viable but as an investor better put money elsewhere|||As a movie lover, yeah.|||What is one less than imax? I think that might be better.|||the amount it would require to build one is too expensive and i don't think nepal has any malls that would be able to incorporate it.|||Not worth it|||Actual imax theater hunu paryo not that digital one.|||tbh maybe no.. cause i am in nyc rn and a regular imax goer. to function the imax screen is no joke the cost is sooo high that only few theaters can afford. even in usa these are not very common. tho there are talks about installing new screens across the country before The Odyssey but the same problem,,, it is so expensive.  and again not every movie shines better on imax screen. most of the movies looks awful.

I would fokkin love mao zedong style cultural cleansing but u fokkin hindu and Christians and muslims and fokkin buddhists wont let that happen because u stupidos love your gods so much and all of u would call it blasphemy|||How is this kind of content being allowed here?|||this is sad man|||Did epstein had sexual slaves as well ???: https://sunnah.com/nasai:3959|||OP cooked with dis one 😂😂😭😭|||And if he was born 5000 years ago a certain religion would have made him Krishna. |||Hindu gods chai different jasto lmao 🤣|||And if he was Nepali today people would defend him by saying that he increased or GDP and harassed the victims and would honor him with malas and a parade if he ever got out. Your point?  Religious leaders have always been predatory. If Epstien was born 1500 years ago, he wouldnt have been the prophet of Islam but rather his own religion that wouldve leagalized sex slavely of marginalized children. Also, Epstien was a European Jewish, not a middle eastern muslim. This makes more sense as he is reported to have been meeting leaders from a genocidial regime where a lot of sex offenders flee to when they're caught for their crimes. (People call it is not real)  The thing is, people would make any man who said, \"God visited me in my dreams\" or \"I am the son of God,\" their prophet and women who said it, they would treat her as a schizophrenic. Just look at what they did to Joan of Arc when she said that Gkd told her to.lead an army. Theres also the origin of Mormanism. If you look into it, the dude bullshitted out of being caught about bullshitting. And that religion itself is so fucking predatory and oppressive that Christians dont even view them as Christians but like a cult. Do you know how bad you have to be if no branch of Christianity considers you to be Christian? Really fucking bad. Jahovah's witness ko ta kurai nagarm. If religion was made for community, then Jahovah's witness was made to isolate people and remove happiness from the world.  Don't get me wrong, I have my own issues with Islams (the way bangladeshi killed that hindu man was uncalled for even if their allegation was true) Infact, I have my issues with all the Abrahamic religions as they all treat other religions the same way: with contempt and a sense of arrogance. They have destryoed a lot of cultures and history all around the world because, \"God wills it.\" And they still continue to fight amongst each other because they dont realize that they serve the same god.  This doesnt mean that the Hindu religion is perfect. Aata ni bhagawan ko naam ma kati dherai atrocities committ bhaeko xha, especially against women ra \"lower\" caste ka manxhe haru, and even homosexual ra transgender manxhe haru (but that was most likely the result of EIC meddling in Nepal ko politics and that turned into religion) and all that. Mero bua ko phupu didi was widowed at 16 because she got married to an old man at a very young age, you know why? \"Means huno bhanda aagadi chori ko bihe bhayo bhane chori pakkai swarga ma janxhe.\" Sounds like making a way for a pedophile to marry a young girl to me.  You can critisize Islam for having a pedophile for a prophet and how it doesn't condem pedophilia. I do too. Tara you cannot act like every other religion isnt the same when it comes to protecting and enabaling pedophilia kinaki every religion has had a pedophile and predators leading their place of worship, and even hinduism, because the title comes wirh protection for their crimes and devotion from the people, and LOTS and LOTS of money. Catholicism ko ta kura nai nagaram cause Catholic priests haru le bhurabhuri haru lai molest gareko ta sterotype nai bhaisakyo.  Dont make this thing with Epstien a religion issue, its a politics, pedophilia, and a money issue. I am sure ki there are many richer than the world muslims who visited the Island, but the key word here is RICH. Epstien would let anybody in the island as long as they were rich, or a child they can exploit.|||I can't believe day would come nepali liberals will defend literal pedophile in comments not talking about epsiten btw|||Most people were Epstein 1500 years ago chill.

And honestly, he’s doing a great job.  This has been his approach for a long time. Even when he was at the Nepal Electricity Authority, he used the same method, visiting sites and dealing directly with contractors. There are even videos of him giving direct order to them. This time as well, he’s doing a solid job. Ever since he took charge of the ministry, he’s been working tirelessly, visiting sites, reviewing the progress of projects, and staying involved in the details. The same goes for the Finance Minister and the Education Minister, they also seem to be working really hard.  Coming back to Kulman Ghising, it’s clear that he has long-term plans. He has already said that he will be contesting the election, and I’m pretty sure he’s thinking ahead. If he wins the election, he’ll likely return in full action mode, and all this groundwork will help him once he’s back in power.  Overall, I’m really satisfied with his work. Recently, I also read that the Department of Roads has restarted its road maintenance ambulance service. Now whenever there’s an issue on the road, like potholes, they’ll respond immediately. I even saw him inaugurate those Ambulance a couple of weeks ago.  So yeah, overall, he’s doing a very good job, and I’m quite satisfied with the work he’s doing right now.|||He deserves the accolades.

THE result was that I scored 84 out of 100 (highest marks-89) and My friend scored 86 out of 100. He got a seat in KMC with a full scholarship and I got a seat in MCOMS in full scholarship.

My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6.

Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.

His books have changed the entire learning journey of school level mathematics in Nepal. That even for decades. His name used to be in every student's tongue. I am no genius in mathematics but I use it in my daily work (ML stuff) and if I have to give some credits for my skills in applying math, I can give his name. And you know what was it like back then when he started writing first book? There was literally no internet, he collected past question papers and had from like 2065. And he even categorized questions, contents based on level like basic, intermediate, advanced and so on. And he even used to add the most prominent mathematician in each chapter. That I even consider a some form of research. Not every research has to wear a PhD hat. So for me, I consider his contributions in mathematics to be highest in Nepal.

You should go two ways:-  1) Report at police's cyber bureau.  2) Do self investigation. Police is slow, case like yours is matter of everyday for them. So, try following:-  - Is their phone still ringing? If yes try as a new client from new number, new voice (friend) and try to meet before paying. If one guy is ready to meet then you can get them nabbed. - If you have family or friends in any of the banks scammers used, then ask them to find their original name, number, location, if account still has any money (this worked for me, I got number and names)  If you got details you can ask police to help by scaring them or freezing the amount etc. You can try these and come back to me here to proceed.|||cyber bureau ma report garne all details .|||haha movies haina ni bro. reverse hack hanera location track hanera firta linu sounds good in fantasy only . only logical option is to go to police/bank or whatever institutions involved|||Sakyeo no chance ull ever recover ur amount..but register ur case to cyber bureau|||First do register police complaint.

But when it comes to GTM, growth, marketing, or just figuring out how to actually sell and scale a product… there’s a huge gap.  Most startups here are run by tech engineers, and naturally, the focus is on building the product perfectly. That’s great, but then things like growth strategy, customer acquisition, positioning, and distribution get ignored. People just assume if you build it, users will come. Spoiler: they don’t.  Most of the startups here in Nepal fail less because the product is bad, but instead because the distribution/game-plan is weak.   Here in Nepal, GTM skills aren’t really taught, nor are they considered “cool” compared to coding. Most people in IT industrychase programming jobs, freelancing gigs, or outsourcing contracts because that’s a safer bet financially.  I think this is actually a huge opportunity. Someone who can master GTM skis here like: user research, acquisition channels, funnel optimization, sales psychology could easily dominate the startup scene.   Instead of just learning yet another JS framework, you should also learn GTM skills.   What do you guys think?",

Look at Indonesia it follows Sufism mixed with agakhani sect do we hear minorities being treated badly? No. Mostly it's the south Asian Muslims who are radical because they follow a very strict islam of deubandi and wahabism school of thought which has caused problem historically it's moderate example would be creation of Taliban and extreme example is creation of Pakztan. Now contrary to that you've Indonesia which is also a majority Muslim nation but follows Sufism school of thought which is why they are much more liberal. They're okay with currency having Ganesha, okay with garuda being national symbol(coat of arms), and even okay with naming kids from Sanskrit derived names like majority of their head of the states have Sanskrit origin names there will be some ups and downs in writing because Indonesia didn't follow devanagari it followed the Brahmi script earlier, in that way it's still preserving the culture. But if you tell this to a MUSLIM.from south Asia he will say it's shirk/haram in islam and that being associated with polytheism is bad and that they are a lost tribe of Turks and Arabs who had invaded our land. So, wahabism and Deubandi unless remained will not allow for inclusivity among the people islam factor will be there no matter what|||Can't decide which is the worst religion - Islam or Hinduism.

If that is not the case here, then it's wrong and us Indians should accept that. 3. Nepal is a beautiful country. People have more civic sense and overall better sense of community and cohesion from what I have seen.  4. What Nepali people have to understand is India is a big country 1.4 billion people is a lot. So, of all the counties in the world, India is probably the only one you should never generalize. 6. Both Nepali and Indian people can have good relationship with each other, just learn to talk properly and not take things to ego. 6. Yes, India is a bigger economy, and has more resources, but it is not in competition with Nepal. Nepal has it's own strengths that it should not forget.  7. Open border has it's pros and cons. Yes, many Nepali are in India, do they get to build a life, yes. Do they get discriminated, yes, and so are Indians from other states. And Nepali also discriminate against Indian tourists and workers. 8. Always remember, most average Indians will probably only have good will towards Nepal and no hate.  9.

This is further emboldened by the recent strong statements UML has put out.  The old parties have their base established, and the more the new parties run for election, the more they dilute their own votes. Furthermore, they aren't organized yet to be a major national party and to compete in 165 different constituencies .

            "heading": "Went to India recently and it was immensely traumatizing",
            "body": "So I (27M) went to India for the first time. I was traveling solo turns out it was a bad idea. It was for work related events. After the event, I decided to explore a few places.   Until the work event, everything was fine. It was great learning and networking in the event. I actually speak Hindi very fluently so communication wasn’t an issue at all. After the event, I wanted to travel and explore.   I had booked a pretty average room for my accommodation. Nothing fancy, just the most budget friendly one I could find. There were a couple of people in the lobby and they greeted me nicely and asked for my ID. I showed them my passport and their faces instantly changed after seeing my Nepali passport. The guy said oh you’re from Nepal. I said yes and the another man said, this doesn’t work, we need to see an Indian ID. They weren’t smiling anymore and were giving me very skeptical looks. I tried not to overthink it. He kept insisting for an Indian ID and I explained to him that I am not from India, it’s my first time here so it’s not possible for me to have an Indian ID. Then they asked me for my contact number and I gave my phone number (didn’t have Indian number). Once again, they kept on asking for an Indian number. I was really surprised seeing their hospitality instantly changed after learning about my identity. Not sure if they did that because I was a foreigner to them or because I was specifically a Nepali guy.   While I was exploring the local market, I went to buy some souvenirs. One shop guy asked me where I was from and I said Nepal. He then started lecturing me saying don’t be close with China. They will do the same to you what Pakistan is doing to us. He kept yapping about how Nepal is a small part of India and that we should be grateful that we have a “bada bhai” like India. I left the shop without saying anything.    I wanted to travel by train but had absolutely zero idea about it. The people weren’t helpful there either. I was asking the various staff in the train station saying I wanna go here where can I find a ticket. They just vaguely pointed go there, it’s over there. Finally one guy at the ticket counter helped me get tickets after nearly couple of hours of running frantically here and there. I told him I’m not from India, traveling by train for the first time. The counter guy gave me a ticket saying this is for general class, it’s not safe to travel there..very crowded and chaotic, after your train arrives, meet the ticket guy and ask him to upgrade to AC compartment. I thanked him and went to the platform. There was a police officer whom I asked about upgrading the ticket. He too said the same thing i.e. meet the ticket guy once your train arrives and he will help you.   I still had about 3-4 hours before my train arrived. I just stayed in the platform watching movie. After the train arrived, I was frantically searching for the ticket guy. One police officer came near me charging with his baton. I was shit scared. He almost charged me saying why are you in the AC compartment with a general ticket in your hand. I was literally shaking at this point and with a shaky voice, I explained him my situation. He said haven’t you been in a train before where are you from. I said I’m from Nepal and he laughed saying oh you guys don’t even have trains there haha. Are you really from Nepal, your eyes don’t look like Nepalese. (I think he was referring to Mongolian eyes). I saw the ticket guy and went to him. He said me go to this seat and I’ll come. Later, he came to me and upgraded my ticket. The journey was a little over an hour long. And I was constantly replaying the entire experience from the hotel to the local market to the train station police guy.    Not sure if I just happened to meet all the wrong people or that everyone is the same there. Either way, I’m not going back to India for a long time. And I haven’t even mentioned the kids constantly following you begging for money, the dirt and litter everywhere, people peeing and even pooping in the open, unnecessary horns, air pollution.   PS: not trying to spread hate— just sharing my personal experience.",

Which cities did you visit, by the way? and as far as I know, many hotels in India especially smaller ones usually avoid foreigners because of paperwork and FRRO/police registration requirements. It’s better to stay at big hotels or resorts while traveling. I personally mostly stay at resorts, especially Club Mahindra ones they’re quite good, with solid service.  Also, try to do everything online in India train bookings, hotels, cabs. That way you’re much less likely to get scammed or harsh treated. Offline train ticket booking is honestly very hectic, even for Indians, so always book train tickets online. Use the official IRCTC website or authorized partners like MakeMyTrip, ConfirmTkt, or Paytm then you won’t face these problems.  And if you remember the time, location, duration, or the office name, you can also register a complaint on the Rail Madad portal or app. Lastly, there’s a huge generation gap in India you’ll mostly hear such racist things from older people or those in the 30–40 age group, but the younger generation is usually nicer and more helpful .You can even see this generation gap while speaking English. If you start speaking English in front of older people, they often treat you like some different person almost a ‘raja sahab’ type. But with the younger generation, it usually doesn’t make much of a difference. Anyway, I hope your journey was safe.|||Mods, how much racial abuse is tolerated here?

Mahesh bhatt father of alia bhatt. |||Extreme religious ideology is worse no matter if it is Hindu, Muslim or Christian, \"Hindu Terrorism\" or \"Christian Terrorism\" barely makes into media as it drags out least amount of attention and media don't make money out of that.   For example: Yesterday Bihar ma euta Muslim lai mob milera kaan kateko [https://thewire.in/communalism/muslim-man-lynched-by-mob-in-bihar-succumbs-to-injuries](https://thewire.in/communalism/muslim-man-lynched-by-mob-in-bihar-succumbs-to-injuries)  America ko Brown Uni Shooting.

Obviously no, tara if muslim man said \"Allah Hu Akhbar\" there will be tons of news on that.  Even recent Australian incident for example, Indian/ Aus Media were so quick to label the guy as Pakistani but turns out father was Indian and son was Australian.  I do agree that majority of attacks extreme muslim ideology le garda bhako cha, with that being said Australia ko last major incident ko hero has always been Muslim (Last year Bondi Stabbing culprit was White guy and Pakistani guy saved lot of people)|||Correct me if I am wrong but I heard muslims believes killing non Muslims will grant them heaven and 72 virgins..

There are always extremists in every religion. Hindu, muslim, christian doesnt matter. If you just look at statistics plenty of school shootings/ assassinations done by primarily christians, is it their religion? robberies done by African Americans so all of them are bad? There’s been plenty of cases of violence/ massacres of muslims all over india and vice vera in Pakistan. Does that make you an extremist since there are Hindus that have massacred people? Would you be okay with an innocent from being killed? Educate yourself and don’t live in an echo chamber.|||Why is that all of these extremist Muslims have some Pak-is-tan connections? And Indonesian muslims have Hindu/Sanskrit names which south Asian muslims will say it's haram, narak mein jaayega tuuh and all the bad names when someone keen attempts such?  I wonder why 🤔|||Why is everyone so racist... It genuinely makes me sad that the nepali sub reddit just hates so easily.|||Is your internet slow?   A guy who saved many people in that attack was also muslim.|||Because, the media hates them.   You really think some guy from syria who identifies as a muslim is responsible for what happened at the Bondi attack?  Stop playing the blaming game here. Humanity is one. it is not muslims that are responsible, it is not hindus that are responsible, it is not jews that are responsible, it is not christians that are responsible. terrorists are responsible.

Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

I'm in a bit of a dilemma and would really appreciate some advice from this community: BBA vs. BBS? I'm leaning towards a management degree, but I'm unsure about the key differences between BBA and BBS programs in Nepal, especially regarding career prospects and curriculum rigor. Given my science background, which one might be a better fit?  Best Colleges near Lalitpur? Could anyone recommend the top-tier management colleges located near Lalitpur/Patan?  Am I too late for admissions? I just passed out in 2025. Have admission cycles already closed for this intake?  The Abroad Factor:  My primary reason for joining a local college immediately is to avoid a gap year, just in case my visa application for abroad studies gets rejected down the line. I want to have a safety net and continue my education smoothly. Any insights, recommendations for colleges, or general advice on navigating admissions timelines would be incredibly helpful right now.",

            "body": "Namaste rNepal,  My name is Mahendra. I wanted to share an update about my father’s health and the situation my family is currently facing.  My father has been diagnosed with metastatic gallbladder cancer, which is a very aggressive form of cancer. Since the diagnosis, our days have been filled with hospital visits, tests, medicines and treatment plans. On 30 November, he completed another round of chemotherapy. He is fighting bravely, but the side effects and the emotional strain have been extremely difficult for him and for all of us.  we come from very lower middle class family but with a dream to make me engineer and a good human my dad put all his life and sacrificed everything. He worked as a security guard in india din vari ubhiyar kaam garnu vo , hamro sapna pura garna lai and  i still  wonder \"why us\" ? He never consumed alcohol,cigarette, tombakhu or anything that is said to cause cancer now when he is admitted at hospital the main head of the family and i have to lookafter all the expenses i understand why all it happen. the burden of money to manage for studies, run family and survive was really hard for us but he never show us. That dherai chintaa about managing money became the cause for the cancer ig , chintaa le ni cancer hudo raicha. My dad is now ,, he's a cancer patient god!! I was a guy learning and doing everything to pass exams nthg more than that and still use to feel sometime \"life kati garo cha yrr,, Yo sem  ma pass vaidiana and all,,  and suddenly life put me in a place where I had to become the pillar of the family. being student and not even earning it's being extremly hard for us.  I am doing everything possible  via writing, reaching out, asking for help — because I don't want to lose my father. He is still hopeful. He still smiles even on the hardest days.  We have already used all our savings and borrowed money to continue his treatment. The cost of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, scans, tests and medicines has become overwhelming for our family. With the help of kind people, we have managed to raise a little over NPR 3 Lakhs so far, which helped cover the initial cycles, but we still have many more ahead.  I am sharing this post to provide a clear and honest update about our situation. I am not asking anyone to do work on my behalf. Anyone who wishes to support us in any form may do so if they feel comfortable. Even reading this and keeping my father in your thoughts means a lot to us.

Cholangiocarcinoma aka gall bladder cancer. He was 3rd stage when we received the diagnosis. Fortunately, the treatments worked and he's in total remission. He's recovered and cancer free for 4th year running.   He had lesions best the duct, with initial spread to lymph nodes.   We got treatment at Nepal Cancer Research Hospital, Chemo and radiation. And surgery at Teaching Hospital.   I don't remember the exact chemo meds, the radiation was about 17 18 cycles and the surgery went decently well.   There is hope brother, the financial strain was absolutely tough. I don't know if you can it lucky or not but my old man was a civil servant and this was right during COVID-19. I was studying, so had free time and he also didn't have to go to work. Everyone was supportive. I guess we spent close to 15 20 lakhs over all, some of which were covered by insurance and some were donations collected by kins and friends.  So, don't lose hope man. And idk but I would like to suggest consulting Dr Sudip at NCHRC hattiban if you decide to continue here in Nepal since it worked in my case. And it's a specialized facility, and they have a lotta data and experience with this stuff. Also, state of the art equipment.|||I don’t know how you’ll take this advice, because most people only follow mainstream chemo treatment for cancer. But I’ve read many testimonies on X about treating cancer with protocol using ivermectin, fenbendazole and other medicines. Which in most cases treated completely 4th stage cancer after following through the medications for 6 months +. Just letting you know these aren’t that expensive medicines, may be available in Nepal as well if not they’re easily available in India. And can be taken parallel to the current treatment. Found this guy on X “Dr William Makis”. Just sharing what I came across, it’s upto you to make the judgement though. Do your own research.

We’ve learnt Nepali and English since childhood and those are the only languages we feel confident in.|||Agree completely. I never entertain anyone who assumes I speak Hindi and doesn't see a difference between our cultures and languages. I never willingly consume Indian media and always try to give Nepali content more of my attention. I think it's high time we did something about the rampant encroachment of not just Indian but also Western culture into our collective psyche.|||Bro, why did you even start speaking hindi ????   Your language is your weapon. Since hindi is not your identity, you have a disadvantage. They look down on you if you speak their language with them. That’s literally saying: you are my master, i will follow you.   You will only be a sidekick on someone else’s story.   You have more control and power over your own language. You can say anything in Nepali and no one can correct you cus you are the native speaker. You are fluent and can express yourself better. That gives you the leverage to take a stand for yourself.   I am surprised, that you used to speak hindi man. You compromised your language for their convenience. Ofcourse they will treat you like their follower.   But i am glad you realised your mistake.|||Lived in the states for 18 yrs, never responded in Hindi. In fact, respond them with English, which for most Nepalese, is better in terms pronunciation than theirs.|||It’s been 10 years since I watched Indian movies or listened to hindi songs. I can’t even name a single post 2015 actor, singer or celebrity.

We are not Hindi, we are Nepali. it’s like a kinda stand on business kinda thing. “we are not just an offshoot of India we are better” kinda thing, and I get it lol|||Well most Indians don't speak Hindi anyway. I live in Delhi and even I speak more English than Hindi. Anyway, like some guy here said language is just a medium of exchange. I doubt the people who are making you feel inferior will automatically stop doing so if you stop communicating in Hindi. You should search other remedies.|||I've faced the same at an apple care Tokyo. Seeing us the technician request another to guide us. One indian man arrived with loud tone \"Kya Problem hai Bhaiya ?\". I said I don't understand Hindi can we communicate in English ? He went back and the previous technician came to guide us again. The problem with my iPad remain unsolved though.  But if somebody (Normally senior citizens) asks for help in Hindi, I help them with my broken hindi.|||Agreed.

So from that day I have stopped speaking in Hindi to Indians and other people I only speak in English.|||Exactly.  Most Nepalis think it shows intelligence or something by speaking Hindi or broken hindi.  Speaking hindi as a Nepali is the best way to show that we are somehow part of India.   I have also seen firsthand that that some Indians will treat you shittier if you speak their language. Its not all indians, but there are too many.   Cmon people have some self respect. |||Yes, either speak Nepali or English, no other language|||wtf even talk in hindi|||I don’t really hang around Indians that much and whenever I do I just say I don’t understand Hindi at all. Which forces them to talk to me in English. Also whenever I mention I’m Hindu they’re like we have the same religion and all. I like to tell them that even tho we have the same religion our practices are different and I am not familiar with their practices and beliefs. I just try to separate myself and our country from them as much as I can, cause we’re not the same. I don’t like those who try to be like them in terms of everything. Like please have your own identity.|||Yaar ma hindi YouTube channel kholnu lako I'm Nepali but Indian audience is large 😭🙏💔🥀|||[deleted]|||It's unfortunate you had that experience, but Hindi is the 3rd most spoken language in the world, right behind English and Mandarin.   To tell someone to stop speaking that language isn't going to fix the issue. You should be confident and talk to the people who make you feel this way that Hindi is not your native language and you can only converse in a limited way. Any person who insults you by considering you \"inferior\" is stupid and arrogant. You have to call them out on it.   Since you are in Canada, there are many people who speak French. And French is the 6th most spoken language in the world. If you can learn it and speak, that'd give you a boost in talking to more people. It doesn't always have to be English.   Language is just a medium to communicate. It doesn't belong to any particular nation or a group of people. Don't be afraid to speak out your thoughts.

At the moment, i would suggest you to keep doing your jobs and garnering your skills so you land up one job with a handsome pay. Good luck.|||dude you're just like me, but 10 years ago. i've been exactly where you are and it sucks ass. i had to maintain multiple jobs because none would pay on time, and i had to support my parents and two siblings. so when i say i know what you're going through, i mean it. and as much i appreciate people being nice here, no one (except for one) is trying to help you navigate this shituation.  the one thing that you need more of isn't money or opportunities, its time. **you need more time**. more time for proper sleep, more time to gather your thoughts, more time to pause and evaluate your current situation, more time to plan out the next few months. you're like a engine that's constantly running 24/7, and you haven't had the chance to rest for a single moment, and it sucks soooo much because as much as you want to stop, you just can't. its all on you, everything depends on you, and you have to keep moving, or else everything will fall apart. and this will only end one way, and its not good dude.  thats why you have to take your time back. you need at least 2 more hours of sleep (sleeping an hour early and waking up 30 minutes late). at least 1 hour of free time to plan your next steps. you weekends need to be for yourself, and yourself alone. whatever precious time you have, you keep it and don't let anyone or anything take it from you.   if you have college every morning, talk with the administration and ask them to let you check-in an hour late - explain your situation, tell them that you have no other option; this worked for me, and will work for you.  if you have small spare time where its not too long to start working but not too short to just sit around (like 25-40 minutes of downtime), just get to the next task/next job. baru duita day shifts ko bich ma kei downtime hunai nadeu. inform your office you'll arrive early and leave early. explain that you have a tight schedule and you don't want to waste your time. companies will try to make up some nonsense about proper timing and all that bullshit but don't let them bully you to submission. ask them to understand your situation, and make up shit like you also study and go to college everyday and do your assignments daily because you're a weak student, and normally don't get enough sleep because of that, so instead of just wasting time after college, you just come to work early - you know, make it sappy if that helps. but whatever you say, make sure that they let you leave early. take back your time.  if this helps you gather even 1-2 hours extra everyday, thats the time you can invest on yourself now. if you can get home by 5pm instead of 6:30pm, thats around 3 hours before your night shift starts. you can use that time to either plan your next move. work on your portfolio. add things to your showreels that you wish you could but weren't allowed to. talk with your parents about what you're going through and ask them to help you with planning for the future. like the other user said, actually start tracking all your expenses and see where all your money is going. excel is free in the browser, and you can search for \"excel free budget templates\". categorize all your expenses and see where the money is being wasted. do you smoke regularly? are your lunches expensive? is your electricity bill too high? not a single rupee goes untracked. you need every penny to be accounted for. if there's an unnecessary expense, cut it out completely. the more you can save, the easier it will be for you.  you can also request your night shift company to let you start early, and end early. sounds like it's a remote job, so your reasoning could be that you're already free by 6pm, and instead of waiting around, you'd like to start early when you're still feeling energized and not drained of energy by 3 in the morning. you can give your work report by 12 midnight and go to sleep 30 minutes early, even.  if you travel by bus or micros, take that time to complete errands that can be done via your phone. create a checklist for what you need to do before you can apply for better jobs. look for potential companies that have a good company culture (normally has better pay too). connect with past colleagues online just to say hi (this one might feel weird at first but its better to say hi how are you rather than hi do you have a job in your company). update your expense tracking sheet. look for templates and plugins that can help your portfolio be better than the rest.  spend every single free minute to get yourself on a better situation.  you're drowning every hour every day, but you're taking the first step towards pulling yourself out. it's going to be difficult the next few months and you may feel more drained than ever, but if you do all these for yourself, you'll be in a much better mental state in the next couple of months. here's to hoping that you update us in a few months that you got a job that pays as much as all three jobs combined 🤞  all the best. do yourself proud.|||On person told me, rather focusing making money from 2-3 small jobs.

Everything will be same but you will be different  Try meditating, clearing your mind. Once you have a clear mind you can think.  The more you panic, the more it gets worse. Thinking about the future and trying to make life better is good but when you over think the same thing over and over, that thought is what making you demotivated not the situation. If you can’t change the situation, don’t over think it.  I know its hard, but don’t loose the hope.  Stay calm, plan and proceed and will be a matter of time you see the changes.  It is a process not an immediate action. At the end its you and I know someone who is handling everything as you said can do lot better in life. Don’t forget, Some people dream to be in your place. Be positive. You got this.|||I hear you can make more with pathao or similar ride services as a rider.|||Keep the hustle going.

If you have any debts, create a small, steady repayment plan so they don’t keep snowballing.      Separate essential and non-essential expenses, even small adjustments can make a difference. And try to save at least a tiny amount each month. Even a symbolic sum gives a bit of control and stability.      Look at how much free time you have outside of work and try to set aside a small, consistent window to learn skills that are in demand. Little steps add up and can help you increase your income over time.      I’ve been in a similar situation myself, and I know how heavy it can feel. But it is possible to climb out of it slowly, with small steady actions. You’re already doing an incredible amount, don’t be too hard on yourself.

However, for the sake of national security and peace, such measures remain essential for VVIPs. Whether we like them or not, an attack on a high profile figure can disrupt our national peace and damage our international reputation for years to come.  ​We can never be certain who might be planning an attack on a VVIP or for what purpose.

There will always be those who fight for their \"masters\" or those who have something to gain from these VVIPs, for them, personal interests and loyalty will always take priority over the country’s wellbeing. If an attack occurs, our country’s stability can derail overnight and Western media and racists in west love to make fun of \"third world countries\" to feel superior regardless of fact that they have been through worse.

            "body": "As it says, I recently got this and was hoping for some help, especially on the markings. There isn’t a ton of info on these in English so I figured I’d do to the source. My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6. This is probably the longest shot of them all, but any ideas what species of critter might have eaten up the stock at one point?

Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.  Jangi Megjin: Originally founded in 1793, it continued to function during the Rana period as a government foundry for manufacturing cannons and military equipment.|||You need someone from the Hanuman Dhoka Museum in Kathmandu.

            "body": "Bail does not mean someone is innocent or guilty. It just means that rather than keeping a person in prison while waiting for their trial (so they don't escape), they are set free for the time being. They have to give the court a large sum of money as a \"deposit\" so they are inclined to return.  If they show up to court as promised, they get their money back. If they run away, the court keeps the cash and sends the police to find them. It isn’t a decision on whether they did the crime, it’s just a way to let someone live their life until the judge or jury makes a final decision. This is usually done if the person in question does not have a high risk of escaping or evading from police.",

So, the deposit is taken,  cannot escapse the country but can roam inside the fix territory|||In simpler terms, it is similar to a security deposit (refundable), not a fine/penalty. The person is required to follow the court orders, e.g., appearing in court on the date of hearings/schedules and not leaving a specific area or boundary, and following any other orders set by the court. If any of these orders are violated, the bail money is forfeited. Otherwise the money is returned after deducting some applicable court fees (if any) once the case is closed or a sentence is made.|||Exactly as you said if defendant is not flight risk and not risk to himself or others they can pay bail to wait for court date. Free up resources.|||In common law, right to bail or presumption of bail is based on the severity and the offense and the likelihood of accused posing an unacceptable risk to the community. Financial crime (white collar crime) usually favours bail provision once the defendants satisfy no flight risk.

Since then, I’ve been focused on building networks, skills, and connections that I can use later in Nepal. I’m confident I can start from scratch there and build something meaningful with the experience I gained here.  Through this whole journey, I’ve noticed that Nepali students who come to Australia usually fall into one of two mindsets: \t1.\tThe “I’ll do whatever it takes for PR” mindset. This path needs long-term commitment, smart planning, and patience. There are multiple routes, but you have to be ready to follow them consistently. \t2.\tThe “Use Australia as a resource and return” mindset. Some people come here to gain skills, experience, money, or professional networks not necessarily to settle. If used wisely, Australia offers a lot that you can take back home and build a career with.  Neither mindset is wrong. The problem is when people don’t think strategically and end up stuck in between spending years here without building anything solid in either country.

I used to wish I could just be “normal.”  But after my S.E.E., something changed. That 3-month break gave me a new life. I had my “aha” moment. Somehow, I finally started understanding things. Maybe it was the silence, maybe it was being away from all the noise, maybe it was just loneliness giving me space to think. But everything shifted.  I taught myself how to code. I got a job as a software developer. I didn’t finish my degree because my college wouldn’t let me work while studying, so I said “forget it” and focused on work. It was well paid, and nobody asked for a degree anyway. So yeah, I’m a dropout who made it this far.  I’m still not “super smart,” but I’m definitely smarter than the version of me back then. I still have tics, they still distract me sometimes, but I’m living with it.  I just needed to get this off my chest. I’ve kept it inside for too long.  **And to anyone reading this who feels like they’re slow, or not smart, or different:**   I hope you find your moment too. I hope you realize that you’re not broken. Sometimes loneliness or silence gives you a new life. You grow in ways you don’t even notice at first. You don’t have to be a genius to make it. You just have to keep going. If I can do it, anyone can.  Stay strong. You’ll get your moment too.      ***Note: Yes, I did use ChatGPT to improve this text, mainly to fix grammar mistakes. I hope that’s alright.***",

We normally don’t jump into public threads, but after reading this post and the comments, we felt it was important to share our side honestly and respectfully.  First, we want to say this clearly: we’re not here to fight anyone or deny their feelings. If someone feels disappointed, that matters. At the same time, one side of the story doesn’t always show the full picture.  1. Not all students are the same Every batch has students with very different abilities, discipline levels, and learning speeds. Some push themselves hard and grow fast. Some struggle, skip practice, or expect results without consistent effort. That difference affects outcomes, and it’s something no institute can fully control.  2. Many students come from very weak foundations A lot of students who join us come from backgrounds where code is still taught by writing it on the board, not by actually building things. No real tools, no projects, no industry exposure. They don’t come job-ready. They come to become job-ready. And despite these gaps, we genuinely try our best to upgrade them, change how they think about learning, and push them toward practical skills. On top of that, we take responsibility by providing guaranteed internship opportunities so they at least get real-world exposure.  3. Internships are where most people get stuck in Nepal The harsh truth is this: a huge number of IT graduates in Nepal never get an internship at all. Without that first step, they never discover what they’re capable of. Many eventually give up, leave the field, or leave the country believing Nepal has no scope. We may not be perfect, but if we can at least help someone start, that matters to us.  4. We are transparent from day one Before anyone joins Mindrisers, we explain things clearly, how the course works, what’s expected from the student, how internships are handled, everything. We use written agreements so there’s no confusion later. If, despite that, posts like this come up, all we can do is stay honest and let time speak. We truly believe karma catches up to both good and bad intentions.  We’re still learning. We’re still improving. And we’re open to real feedback. But please understand, we’re not here to scam, exploit, or sell fake dreams. We’re trying to do something meaningful in a system that already has many problems.  Thanks to everyone who took time to read this. Team Mindrisers",

His books have changed the entire learning journey of school level mathematics in Nepal. That even for decades. His name used to be in every student's tongue. I am no genius in mathematics but I use it in my daily work (ML stuff) and if I have to give some credits for my skills in applying math, I can give his name. And you know what was it like back then when he started writing first book? There was literally no internet, he collected past question papers and had from like 2065. And he even categorized questions, contents based on level like basic, intermediate, advanced and so on. And he even used to add the most prominent mathematician in each chapter. That I even consider a some form of research. Not every research has to wear a PhD hat. So for me, I consider his contributions in mathematics to be highest in Nepal.   But I do not know what goes inside his head and now his fourth masters? This I find weird. May be he should have done PhD and finally become a correct Dr.?|||Stop the hate.

Why is it that other communities are literally filled with intellectual posts but here, we have people like you berating the work of others. You're getting downvoted for a reason. That's the general consensus.  \"What has he done to contribute for mathematics?\" His books are influential. He's an educator not a researcher. Probably a faculty at KU or some place.   That makes me curious. Are you \\*sponsoring\\* him to do research? \\*Why\\* does \\*he\\* have to contribute? Are you trying to prove he's inferior to you somehow? What's the bloody point.  Yashavant Kanetkar is a common name - his books are barely technical. But you'll find many many people who started out with his books. You can hate all you want; doesn't change a thing.  People pursue multiple degrees for many reasons. I plan on getting several. PhD isn't interesting to everybody. Literally anybody can publish papers. I've seen folks in PhD programs who've made me question the bar in Science.  If you think about it, you can do more contribution as an entrepreneur. Or by relocating to a remote village and educating kids. There's a book called 80000 hours that breaks this down. I'm sure it's free shipping. Look into it.  I care more about earning than the number of papers I publish. Or having a PhD to my name. I care more about what makes me happy. The last thing on my mind is what you'd think of it. Or what you think my contribution to X is. Grow up. Literally.|||Bro collecting degree like  he collecting magikarp in pokemon!|||How many degrees you got? 37?|||bro yo budo ko math 11 12 9 10 tira guide math ko ani bachelors tira ni cha   khatra budo ho hau|||And op here struggling with SEE.|||Made math easier to understand for the growing mind so that they dont post ragebait in reddit like this.

            "body": "I’ve been thinking about this for a while. It feels like in Nepal, we have tons of programmers and tech talent, people who can build apps, websites, AI stuff, you name it. But when it comes to GTM, growth, marketing, or just figuring out how to actually sell and scale a product… there’s a huge gap.  Most startups here are run by tech engineers, and naturally, the focus is on building the product perfectly. That’s great, but then things like growth strategy, customer acquisition, positioning, and distribution get ignored. People just assume if you build it, users will come. Spoiler: they don’t.  Most of the startups here in Nepal fail less because the product is bad, but instead because the distribution/game-plan is weak.   Here in Nepal, GTM skills aren’t really taught, nor are they considered “cool” compared to coding. Most people in IT industrychase programming jobs, freelancing gigs, or outsourcing contracts because that’s a safer bet financially.  I think this is actually a huge opportunity. Someone who can master GTM skis here like: user research, acquisition channels, funnel optimization, sales psychology could easily dominate the startup scene.   Instead of just learning yet another JS framework, you should also learn GTM skills.   What do you guys think?",

I will add if I remember any others later.  \\- Lightweight Inventory, CRM, ROI, Campaign, Finance tracking setup using google sheets/app scripts for my non-tech side hustle which can be used easily in real-time by multiple users. It features algorithm to suggest product prices, auto sorting, stock filters, auto sum and so on.  \\- PS5, Ubuntu, Android, Windows, IMDB data one tap cumulative sync/backup to a external drive using freefilesync and other tools which I run every 3 months. Retains changed files into seperate Versioned folder upto 3 years.  \\- Phone pictures one tap sync with deletions to google drive which then can directly mounted to windows/ubuntu as a drive and used for any uploads straight away.  \\- Acer laptop had kernel level issue on ubuntu with earphones input/output so reported it in launchpad and helped the devs to test out potential fix for months using custom kernels. At last a real fix was found and now it's launched as part of recent kernel update. Real proud of this one.  \\- Not sure this counts but I block every useless repetitive notifications for all apps on my phone unless it's a direct message. With this I get notifications only if someone wants to reach me directly. This helps with digital minimalism and to focus when needed.

The islamic countries here in Asia are being sponsored by various other countries to spread violence. The islamic crowd needs to understand that they are not made for religion, religion is made for them. Religion is for your inner peace and it does not need anything from the people. Executing people just because they said something against religion is not acceptable.

In the protest you guys killed and the burned the politician and beated them on road to death. You guys destroyed public property and also the government property made by your own tax money. Stealing from malls and local shops,  those who were stealing they were all educated people, you guys are corrupt yourself and what better can we expect from government. I saw videos of Indian youths crying in pokhara for help when some group of protesters came to beat them because they were indians. Now I guess after doing all this Nepal will surpass india and germany, china, japan etc right? A politicians wife was burnt alive in her house and she died while going to the hospital.

But the irony of the protesters is hilarious.|||It's not muslims the problem but the hanafi, wahabism and Deubandi school of thought which makes them radical. Look at Indonesia it follows Sufism mixed with agakhani sect do we hear minorities being treated badly? No. Mostly it's the south Asian Muslims who are radical because they follow a very strict islam of deubandi and wahabism school of thought which has caused problem historically it's moderate example would be creation of Taliban and extreme example is creation of Pakztan. Now contrary to that you've Indonesia which is also a majority Muslim nation but follows Sufism school of thought which is why they are much more liberal. They're okay with currency having Ganesha, okay with garuda being national symbol(coat of arms), and even okay with naming kids from Sanskrit derived names like majority of their head of the states have Sanskrit origin names there will be some ups and downs in writing because Indonesia didn't follow devanagari it followed the Brahmi script earlier, in that way it's still preserving the culture. But if you tell this to a MUSLIM.from south Asia he will say it's shirk/haram in islam and that being associated with polytheism is bad and that they are a lost tribe of Turks and Arabs who had invaded our land. So, wahabism and Deubandi unless remained will not allow for inclusivity among the people islam factor will be there no matter what|||Can't decide which is the worst religion - Islam or Hinduism.

That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.  Growing up in Nepal, almost all TV channels were in Hindi. Indian serials and movies basically forced Hindi onto us. Now I’m choosing to learn Newari and other Nepali ethnic languages instead. I want to promote my own culture, not get mistaken as part of another country.  I don’t want foreigners thinking Nepal = India just because we speak Hindi in movies or daily life.

I agree.|||First thing I do is I ask them if they can speak English. It will hurt their little ego and they’ll switch immediately.|||You do you and I'll do me, I guess.    I spoke Hindi with a bunch of Bangladeshi tourists, because I don't understand Bangla, they don't understand Nepali, and they were more comfortable with Hindi than English.    I spoke Hindi with some Indian tourists because they were more comfortable with it than with English.    I continued to speak in English with an Indian visiting Nepal when I and a friend were interacting with him. The thing was, he switched code. I understood him and could have communicated well in Hindi with him, but my friend doesn't really understand Hindi, so I had to keep it in a language everyone understood, and I just told him I am not very good in Hindi.    I would happily speak Nepali in places like Darjeeling, where they speak Nepali, because I am most comfortable in it, and I know most people there would be more than comfortable in that. I assume that it is a comfort thing for them as well.  They're just more comfortable with Hindi than English, and I am accommodating, and fluent enough in Hindi, to extend the courtesy of speaking in their language.    I have come across Indians who look down on Nepal and Nepalis, and unfortunately, that attitude is more common among Indians than it should've been. It is not a pleasant experience, I admit. But, I refrain from putting all of them in a single box. I've met some wonderful Indians as well.   What I have to say is, we are individuals first, I, you, and anyone else, regardless of our nationality, or the languages we speak. Treat each individual on their merit, not their national identity. In fact, the shittiest person I've ever met is a fellow Nepali, and for obvious reasons—I live in Nepal.   The people who treated you bad were shitty people. The same attitude could very well be found in an Englishman, a Frenchman, or even a Nepali. That doesn't mean every Nepali, or Englishman, or Frenchman, is like that.    We are individuals first, in our lived experiences, not just a nationality, and in essence, expressions of existence, far greater than just a nationality. Treat people for who they are in that moment, not a label attached to them.    This is exactly the kind of subtle hate and/or prejudice I am against, whether it is based on lived experiences or influenced by rhetoric.   Use all the languages you know, as much as possible, I say. It is much better to open one's horizons than be insular. And no, I am not just a Nepali. My nationality is just one aspect of who I am, one which is more happenstance than chosen and curated with careful thought. So is yours, if you are actually willing to see it, along with anyone else's. |||I am in Dubai and I speak fluent hindi except for friends if someone asks I just say I understand but can’t speak.

Vanxan, hami haru Indian ko vasa sikxau, gore le ni Indian vanxa, I'll start to learn newari. Thanks OP.|||Language is a powerful tool. I’m here in the US and I speak Spanish with folks who speak Spanish and obviously when there is a language barrier people will banter by saying things that can feel personal. Even greetings come down to culture like cunado (sala) in Nepali.  Most of our generation I am 27 years old watches anime Korean series and picks up words the same way we grew up with Hindi serials. It’s not about speaking Hindi being inappropriate but about the mindset and stigma attached to it. While speaking Japanese Spanish Korean Chinese or French gives you brownie points Hindi often doesn’t and that’s a failure in how Indian people and Hindi have been framed.  I relate to your concern and I have seen firsthand what you’re saying where it can make someone feel inferior and I believe that comes from perception not the language itself.  I say use language in your favor when you can. Draw your boundaries when needed and if something feels insulting say it clearly in English and they usually won’t repeat it. This applies to all languages.  Cheers!|||100%, i live in Canada and I have faced these situations too much. I don’t speak hindi anymore. These people see me brown and come up to me speaking hindi.

You can speak Hindi and still set boundaries if they treat you like shit. I don't see why speaking any other language will make you inferior. I did my Bachelors in India and never had a problem putting people in their places in their own language. I think uneducated illiterate and entitled people are everywhere including India and Nepal, I have had similar experiences with different ethnic communities within Nepal. I actually have problems speaking to Nepali people in Australia as they'll cross every boundary and think I'm liable for them just because we're from the same country.. Its a regional issue.  I watched a interview of Sonam Wangchuk in Nepal and he speaks Nepali throughout the interview. I think as reasonable people we should use whatever language we want depending on the circumstances. Having Hindi in our language arsenal is honestly a superpower as we get access to soo much resources and forms of art that otherwise we wouldn't have been exposed to and as someone from Nepal where we already have a lack of such resources, I'd be sad if I hadn't known Hindi.  So, maybe lets practice putting people in their places if they behave rudely to us and not blame the language. I have many friends from India who I am very close with and many that I had to tell them to show their entitlement elsewhere. It can be the same with English very soon with sentiments of immigration shifting alot and will be with Nepali within Nepal as well. So yea.. lets just enrich our lives with our knowledge of the language.|||i feel good that i never talked in hindi with anyone here.

I used to directly reply to them that I do know a little but I prefer not to because there’s no reason to and want to make my English speaking skills better.|||Bro, most Indians do not care about Nepal particularly in their day to day life. They are too busy with their own lives and the immediate world around them to specifically think anything about Nepal. India is a country of 1.3 billion people. And even in India, many people don't speak Hindi. Yeah, many in older generation are more racist, but they are racist to each other too. Many people fight over language in different Indian states, and discriminate with people of different states. But as I said, there are 1.3 billion people and a large majority will be as friendly to Nepali people. No, they don't think of Nepal as their little bro, but if asked, would actually hold some affinity towards Nepal in comparison to what they think of other nations.  Feel free to learn Hindi, feel free to forget, it's every one's personal choice. I honestly almost never need to learn it, but I like Nepali songs so much that I'm picking up on Nepali words now. (Kasari Bhanu, Bardali, Sarangi, Timi ra ma are among my favourite)  Lastly, this sub is quite Anti Indian, just saying,  generalizing India and Indians is ridiculous as the population is much more than most people can think of. And bad will always be highlighted more than good.|||It's not just Nepalis. North Indians act like this towards south Indians too.

I openly say that I understand it but don’t speak it, and I’ve never been treated like garbage because of that. I’m guessing you’re a man, because Nepalese men constantly put themselves in an inferior position, always with the “bhai, bhai” nonsense. That alone tells people how to treat you. I’m a 22-year-old woman in Canada, and there are two other Nepalese girls where I work. We carry ourselves with confidence. Our Indian manager can’t talk down to us, and neither can any coworker. But the Nepalese guys? They’re always talked down to like kids. They’re 27 and 28 years old and still get called “sala Nepali.” That never happens to us and it’s not a coincidence. We have more filipino co workers than Indians but they always hangout with Indians and say sh like , “ chalo bhai daru pitey hai aj “ in worse hindi accent possible.  This has nothing to do with language. It’s about presence. It’s about how you carry yourself. When you look unsure, dress badly, and act small, people treat you that way. Respect isn’t begged for , it’s taken.|||Guys why so much hatred for India..

It had been a month since she's been taking home tuition from this one teacher. He comes to her house and teaches her. Usko chai aahiley renovation chali rako cha ghar ma so me being the nice bf that I am, told her she could come over to my house and ask the teacher to come there to teach. I would be all day in my classes as well so disturb ni hunthena(she has morning classes I have day classes)  So for few hours a day, she was getting tuition from the teacher in my room. Or so I thought. Ekdin chai mero classes haru chito sakkiyo and I went home about an hour early. Room jada it was locked from the inside so I thought bahira bata noise aayera room lock gareko hola bhanera. Tei ni I got curious and went around the window to see what was going on.  My gf was on her my bed with her teacher cuddling inside the blankets and what not like wtfff bhaira ma ta. I couldn't believe my eyes I thought I was having a nightmare. I got really furious, told her to open the door and we had a huge fight I was really heartbroken. Riss ma aayera I threw the damn blankets, comforter, duvet, even the rug. Ghar bata sabai faldiye and told them to leave.  So can you guys please tell me where can I get some good rugs and comforters in Nepal? Its winter and I cant sleep without the blankets yk. Especially Im looking for a warm fluffy white/creamy type of rug tyo fur wala. Online shops testo kei cause im not from valley. Help guyss!!",

You are the biggest fucking cuck Nepal has ever produced, bar none.  You literally heard “ghar renovate bhairacha” and your smooth brain went: “Aww baby, aaile mero room ma aaija na, teacher lai ni bolau, ma ta class ma hunchu, disturb pani hudaina.” Bro you didn’t just hand over your room, you handed over your entire bed for their afternoon fuck-session like a 5-star hotel receptionist. You set the mood, locked the door from outside and paid the electricity bill while that randi was getting railed on your own pillow.  You’re not a “nice boyfriend”, you’re a walking doormat with Wi-Fi. The moment she said “home tuition” alarm bells should’ve rung, but no, timi ta “disturb nahos” bhanera uniharulai honeymoon suite diyau. Teacher le timro girlfriend ko “syllabus” cover gardai thiyo ani timi bahira “nice guy” badge polish gardai basyo.  You came home early and still had to play detective like some Bollywood hero, peeking through the window because your own room was locked from inside. Bro even Nepali serials don’t have this level of chutiya plot.  And the cherry on top? You threw the blankets and rugs instead of throwing hands. Blanket jalaunu parne thiyo, timi chai “winter aaucha, kasari sutne” bhanera Daraz ma fluffy white rug khojdai chau. Bro your girlfriend got piped on your bed and your biggest concern is staying warm?? Priority thik cha baba.  You didn’t just get cheated on, you got professionally scammed by a third-class tutor and a third-rate girlfriend. Block her, delete everything burn the mattress and never ever say “disturb nahos” to a girl again.  You’re not heartbroken, you’re brain-dead. Wake the fuck up king, your crown’s on fire and you’re still asking for new rugs. 😂😂😂|||Japa hari ram lai Maya jaal ma nabhula|||Bhina bhina k padhnu parxa go to jamal bajar teha pauxa babbal blankets|||7/10 rage bait.

What is wrong is wrong, I dunno what the procedure for BSF to enter each other countries is, with the open border and all, but I'm sure they are only able to enter after some permission from each other's authorities. If that is not the case here, then it's wrong and us Indians should accept that. 3. Nepal is a beautiful country. People have more civic sense and overall better sense of community and cohesion from what I have seen.  4. What Nepali people have to understand is India is a big country 1.4 billion people is a lot. So, of all the counties in the world, India is probably the only one you should never generalize. 6. Both Nepali and Indian people can have good relationship with each other, just learn to talk properly and not take things to ego. 6. Yes, India is a bigger economy, and has more resources, but it is not in competition with Nepal. Nepal has it's own strengths that it should not forget.  7. Open border has it's pros and cons. Yes, many Nepali are in India, do they get to build a life, yes. Do they get discriminated, yes, and so are Indians from other states. And Nepali also discriminate against Indian tourists and workers. 8. Always remember, most average Indians will probably only have good will towards Nepal and no hate.  9. It is very important that rather than spreading unnecessary generalized hate, we judge people on individual basis. Hate the bad ones and respect the good ones, be it any human from any demographic.|||BSF is for Bang-la-desh border and not ours|||Indian sub ma haldeu spamm|||ani mug wonder why we hate them|||Where is this actually?|||And fuckin Indians will be proud of this|||Ssb|||[ Removed by Reddit ]|||haina hola|||It might sting but it's the truth.

            "body": "Namaste everyone,  I want to share an incident that happened to me in the last two weeks here in Germany.  My name is … Khadka, and I’ve been doing an Ausbildung at a Hofladen for the past 7 months. My chef treats me really well, like family.  Last week, I was at an Indian roadside café with my sister and some German friends, waiting for my chef to pick me up before visiting the Weihnachtsmarkt. We were waiting , suddenly two indian boys came to us and we had a short conversation . They were annoying so we started ignoring but they soon started making disrespectful comments like calling me MOMO and then mocking Nepal, our size, economy, and poverty. I didn’t respond with racism, though the conversation got heated.  Coincidentally, my chef was nearby, noticed something was wrong, and later asked if I was okay. I explained everything to him. He took it seriously and suggested legal action.  With the help of my chef’s lawyer, a legal letter was sent demanding an apology and €270 from the men. After a few days, they agreed to pay the money and apologized so the case would not go further.  Fun Fact : I and my sister literally eat MOMO after getting that 270 euro 😭😆  So reason of writing this post was just to sharing the possibility of what wrong can happened and how to handle this things.  Edit : For OC (https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204052999996390/permalink/2475725379495816/?mibextid=rS40aB7S9Ucbxw6v)",

No doubt we live in social media bubble and think that people will overwhelming vote UML and maoists out, but if you go to the rural areas(and I have), you see that they still have strong roots there. This is further emboldened by the recent strong statements UML has put out.  The old parties have their base established, and the more the new parties run for election, the more they dilute their own votes. Furthermore, they aren't organized yet to be a major national party and to compete in 165 different constituencies .

            "heading": "Went to India recently and it was immensely traumatizing",
            "body": "So I (27M) went to India for the first time. I was traveling solo turns out it was a bad idea. It was for work related events. After the event, I decided to explore a few places.   Until the work event, everything was fine. It was great learning and networking in the event. I actually speak Hindi very fluently so communication wasn’t an issue at all. After the event, I wanted to travel and explore.   I had booked a pretty average room for my accommodation. Nothing fancy, just the most budget friendly one I could find. There were a couple of people in the lobby and they greeted me nicely and asked for my ID. I showed them my passport and their faces instantly changed after seeing my Nepali passport. The guy said oh you’re from Nepal. I said yes and the another man said, this doesn’t work, we need to see an Indian ID. They weren’t smiling anymore and were giving me very skeptical looks. I tried not to overthink it. He kept insisting for an Indian ID and I explained to him that I am not from India, it’s my first time here so it’s not possible for me to have an Indian ID. Then they asked me for my contact number and I gave my phone number (didn’t have Indian number). Once again, they kept on asking for an Indian number. I was really surprised seeing their hospitality instantly changed after learning about my identity. Not sure if they did that because I was a foreigner to them or because I was specifically a Nepali guy.   While I was exploring the local market, I went to buy some souvenirs. One shop guy asked me where I was from and I said Nepal. He then started lecturing me saying don’t be close with China. They will do the same to you what Pakistan is doing to us. He kept yapping about how Nepal is a small part of India and that we should be grateful that we have a “bada bhai” like India. I left the shop without saying anything.    I wanted to travel by train but had absolutely zero idea about it. The people weren’t helpful there either. I was asking the various staff in the train station saying I wanna go here where can I find a ticket. They just vaguely pointed go there, it’s over there. Finally one guy at the ticket counter helped me get tickets after nearly couple of hours of running frantically here and there. I told him I’m not from India, traveling by train for the first time. The counter guy gave me a ticket saying this is for general class, it’s not safe to travel there..very crowded and chaotic, after your train arrives, meet the ticket guy and ask him to upgrade to AC compartment. I thanked him and went to the platform. There was a police officer whom I asked about upgrading the ticket. He too said the same thing i.e. meet the ticket guy once your train arrives and he will help you.   I still had about 3-4 hours before my train arrived. I just stayed in the platform watching movie. After the train arrived, I was frantically searching for the ticket guy. One police officer came near me charging with his baton. I was shit scared. He almost charged me saying why are you in the AC compartment with a general ticket in your hand. I was literally shaking at this point and with a shaky voice, I explained him my situation. He said haven’t you been in a train before where are you from. I said I’m from Nepal and he laughed saying oh you guys don’t even have trains there haha. Are you really from Nepal, your eyes don’t look like Nepalese. (I think he was referring to Mongolian eyes). I saw the ticket guy and went to him. He said me go to this seat and I’ll come. Later, he came to me and upgraded my ticket. The journey was a little over an hour long. And I was constantly replaying the entire experience from the hotel to the local market to the train station police guy.    Not sure if I just happened to meet all the wrong people or that everyone is the same there. Either way, I’m not going back to India for a long time. And I haven’t even mentioned the kids constantly following you begging for money, the dirt and litter everywhere, people peeing and even pooping in the open, unnecessary horns, air pollution.

Which cities did you visit, by the way? and as far as I know, many hotels in India especially smaller ones usually avoid foreigners because of paperwork and FRRO/police registration requirements. It’s better to stay at big hotels or resorts while traveling. I personally mostly stay at resorts, especially Club Mahindra ones they’re quite good, with solid service.  Also, try to do everything online in India train bookings, hotels, cabs. That way you’re much less likely to get scammed or harsh treated. Offline train ticket booking is honestly very hectic, even for Indians, so always book train tickets online. Use the official IRCTC website or authorized partners like MakeMyTrip, ConfirmTkt, or Paytm then you won’t face these problems.  And if you remember the time, location, duration, or the office name, you can also register a complaint on the Rail Madad portal or app. Lastly, there’s a huge generation gap in India you’ll mostly hear such racist things from older people or those in the 30–40 age group, but the younger generation is usually nicer and more helpful .You can even see this generation gap while speaking English. If you start speaking English in front of older people, they often treat you like some different person almost a ‘raja sahab’ type. But with the younger generation, it usually doesn’t make much of a difference. Anyway, I hope your journey was safe.|||Mods, how much racial abuse is tolerated here?

Here are a few from my side:  1. Does RSP view kulman's party as a threat to their voter base as there seems to be a significant overlap between RSP and Kulman’s supporters. Are there any discussions or considerations about forming a coalition with them or other emerging political forces? 2. Sumana leaving brought a lot of negative light on RSP, her exit made it seem like the party was becoming more of a “Rabi supporters’ club.” Has her departure brought any internal changes within the party, or has everything remained largely the same? 3. If an opportunity arises  where you can form a coalition government together with one of the old parties are you willing to take it, for example if UML and RSP together have the numbers to form a government, would you take that opportunity? Or would the party prefer to stay in opposition rather than partner with any of the traditional major parties?

In this context, what does RSP feels about new alternative forces that have emerged after the gen z Andolan? Do you see them as a threat since they too will be contesting for the same voter base? Any internal discussions going on to work with them?  I think a good percentage of people are confused and unsure about where RSP stands on many burning issues in Nepal which has pushed Nepal into instability time and again. I’m sure you know what I’m talking about. RSP seems to tip toe around those issues and avoid discussing it overtly.   Could we see RSP take a vocal stand on those issues and make their ideological stance clear before this election? Perhaps this would help RSP clarify its position to unsure but potential voters, and strengthen its presence in villages, small towns and far districts.|||Do you think the current FPTP voting system should be replaced by Instant-runoff / Alternative voting?

I get it Rabi ko party ho but when I/we voted to RSP, it wasn’t because of Rabi but rather the young people like Sumana, Toshima, Ganesh, Sobita who joined Rabi.   Swarnim Wagle isn’t the face of alternative politics. He went to media and started saying shit about Kulman when Kulman has just stayed silent about RSP-Kulman merger. What is that if not a media trial? He is just a sad Congress member who couldn’t get ticket due to bhauju so jumped ship to RSP. Why does he get more say in RSP ko internal matters than other young faces?  So my question again - why is RSP so Rabi centric? Why should we vote for RSP when the whole party philosophy revolves around Rabi? And when Rabi retires, there’s basically no one to lead because the party has been so focused on Rabi and doing media trial against other young leaders.|||What is RSP stance in privatizing Nepal Oil Corporation, Nepal Airlines, and other state owned companies?

Why not make Kulman Ghising as face of RSP and future PM.|||Why did you go in alliance with CPN-Maoist(formerly), if we look at politicians with big ambitions like Pierre Pollierrve(Canadian LoP currrently), the far-right of germany, the far right of France, all of them have chosen to not form an alliance with the one whom they claim they're fighting against. For example, Pierre Pollierve despite my hatred for him I can agree that he trruly opposed the policies and was there for a change which is why respecting the mandate in previous elections he chose not to form a gov despite having an opportunity to come in power via alliance with NDP, and Qubec. Why did you not stick with the principles and chose an alliance with the two heads whom Nepalese hate?  Second question, what's your party ideology, is it left wing or right wing? Based on following factors;Economics, Culture.  Third Question, the census data reveals that there's been 100% increase in the number of Christian population which clearly shows that our demographics is being destroyed, in the vietnam the missionaries have been converting the indegenous people to have a claim over the land, similar thing has happened with the Naga community of India, so its likely that Kiranti people are next, what will you do to stop this manipulative conversion, if you were in position of power?

I have some critical questions. I would be more than happy if Rabi reads these as well.  1.Why aren't you popular? ..at least upto your actual work?  Why are you guys in the shade while there's only talk of Rabi , Gagan, prasai , balen , sumana in the town. Your name is only taken collectively as \"a raswopa neta\". What are your biggest works and achievements as a member of parliament and rsp central member?  2.Why 45 lakhs signature for Rabi but 8.2 lakhs only voter id? Why can't I say that rsp prioritized a personality cult over connecting to new voters. Why is this not a catastrophic failure? Why did you guys fail to pressurize gov and commission to enable diaspora voting and even voter id registration from abroad. Nid was enabled for a brief period of time only. How can you guys exercise democracy with that slow and buggy registration process and 25 lakhs eligible citizens still unregistered?  3.Why is RSP scared to run elections independently on their own?Any plans to help gagan thapa win again?  4.Why is RSP vulnerable to propaganda by gagan thapa IT cell and 12 bhai fake news?  5.Why is rsp's communication and convincing skills so poor ? Couldn't onboard prominent figures and even chase Sumana away, how will you guarantee this doesn't deter similar newcomers again? I know it's important but is it that only the loyalist shall survive in rsp?   6. How many seats is the bibeksheel party contributing to the rsp in the upcoming election? Any projections? Or is it just a symbol?  7.Why is RSP not popular among genz , heavy backslash to Rabi and rsp being labeled as the same old parties, it being too person centric? Why do genz and youngsters hate political parties? What has rsp done and doing to make rsp popular among youngsters? Why is it so lost?   8.Why is RSP activities limited to Kathmandu valley and Chitwan only? I saw rsp doing some program recently AGAIN in chitwan instead of some new place. By being such limited to two districts how are you gonna secure the majority of seats across the country? Why are you preventing RSP from becoming big? We had hopes and still have some. Who's deciding all these?   9. Who's the youths face in rsp ? And how are they representing us? Where?   10. Why does RSP lack someone who's clear about his stance like what Mahesh basnet is for uml? Who's the spokesperson and why is he/she operating in a clinical and limited periphery.   11. Rabi Lamichhane publicly in a speech told that he lost many seats in 2079 election because he wasted his time trying to onboard popular faces instead of fostering new leadership and win more seats, but you guys seem to entertain this notion of onboarding popular faces more , forgetting the fact that you yourself aren't there due to popularity background. Why? Why can't you do something on your own rather than over-depending upon kulman or balen? I mean if you can't onboard them why waste an excessive amount of energy for that? Why such a weak mindset?  RSP central committee representatives feels incomplete and still need to cater many audiences, why don't you onboard brilliant and sharpest minds rather than just someone based on popularity or old connections? |||What are the things that you've done for Nepal?|||RSP stands for Rabi Swatantra Party?|||Remindme! 1 day|||Whats the ideology of rsp|||Hello Ganesh Nepal should enforce proper marital laws, including legally recognized prenups.

Mahesh bhatt father of alia bhatt. |||Extreme religious ideology is worse no matter if it is Hindu, Muslim or Christian, \"Hindu Terrorism\" or \"Christian Terrorism\" barely makes into media as it drags out least amount of attention and media don't make money out of that.   For example: Yesterday Bihar ma euta Muslim lai mob milera kaan kateko [https://thewire.in/communalism/muslim-man-lynched-by-mob-in-bihar-succumbs-to-injuries](https://thewire.in/communalism/muslim-man-lynched-by-mob-in-bihar-succumbs-to-injuries)  America ko Brown Uni Shooting.

Obviously no, tara if muslim man said \"Allah Hu Akhbar\" there will be tons of news on that.  Even recent Australian incident for example, Indian/ Aus Media were so quick to label the guy as Pakistani but turns out father was Indian and son was Australian.  I do agree that majority of attacks extreme muslim ideology le garda bhako cha, with that being said Australia ko last major incident ko hero has always been Muslim (Last year Bondi Stabbing culprit was White guy and Pakistani guy saved lot of people)|||Correct me if I am wrong but I heard muslims believes killing non Muslims will grant them heaven and 72 virgins..

There are always extremists in every religion. Hindu, muslim, christian doesnt matter. If you just look at statistics plenty of school shootings/ assassinations done by primarily christians, is it their religion? robberies done by African Americans so all of them are bad? There’s been plenty of cases of violence/ massacres of muslims all over india and vice vera in Pakistan. Does that make you an extremist since there are Hindus that have massacred people? Would you be okay with an innocent from being killed? Educate yourself and don’t live in an echo chamber.|||Why is that all of these extremist Muslims have some Pak-is-tan connections? And Indonesian muslims have Hindu/Sanskrit names which south Asian muslims will say it's haram, narak mein jaayega tuuh and all the bad names when someone keen attempts such?  I wonder why 🤔|||Why is everyone so racist... It genuinely makes me sad that the nepali sub reddit just hates so easily.|||Is your internet slow?   A guy who saved many people in that attack was also muslim.|||Because, the media hates them.

Humanity is one. it is not muslims that are responsible, it is not hindus that are responsible, it is not jews that are responsible, it is not christians that are responsible. terrorists are responsible.  End of discussion.|||Low iq post.|||It's called Taqiyyah|||Ok, now find out how many deaths due to gun violences (just this year) were caused by American christians and then maybe we’ll realize it’s not the fault of a religion. Yes, there has been radicalization of a lot of Muslims (and white christians in recent years), but if we start just hating them without systematic education and de-radicalization of religious groups with legal solutions (eg: integration training, community activities, de-radicalization syllabus in schools, etc.) we’ll lose lives whilst being stuck in a blame game.|||Please don't make Nepal the next India with all this hatred guys.

            "body": "Got forced into an arranged marriage, husband is shyer than a scared kitten, and now we’re 8 months deep with zero conversations lmao.  So after my +2, my family started going full \"bihe gar, bihe gar\" mode. Every morning felt like a marriage proposal interview. I kept saying I wanted to study bachelor’s first, but nobody took me seriously. Typical Nepali parent combo attack.  Then one day, boom they tell me, “We found a good boy.” I hadn't even seen his face; they were like, “Ramro chhora ho.” Girl, I didn’t even know his name.  Fast-forward to the wedding day: Whole gaun dancing, kids running everywhere, DJ blasting Sani Nani. Everyone vibing except me, the bride, who’s just like “ what is happening.”  I finally saw my husband at mandap and yeah, he looked decent but BRO DIDN’T EVEN LOOK at me properly. I swear he stared at the floor more than my face.  Then suhagraat… I was in the room crying like an idiot because I was stressed and scared. But instead of comforting me, man walked in, looked shocked like he saw a ghost, and LEFT. NO WORDS. ZERO. ZILCH.  For the next few days, our communication level = Bluetooth off.  After that, he escaped to KTM faster than a last bench student during assembly. I thought maybe he’d text? Call? Smoke signal? ANYTHING? Nope. Silence.  Dashain time comes, he returns home. I tried walking near him; man literally walked behind us like we're bodyguards. Even then, no talking. I don’t think he even knew my name until his mom spilled it   And the chocolate incident… His sister gave me a packet, so I ate it (obviously). Later I found out it was for gifting the village kids. Bro looked at me like I ate their future   Months passed. Not a single conversation. I started avoiding him too because at this point it's just awkward both sides.  Then post-Dashain, he shows up at my maita to take me back. Whole family treating him like king jwai. He looked scared of the respect   My little sister tagged along with us, thank god, because otherwise we’d walk one hour in complete silence. My man STILL didn’t talk directly to me. He literally whispered to my sister, “Ask what didi wants to eat.” SIR??? HELLO??? I CAN HEAR YOU???  8 months married. 0 conversations. 0 eye contact. 0 progress.  We communicate through: • my sister • awkward glances • chowmein orders • pure telepathy failure  Anyway, idk what this relationship is but at this point we’re basically two NPCs living separately but married by system default 😭",

I thought I had at least 5–7 years to mentally prepare… apparently not.  One random Tuesday, Ama goes, “Babu, we found a girl for you.” I nearly dropped my phone. Girl? For ME? Why?  I saw one tiny photo of you for 0.3 seconds before my dad covered it like it was a government secret. I was like, “Wait— but— who—?” Too late. Wedding prep started.  Wedding Day  Everyone’s dancing, drinking, screaming, having the time of their lives. Meanwhile me = statue mode.  Then I saw you at the mandap.  My brain: “She’s… pretty.” Also my brain: “Don’t look. If you look she’ll know you exist.”  So yes, I stared at the floor like it owed me money. I was SO nervous I forgot how to blink.  Suhagraat  I walked into the room and saw you crying and my entire soul left my body.  I panicked so hard I thought I’d faint. My mind went: “What do I do?? Comfort??? Talk??? DIE???”  So I did the only thing my socially anxious caveman instincts allowed: I LEFT.  First Few Days  Every time I tried to say something, my throat said, “Haha no.” You looked as scared as I felt.  So… Bluetooth off.  Then I got sent to Kathmandu for work and honestly I was relieved because I had no idea how to function around you. I rehearsed texting you like 20 times but never sent anything. If silence was a sport, I was winning gold.  Dashain  I came home thinking, “Okay, this time I’ll talk.” Then I saw you.  Brain: buffering…  I wanted to walk next to you but I didn't want to be creepy or weird, so I walked behind. Like a bodyguard with performance issues.  Then the chocolate incident— I gave that packet to my sister to distribute to kids. When I saw you eating it I didn’t get mad— I got SCARED. Because I didn’t know if I should tell you or just pretend gifting chocolate to villagers was never my plan in life.  After Dashain  My parents forced me to go pick you up from your maita. I was SO nervous I practiced “Let’s go” in front of the mirror like 14 times.  Your family treated me like royalty and I had no idea how to respond except freeze.  Your little sister tagging along was the best thing ever because if it was just us two… That hour of walking would’ve sent me to the hospital.  I DID want to talk to you. Genuinely. But my voice refused to come out whenever I faced you directly.  That’s why I whispered through your sister. “Ask what didi wants to eat” = the bravest sentence I said that day.  Now  8 months married. I still haven’t had the courage to properly talk to you.  Not because I don’t like you— I actually really like you.  I’m just… Terrified. Awkward. Zero experience. And overwhelmed by the fact that I suddenly have a whole wife.  Every day I think: “Tomorrow, I’ll talk to her.” Then you walk into the room and my brain blue-screens.  So yes, we are two NPCs married by system auto-fill. But trust me— I’m trying.  My heart is ready. My mouth is not.|||Xya yesto lamo kasle padhxa ho|||Yeutai manxey le made up scenario post garira cha yo ta.

I don't know if you play games like Free Fire, PUBG, Royale, or something else. Ask yourself how you remembered all the gun names, location names, and the different things in them. How you remembered a whole 3-hour-long story you watched years ago? Treat these things the same way. Connect with them. Practice writing out the reaction yourself. Guess how they could pair up and react to give products. In the beginning, you will make mistakes, but slowly you will get used to it. Just know the reaction types: what acid-base rxns do, salts, catalysts, how oxidants and reductants work in any reaction. Try to understand these basics, and then you will not have to blindly learn rxns.|||On youtube watch pw lecture |||Old is gold ma vako haru pada yo sabb padna maile ta sakena yrr thett|||Haina ho sab Chinese letter dekhchu ta|||dont read all just read half the syllabus tara tyo half chai purai aunu paryo ......and u will pass|||Heri raakhnu parxa, kasto ma displacement, kasto ma substitution vanne crack vayesi sajilo hunxa|||I skipped the all organic portion but still got B+|||I didn't.

            "body": "My college head and a friendly botany teacher who has seen thousands of students always says just do enough to pass all subjects. Thats it. Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

NOC ko lagi matra ho. I can guarantee you: Nepal ma law padhera, +2 ma you can be a doctor in the US. Don't worry about that path.    Now, +2 ma business Ra Tesko paxi law, or vice versa. Again, it doesn't matter; a good argument is that you enjoy business, so you would've gotten something out of it, but sometimes life isn't linear.    If you want to study in the US, you need a bachelor's degree before a law degree(juris doctor or JD), so you can do your bachelor's in business. If you want to study in any other country, you could easily dual-major in business + law.    Don't worry!|||Bro same I'm studying law in grade 12 rn 11 ma huda ni law padhne bela ekdam josh thiyo but as time passed by I started hating it 12 ta omfg i can't imagine (Legal drafting/Civil and criminal law/Nepalese legal system) is gonna take my life too many things to note down.I think it's better to go abroad after+2 you can pursue law in another country rather than here.

            "body": "I'm currently looking at my options for a Bachelor's degree here in Nepal. I have a 3.0 GPA (science). I'm in a bit of a dilemma and would really appreciate some advice from this community: BBA vs. BBS? I'm leaning towards a management degree, but I'm unsure about the key differences between BBA and BBS programs in Nepal, especially regarding career prospects and curriculum rigor. Given my science background, which one might be a better fit?  Best Colleges near Lalitpur? Could anyone recommend the top-tier management colleges located near Lalitpur/Patan?  Am I too late for admissions? I just passed out in 2025. Have admission cycles already closed for this intake?  The Abroad Factor:  My primary reason for joining a local college immediately is to avoid a gap year, just in case my visa application for abroad studies gets rejected down the line. I want to have a safety net and continue my education smoothly. Any insights, recommendations for colleges, or general advice on navigating admissions timelines would be incredibly helpful right now.",
