These accounts have started using a smart strategy of defending both Balen and Rabi but with a twist. Their real motive is to defame them both using a simple trick.  What they do is support Rabi when the post is about Balen, which angers the Balen crowd and makes them go against Rabi. Then the same id supports Balen when the post is positive about Rabi, triggering anti Balen sentiment among Rabi supporters.  Balen, Sumana, Sagar Dhakal and others have no political party that is taking part in this election. Since the election is less than 6 months away and there is no alternate political organization that has reached the local level across Nepal, we should all support and vote for RSP and not fall for the propaganda spread by these old political parties against RSP.  Yes, there are some imperfection in RSP and we can discuss it after the election. If they dont listen we can vote for other next time. But this time we all should run a campaign supporting them as they are the only hope we have.  If RSP fails then the same old parties will win majority and form the government again.

This trek is well-organized, popular, and has good infrastructure, so you‚Äôll never feel completely alone on the trail. The route passes through welcoming villages like Ghandruk, Chhomrong, and Bamboo, where locals are friendly and used to hosting international travelers. You‚Äôll also get stunning mountain views of Machapuchare (Fishtail), Annapurna South, and Hiunchuli.  Autumn (September to November) is perfect because the weather is clear, the paths are busy but not overcrowded, and lodges are open with plenty of fellow trekkers around.  If you want help organizing your trek, finding reliable guides, or just need local advice, feel free to DM me. I‚Äôm from Nepal and happy to help you plan safely and confidently.|||For a solo female trekker, I‚Äôve found **Everest Base Camp (EBC)** and **Annapurna Base Camp (ABC)** really safe and manageable. Both trails are well-trodden, with plenty of teahouses, guides, and other trekkers around, so you‚Äôre never completely alone.  If you want a slightly quieter experience, **Gokyo Lakes** near EBC is amazing ‚Äî stunning views and fewer crowds than the main EBC route.  Just make sure to:  * Stay in teahouses or lodges along the trail * Keep your valuables safe * Have a local guide or join a small group for extra safety  The trails are very friendly to solo travelers, and you‚Äôll meet lots of fellow trekkers along the way.|||Is phoksundo Trekking not popuar these days?   me and my friend were planning to go there by the end of this month.|||For solo, ama yangri, mardi, ABC.

Are there specific things I should know about taxes and compliance? Should I only target certain types of companies that can handle these complications?

What do they mean?   22 seeders mean there are 22 people who have the complete torrent downloaded to their machines, and are sharing it.  144 leechers mean people who have partial torrent but not the complete torrent.  If you are downloading a torrent, you first become a leecher. If you download the complete torrent, and keep it active in your torrent client, then you become a seeder. If you only download partial torrent but keep sharing (seeding) what you have downloaded, then you will still be reported just as a leecher.   > Don't the people (servers) need to communicate to each other to send me the files for download, where does it take place? Doesn't it needs some sorts of coordination server?  There are torrent trackers, such as The Pirate Bay. Trackers normally don't host any content themselves, they will just have a listing of the content, and the tracker will track the seeders and leechers. So when you download a torrent file (or use a magnet link), the torrent file will have information on what content the torrent should have (the actual torrent content will be with seeders/leechers) as well as information on seeders/leechers.  > And if there is one, can't people who don't want their stuff illegally downloaded track those coordination servers?  It's not so easy. It's fairly easy to start your own torrent tracker. If you take out one torrent tracker, then many more would pop up to take its place. And the seeders/leechers would continue to have access to the files, they could just switch to another tracker.   There are also countries with cheap internet access and loose copyright laws who won't cooperate with US/EU, so many trackers are hosted on those countries.  > Also can I become seeder too if I want to put out something on pirate bay myself with my 16 GB RAM laoptop?   You don't need to upload to become a seeder, you just need a completed version of the torrent active on your torrent client.  You can upload torrents on various trackers, or even have your own tracker. There are many legitimate uses of torrents such as hosting Linux ISOs.  > And what do people who provide their own computing resources get for their efforts? Why do they do it?   It doesn't really take much computing resources other than disk space and bandwidth (CPU and RAM usage will be low on a decent torrent client).  Torrenting does require generous people who have the spirit of sharing. Without this, torrenting won't work.  There are also private torrent trackers which have seeding and ratio rules (you may need to seed each torrents for at least a minimum amount of time set by the tracker and/or maintain a good upload to download ratio, and there are generally incentives for seeding long term). Here you will have to follow the rules of seeding if you want to download. What this means is the files will be better seeded in private trackers, and the quality of files will be higher too.|||From my knowledge, Seeders are the providers who have the files installed on their system and they are distributing it in parts to the leechers that is you in this case.   And to be a seeder is not a heavy task, after finishing the download by taking bits one by one and arranging the file, the torrent itself starts to seed if the torrent client is open. I seed on my 4 gb ram laptop too. It's not done for profit, it's done cuz you wanna help others out cuz you also got helped by others. And use QBittorrent if not alr.|||Torrenting is just file sharing among people. The torrent file is not the movie,it is really like a map that shows where the pieces are located. Seeders have the full file and share it out. Leechers download but also share what they got. Your computer downloads small pieces from many people at the same time. It also shares the pieces you've already downloaded with others. No single server contains the file,trackers just help computers find one another. You may share your own files also by leaving your torrent running. People generally share to help others and keep torrents running. The more you share, the faster your downloads are.|||**Basically, if you've already downloaded the file or parts of the file, and have enabled seeding, other downloaders can request chunks of the file, and it will be sent from your computer to their computer. Hence termed peer-to-peer.**  **If you've enabled seeding, you're a seeder.**  **If you're just downloading without enabling seeding, you're a leecher.**  **There are communities dedicated to keeping popular torrents active for years, with server farms that keep seeding thousands of torrents 24/7. And some torrent creators seed it themselves with gigabytes per second speeds. Spreading the file throughout the network.**  Torrent files or magnet links just tell your client where to look; trackers(hosted somewhere) or DHT help it find other peers sharing that file. Trackers or DHT don‚Äôt host the actual file, just a list of connected peers and info about which chunks they have.  Once connected, it grabs tiny chunks from many at once and shares what it‚Äôs got back, pure decentralized magic.  See the graph highlighted in red?  https://preview.redd.it/kr31xb3u7xtf1.png?width=976&format=png&auto=webp&s=c84151228f898cc0e6eb3846e87737d6714745d0  The black lines are the chunks that you've already downloaded. As you can see, the chunks are requested in random order.  However, some applications like WebTorrent allow you to download the chunks in order, from beginning to end. Hence, it lets you stream the video without downloading the entire file. Possibly, [goku.sx](http://goku.sx) does this as well.  **That's why torrents are hard to counter.**  Because everyone who's downloaded the file can send it to the ones who request it.  **It's truly genius.**  And people usually **don‚Äôt get paid**. They seed because they want to **help others download faster** and keep torrents alive, like giving back to the community that helped them.  Some do it for **reputation on private trackers**, or just **because they enjoy being part of a swarm**.|||What it is: 1. p2p nai ho. 2. Decentralized vatekole files are divided into equal parts. Each part may be a small chunk of 2MB, 4MB, 8MB etc depending on configuration. 3. Example: 64MB filr would have 16 parts each of 4MB or, 8 parts each 8MB. 4. SEEDER = who hosts parts (seeds)source 5. LEECHER is who downloadeds(leeches) from source 6. For this to work, SEED (Part of File) must exist with ATLEAST one Seeder.  Gow it works: 1. When you do a torrent download, you are initially a Leecher Only. For all parts. 2. As soon as you download ANY part, you become a Seeder for that part. 3. Meaning, you are now a source for that part for someone on the network  4. If more people have the part that you want, and if they are nearby, your download of that part will be significantly faster. 5. If a single Seeder is serving some particular PART, the download of that part (Leeching) will be painfully slow. 6. Thankfully, many Leechers for that PART means someone downloading closest to that Seeder will complete the download faster, and they in-turn will become Seeder for that part. So, -1 Leecher +1 Seeder happens. This makes your download faster. You can download each part from 1 peer by default, but you also have the option to choose multiple peers for a PART. 7. If you leave the file as-is after the complete download. That file will continue being seeded. You will act as a peer with all parts. Essentially, making the download faster for everbody. 8. Downloads are not sequential by design, because UDN will grab whatever is available. But modern torrent clients have the option of concurrent download. You trade download speed with serial download of parts. Useful for things like streaming video (You can play video on VLC as it is downloading, that way!)|||Simply understand like,  seeders - those who have complete files  leechers - those who have incomplete files  In this case the new downloader also becomes leechers as it has incomplete files.   In Torrent the client who is downloading is also uploading at the same time to others that doesn't have incomplete files. Only when the file is completely downloaded the client becomes a seeder.   There is no server here. All leechers act on its own who wants which chunk of missing file and completes it from the easiest seeder or peecher.  Count that the more the seeder the better the download as multiple chunks of files can be taken from multiple seeders which may find the easiest.  For a file to be downloaded completely there needs to be atleast one seeder and none or any no. of leechers.  More the leechers means multiple clients has incomplete files. In this case each leechers acts selfish grasping incomplete file of its own from any leechers or seeders with the shortest or easiest available route or port.   Note that when there is only single seeder then leechers downloads from any other leachers which file is available but since the complete file is only one so the missing piece is only completed through that single seeder. As soon as the leecher completes its file it instantly becomes seeder.  Also there is role of port which can make complex for time being.|||lots of questions but i will try to answer them one by one!  Seeders are those who have the complete file. leachers are those who are still downloading the file and have parts of it.  Most  .torrent has a tracker url. its doesnot host the file but keeps the ip addresses of the people who have the file i.e seeder and leechers. when you start downloading you client qbittorrent ask for the file and the trackers replies with the ip addresses of the people who have it. and then you client directly connects you to the seeder (no server in between).  Yes ‚Äî trackers are public, and law enforcement or copyright agencies can (and do) monitor them. and join in the swarm and look for seeder or people who are downloading. That‚Äôs how copyright notices often originate by logging IPs seen sharing a particular movie or software.   you are saring the file as you are downloading(leacher). Once the download is complete you client automatically starts seeding it as long as you are kepping the application open, and everytime you open the application. in the case of seeding it does not take much bandwidth.  torrenting is bandwidth, I/O heavy not ram or cpu, You are not hosting the file Like a server you are just sharing it.  For the love of the game. if nobody shares it the torrent dies. most client forces their users to seed or do it on auto . some do it for the freedom. and sharing is caring.  No significant computing power is needed torrenting mostly uses bandwidth and disk I/O, not CPU or RAM.  Torrenting itself is completely legal  it‚Äôs just a peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol. What can be illegal is *what* you download or share. Distributing copyrighted material (like commercial movies, games, or software) without permission can violate copyright laws in many countries. In practice, enforcement often focuses on large uploaders or tracker sites rather than individual users. so you are safe.|||Basically, you are looking for a packet of parle G. Say, 10 people on this thread have a packet of parle G each. So we agree to share you a copy of our individual biscuit each. Some will give you 2 piece, some will give 5 etc untill you complete an entire packet worth of biscuits. Sharing a copy of your file is Seeding.  Getting said file from other sharing the same file is leeching.  Now, you asked for a friend to help you look for said parle g is the torrent file/sites  After you get your copy of file, just let it be on the torrent. Others who'd want it will then get connected to you and you will share a copy of your file with them.  Torrenting itself is not illegal, sharing copyrighted files is. (But who cares, most of us can't afford any useful softwares legally anyway :D)|||Just set your torrent client to run at startup & keep it running in the background to seed.

I feel confident enough that I will be able to make the frontend of any website. I have sort of realised learning front end only is also not enough and that I will now have to learn backend too. Can anyone with any experience suggest any path or course I can take online to learn backend (I think I should start with Node/Express/MongoDB ) also. I saw a few courses on Udemy but they seem to be outdated or they just make a project (which might not cover all topics).",

Why isn‚Äôt he speaking the truth or guiding the youth?   Why did he only talk about forming an interim government and dissolving the parliament when he knew people wanted a directly elected Prime Minister  and that it could have been his golden opportunity to lead Nepal into a new era?

These accounts have started using a smart strategy of defending both Balen and Rabi but with a twist. Their real motive is to defame them both using a simple trick.  What they do is support Rabi when the post is about Balen, which angers the Balen crowd and makes them go against Rabi. Then the same id supports Balen when the post is positive about Rabi, triggering anti Balen sentiment among Rabi supporters.  Balen, Sumana, Sagar Dhakal and others have no political party that is taking part in this election. Since the election is less than 6 months away and there is no alternate political organization that has reached the local level across Nepal, we should all support and vote for RSP and not fall for the propaganda spread by these old political parties against RSP.   Yes, there are some imperfection in RSP and we can discuss it after the election. If they dont listen we can vote for other next time. But this time we all should run a campaign supporting them as they are the only hope we have.  If RSP fails then the same old parties will win majority and form the government again. And we all know what happens after that.",

Because there was no one to guide me, i failed this year's neb board.   so from someone who learned from his own experience, my best advice is that you don't depend only on teachers from your school. there are tons of videos on youtube and tons of notes and  straight up answers in the internet.   if you do not understand and get anything at all, then only focus on the questions that are asked many times or repeated i.e only imp questions.   you have to make sure that you atleast passing marks, so look focus on the chapters you understand and master them first then only focus on others.   You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

I emailed ambition guru saying they have a security issue and a security researcher replied my email too. His name‚Äôs MANIK KOIRALA. He asked me what the issue was and I explained the whole situation but I didnt give him the process of accessing the course for free. I demanded some fee as bug bounty and infact he even said they will report the bug and talk about the bounty and as I was familiar with ambition guru, I trusted them and told them the whole process and after few days I emailed him again asking if they fixed it or not and what about my bounty and all but they did not reply at all. THEY GHOSTED ME WTF  ANI CRAZY THING I JUST CHECKED IF THE BUGS STILL THERE GUESS WHAT THEY FIXED IT AND I DID NOT GET MY BOUNTY!!  If I had not reported this they would have to face a use loss as everyone could access any course for free!!!   What should I do guys I need my bounty any how I mean if it was a huge bug??

To the people wanting to know what it is . Ambition guru gives a week trial , providing recorded video of lectures but there's a catch while other top educational institutions of Nepal and india give access to 2 3 units that too the basic ones only ambition guru knowingly or unknowingly provided the file with all recorded video with all notes and everything but they were not that good tbh it worked only as reference and to get some extra insights .  To this young innocent guy here , I too thought about reporting it and asking a bug bounty but I already knew I was not going to get any so I just opened my laptop and got an extension named M8UL downloader or something to download all those videos , ( why I downloaded an extension?? : cause institutions upload videos in small small chunks of file that play altogether to form a video , like you you download from other extension you will find files of 8sec 15sec more than 100 of such files will exist there and the extension I mentioned just compiles them all and let you download the full video ) .|||Hello u/Space_X_Offical, thank you for contributing to r/NepalPlusTwo.

But after some time, I dozed off; and during the bumpy road, I woke up a few times and noticed she had **fallen asleep on my shoulder**. I didn‚Äôt move because it felt kinda sweet that she was comfortable enough to do that.  I had to get off earlier since my village was nearer, but before that, I **showed her my Instagram ID**. I think she saw it, but she never sent a request.  If by some chance you‚Äôre reading this, please send me a request on Instagram.

            "body": "I need to vent about those cringe NPC-type people who just wannabe something they‚Äôre not, copying whatever they see on the internet like it‚Äôs their personality. You know the type those ‚Äúkhul mil‚Äù posers who act like they‚Äôre the coolest because they saw some TikTok edit or Instagram reel and think they‚Äôre experts. I HATE these people the most. They‚Äôll fake being into a popular series or movie just because it‚Äôs trending, but they‚Äôve only watched some half-baked TikTok explanation or a 15-second clip. No depth, no authenticity, just pure clout-chasing vibes. So, let me tell you about this one incident that had me HEATED. I was chilling at my mama‚Äôs ghar, and my 7th cousin or something (he‚Äôs like 3 years younger than me, so probably 18-ish) shows up for a visit or whatever. We‚Äôre just having a normal day, and I‚Äôm scrolling through Instagram reels. One of the reels pops up with a Breaking Bad scene, you know, the one where Jesse‚Äôs cooking meth with Badger, trying to mimic Walt‚Äôs technique. Iconic stuff. This cousin peeks over and goes, ‚ÄúYo, you watched Breaking Bad?‚Äù I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúHell yeah, it‚Äôs a absolute peak.‚Äù He asks who my favorite character is, and I say Jesse Pinkman because, duh, he‚Äôs the GOATand all that stuff. Then he hits me with, ‚ÄúOh, my favorite‚Äôs Gus Fring.‚Äù I‚Äôm thinking, ‚ÄúAight, typical Breaking Bad fan pick, Gus is a badass.‚Äù But then he starts yapping about his ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù scenes, and something‚Äôs off. Like, he‚Äôs only describing the most TikTok-edited scenes the ‚ÄúSay My Name‚Äù moment, the big Gus explosion, you know, the ones that are ALL OVER social media. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs reciting a highlight reel from Instagram, not talking about the actual show. So, I‚Äôm getting sus. I decide to test this dude. I hit him with, ‚ÄúIf Gus is your favorite, what‚Äôs the actor‚Äôs real name?‚Äù He freezes. Like, full-on deer-in-headlights hesitation. After a beat, he mumbles, ‚ÄúUh, Giancarlo Esposito.‚Äù Okay, fair, he got that right, probably from seeing it in a TikTok caption. So I push further: ‚ÄúCool, what other movies or series has Giancarlo Esposito been in, besides Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul?‚Äù awkard silence. Dude‚Äôs got NOTHING. He‚Äôs just staring at me, brain buffering like a 2003 dial-up modem. So I call him out: ‚ÄúBro, be real. Have you actually watched Breaking Bad, or are you just explaining TikTok edits?‚Äù After a super awkward pause, he admits it. ‚ÄúOkay, fine, I didn‚Äôt watch it. I just saw some explanations and edits on TikTok.‚Äù BOOM. Exposed. This dude was straight-up faking it, trying to seem cool by pretending he‚Äôs a Breaking Bad stan when he‚Äôs just a wannabe hopping on the hype train. I‚Äôm so done with these types of people. They see something trending, latch onto it, and act like they‚Äôre part of the culture without putting in the work. Like, bro, just watch the show! It‚Äôs not that hard! Has anyone else dealt with these fake NPC wannabes? Drop your stories below because I know I‚Äôm not alone in this.",

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. üò≠üò≠2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye üò≠|||3 brsa vo dashign namanako|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

This affectes every country in south Asia including Nepal. That's a problem we should solve. IT's gradually under control I guess.|||Google Bangladesh. And let me know if you found the answer|||Don‚Äôt look up bangladesh/australia. Nepal has average population density.|||Population in SE Asia seems to be quite high in general. I think regarding your question about where the population is concentrated, you will find that the population is scattered throughout the country - everywhere minus above 3000m up the himalayas. Then if you do a deep assessment what % of Perus Land actually has people vs % of Nepal where people reside, you may find the two land sizes may not be off by a magnitude like now when you compare the full size of the country. For eg UK has a landmass of 250k but has a population of 69 mil. That's 2x population of Peru in 1/5th of land. In the other hand australia has a population of 27mil in 7.7mil km2. Russia has 143mil people in 17mil km2 (4x Pop of Peru in 16x land area).  You are also looking at the mercader projection which further makes Nepal look more visually small in the map. Not that it should have any basis when you talk about numbers.   I suppose what I am trying to say is the population may still be high in Nepal but it may not be as high as you think when you factor in livable land in the country. Total land mass alone is not a great indicator.|||Fertile land, fertile people, most are on terai belt. Look at india and bangladesh, how densely populated they all are.

Most of the people are concentrated in the cities and in the low lands where theres lots of rivers and fertile land till 1990s people procreate and like crazy plus modern medicine less infant mortality and less knowledge of contraceptives. Also temperate climate.|||Time zones bro.|||Look at bangaldesh's area and population. You'll be shocked my guy|||The reported surface area of a country is always the 2D surface area. It calculated on a flat, two-dimensional plane, not by measuring the surface area of its mountains, hills, and valleys. The total land area of a country is determined by projecting its borders onto a standardized reference surface, typically an ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the Earth.      Nepal is roughly a \\~1000 km long, and 150 km wide and so the approximate area of 150 sq km.   Now if you count the mountains and valleys that covers like 70% of that 2D area, the actual habitable space is order of magnitide larger. maybe even 50x.   So the actual living space is quite a lot for mountainous country like Nepal. I would imagine same for Peru.|||You know about canada?|||You should have started with Bangladesh and it's population density.  Regardless, depends on how fertile and navigable the lands are.

It is all scams. All man made religion and cult.  There are 33 Crore hindu gods.  Lots of Gods are forgotten already.   There is no possible way to count the number of forgotten gods because by their very nature, they have been lost to history.  However, we can explore the scale and reasons for this \"divine forgetting\" to understand just how vast that number must be. Think of it not as a number, but as an ocean compared to the few droplets of water that are the gods we still remember.  Here‚Äôs a breakdown of where these forgotten gods come from and why the number is essentially infinite:  1. Gods of Lost Cultures and Civilizations  For every major ancient civilization we know about (Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Mesopotamian), there were dozens, if not hundreds, of smaller cultures, tribes, and city-states that were absorbed, destroyed, or simply died out.  ¬∑ Example: The Canaanite pantheon is largely forgotten except for figures who appear in the Bible as villains or rivals. Where are the worshippers of Ba'al, Anat, or El today? Their stories are fragmentary. ¬∑ Scale: Across the Americas, Africa, Asia, and prehistoric Europe, countless tribes with their own unique spirits, creator gods, and deities vanished without a written record. Each tribe might have had a dozen or more significant divine figures. The collective number from this category alone is staggering.  2. Hyper-Local and Niche Deities  The ancient world was filled with gods who had very specific, limited portfolios.  ¬∑ Examples:   ¬∑ Roman Numina: These were minor spirits of specific places‚Äîthe god of a particular stream, a particular forest, a particular crossroads, or even the god of your household's front door (Cardea) or the pantry (Penates).   ¬∑ Greek River Gods: Every major river had its own god, like Achelous or Scamander. How many minor streams and springs had gods whose names were forever lost? ¬∑ Scale: If every village, spring, hill, and family had its own protective spirit or deity, the total number across the globe throughout history is unimaginably large.  3. Gods Who Evolved or Were Absorbed  As cultures merged, many gods were fused with others or simply fell out of favour.  ¬∑ Example: The Egyptian god Amun was merged with the sun god Ra to become Amun-Ra. What if Ra had been the one to be forgotten instead? Many lesser gods were likely absorbed in this way, their original identities lost. ¬∑ Example: The Roman god Sylvanus was an ancient god of the woods largely overshadowed by more popular gods like Diana or Mars. Countless others like him simply faded from popular worship.  4. Gods of Abandoned Religions  Entire religious systems have disappeared, taking their entire pantheons with them.  ¬∑ Examples:   ¬∑ The Hittite Empire had a pantheon of thousands of gods, most of whom are now only names on clay tablets, understood by a handful of scholars.   ¬∑ The Manichaean religion, once a major world faith, is now extinct, and its complex cosmology of gods and divine beings is largely forgotten.   ¬∑ Pre-Christian Slavic, Celtic, and Baltic paganism are reconstructed from fragments and folklore. We know the names of a few major gods like Perun or Cernunnos, but the vast majority of their divine beings are unknown to us.  A Philosophical and Literary Perspective  The concept of forgotten gods is a powerful theme in modern fantasy and horror (most famously in H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos and Neil Gaiman's American Gods). These stories suggest that gods are sustained by belief, and when belief dies, the gods fade into a shadowy, powerless existence, waiting in the void. From this perspective, the \"forgotten gods\" are a near-infinite multitude, a silent chorus of the divine that humanity has left behind.  Conclusion  So, to answer \"how many?\":  ¬∑ Historically: The number is countless and uncountable. It includes all the household spirits, local river gods, and tribal deities from cultures that left no written record. ¬∑ Metaphorically: The number is infinite, limited only by the number of places, concepts, and fears that humans have ever tried to personify and worship, only to eventually move on.  The forgotten gods outnumber the remembered ones not by dozens or hundreds but by orders of magnitude that we can never truly comprehend. They are the dark matter of the divine cosmos‚Äîthe overwhelming majority of what was once there, now invisible and unknown.|||If you've watched the movie PK then it sums up religion very well. There's 2 types of gods, the one that made us and the one that we made. The first one we don't even know if exists or not whereas the second one is people created for their own goals|||Some  believe in god only when they come between a paranormal entity.|||God is a lie.¬†   And Krishna said, if a lie does good to someone, that is not a lie.   Camus said there are three options for life.   Either kill yourself because there is no meaning.   Or submit to a higher power and live under that.   Third option is to live the life even if it doesn't have meaning. You got the life, so might as well enjoy it while living. Taste the chicken. Listen to a song. Look around. One day you will die anyway.|||\"If there is a god, atheism must seem less as an insult to him than religion\" - Edmond  de Goncourt|||Of course it is, religion was made up by ancient people to control other people.|||Yes it is|||This kind of thought can only arrive when you reach some level of consciousness.

It is only a belief system; people have to cope with the different facets of reality. At least, that's how I take religion and many other systems of thinking. It's neither a tool to control nor a tool to exploit the poor. But it has gotten that way now, though. When people are overly reliant on religions, that's when they get exploited. We need to understand that religion itself isn't a bad thing, but having a blind trust in it is wrong.

Buddhism ma god concept nai chaina|||The reason we have such temples, architecture, culture and religious devotion particularly in Kathmandu valley - newa culture, tradition and religion, was that at some point of time, they were a very stratified community i.e. resource rich, abundance of resource and time, and also isolated from much of external territorial clashes. Thus people were able to explore culture, develop tradition and dedicate time and resources to the religious pursuit.   Religion and culture is a way to explore divinity,  philosophy, metaphysics, life, death and beyond. It has its beauty, strengths and flaws like every human philosophical exploration.  But to answer the question of Development, infrastructure being built, particularly Western countries and many other countries while contrasting Asian countries is a complex historical and economic topic. You need to look at how modern development and infrastructure came to be. Why development occurred in some fields faster than others. And Why have our countries lagged behind in the past 300 years. And also the population boom and industrial revolution of the 19th and 20th century.   They've been constantly at war , so they had to take initiatives to outgrow and outperform their rivals leading to rapid research and development.   It's a big topic to cover.   And your misconception of Western countries and developed countries not being religious is not true.  Look at the big churches they've built, their art development alongside their religion eg- Davincis last resort.    You can see they have created a strong religious identity and are trying their best at spreading it wherever they go.  Whole Villages here in Nepal have converted to Christianity religion. And then there's factions of Muslims trying to do the same in other countries. ( Not in Nepal atm.)  They have contested their religion against others, they have seminars for religious conversions, research to pit their religious views against other religions, and actually are investing huge into conversions towards their religion. This can't be denied.  You look at china and Japan today, investing tons into their history and identity. Just a few decades ago, china was hugely behind in development and infrastructure. They've played their cards well in recent times.  You must understand today, the notions of absolute opposition to religion stems from leftist, communist and socialist narratives. Bending facts with fiction to push their ideology one way or another, all for pursuit of power. Eg- how maoist in Nepal manipulated facts and ficticious ideas to captivate the populus.   But, There have always been ways in our culture to be agnostic and still be a part of society.   Well, tldr, West is very religious, but they outpaced most due to rapid industrialization, marketisation, their investment into RnD and human resource.  India was under opressive British rule. Us in Nepal, fell behind when we failed to initiate our industrial revolution and we went to isolation during the industrial revolution. (Rana regime)  But, with positive steps, we are catching up.|||it's necessay to run and regulate for better of humanity! not everyone like books nerds!|||Human Being are fragile being. They need a belief system to operate. Religion is that belief system.   There are super powers no doubts which are beyond our imagination.

I supposedly believe that, concept of god and religion are two different things. Religion is collective belief system inspired, moreover conspired by smart-dominant human whereas concept of God is figurative and representation of something supreme.   In different era, to control or to discipline the mass, the smart-dominant human infused the concept of god and religion together.

            "body": "Hey r/Nepal, I'm a Grade 12 student dealing with a family crisis and I need urgent advice. My grandpa has severe CKD and an infection.   The government hospital in our district (Rajbiraj) is supposed to provide free dialysis for poor citizens, but they are refusing him due to the infection, and they're also sitting on unused dialysis machines claiming \"no installation space.\"  Because of this, my dad has to take my grandpa on a long, single-session trip to Dharan every week.  My dad is a security guard with a strict 12-hour shift, 7 days a week, because there are only two guards at the bank. He is exhausted, sick, and running himself into the ground.  I feel helpless watching him struggle against the company's rules and the hospital's cruelty. I have two urgent questions:  1. Work Shift: Is the 12-Hour Shift Legal? Is the security company legally required to pay my dad overtime (1.5x basic wage) for the 4 hours worked beyond the standard 8? How do we check his payslip and enforce this  Idk if 12 hour shift he is doing is considered stander or overtime. But I know before the few years it was 3 guard in bank with 8 hour of shift. 2 in day and 1 in night.  Is it legal to make him work for 12 hour.    Can he legally request a reduced shift or a third guard, citing a critical family health emergency that's affecting his ability to work safely?  2. Hospital Denial:  What are our Rights?   The hospital is denying a free, life-saving service to a Bippana citizen. Where in the Nepali government (Health Ministry, Human Rights, Provincial Directorate) can I file a formal complaint?  How can we use public pressure (like local media) to shame the hospital into installing the unused dialysis machines they are hoarding due to an absurd \"no space\" excuse?  Please, any practical advice or contact info for legal/social workers in Nepal would be a lifeline right now. Thank you   I have uses ai for better articulation",

Is the security company legally required to pay my dad overtime (1.5x basic wage) for the 4 hours worked beyond the standard 8? How do we check his payslip and enforce this**  No, it is not legal. Look at [the labor act](https://antislaverylaw.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/The-Labour-Act-2017.pdf). Go to page 18. It says:  >**Working hours:** (1) No employer shall employ labours to work more than eight hours a day and forty-eight hours a week. (2) The labours shall be provided with half an hour rest after five hours of continuous work. (3) In the cases of work which is not to be stopped and is to be carried out continuously, labours shall be provided with such a rest time turn by turn.  >**Not to compel to work overtime:** (1) No employer shall compel a labour to work more than the hours set forth in sub-section (1) of Section 28.  >**Additional remuneration to be paid:** (1) While employing any labour to work overtime pursuant to Section 30, the employer shall pay to the labour remuneration at a rate of 1.5 times of the basic remuneration receivable during regular hours of work.  In simple words, your father should only be made to work 8 hours a day, 48 hours a week. He can't be forced to work more than that. Even in those 8 hours a day shift, he should be given 30 hours a rest after every 5 hours of continuous work. And overtime is completely voluntary. That overtime should be paid at 1.5 times the normal rate.  **2. Hospital Denial: What are our Rights?**  **The hospital is denying a free, life-saving service to a Bippana citizen. Where in the Nepali government (Health Ministry, Human Rights, Provincial Directorate) can I file a formal complaint?**  Hami Nepal might be able to help you.

But for moat cases, hospital have seperate dialysis machine for such patient.   The risk is two fold, if your grandpa have this disease and he is put on this normal dialysis machine , then the disease will spread to other CKD patient who comes after your grandpa.

I think your dad should consider changing a job - I know it is easier said than done. Maybe explore NGOs that may be able to help, if not in money, maybe they can help put some pressure on the hospital.

Chitwan-Hetauda-Birgunj in mid Nepal, Butwal-Bhairawa-Dang as for Lumbini Tourism enhancement, on site Dhangadi-Attariya, etc.  3. We can choose Dang valley as potential IT city like silicon valley or Banglore. We could build metro connection (Ghorahi-Tulsipur) there and make in PPP partnership with the buildings and government buildings with Nepali western architecture enhancing beauty. We can ask National Innovation centre of Mahabir Pun, Yatri motorcycles and IT companies and others to move there and do research and innovations for things needed to Nepal and be IT hub like Banglore and Silicon valley. Hiking route to pyuthan and trekking route to Dhorpatan could be developed for weekends plan.   4. Major cities should be reconstructed and all DPR should be canceled and major roads, highways should made with (wider footpath-cycle lane-Trees -4/6 lanes in middle and same on both sides). So that terai cities like Biratnagar, Birtamode, Itahari, Janakpur, Birgung, Nepalgunj, Butwal, Dhangadi, etc. with excessive heat in summer would be liveable as trees shade would fall upon footpaths and cycle lane and buses and motorcycle while travelling. And terai cities to hill stations and mountains route should be developed for travel and holidays/weekends.  5. All universities infrastructure outside Kathmandu should be upgraded and maintained and also major building should be in Nepali design as most foreign universities are like Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard, etc with proper infrasture development to attract students study there.  6. Additionally not related to decentralization but minimum monthly salary for 8 hours duty should be determined by dividing jobs in caterogies like other countries non-skilled, Semi skilled, skilled and fully skilled. Most industries make enginners work 12 hours and don't pay even minimum of labors salary of 8 hours and even Saturday is not given holiday in many industries. Also in hospitals is same case for nurses and other professionals as well. Also player should be paid minimum salary and law should be passed.   Addressing these things will help population to be divided among Nepal and reduce necessity to live in Kathmandu. Kathmandu is already historic city and we don't need flyovers, monorail, etc. and ruin it's beauty. Please add if you have more ideas in the given needs and mail to necessary authorities like kulman ghising, mahabir pun, etc. if you have mail I'd or number.",

As citizens, we are not asking for luxuries  only the basics: proper roads, quality education, justice, industries, sports infrastructure, transparency in taxation, and genuine support for agriculture. If nations like the USA, Ireland, Canada, Japan, and China could transform within decades, Nepal can too  but only if we focus on unity, discipline, and vision.  1. Agriculture and Export Driven Economy   Instead of importing almost everything, we should prioritize exports. Nepals fertile land can support large scale organic farming and high value crops. Marijuana and hemp, legalized strictly for export, could become billion dollar industries. Like Canada and Ireland, agricultural cooperatives should be modernized with technology, irrigation, and subsidies to farmers.   2. Tourism and Cultural Heritage   Tourism should be developed as one of our strongest economic backbones. Kathmandu Valley must be preserved as a world class cultural heritage hub, like Kyoto in Japan.  Mountain and adventure tourism should be expanded with world class trekking routes, cable cars, and eco tourism villages. Each district should showcase unique cultural, historical, or natural heritage to attract domestic and international tourists.   3. Industrial and Technological Hubs  Every district should host at least four to five industries based on local resources.  Cities like Chitwan, Hetauda, Birgunj, Biratnagar, and Nepalgunj should be major industrial corridors, like Shenzhen in China or Detroit in the USA. IT hubs must be developed to stop brain drain, inspired by Irelands Tech Island model. Encourage startups, innovation centers, and digital infrastructure.   4. Sports and National Identity  Establish national sports training grounds in every province. Focus on Olympic level facilities for football, cricket, martial arts, and athletics.  Take inspiration from China and Japan, who invested in sports to uplift national pride. Sports can create jobs, unity, and international recognition.  5. Infrastructure and Connectivity   All districts must be connected within four to five hours of travel with highways, regional airports, and modern public transport. Introduce metro or rapid rail linking Kathmandu Valley to nearby cities. Smart transportation like Japans Shinkansen or Canadas efficient highways should be our model.   6. Governance and Accountability  Strict rules and regulations for politicians ‚Äî no one above the law.  Police and media must be independent, like in developed democracies. Civil service and government jobs should be limited to ten years, not lifetime tenure, so fresh talent always enters the system. Adopt transparency systems like Canada and the USA where every rupee of tax is accounted for.   7. Education and Innovation   Free quality education up to secondary level, with strong focus on STEM, arts, and culture. Universities should link directly with industries, like in the USA and Japan, to create job ready graduates.  Encourage vocational training and research so youth can become innovators, not just job seekers abroad  8. Country First System  Above all, every policy, project, and law must prioritize Nepals prosperity.  National interest must come before political parties or individual gains.  If Japan and China could rise from devastation, if Ireland could transform from poverty into Europes tech hub, if the USA and Canada can sustain growth with diversity Nepal too can build a proud future.|||This is needed very much for the development of nepal.|||u are absolutely correct|||Yes and the goal should be does a KTM person want to move to that city or not.¬†   Start with establishing education institute to lure students and setup business around to stick them there.

This evolution reflects a shift from centralized monarchy to decentralized federalism, driven by ethnic inclusion and regional equity, though rooted in ancient feudal practices adapted to modern demands.  The necessity of decentralized governance through federal provinces in Nepal stems from the country's diverse geography, ethnicity, and historical centralization, which created disparities and marginalization.   Below is a concise explanation of why federalism was deemed essential, based on key factors:  Addressing Ethnic and Cultural Diversity: Nepal has over 125 ethnic groups and 123 languages.   Centralized governance historically marginalized groups like Madhesis, Janajatis, and Dalits, favoring Kathmandu-centric elites. Federalism allows provinces to preserve linguistic, cultural, and ethnic identities through local governance, reducing discrimination and fostering inclusion.\r Reducing Regional Disparities: Nepal‚Äôs diverse terrain (Himalayas, hills, Tarai) led to uneven development, with remote areas neglected. Federal provinces enable localized decision-making, allowing regions to prioritize their economic and infrastructural needs, such as agriculture in Tarai or tourism in mountainous areas.  \r Political Representation and Autonomy: Centralized rule concentrated power in Kathmandu, alienating regions like the Tarai and far-west. Federalism devolves power to provinces, granting them legislative and administrative authority to address local issues, enhancing political participation and accountability.  \r Mitigating Conflict and Unrest: The Maoist insurgency (1996‚Äì2006) and Madhesi movements (2007‚Äì2008) highlighted demands for regional autonomy. Federalism was a response to these conflicts, aiming to prevent further unrest by ensuring equitable representation and resource distribution.  \r Strengthening Democracy: By decentralizing power, federalism promotes grassroots democracy, allowing local governments to address community-specific needs. This counters the autocratic tendencies of past monarchical and centralized systems, fostering cooperative governance across federal, provincial, and local levels.  \r Economic Efficiency and Development: Provinces can tailor policies to their economic strengths (e.g., hydropower in hilly provinces, agriculture in Tarai), optimizing resource use. Decentralized governance reduces bureaucratic delays from Kathmandu, enabling faster implementation of development projects.\r \r Despite its necessity, challenges like resource allocation, inter-provincial disputes, and incomplete devolution persist, requiring ongoing refinement to ensure effective governance. Federalism remains critical to balancing Nepal‚Äôs diverse needs with national unity.",

I personally feel we need a libertarian party that puts on views that limits the role of government to implementing PEACE, SECURITY & JUSTICE.    I would love to quote this from my idol Milton Friedman \"Government has three primary functions. It should provide for military defense of the nation. It should enforce contracts between individuals. It should protect citizens from crimes against themselves or their property. When government-- in pursuit of good intentions tries to rearrange the economy, legislate morality, or help special interests, the cost come in inefficiency, lack of motivation, and loss of freedom. Government should be a referee, not an active player.\"   GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT INTERVENE BUSINESS OF PEOPLE but ENSURE THE PLAYGROUND IS FREE OF FOUL PLAY.|||Won't because the implementation part is cooked .

Dubei group ko extremist ko rise hudei cha.  But these are the kind of things I used to see in Indian news but lately I have been seeing it in Nepali news as well. So yesterday I was in Birgunj and I witnessed something that made me kinda angry as well as sad. I had seen it in videos too but iguess seeing it live just pisses you off more.  So what happened was yesterday, this huge group of guys carrying those ‚ÄúJay Shree Ram‚Äù flags were having this really huge rally in Birgunj. You could easily see majority of them were Indians. In the rally there were tons of bikes but most of them had number plates of India. They had this jeep where lots of guys were hanging and chanting Jay Shree Ram, huge speakers blasting music. And the guys on the bike were not wearing helmets or anything, instead they were over confident, driving recklessly. Some of them were even carrying swords, yes literal swords.  And there was police presence but only couple of them. And yeah it was too irritating. Especially the fact that half of them were Indians, they were in Indian vehicles, out here in Nepal doing unnecessary stunt bazi. It just pissed me off. They were disturbing traffic as well but no way anyone could say anything because you can literally see they are those rowdy ones. They too are goons of some group so arguing with them meant getting into a fight with them. Even though there were cops I hardly believe situation would‚Äôve gotten calm sooner. Anyways yeah, seeing so many Indian Bihari people out there with their Bihari number plate here in Nepal disturbing peace just pissed me off.  **Also isn‚Äôt there some law or anything barring Indian vehicles to participate in this kind of activities in Nepal?**¬†Because more than half of the vehicles there were Indian. Isn‚Äôt this them disturbing peace of another nation? I mean I am not aware about the law so asking. They were in another country, in their own country‚Äôs bikes, no helmets or anything, reckless driving, disturbing peace, sometimes even getting into riots. How is this not illegal?  And that makes me think,¬†**is this something they‚Äôre (gov) deliberately letting happen?**¬†I mean, obviously cops can‚Äôt just make arrests themselves, they need orders from higher-ups. So are the higher-ups letting this pass due to some political reason? Or are they too under the control of Indian influence or what? Because like I said, these were literally citizens of another country disturbing the peace of our country. Yes, there were Nepali people in the rally too, tons of Nepali vehicles as well, but there were equal numbers of Indian vehicles. Gunda haru liera aako thiey India dekhi nei.  So just wanted to share this here as well. These kind of things have been going on since quite some time recently. Just few months back here in Birgunj there was this huge fight between Muslim group and Hindu group. Now idk who was the culprit here or anything but I do know that Indian group infiltration is one of the most likely reason.  Edit: So I am sharing the experience I had yesterday, the things I witnessed and some of the talks I had with people here combined. To all those saying why this and not why that, like I said, I just shared what I witnessed yesterday.",

Food is really good, since it's important to keep people healthy and in good morale. I was in for three years. My crime? Making up shit on the internet.|||Before even going to jail the police beat the shit out of you so you're half dead already.|||Nepal doesn't have gang warfare like in the Americas or violent tribal conflicts like in Africa, which can spill over to prisons and make them dangerous. The police-inmate conflict is not as escalated as other countries where criminal groups are more \"institutionalized\" (USA, India, ...) The jails are, therefore, not as tense and unsafe. Combined with the general attitude towards foreigners (especially white ones) and the culture of regarding them as \"guests\", I would assume that a white American would have a pretty easy time in Nepali jails.|||If local Nepalis find the living condition bad then it's probably 100x bad for you. Also don't expect to get fair treatment from police.|||Nepali prison/ jail is over packed, unhygienic and unsafe. If you did big crime then you may get special cells for other crimes you are cooked unless you are physically strong.  There are groups inside prison that act as a gang.|||Your bumh@le won't get resized here like in the american prisons.|||I‚Äôd imagine Nepali prisons aren‚Äôt as scary as what other countries might be. Nepal is low-violence and doesn‚Äôt have organized crime, which are the things that make prisons much more concerning in other countries.|||So my experience is about 4 decades old. I would hope things have improved since then,  ut doubt it. I was working on Nepal and one of my employees was arrested. I went to visit him in the Patan jail. The ‚Äújail‚Äù was one large very dark room with about 30 people locked up in it. There was a trough running down the middle of the floor that inmates used for pee and poop. Food was the bare minimum - rice and a very watery potato dhal. No beds, and the only garments or bedding used by prisoners were whatever was brought by family members who had to bribe the jailers to pass it on. Again this was a long time ago so take it with a grain of salt and hope conditions are better. I would assume that if an inmate had the funds they could secure nicer accommodations.|||From my experience of visiting Nepali prisons for research purposes, there are a few factors that determine how bad it is, each location is different in terms of the facilities and practices. Overall I would say the living conditions are pretty bad in most prisons, places are cramped, so not a lot of personal space, hygiene and access to healthcare is an issue. However, There are also some good prisons with facilities like gym, some providing mental health support, vocational training and so on. So it really depends on which prison but there really isn‚Äôt any imminent threat to life or gang violence or anything extreme. From what I saw, everybody does their own thing and it‚Äôs pretty chill, there are ‚Äúleaders‚Äù like a class captains who pretty much run the place and communicate with the police officers. I also met some foreigners although they were not white or American. Ofcourse they were treated really well like any other place in Nepal, the only complaint they had was about the justice system and how fucked up it is in Nepal and how many innocent people are in jail.|||It‚Äôs pretty chill they‚Äôll let you out once in a while when there‚Äôs like a protest or smth or like a flood and expect you to report yourself so they can put you back. Actually it‚Äôs very liberal in terms of your character development and they‚Äôll make sure you get your food one time. Just beware of dropping your soap though as that is universal.

Trackers normally don't host any content themselves, they will just have a listing of the content, and the tracker will track the seeders and leechers. So when you download a torrent file (or use a magnet link), the torrent file will have information on what content the torrent should have (the actual torrent content will be with seeders/leechers) as well as information on seeders/leechers.  > And if there is one, can't people who don't want their stuff illegally downloaded track those coordination servers?  It's not so easy. It's fairly easy to start your own torrent tracker. If you take out one torrent tracker, then many more would pop up to take its place. And the seeders/leechers would continue to have access to the files, they could just switch to another tracker.   There are also countries with cheap internet access and loose copyright laws who won't cooperate with US/EU, so many trackers are hosted on those countries.  > Also can I become seeder too if I want to put out something on pirate bay myself with my 16 GB RAM laoptop?   You don't need to upload to become a seeder, you just need a completed version of the torrent active on your torrent client.  You can upload torrents on various trackers, or even have your own tracker. There are many legitimate uses of torrents such as hosting Linux ISOs.  > And what do people who provide their own computing resources get for their efforts? Why do they do it?   It doesn't really take much computing resources other than disk space and bandwidth (CPU and RAM usage will be low on a decent torrent client).  Torrenting does require generous people who have the spirit of sharing. Without this, torrenting won't work.  There are also private torrent trackers which have seeding and ratio rules (you may need to seed each torrents for at least a minimum amount of time set by the tracker and/or maintain a good upload to download ratio, and there are generally incentives for seeding long term). Here you will have to follow the rules of seeding if you want to download. What this means is the files will be better seeded in private trackers, and the quality of files will be higher too.|||From my knowledge, Seeders are the providers who have the files installed on their system and they are distributing it in parts to the leechers that is you in this case.   And to be a seeder is not a heavy task, after finishing the download by taking bits one by one and arranging the file, the torrent itself starts to seed if the torrent client is open. I seed on my 4 gb ram laptop too. It's not done for profit, it's done cuz you wanna help others out cuz you also got helped by others. And use QBittorrent if not alr.|||Torrenting is just file sharing among people. The torrent file is not the movie,it is really like a map that shows where the pieces are located. Seeders have the full file and share it out. Leechers download but also share what they got. Your computer downloads small pieces from many people at the same time. It also shares the pieces you've already downloaded with others. No single server contains the file,trackers just help computers find one another. You may share your own files also by leaving your torrent running. People generally share to help others and keep torrents running. The more you share, the faster your downloads are.|||**Basically, if you've already downloaded the file or parts of the file, and have enabled seeding, other downloaders can request chunks of the file, and it will be sent from your computer to their computer. Hence termed peer-to-peer.**  **If you've enabled seeding, you're a seeder.**  **If you're just downloading without enabling seeding, you're a leecher.**  **There are communities dedicated to keeping popular torrents active for years, with server farms that keep seeding thousands of torrents 24/7. And some torrent creators seed it themselves with gigabytes per second speeds. Spreading the file throughout the network.**  Torrent files or magnet links just tell your client where to look; trackers(hosted somewhere) or DHT help it find other peers sharing that file. Trackers or DHT don‚Äôt host the actual file, just a list of connected peers and info about which chunks they have.  Once connected, it grabs tiny chunks from many at once and shares what it‚Äôs got back, pure decentralized magic.  See the graph highlighted in red?  https://preview.redd.it/kr31xb3u7xtf1.png?width=976&format=png&auto=webp&s=c84151228f898cc0e6eb3846e87737d6714745d0  The black lines are the chunks that you've already downloaded. As you can see, the chunks are requested in random order.  However, some applications like WebTorrent allow you to download the chunks in order, from beginning to end. Hence, it lets you stream the video without downloading the entire file. Possibly, [goku.sx](http://goku.sx) does this as well.  **That's why torrents are hard to counter.**  Because everyone who's downloaded the file can send it to the ones who request it.  **It's truly genius.**  And people usually **don‚Äôt get paid**. They seed because they want to **help others download faster** and keep torrents alive, like giving back to the community that helped them.  Some do it for **reputation on private trackers**, or just **because they enjoy being part of a swarm**.|||What it is: 1. p2p nai ho. 2. Decentralized vatekole files are divided into equal parts. Each part may be a small chunk of 2MB, 4MB, 8MB etc depending on configuration. 3. Example: 64MB filr would have 16 parts each of 4MB or, 8 parts each 8MB. 4. SEEDER = who hosts parts (seeds)source 5. LEECHER is who downloadeds(leeches) from source 6. For this to work, SEED (Part of File) must exist with ATLEAST one Seeder.  Gow it works: 1. When you do a torrent download, you are initially a Leecher Only. For all parts. 2. As soon as you download ANY part, you become a Seeder for that part. 3. Meaning, you are now a source for that part for someone on the network  4. If more people have the part that you want, and if they are nearby, your download of that part will be significantly faster. 5. If a single Seeder is serving some particular PART, the download of that part (Leeching) will be painfully slow. 6. Thankfully, many Leechers for that PART means someone downloading closest to that Seeder will complete the download faster, and they in-turn will become Seeder for that part. So, -1 Leecher +1 Seeder happens. This makes your download faster. You can download each part from 1 peer by default, but you also have the option to choose multiple peers for a PART. 7. If you leave the file as-is after the complete download. That file will continue being seeded. You will act as a peer with all parts. Essentially, making the download faster for everbody. 8. Downloads are not sequential by design, because UDN will grab whatever is available. But modern torrent clients have the option of concurrent download. You trade download speed with serial download of parts. Useful for things like streaming video (You can play video on VLC as it is downloading, that way!)|||Simply understand like,  seeders - those who have complete files  leechers - those who have incomplete files  In this case the new downloader also becomes leechers as it has incomplete files.   In Torrent the client who is downloading is also uploading at the same time to others that doesn't have incomplete files. Only when the file is completely downloaded the client becomes a seeder.   There is no server here. All leechers act on its own who wants which chunk of missing file and completes it from the easiest seeder or peecher.  Count that the more the seeder the better the download as multiple chunks of files can be taken from multiple seeders which may find the easiest.  For a file to be downloaded completely there needs to be atleast one seeder and none or any no. of leechers.  More the leechers means multiple clients has incomplete files. In this case each leechers acts selfish grasping incomplete file of its own from any leechers or seeders with the shortest or easiest available route or port.   Note that when there is only single seeder then leechers downloads from any other leachers which file is available but since the complete file is only one so the missing piece is only completed through that single seeder. As soon as the leecher completes its file it instantly becomes seeder.  Also there is role of port which can make complex for time being.|||lots of questions but i will try to answer them one by one!  Seeders are those who have the complete file. leachers are those who are still downloading the file and have parts of it.  Most  .torrent has a tracker url. its doesnot host the file but keeps the ip addresses of the people who have the file i.e seeder and leechers. when you start downloading you client qbittorrent ask for the file and the trackers replies with the ip addresses of the people who have it. and then you client directly connects you to the seeder (no server in between).  Yes ‚Äî trackers are public, and law enforcement or copyright agencies can (and do) monitor them. and join in the swarm and look for seeder or people who are downloading. That‚Äôs how copyright notices often originate by logging IPs seen sharing a particular movie or software.   you are saring the file as you are downloading(leacher). Once the download is complete you client automatically starts seeding it as long as you are kepping the application open, and everytime you open the application. in the case of seeding it does not take much bandwidth.  torrenting is bandwidth, I/O heavy not ram or cpu, You are not hosting the file Like a server you are just sharing it.  For the love of the game. if nobody shares it the torrent dies. most client forces their users to seed or do it on auto . some do it for the freedom. and sharing is caring.  No significant computing power is needed torrenting mostly uses bandwidth and disk I/O, not CPU or RAM.  Torrenting itself is completely legal  it‚Äôs just a peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol. What can be illegal is *what* you download or share. Distributing copyrighted material (like commercial movies, games, or software) without permission can violate copyright laws in many countries. In practice, enforcement often focuses on large uploaders or tracker sites rather than individual users. so you are safe.|||Basically, you are looking for a packet of parle G. Say, 10 people on this thread have a packet of parle G each. So we agree to share you a copy of our individual biscuit each. Some will give you 2 piece, some will give 5 etc untill you complete an entire packet worth of biscuits. Sharing a copy of your file is Seeding.  Getting said file from other sharing the same file is leeching.  Now, you asked for a friend to help you look for said parle g is the torrent file/sites  After you get your copy of file, just let it be on the torrent. Others who'd want it will then get connected to you and you will share a copy of your file with them.  Torrenting itself is not illegal, sharing copyrighted files is. (But who cares, most of us can't afford any useful softwares legally anyway :D)|||Just set your torrent client to run at startup & keep it running in the background to seed.

Follow the pattern‚Ä¶ the outfits, the wedding decorations, jewellery, she made it come to reality. She followed it diligently - color, design, looks, everything. Likewise, will be her uncountable homes and more plethora of jewellery. You are making people aware what she was upto on the days of the protests and the tragedy of losing innocent lives. Some people will always defend her no matter what as most of them are paid PR people.   Her homes which she shared with the husband are perhaps and most probably their upcoming homes and redecorations which she has said she is renovating three of her houses. The Sirohiya house that was burnt down was surprisingly not lavish at all despite the corruption scale. They are of course building a new house, what else would you do with all that black money. She wants to get into politics and the scale of the house will be similar. She does everything for the clout and to portray this picture perfect curated lifestyle.  Whenever someone wants to warn people, they are always ridiculed. There were people who exposed her long time back but they were also met with unfair repercussions. People are speaking up now because her hypocrisy has been on the forefront.  You did your job, let the people do whatever they want with the info. When the time comes, they will think back and say yes there were signs but‚Ä¶.This is exactly how the corruption went overboard cause few people called out things but they were never taken seriously, this continued for decades giving the corrupt people the benefit of the doubt and even after they have been exposed now, they still have the audacity to say that they have been nothing but victims. All happened because no one listened, no one cared, no one acknowledged and there was no accountability until it was too late.  Srinkhala, her parents, her in laws and her husband are frauds and parasites. Everyone knows that but still some people don‚Äôt want to accept it and live in denial. Her brother was supposed to get married the week or following after the protests. It‚Äôs a fact! She did not disclose this, the media did. She pinned the jewelry ideas around the same time and if people still defend her then just leave it at that. If the protests did not happen, we would have seen her never ending posts about the wedding, what she wore, what she is working on as ‚Äúan architect‚Äù. Her home- her dream project will be a lavish one because it has to match her ambition and ego. She makes everything about herself, you think she won‚Äôt make her dream project about herself? Then she will come out and say it was all her vision, she got inspired by this sustainability and how her husband guided her into making better decisions like her wedding speech.  If she was really talented, her Gaatha and skincare line would not have been what it is today. Whatever little publicity those are getting are because she has been endorsing both. Nepal ma alikati kei ramro bhayo ki successful bhaihalcha. Yo ta jhan afailay endorse gareko brainchild ho re in her own words. If it is not making any rounds and not doing well then there is clearly no talent with the amount of money, position, connections, power and influence that she has especially after getting married.

Many examples around me but its a common story to reject someone based on casteism and discriminate during pooja, not eating what she cooks etc even if you end up marrying him.   Not that you won‚Äôt run into this problem with other castes. But I have seen both upadhya bahun girls being boycotted by their maiti for entering non-upadhya marriage, and non-baun buharis facing humiliation and exclusion by not only the family but all the relatives too.   Yes IT is the 21st century, but some things haven‚Äôt changed so GIRLS! you gotta think where you gotta think. Be careful and aware and if you are entering a marriage like this at all, be prepared to discuss this before marriage, with both families involved.

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. üò≠üò≠2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye üò≠|||3 brsa vo dashign namanako|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

Let‚Äôs ignore Computer, Nepali, and English for now .The main challenge for me is Maths, Physics, and Chemistry. My first-term exam went unexpectedly bad no matter how much I studied, the questions turned out very difficult. I feel extremely demotivated and depressed right now. I used to be one of the best students until grade 10, but after entering +2, the syllabus feels vast, and my study approach doesn‚Äôt seem to be working anymore. Now I don‚Äôt know what to do. Should I join tuition classes or not? I‚Äôm seeking advice from seniors and experienced people. My college runs from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.The problem is how to manage everything together studies, my interest in webdev, and personal time. On top of that, my first-term result has put me under a lot of stress. I keep wondering can I really make a comeback from here?",

Because there was no one to guide me, i failed this year's neb board.   so from someone who learned from his own experience, my best advice is that you don't depend only on teachers from your school. there are tons of videos on youtube and tons of notes and  straight up answers in the internet.   if you do not understand and get anything at all, then only focus on the questions that are asked many times or repeated i.e only imp questions.   you have to make sure that you atleast passing marks, so look focus on the chapters you understand and master them first then only focus on others.   You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

            "body": "I need to vent about those cringe NPC-type people who just wannabe something they‚Äôre not, copying whatever they see on the internet like it‚Äôs their personality. You know the type those ‚Äúkhul mil‚Äù posers who act like they‚Äôre the coolest because they saw some TikTok edit or Instagram reel and think they‚Äôre experts. I HATE these people the most. They‚Äôll fake being into a popular series or movie just because it‚Äôs trending, but they‚Äôve only watched some half-baked TikTok explanation or a 15-second clip. No depth, no authenticity, just pure clout-chasing vibes. So, let me tell you about this one incident that had me HEATED. I was chilling at my mama‚Äôs ghar, and my 7th cousin or something (he‚Äôs like 3 years younger than me, so probably 18-ish) shows up for a visit or whatever. We‚Äôre just having a normal day, and I‚Äôm scrolling through Instagram reels. One of the reels pops up with a Breaking Bad scene, you know, the one where Jesse‚Äôs cooking meth with Badger, trying to mimic Walt‚Äôs technique. Iconic stuff. This cousin peeks over and goes, ‚ÄúYo, you watched Breaking Bad?‚Äù I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúHell yeah, it‚Äôs a absolute peak.‚Äù He asks who my favorite character is, and I say Jesse Pinkman because, duh, he‚Äôs the GOATand all that stuff. Then he hits me with, ‚ÄúOh, my favorite‚Äôs Gus Fring.‚Äù I‚Äôm thinking, ‚ÄúAight, typical Breaking Bad fan pick, Gus is a badass.‚Äù But then he starts yapping about his ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù scenes, and something‚Äôs off. Like, he‚Äôs only describing the most TikTok-edited scenes the ‚ÄúSay My Name‚Äù moment, the big Gus explosion, you know, the ones that are ALL OVER social media. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs reciting a highlight reel from Instagram, not talking about the actual show. So, I‚Äôm getting sus. I decide to test this dude. I hit him with, ‚ÄúIf Gus is your favorite, what‚Äôs the actor‚Äôs real name?‚Äù He freezes. Like, full-on deer-in-headlights hesitation. After a beat, he mumbles, ‚ÄúUh, Giancarlo Esposito.‚Äù Okay, fair, he got that right, probably from seeing it in a TikTok caption. So I push further: ‚ÄúCool, what other movies or series has Giancarlo Esposito been in, besides Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul?‚Äù awkard silence. Dude‚Äôs got NOTHING. He‚Äôs just staring at me, brain buffering like a 2003 dial-up modem. So I call him out: ‚ÄúBro, be real. Have you actually watched Breaking Bad, or are you just explaining TikTok edits?‚Äù After a super awkward pause, he admits it. ‚ÄúOkay, fine, I didn‚Äôt watch it. I just saw some explanations and edits on TikTok.‚Äù BOOM. Exposed. This dude was straight-up faking it, trying to seem cool by pretending he‚Äôs a Breaking Bad stan when he‚Äôs just a wannabe hopping on the hype train. I‚Äôm so done with these types of people. They see something trending, latch onto it, and act like they‚Äôre part of the culture without putting in the work. Like, bro, just watch the show! It‚Äôs not that hard! Has anyone else dealt with these fake NPC wannabes? Drop your stories below because I know I‚Äôm not alone in this.",

            "body": "We all know most ISP here lock the router and dont give any access to the web management. As a devops practitioner and someone who is very invested in homelabbing and selfhosting, locked router was my biggest achilles heels.   Requirement: A secondary router, you main router will stop working and secondary router will only work through LAN1 port.   Solution: All you have to do is create a ticket on vianet app stating \"Turn the router into bridge/modem only mode\". Someone will call you back, just ask them username and password for PPPOE and use your secondary router to configure through PPPOE instead of DHCP. Tada!!! you now have full control over your router.   Bonus 1: You can flash openwrt with Luci web interface and you will be able to configure anything you can think of. extra advantage is you can configure mesh routing without needing a special router. I have managed to easily flash it on my Mi router and a old tp link router, search for guides depending on your model or ask Claude or Gpt to search specifically for your router model.   Bonus 2: Vianet gives you globally accessible IPV6. That means you are free from CGNAT. Use this to access your home services without needing any relay like Cloudflare Tunnel or Tailscale VPN. Direct connection means no extra latency and maxed bandwidth and you can use this to host online game servers to play with your friends!! But for some reason Worldlink doesnt connect sometimes. Ncell and ClassicTech seems to have no problem tho. I am not sure if NTC offers IPV6.  Bonus 3: Host a adguard DNS server and configure your openwrt to use it as your default DNS server. This way you will have adblocking for your whole network. Your parents and old grannies wont have to see ads no more (wont work with Youtube app - use revance) and it keeps them safe from online phishing and malwares. You can also set some static ip and adguard to block some websites like gambling and pornography if there are minors in your household.   Disadvantage: The only downside of this is your main router will turn pretty much useless. Internet wont work through wireless and extra ports. So dont forget the vianet tech support to turn off the DHCP and wireless on the main router. Since my secondary router also has 2 ports only I had to invest some money on extra gigabyte switch.   I know some of you will appreciate this so this is my appreciation and giving back to this community. enjoy and have fun!! Happy Dashain!!!

The child will have access to education and almost everything another child can ask for. We have belief that the child carries spirit of Taleju Bhawani, which gives the child immense power. Again, in an age where we have lost our belief, I cannot prove it.  The kumaris I have visited emit strong aura (i may have been brainwashed to feel this). But she does have to be disciplined (i dont mean someone disciplines her). The child is treated with utmost respect by the best people in a homely environment.   Aba before age of 15 16, Manang Mustang ghumna khasai koi jaadaina hola (only speaking for myself) After she is no longer a Kumari, she can go whereever she wants to.

Jay Desh|||We should support female pope in Vatican gender equality let's goooo!!!|||What about the rights of Nuns... We should talk about this also|||Kumaris: A common doll for everyone.   A 3 year old child has no idea what she is getting into. She cannot grasp what a normal childhood is, what is right and what is wrong. The only thing she knows and does is based on her likes and dislikes, which is heavily depended upon how her parents/surrounding elders dictates.   Ani about 'No complains' from past Kumaris:   Newari culture is super sensitive. You cannot say anything against their culture. Otherwise, you'll have to face \"Tom n Jerry\" like people. I think, every ex Kumaris understands this at some point. With this much pressure along with the grooming done from a very young age, I don't think anyone dares to speak up. Which basically means none of us know what they really feel inside.    Well, of course, keeping in mind how they're thrown away once they reach a certain age or goes through ü©∏. At least, a life time opportunity to be a Kumari where they could renounce their position if they don't feel like it should be a way.   They don't preach, they don't teach, they only show up during jatras. I've never seen Kumaris actively participating in rituals or any sort of activities. Yestai ho vane, why not create a statue of a Kumari for the rest of our lives and stay quiet???|||Also it adds to the stereotype that period blood is impure|||Yeah the 1sttime ever I saw Kumari it was not aww like I hoped but pity to the \"Living Goddess\" she had the look of not a girl her age but of an \"ice princess\" in anime.

The only thing you should feel bad about is her parents who now have to be her full time care takers probably having to leave their jobs and careers and move into the kumari house with her.||| The Living Goddess tradition of Nepal is a complex institution rooted in centuries of culture. While modern concerns about child rights are valid, the practice is governed by strict rituals and has evolved to address contemporary welfare standards. Here are the key facts:  1. The Selection is Meticulous and Considered an Honor:  ¬∑ A Kumari is chosen from the specific Shakya clan of the Newari community, a Buddhist goldsmith caste. ¬∑ The selection process is incredibly rigorous. Candidates must meet 32 strict physical perfection requirements (e.g., eye shape, voice quality, hair color) and demonstrate a fearless and serene demeanor (e.g., by not crying during a ceremony in a room of 108 ritually sacrificed animal heads). ¬∑ For the family and community, her selection is not a punishment but the highest spiritual honor.  2. The Role is Central to National Culture and Unity:  ¬∑ The Kumari is not just a religious figure but a national symbol. ¬∑ Her most important public duty is during the Indra Jatra festival, where she blesses the President of Nepal, providing divine legitimacy to the state in a ceremony that blends Hindu and Buddhist traditions. This is a key event for national identity.  3. Significant Reforms and Safeguards Have Been Implemented:  ¬∑ Education: By law, the Kumari now receives a formal education from private tutors within her residence. The government provides a monthly stipend specifically for this purpose. ¬∑ Family Presence: Contrary to isolation claims, her family (typically her mother) lives with her throughout her tenure. ¬∑ Financial Security: Upon retiring at puberty, the state grants her a lifetime pension. As of recent years, this is approximately NPR 10,000 per month (roughly $75 USD), along with a lump sum of NPR 1 million (roughly $7,500 USD) to support her transition. ¬∑ Successful Reintegration: Former Kumaris like Dr. Chanira Bajracharya, who served until 14, have publicly spoken about their positive experiences, pursued higher education, and built successful careers, demonstrating that life after the role is viable.  The Kumari tradition is a deeply embedded socio-religious institution. It is factually inaccurate to frame it simply as the \"isolation\" of a child. It is a state-sanctioned, culturally sacred role with defined rituals, significant community support, and legally mandated provisions for the girl's education, family life, and long-term financial security. The debate around it highlights the global tension between cultural preservation and evolving child rights, but the practice itself has demonstrably adapted to modern norms.|||I ain't newar but also I think aaba yesto kura chai parents haru le vhaneko ramro hami third party le vhannu vhanda pani . look if kumari ko parents le chahanu hudaina vhani tyo kumari ko candidate mai na leraunu parni ho . so parents lai kehi problem xaina , kumari le as a normal human being ni basna paunu hunxa after completion so I think we are no one to question sodhna lai|||What about the tradition of marrying off daughters into the inlaws house?|||After giving this some thought question is of a philosophical one.

I asked myself the same question and the answer is not much.   I disagree with your claim that the Kumari‚Äôs are discarded. They are always welcome.

Khaire ko documentary haru herera brainrot kura nagara na. Not everyone is privileged to become kumari and nor they are selected randomly. The family members themself have to fill the form and there's a long running selection process. Only a certain clan of newar can become Kumari. There are lots of inhuman and child abusive traditions going on all over. In case of kumari they get highest level of love and respect. They can live with their parents, they can play, they can watch TV, they can even play video games. It would be better if you watch podcasts of ex kumaris it's really helpful. I used to think same like everyone calling this inhuman before but they are living the normal life as you and me. And the fact that you can't speak up being kumari is totally false, yes you can't but only in jatras and other religious ceremonies, do you speak up during sharad and other pujas(it's prohibited to talk during sharad if you don't know). Go visit sudurpaschim hundreds of girls are being raped during their chhaupadi bas. Go visit terai Muslim villages girls at the age of 15 are getting married and at the age of 21 they are booned with 3 childs. Ex Kumaris themself enjoy being kumari and love to live their that phase again. If they are fine, their parents are fine no need to talk about that. Now the rules and prohibitions are amended.

To those insisting Kumaris are always ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù or dismissing criticism by belittling others, few things we can reflect on:   1. How much do we actually know about child psychology and development, especially at such a young age when experiences shape a lifetime? 2. Yes, a Kumari is worshipped as a goddess now but when her time ends, how does a goddess step back into an ordinary life? How do peers treat her? How does she even make friends? 3. With isolation and the constant expectation to suppress emotions, what happens to her social, communication, and interpersonal skills? Who helps her navigate that later? 4. Does she ever get space to express her own feelings and thoughts or is silence part of the job description? 5. We‚Äôve all seen videos of new Kumari, some barely three years old, literally asleep in full dress during rituals. How on earth can a toddler be burdened with divine expectations when they can barely stay awake through it? 6. As Nepalis, many of us defend dal bhat tarkari because it‚Äôs what we grew up with it feels untouchable. (I know it‚Äôs not the same but for reference) For a Kumari, this role is all she has ever known. So how would she even recognise or articulate what she‚Äôs missed out on, when she never had the chance to experience it? 7. And let‚Äôs be honest do we really believe someone put on a pedestal that high, surrounded by cultural pressure, guilt, and shame, would openly talk about the negatives of being Kumari? Yes, things have changed there‚Äôs more education, some family contact,but none of that cancels out the developmental and human rights concerns we‚Äôre talking about.  And honestly, the comments here kind of prove the point: we were never really taught to think critically. Instead of having an actual discussion, people are throwing around ‚Äúbahun,‚Äù ‚ÄúChristian,‚Äù or ‚Äúother cultures‚Äù like that somehow answers the question.

Goodness flows through Kumari.  She is worshipped for being the medium of taleju bhawani. They are taught that they as an individual are not god, but the goodness that flows through her is what makes her worshipped.  And calling Kumari as a \"virgin goddess\" is stupid and a complete disregard of religious belief. It's a literal translation not a literary translation.   A lot of misconceptions have already been debunked.  Therefore they are able to integrate back into society well. They have good societal support . They are mentored, taught and are well taken care of. They themselves have immence respect for their religion and tradition.  If you think being a Kumari is wrong, you simply look at other practices in other religions. Nuns are not allowed to marry or consummate. Denying the right to marry and consummate can be considered as an oppressive practices denying one from their human desires. In radical Islam, burka, multiple marriages, denial of human rights for wemen.  While such petty comparisons are stupid themselves, what I want to say is we are worshipping female power. We are actually looking at females as devine. Not simply blind worship.   Nothing about today's childhood is normal.  You see young boys and girls sent off to boarding schools as normal? It's more isolating depressing. Parents just sticking their child to an iPad, or a hyperactive parent forcing their child through multiple activities (music class, sports, extra activities) even when their child may not want to to them, and pushing their child to extremes, putting their child through ridiculously high expectations, so that they can fulfill own ego( yes I've seen it happen).  A lot is not normal in so called modern normal childhood.   A lot of narratives and propogandas have infiltrated our thinking. Be water and explore into the culture.

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. üò≠üò≠2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye üò≠|||3 brsa vo dashign namanako|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

But that doesn't mean I have direct ties with them. JHOLEY and BHEDA is a noun that defines people who blindly believe in a person or a political party.      Talking about myself, I am already 36, a father and I am thinking of raising my family here in Nepal. I was totally against going abroad as a student when there was trend to do so. But the political system was never stable here. However, This current GenZ revolution happened against corruption. We indeed got a good progress against these corrupt leaders. But things turned out to be different and here is my roller coaster of emotions. Please let me know if you can relate to this.  Day 0: Social Media Ban - Mixed feelings. Hopeful that social medias will proceed further with registration.  Day 1: GenZ revolution and killing - Lots of anger. Disappointment and discontent.  Day 2: Revolution, excited and happy till 4 PM, until we destroyed the party system. Once the public started destroying Singha Durbar, I came to realize what I had done. I started a fire that I can't extinguish.  Day 3: Realization of the revolution being hijacked. We were just against corruption, regime change was not our motto. The revolution gradually turned into a COLOR REVOLUTION.  Day 4: Worried about who will lead the country. Started mentally supporting Balen/Rabi or any young leader. Furious, since the army asked GenZ to come up with a leader. Finally Hami Nepal, some guys funded by Deep state along with Sanduk Ruit and Swarnim Wagle came into light. They started talking about regime change and Constitution change. They said they directly want to select Zelensky as their prime minister.   Day 5: Much more disappointed as some kids who are aiming to go abroad for future study is electing prime minister through Discord. Sushila Karki elected as PM. Which is some sort of relief. I feared a autocrat.  Day 6 - Day 7: China is yet to acknowledge PM Sushila Karki. China is suspecting foul play as KP Oli had been to SCO and all of this happened just after that.      Now I am very much in distress. I feel that, Nepal is Ukraine. Balen is the new Zelensky and China is the new Russia. I dont want to think negatively but the situation ahead seems to be very dark and we will have to take steps cautiously. There are a lot of hatred here and Social medias are fueling it. None of the GenZ were born during the writing of the constitution. There were lots of revolution that was endured by current revolution Maoist Revolution, Madesh Revolution etc. But now it seems everything has gone to waste and there is no constitution here in the country.

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not ‚Äúrevolution,‚Äù it‚Äôs not ‚Äújustice,‚Äù and it sure as hell isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe voice of the people.‚Äù It‚Äôs mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn‚Äôt make you brave‚Äîit makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that‚Äîsurrounded by a wave of so-called ‚Äúyouths‚Äù who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let‚Äôs not sugarcoat it‚Äîthe so-called Gen Z ‚Äúwarriors‚Äù hiding in the mob weren‚Äôt heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country‚Äôs social fabric. He still can‚Äôt step foot in certain countries because he‚Äôs internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he‚Äôs propped up as a ‚Äúleader.‚Äù  Let‚Äôs be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn‚Äôt an accident‚Äîit was a setup. While Deuba‚Äôs family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don‚Äôt get it twisted‚Äîthose sharpshooters in the crowd weren‚Äôt just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres‚Äîformer insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let‚Äôs stop pretending this was ‚Äúthe people rising up.‚Äù It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist‚Äîthe one who drowned this nation in blood‚Äîwalks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don‚Äôt for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn‚Äôt that Deuba suffered humiliation‚Äîthe real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn‚Äôt a flower; he‚Äôs a weed choking the soil of Nepal‚Äôs democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too na√Øve to realize they‚Äôre being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||CIA & India Agents involved in chaos!

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4. Retirement age and term limits: This is a must, we need a clear retirement age for the public positions just like other jobs.     These sort of things are fundamental of any country, without getting the fundamentals right we cannot expect our country to do better. We have a chance to make things better, lets take this chance.|||also i think! what lessons can be learned from Bangladesh last year?|||Garni nai ho vani presidency system lyauni.

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

What the man didn‚Äôt do or didn‚Äôt say. 2. What people expected him to do.  The man himself has said enough in his posts.   It‚Äôs what, he DIDN‚ÄôT do that impresses me the most about him. Saying ‚ÄúNo‚Äù is harder than saying ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, when everyone wanted him to say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.  (Think about this.)  He put out only a couple of posts, which I think served as guide posts during the revolution.   1. He was the first widely known public figure (that I know) who defined who Gen Z was and gave his support to the protest. 2. When the tempo rose, he clarified that Gen Z should lead, he accepted Sushila even when all of his cultists were going crazy about making him the interim PM.  Removing himself from the picture, brought focus back on the revolution and the task ahead, rather than turn the confusion situation, even more confusing with a popularity contest as a side gig.   There is a lot of things to think about and I think in time we can all make sense of it all.   That‚Äôs my two paisa about him.|||Leading KTM municipality vs leading the nation are totally different. The followers of Balen urging and rushing him to lead 'right now' and come out by 2PM are the same people who will criticize him within one year if he were to be them PM someday. They don't have patience and want to see changes immediately.  Personally, I would like to see him running in the upcoming election as deputy/vice roles first and not immediate PM role...assuming how parties will be formed and if there are any good lead independent candidate who will run with him. He's one of those few worthy to be PM but this is not his peak yet. He just became a mayor like 3 years ago and he still has a lot to show to the general public. If and when he wins to the election, it will be his peak and he has high chances of being a two term PM...assuming two term limit will be in place hopefully.

Yes it is definitely an opportunistic behaviour by balen.

The moment anyone spoke up, they tried to shut it down and let‚Äôs not even start on the behavior of their hardcore supporters(jholey as we call them).  Even leaders like Balen need to address this with their own supporters, as do all the new representatives entering the upcoming elections. They must say publicly that they welcome criticism, will reflect on it, and use it as a tool for improvement. Leaders should make it clear to their base: don‚Äôt bully or silence people for simply asking questions or raising concerns. Do not perform character assassination against someone just for criticizing. After all, in a democracy, freedom of speech is our right.  At the same time, we the general public also carry responsibility. We need to recognize the difference between constructive criticism and defamation. What we must not do is fall for propaganda, spread rumors, or engage in baseless character assassination.  And if we realize that our criticism or questioning was wrong, we should have the courage to apologize in the same way we raised the question. After all, apologizing will never make you small. It‚Äôs just a simple five letter word: ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù A word that can and should be spoken from both sides.|||Just because you‚Äôre against the system, doesn‚Äôt make you Balen-Supporters. Balen has no experience. Balen should wait and gain some experience. Criticism is a backbone of democracy and one must welcome it.|||EXACTLY. They lack this ability to critically analyse any action of any leader. Like no one is perfect and no one is a good. Let's be honest. Let's criticize people for their actions. People should be held accountable for their actions. Most importantly, leaders who run our nation. If we don't point out their wrongdoings, will they ever stop? Nepalese have such a bheda mindset, istg. Let's be more aware and let's know how to discern leaders and their actions.   By criticizing these leaders, we aren't hating on them. We're trying to bring awareness so that they won't repeat the same thing again and can do things better for the country.|||They need to be aware party KO jhole become jhole because they were andabhakt of party leader ( just like they are blind follower of balen rn)|||I think holding politicians accountable is crucial.

This is what I‚Äôve been saying for some time. Like the post says, I‚Äôve also been labeled as a party ko jhole and what not. Even here in this sub, people have called me jhole lol just because I questioned him.  I am a Balen supporter. I supported him and did my part by sharing about his campaign on social media and making everyone aware about it. And I was super happy when he won, I still am. But I‚Äôve been criticizing him on various points that I find valid. The top one is communication.  During the election, he constantly criticized Bidya Sundar (the previous mayor) for not communicating publicly. He even said that once he became mayor, he wouldn‚Äôt be like that and would stay in constant touch. He proposed starting a ‚ÄòMayor with the Public‚Äô TV program and even set aside a budget for it, but nothing has happened. He hasn‚Äôt given a single interview.  And then come his jhole supporters who always argue with the same line: ‚ÄòPailai kei chaieko ho.‚Äô With that logic, we should never question anyone. Just look at how Balen has become now, he just posts one-sided, no-context Facebook statuses and nothing else.|||Balen is a hypocrite in my opinion, like he encouraged the protest and even promised to provide a safe and secure environment for the protest but when things turned south he vanished like horn from a donkeys head|||Finally someone spoke about this, belun has literally become a god complex among some people out there, which is kinda concerning, the only time he speaks is to not let his adhabhatka interfere in every other stuff out there.

Moreover, Sagar Dhakal‚Äôs brother has been working actively to eradicate the dictatorship of these political parties. Maybe your parents are bootlicking those rotten political parties, so you only see what Balen has never done and will never do.

One word from him has many consequences in such a movement. He is very clever and very wise; unlike Harka Sampang, though I like Harka as a person.

I mean yesterday when trying to choose a representative for GenZ nai testai vayo, everyone questioning everyone, representative candidates fighting with each other, and mind you there were less 1000 people there. Went to another server, same thing there. And of course no common interest in these two channels as well. I did raise that concern since everyone was fighting, in the chat because no one was ready to listen, just shout, that there are thousands of people who were involved, even if someone did get elected in that very server, what's to say others who were not there will follow. I left after that, have not joined it today. I see representatives of GenZ already doing interviews elsewhere so what is the point here. Also I refrain myself of any opinions since I have absolutely zero knowledge on any politician or their views or visions or nothing, but was just there to see who got elected and what was the conclusion.|||Mujii ‚ÄúGen z movement ‚Äú itself fundamentally wrong xa, monarchy maan paraune pani gen z xan uniharu ko kura sunnupardaina?

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**¬†The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**¬†If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**¬†If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**¬†If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not ‚Äúrevolution,‚Äù it‚Äôs not ‚Äújustice,‚Äù and it sure as hell isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe voice of the people.‚Äù It‚Äôs mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn‚Äôt make you brave‚Äîit makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that‚Äîsurrounded by a wave of so-called ‚Äúyouths‚Äù who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let‚Äôs not sugarcoat it‚Äîthe so-called Gen Z ‚Äúwarriors‚Äù hiding in the mob weren‚Äôt heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country‚Äôs social fabric. He still can‚Äôt step foot in certain countries because he‚Äôs internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he‚Äôs propped up as a ‚Äúleader.‚Äù  Let‚Äôs be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn‚Äôt an accident‚Äîit was a setup. While Deuba‚Äôs family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don‚Äôt get it twisted‚Äîthose sharpshooters in the crowd weren‚Äôt just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres‚Äîformer insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let‚Äôs stop pretending this was ‚Äúthe people rising up.‚Äù It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist‚Äîthe one who drowned this nation in blood‚Äîwalks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don‚Äôt for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn‚Äôt that Deuba suffered humiliation‚Äîthe real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn‚Äôt a flower; he‚Äôs a weed choking the soil of Nepal‚Äôs democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too na√Øve to realize they‚Äôre being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||Prachanda and Baburam are India's puppet.

This has been ongoing for more than two decades. Behind the few visible figures, there are countless others who have either assisted them or benefitted through their association‚Äîranging from major brands in Nepal to traders. For example, Sher Bahadur Deuba‚Äôs son and his sanitary pad importing company stand as an illustration.  They have institutionalized corruption by appointing foreign ambassadors based on party loyalty and financial gains, extending even to the transfer of bureaucrats to preferred locations in exchange for bribes and other undue benefits. The problem is not limited to the political system alone; bureaucrats, too, require checks and balances. A mechanism must be established to regulate the power of bureaucrats over politicians. Since bureaucrats are permanent stakeholders, their influence is even greater. One effective way to mitigate this is to appoint domain experts as ministers‚Äîfor instance, a professional civil engineer as a minister cannot be misled about the cost estimates of a construction project.  There remains much to be done. Moreover, these political parties will attempt to form alliances before elections, bringing forward the same candidates and restoring the same exploitative system. Therefore, the first and most meaningful reform must be a change in the electoral process, with the inclusion of a ‚ÄúNOTA‚Äù (None of the Above) option.  Further accountability can be ensured by eliminating political appointments to certain positions. At present, even temporary (karar) appointments are made based on party affiliation rather than merit. As a result, even highly qualified experts are compelled to seek political approval. The recent appointments of Vice-Chancellors at B.P. Koirala Institute in Dharan and Gangalal Hospital are prime examples.  In addition to these issues, several other structural flaws persist.

People watched her speech where she said stuff like, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?‚Äù  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still don‚Äôt have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we don‚Äôt have the right connections.  We don‚Äôt get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, it‚Äôs still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? That‚Äôs probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  We‚Äôre out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor people‚Äôs kids not boil?  On top of that, there‚Äôs already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent. Because this have  been suppressed for so long, and now the mindset is like ‚Äî ‚ÄúIf we can‚Äôt reach anywhere through the system, then we might as well destroy it.‚Äù  And even if some third party tries to trigger people, the truth is, it was already there deep down in their subconscious.

The police decided to fire shots injuring many and killing 17 people which was intentional as well as, they wanted to trigger a mass violence in the country ( so basically the police was a part of the whole scheme as well ) 4. Nepali people are sentimental and we all had our blood boiling because of the killings on innocent kids and it broke a country wide massive violence which is exactly what they wanted ( prachanda and rabi) 5. Sept 9 hell broke loose on nepal we managed to overthrow the government but did you think why none of the maoist party politicians were attacked or where were they even hiding? Not a single clue meanwhile politicians of yemale and congress were specifically targeted ( not talking about houses burning but the politicians being dragged out)  I couldn‚Äôt care less about yemale or congress they can rot in hell but something big was being plotted from the beginning. 6. Notice how prachanda posted in support with gen z and has been silent and underground ever since? Not js him, the whole bunch of politicians of their party are gone 7.Why police were their puppets as well? Cause the police who injured hundreds and killed kids completely gave up on sept 9 they didn‚Äôt even try as if they wanted a nationwide violence. Fine  they didn‚Äôt come out to control the protest but did  they resign from their jobs that day ? NO ,so why was the prison not secured ? Cause their MAIN AGENDA WAS : TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE NATIONWIDE PROTEST AND FREE RABI FROM PRISON AND THE DOWNFALL OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT.  8. RABI has now come up with a letter that was issued for his release BUT if the letter was issued officially why wasn‚Äôt he the only person out of prison? Why free heinous criminals by destroying the prison? CAUSE IT DISTRACTED  THE PEOPLE from him . If you follow the timeline after he got out the prison news of other prisoner escaping from different jails came along .  9. The situation started getting worse after then , we GEN Z weren‚Äôt out till night but as you know people kept destroying things looting everything they found , who were they? They weren‚Äôt US they were JHOLEY of prachanda and rabi 10. Now rabi is acting like a messiah and people are buying it . He legit shook hands with people that we were protesting against , to get the grihamantri seat back then . HE AIN‚Äôt NO SAINT  11. How can a man who says he is devoted to a country enjoy their time being praised by his JHOLEY‚Äôs while such criminals escaped because of him? All i have to say is If he is genuine why not surrender yourself to the police and proceed legally cause the people jasle uslai allegedly fasako ho tni haru power ma chaina so it should be quite easy right? We all know his history with prachanda as well  lets not turn a blind eye to that . So in conclusion The GEN Z protest has been massively exploited by prachanda and rabi for their own cause . Obviously prachanda won‚Äôt be on the front lines this time but he is the one pulling the strings and Rabi is the one dancing and selling the act to people. WAKE UP LADS  FYI I don‚Äôt support any political party i was so happy at first seeing the government crumble but now i think we didn‚Äôt see the bigger picture being plotted .",

My soul hurts to see violence, arson, anarchy, and the loot and burning of our national properties. We, Gen-Z, seem to have won, yet feel lost. Hope feels lost. Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? I‚Äôve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we can‚Äôt let our nation fail.** We can‚Äôt let our nation burn. We can‚Äôt let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**¬†    **1) We lay down our weapons.**¬†  We came in peace, we protested in peace, and we‚Äôve always wanted peace. We shall end this in peace. Be it known that anybody inciting violence isn‚Äôt part of our movement.¬†    **2) We extend love.**¬†  Love towards our brothers and sisters, love towards our nation, love towards our neighbours, our society, and the opposing side. The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.¬†    **3) We wear white.**¬†  White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that we‚Äôve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.¬†    **4) We have hope.**¬†  Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.¬†    Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.¬†    Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.¬†    Sincerely,¬†  Pantji, a Gen-Z¬†|||It's easy to topple government but difficult to fill the vaccum.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**¬†The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**¬†If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**¬†If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**¬†If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Army should not interfere in internal problems|||‡§Ü‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡•Ä‡§≤‡•á ‡§ï‡§§‡§ø ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ó‡§∞‡•ç‡§õ‡§®‡•ç ‡§®‡§æ‡§ó‡§∞‡§ø‡§ï‡§≤‡§æ‡§à? ‡§ú‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ ‡•®/‡•® ‡§ù‡§æ‡§™‡§°, ‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§π‡•Ä ‡§†‡§æ‡§â‡§Å‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ã‡§≤‡§®‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§ñ‡§ü‡§ø‡§è‡§ï‡§æ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§≠‡§è ‡§¨‡•á‡§π‡•ã‡§∏ ‡§®‡§π‡•Å‡§®‡•ç‡§ú‡•á‡§≤ ‡§ï‡•Å‡§ü‡•ç‡§®‡•á ‡§•‡§ø‡§è ‡•§|||asti belai ma aayera yo radaban harlai yesari handeko bhaye singhadurbar jaldainathyo|||Obviously Nepal is not a democracy.

But this time, to suppress the voices, he used his goons to burn down the homes of the people who rose up against him.  He left the DRN to be PM, taking his so-called \"jhole.\"|||I'm from Dharan.   I know Harka from close, I voted for him. He isn't even capable of being the mayor. The position of Prime Minister is far beyond his dreams.He should have been elected as a ward member first, and then he should have practiced for a higher-level position.However, due to the frustration of the people, voters chose him. It wasn't because of his popularity, but because of that frustration.Look at his recent activity, he cannot coordinate with the 20 members and bring the budget in on time   And so called the Sharaman, it's the illusion, of the corruption|||Not being a racist, but most people who are blindly supporting him are from Mongolian ethnicity ( mostly Rai and Kirati) .|||Even Kulman is a corrupt person. NEA le u bhanda thulo ghus khor dekhekai chaina. Hamro ghar ma loadshedding kam bhayo, maney. Tara Gen z do think he's some kinda hero. Hamilai politics ko knowledge nai chaina.

He is asking people that he can bring the change so what the bid deal in that. So people need a leader who is just become a puppet of other, no transparency. The nation need a leader who can proudly say yes this is my country I will die or live for it. He is the one. My suggestion is do not judge based  on sentiments.|||His position is great till the mayor, no need to drag him any further.|||This needs to spread forward, he is a narcissist, somebody who has no sense of how to speak , god complex.  publicity stunt doesnot makes person a great leader.|||We‚Äôre falling into the same trap again. Don‚Äôt buy into the smooth talk and fake charm ‚Äî check their track record instead. Balen and Harka might be moody, but at least they‚Äôve been tested in real battles. I‚Äôm done with sugar-coated leaders; give me someone who spits facts and takes action. Doing the right thing in a rotten system is never easy, and that‚Äôs why tried-and-tested leaders matter.

But unfortunately for him, the public is educated. 100 years ago and this guy would have started the Sampang regime üòÇ|||Anyone who actively seeks power does so because they want to be seen and heard. That drive inevitably brings with it shades of narcissism and opportunism. So rather than fixating on intentions, it makes more sense to judge politicians by their results. On that front, Harka has proven he can deliver. His rough almost mobster-like style may be off-putting to some but in a city like Dharan which is home to hotheaded Kirati / Hill Janajati majority that kind of toughness isn‚Äôt just useful, it‚Äôs necessary.  That said, he is neither qualified nor capable enough to be considered an ‚Äòideal‚Äô Prime Minister. Nonetheless, when compared to Rabi Lamichhane Harka represents a comparatively more credible alternative. Personally not a fan of either.|||Tei ta Mayor ko pani layak xaina veda janta lai pm chaiyo re|||Dherai yo jaat ko haru furkirako cha muji haru K hi pachi k huncha kei tha chaina gu bhareko muji haru ko|||Guys Primeminister is not joke role. It is representative of country. He must have some internal support and dealing capacity.|||The common thing between Harka and Balen is that both are independent and hardworking, and that is what people recognize and that is what the revolution wants. If a person has done good work, both of them will be appreciated hands down. You have to look at the picture from both sides. Secondly, please ask your senior citizens or elders from a different generation. They have seen history and faced the consequences. The real issue is bringing change in the constitution, i.e., a representative should not be above a certain age and should be allowed to seek votes only for one term. Take that in writing from the concerned representative, live, and show it to the world clearly. Also, please do not discriminate by saying someone is from the ‚ÄúStone Age,‚Äù as such remarks can hurt the sentiments of people who are not from cities.|||Yes, I don't know what to. It feels like waste of my taxes. Now even democracy is undermined. I think this will repeat again in 10 to 15 year|||He is not educated, he does not have the capabilities of being head of government.

Even he ignored and disagree with the Loan to be used from ADB ( Asian Development Bank ) . 6) He speaks and protest on his own way BUT still he has some flaws unlike us even the moon has flaws then he is still human . ra usko flaws we can ignore . May be he isnt eligible for primeminister as the lacks some level of diplomacy and its skill but he can be best suited in ministries like : Industry and commerce , Infrastructure, Agriculture .

U all r pretty blinded by jealousy and his popularity. Only in a lifetime we get such leader.

I'm a Software Engineer and I have to perform multiple hacks to just receive payments from my international consumer and I also need to constantly fear that the hack might be caught and my account be sanctioned.   I think this is the great opportunity for us GenZ to discuss about possibility of hassle-free international payments for solo or team businesses.

            "body": "We all know most ISP here lock the router and dont give any access to the web management. As a devops practitioner and someone who is very invested in homelabbing and selfhosting, locked router was my biggest achilles heels.   Requirement: A secondary router, you main router will stop working and secondary router will only work through LAN1 port.   Solution: All you have to do is create a ticket on vianet app stating \"Turn the router into bridge/modem only mode\". Someone will call you back, just ask them username and password for PPPOE and use your secondary router to configure through PPPOE instead of DHCP. Tada!!! you now have full control over your router.   Bonus 1: You can flash openwrt with Luci web interface and you will be able to configure anything you can think of. extra advantage is you can configure mesh routing without needing a special router. I have managed to easily flash it on my Mi router and a old tp link router, search for guides depending on your model or ask Claude or Gpt to search specifically for your router model.   Bonus 2: Vianet gives you globally accessible IPV6. That means you are free from CGNAT. Use this to access your home services without needing any relay like Cloudflare Tunnel or Tailscale VPN. Direct connection means no extra latency and maxed bandwidth and you can use this to host online game servers to play with your friends!! But for some reason Worldlink doesnt connect sometimes. Ncell and ClassicTech seems to have no problem tho. I am not sure if NTC offers IPV6.  Bonus 3: Host a adguard DNS server and configure your openwrt to use it as your default DNS server. This way you will have adblocking for your whole network. Your parents and old grannies wont have to see ads no more (wont work with Youtube app - use revance) and it keeps them safe from online phishing and malwares. You can also set some static ip and adguard to block some websites like gambling and pornography if there are minors in your household.   Disadvantage: The only downside of this is your main router will turn pretty much useless. Internet wont work through wireless and extra ports. So dont forget the vianet tech support to turn off the DHCP and wireless on the main router. Since my secondary router also has 2 ports only I had to invest some money on extra gigabyte switch.   I know some of you will appreciate this so this is my appreciation and giving back to this community. enjoy and have fun!! Happy Dashain!!!

Government should have a very strict consumer protection law which include modification of DNS in ISP issued router.  P.S. I recommend to use nextdns as it allows more flexible configuration and selective lists to block or allow sites. It has free quota of 300k queries but it is enough for 3-4 users who use internet all day as most sites normal people use are the same 3/4 sites these days.|||NO WAYYY. i didn't bother to ask them about modem mode LMAOOO. i hope worldlink lets me do the same. i plan to have a virtualized router and AP for wireless, then ipv6 port forwarding.|||Guys haru k gardai xau ho , homelab ki ???

I already have a secondary Mi 4a router with OpenWRT + Adblock + HTTPS DNS Proxy configured. I'll create a ticket right now. However, a question on IPV6, does it need a separate ticket or I will get the IPV6 after turning the ISP's router into bridge/modem only mode?|||I mean you don't even have to do anything about the main vianet router, you can just turn off the wifi of it and use secondary Mi Router as the main thing.|||Good job on this. Did it impact your internet speed in any way?   Also, directly exposing your local network and devices through IPv6 is not really a good idea. Make sure to reverse proxy it or add additional layers of authentication like TailScale. Or, you can setup usage of keys for SSH and fail2ban for access control limits. I have a setup that works without the need for a dedicated IPv6 and it‚Äôs much safer ngl.|||And what about nettv, does it also work after this?|||Ipv6 is being implemented in NTC, old BRAS are being replaced to support it|||Nokia ko worldlink router xa euta tara lock xa any solution?|||Hmm.

So I have a camera that allows remote viewing. However, when I connect the camera to Vianet, remote viewing doesn't work and I need to be within my home network to view the feed through the app.  The remote feed viewing works in Worldlink and Ncell's mobile data.

I am just a sincere, hardworking youth who remained silent because too many opinions create a ruckus. That's what I believed till September 8. When I went to the protest, it was all fine until they started firing. When you're in the battleground, all moralities go out the window. Yet, I did not throw a single stone at anyone and I am proud of that. I remained with the group who were peacefully protesting infront of the army van, I helped people with water to wash their face, tried picking up litters. The main point is I tried being a responsible person. But the moment I saw people being carried to the hospital with their blood spattering the streets, I fucking lost it. In retaliation, my protests became more louder. I came home late at night, tried my best to repost as many information I could. At one point, I felt like people should burn down the entire ministry down, all these nepo-babies should be brought to the streets to teach their parents how it feels to kill someone's child. I was furious, the word being an understatement. But seeing this people getting mob justice was what I never wanted.

            "heading": "The Shrinkhala Khatiwada I knew at Harvard",
            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada‚Äôs classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.¬†  We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking‚Äìmuch to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in¬† Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate -¬†the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala‚Äôs approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.¬†  Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn‚Äôt mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‚Äòhelp‚Äô. One time, she even said airily, ‚ÄúI wash my own dishes, you know.‚Äù She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala‚Äìa beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth‚Äìlingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don‚Äôt intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‚Äònepo babies‚Äô who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).¬†  Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It‚Äôs a troubling idea to think that despite what‚Äôs happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

I never liked her naak ma singan adke jasto boli.. And always felt she has a cunning personality that clings over you until she can no more use you for her advantage..  Sisan literally dodged a  bullet.. all thanks to her greed though..|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn‚Äôt some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake ‚Äúbeauty with brains‚Äù narrative. Do you guys remember Niti‚Äôs big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let‚Äôs not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala‚Äôs prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it‚Äôs her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let‚Äôs be real- Sisan wasn‚Äôt perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they‚Äôd known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn‚Äôt even exist. This just proves it- they weren‚Äôt just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can‚Äôt just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala‚Äôs career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav‚Äôs narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What‚Äôs the lesson we can learn from here ?

Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don‚Äôt even make sense to begin with. Don‚Äôt know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don‚Äôt even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It‚Äôs so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It‚Äôs astounding what the world has come to and it‚Äôs deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can‚Äôt be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn‚Äôt she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It‚Äôs better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has.

She knows the bashing on Tiktok or Instagram doesn‚Äôt matter as long as her professional side stays spotless, especially where she might work with people internationally who will never know the side of her life in Nepal that‚Äôs been exposed and torn apart ever since the truth came out.  It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs playing this endless game of Ludo, always climbing the ladder, polishing her image as she goes. But at the same time, you can‚Äôt help but feel she‚Äôs only ever a roll away from hitting 98 and sliding right back down the snake.|||We wont know if what you claim is true.

These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!!

This is valuable for those of us who were shocked and skeptical about her success right from the day she got into limelight. I watched her view on Youtube yesterday and couldn't get past a minute of that video, she is clearly playing victim and trying to play the game.  Nope! she doesn't deserve any chance at all.  The students that I know personally who went to Harvard, MIT and many other prestigious institutions had grit, determination, belief in hard-work, may be little bit of luck but most of all they had \"humility\". They NEVER used their \"Harvard degree\" or Ivy league label to show off. It's those who want to fame and fake pride that put up social media posts to show off their diplomas. Honestly, it was very very clear even before she went to Harvard that she was on the wrong side of fame game.  For the longest time I thought it was a generational difference, since there are many other Harvard students who have publicized themselves in several Youtube videos and they are all Gen Z, and as a Gen Y (Millennial) observing this trend seemed justifiable.  However, Shrinkhala was building a house of cards and the fact that she had the audacity to publicize and put Sambhav Sirohiya in the limelight using Harvard freebies was just laughable a few years ago.  Like you pointed out, the fact that she still has 900K followers is troubling for sure but let's hope those are just her fake followers (some % are bought/in-organic followers, some her closest elite allies like \"Other Miss Nepals/ Businessmen/political affiliates etc. and some her enemies) as they say, **keep your friends close and enemies closer.**|||I heard that B.arch is the easiest subject to get at Pulchowk and that too for a girl as they have separate reservations for women. Yes she must be smart because to get that you need to work hard.  But the image she tries to portray being you know the perfect, hardworking,real and independent girl always sounded fishy to me.  Miss World organization saw through her, so didn't let her go to the final round. There is no substance in her words and it  sounds exactly like a politician speech. Idealistic statements with no action. Look at the legacy of previous Miss Nepal winners. Most of them marry rich businessman and secure a rich, lavish life. Miss Nepal itself feels like a joke...|||First of all, there was no government scholarship. She lied to you guys so she could appear smart. She has now publicly claimed that she paid her tuition with her influencer income. But we all know where the money came from.|||I have a similar story like Shrinkhala‚Äôs on Nepal‚Äôs current president‚Äôs granddaughter (he has 4 and i‚Äôm talking about the one studying at the University of Texas in Austin). Its not easy to get in there and even if you do its one of the expensive schools there. Talking about her Nepal bachelor‚Äôs days, my friends studied with her in KU in nepal in b. arch, and so many said she cheated on exams (A LOT) just to pass. later she worked for the nepal government and came to US for conferences and presentations ü§°. now she has started her master‚Äôs at UT austin, funded by corrupted money. she removed her instagram posts about her prior foreign visits and her recent UT Austin orientation day, and even deactivated her linkedin account.  Now she‚Äôs posting on instagram and facebook, after the new PM was appointed, congratulating her and thanking the president grand dad for this revolution. it‚Äôs crazy how these unethical people still have the audacity to do all this.  (Source: from college friends and family members, and as those of us who are directly impacted by this revolution in nepal, we are not going to stay quiet against corruption and the unethical hypocrisy going on for a long time)|||Also the harvard blog lol|||What was her gpa?|||Most of her followers in isnt are fake and paid tho|||If you guys want social awareness of Nepal's issues, you should write fully in English.

Like I get it that she had 1M followers but she wasn't really like an influencer. How could she claim that she is the most influential person in Nepal. If she actually got 3 crore then maybe I should also be an influencer.|||Why isn‚Äôt anyone asking her this - how much taxes did you pay in 3 crore income? Income at this level is taxed at 39% in Nepal. Don't try to fool us - the taxes are supposed to be paid by you, not by the brands as you claimed. I want to see your tax returns. You claimed to be honest and talked about corporations evading taxes several times in your interviews. Can you show us that you paid income taxes for the money you claimed you earned as an influencer?|||Sisan dai dodged a bullet ‚Ä¶|||Glad you shared this all.

She used to go around Harvard telling everyone that she received a prestigious Nepal government scholarship to fund her education. She lied about receiving the scholarship s she can appear smart amongst other students who got there on their own merit. She kept quiet for a long time when Nepali people asked her about her educational expenses. Now, all of a sudden, she is claiming she funded it with her own influencer money.¬†|||My mom generation dont even know the name shrinkhala|||So I assume your story is true. I also studied in the states and I know how expensive it can get.   So how did she funded her education considering Harvard which is an ivy league school is extremely costly and on top of that, her lifestyle itself is on the high end. So..  In that case, even you since you studied in Harvard. How did you fund your education?  Just curious. A reply will be great since there are hundred of replies.|||Remember that education in Nepal is based on how well you do...based on your caste. I have heard that a lot of exams are predetermined by the ruling caste. This corruption is so bad that even well-educated people are falsely given a bad grade. While the latter is given a high passing grade. This type of discrimination is not only evil but can takes one's life. HK student commit suicide because of academic pressure.

The internet is dangerous and anyone can sit behind a screen make up stories and try to drag someone down just for attention. if you are really who you claim to be and if what you re saying about her is real then u need to show somethin that make sense. we need actual proof that you're a real person and that your story is true. and to be clear i 'am not asking for private or sensitive information i 'am asking for verifiable proof that doesn't expose personal data. post something that proves you are real AND U ACTUALLY KNEW HER not just a vouge words from behind an anonymous screen's.  you could show a public Harvard profile or alumni directory link with your name on it or simple photo of a Harvard ID or an official enrollment or graduation letter. without something like that, this is just baseless gossip. the internet is full of people who spread lies to ruin others, and that's exactly why nobody should take your words seriously without real evidence. if you truly care about the truth you'd stand behind your claims publicly. otherwise, what you're saying is just another reminder of how dangerous and misleading the internet can be when people use it to spread rumors without accountability.|||Give us some proof OP.

They exude your bitterness towards her. I think you envy her followers ( which you have mentioned a lot) and her beauty, its common for ugly people to have this jealousy.

You creating a burner account to throw dirt at her shows your pettiness as well.|||So she was just like an ordinary college student like all of us, so what if she wasn‚Äôt a studious/intellectual kid, still she was an opportunist, many of us are & maybe that turned out in her favour. And there is nothing wrong with this. She was a title holder that‚Äôs why she could be getting benefited after that. Plus, getting into Harvard is not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea no matter how much money one wishes to spend. Frankly speaking, linking her Harvard degree with nepotism& corruption is making ordinary people like us into more likely believing her part of the story. Targeting her is only gonna make her more famous, still 900k+ followers believe her part. She is getting sympathy from people as people are still forgetting about the real agenda and getting jealous about her getting into Harvard.|||i mean knowing she did try to contribute to nepal rest of the thing was from the breakup scandal right , i don't know about the beauty though everyon is beautiful you try to find it !!!the system will surely benefit her , but a lot of people are unaware of transparecy can't connect the dot in larger scale if she can do great things with her face that has been blessed and for the achievement sh won once title ie miss nepal, she should do great things for the nation in upcoming years and time and hope she get equal value from the scandals!! and serve !!!|||[deleted]|||Still Beautiful though",

We keep repeating the same mistakes because people get blinded by shiny new faces and ignore anyone who actually knows what they‚Äôre doing. Experience doesn‚Äôt mean someone is corrupt it means they‚Äôve been in the trenches and survived. Throwing it away just to see if a ‚Äúfresh face‚Äù can magically save everything is how you crash a country.  Nepal isn‚Äôt a playground. Leadership isn‚Äôt about hype, popularity, or being young and ‚Äúgreen.‚Äù It‚Äôs about surviving the chaos, making tough decisions, and knowing where the landmines are. If you think a rookie can do that better than someone experienced, you‚Äôre dreaming and the whole nation will pay the price for it.",

Even if they have the intention and will to do so (like many of us want), they do not know how to run a country.

The thing is they have a lot more to learn and they will, with time.       This situation would not have happened if there were transfer of power to youth in timely manner. Now the rising youth leaders do not have experience because these corrupt politicians did not allow that.      What we need is a system where corruption should now be absolutely dreaded, seeing how corrupt politicians had to run away for thier life. They have to realize that people will not just punish the corrupt polticians, they will also punish whoever was responsible to prevent that.       There now needs to be a collaborative development with young leaders like Balen and experienced people like Sushila.

The child will have access to education and almost everything another child can ask for. We have belief that the child carries spirit of Taleju Bhawani, which gives the child immense power. Again, in an age where we have lost our belief, I cannot prove it.  The kumaris I have visited emit strong aura (i may have been brainwashed to feel this). But she does have to be disciplined (i dont mean someone disciplines her). The child is treated with utmost respect by the best people in a homely environment.   Aba before age of 15 16, Manang Mustang ghumna khasai koi jaadaina hola (only speaking for myself) After she is no longer a Kumari, she can go whereever she wants to.

Jay Desh|||We should support female pope in Vatican gender equality let's goooo!!!|||What about the rights of Nuns... We should talk about this also|||Kumaris: A common doll for everyone.   A 3 year old child has no idea what she is getting into. She cannot grasp what a normal childhood is, what is right and what is wrong. The only thing she knows and does is based on her likes and dislikes, which is heavily depended upon how her parents/surrounding elders dictates.   Ani about 'No complains' from past Kumaris:   Newari culture is super sensitive. You cannot say anything against their culture. Otherwise, you'll have to face \"Tom n Jerry\" like people. I think, every ex Kumaris understands this at some point. With this much pressure along with the grooming done from a very young age, I don't think anyone dares to speak up. Which basically means none of us know what they really feel inside.    Well, of course, keeping in mind how they're thrown away once they reach a certain age or goes through ü©∏. At least, a life time opportunity to be a Kumari where they could renounce their position if they don't feel like it should be a way.   They don't preach, they don't teach, they only show up during jatras. I've never seen Kumaris actively participating in rituals or any sort of activities. Yestai ho vane, why not create a statue of a Kumari for the rest of our lives and stay quiet???|||Also it adds to the stereotype that period blood is impure|||Yeah the 1sttime ever I saw Kumari it was not aww like I hoped but pity to the \"Living Goddess\" she had the look of not a girl her age but of an \"ice princess\" in anime. Like I have never seen such a sad expression ever probably cause she cant smile or cry.|||i think no newari person feels that being chosen as a kumari is a bad thing and they have ripped the kid of her most deserving childhood, she has a great life in kumari house fully taken care by her parents, she also gets educated within the kumari house, apart from her kumari duties, providing blessings to people which is a small time of her day and appearing in festivals she has a normal fun life.  The only thing you should feel bad about is her parents who now have to be her full time care takers probably having to leave their jobs and careers and move into the kumari house with her.||| The Living Goddess tradition of Nepal is a complex institution rooted in centuries of culture. While modern concerns about child rights are valid, the practice is governed by strict rituals and has evolved to address contemporary welfare standards. Here are the key facts:  1. The Selection is Meticulous and Considered an Honor:  ¬∑ A Kumari is chosen from the specific Shakya clan of the Newari community, a Buddhist goldsmith caste. ¬∑ The selection process is incredibly rigorous. Candidates must meet 32 strict physical perfection requirements (e.g., eye shape, voice quality, hair color) and demonstrate a fearless and serene demeanor (e.g., by not crying during a ceremony in a room of 108 ritually sacrificed animal heads). ¬∑ For the family and community, her selection is not a punishment but the highest spiritual honor.  2. The Role is Central to National Culture and Unity:  ¬∑ The Kumari is not just a religious figure but a national symbol. ¬∑ Her most important public duty is during the Indra Jatra festival, where she blesses the President of Nepal, providing divine legitimacy to the state in a ceremony that blends Hindu and Buddhist traditions. This is a key event for national identity.  3. Significant Reforms and Safeguards Have Been Implemented:  ¬∑ Education: By law, the Kumari now receives a formal education from private tutors within her residence. The government provides a monthly stipend specifically for this purpose. ¬∑ Family Presence: Contrary to isolation claims, her family (typically her mother) lives with her throughout her tenure. ¬∑ Financial Security: Upon retiring at puberty, the state grants her a lifetime pension. As of recent years, this is approximately NPR 10,000 per month (roughly $75 USD), along with a lump sum of NPR 1 million (roughly $7,500 USD) to support her transition. ¬∑ Successful Reintegration: Former Kumaris like Dr. Chanira Bajracharya, who served until 14, have publicly spoken about their positive experiences, pursued higher education, and built successful careers, demonstrating that life after the role is viable.  The Kumari tradition is a deeply embedded socio-religious institution. It is factually inaccurate to frame it simply as the \"isolation\" of a child. It is a state-sanctioned, culturally sacred role with defined rituals, significant community support, and legally mandated provisions for the girl's education, family life, and long-term financial security. The debate around it highlights the global tension between cultural preservation and evolving child rights, but the practice itself has demonstrably adapted to modern norms.|||I ain't newar but also I think aaba yesto kura chai parents haru le vhaneko ramro hami third party le vhannu vhanda pani . look if kumari ko parents le chahanu hudaina vhani tyo kumari ko candidate mai na leraunu parni ho . so parents lai kehi problem xaina , kumari le as a normal human being ni basna paunu hunxa after completion so I think we are no one to question sodhna lai|||What about the tradition of marrying off daughters into the inlaws house?|||After giving this some thought question is of a philosophical one. What freedom does a child have?  What life does a child choose? Isn‚Äôt everyone forced and fed their parent‚Äôs beliefs?   Also, can you give some evidence of abuse?

I asked myself the same question and the answer is not much.   I disagree with your claim that the Kumari‚Äôs are discarded. They are always welcome. What it shows is the core principle of Buddhism that nothing is permanent. All things, even being revered as the living goddess, comes to an end.

Khaire ko documentary haru herera brainrot kura nagara na. Not everyone is privileged to become kumari and nor they are selected randomly. The family members themself have to fill the form and there's a long running selection process. Only a certain clan of newar can become Kumari. There are lots of inhuman and child abusive traditions going on all over. In case of kumari they get highest level of love and respect. They can live with their parents, they can play, they can watch TV, they can even play video games. It would be better if you watch podcasts of ex kumaris it's really helpful. I used to think same like everyone calling this inhuman before but they are living the normal life as you and me. And the fact that you can't speak up being kumari is totally false, yes you can't but only in jatras and other religious ceremonies, do you speak up during sharad and other pujas(it's prohibited to talk during sharad if you don't know). Go visit sudurpaschim hundreds of girls are being raped during their chhaupadi bas. Go visit terai Muslim villages girls at the age of 15 are getting married and at the age of 21 they are booned with 3 childs. Ex Kumaris themself enjoy being kumari and love to live their that phase again. If they are fine, their parents are fine no need to talk about that. Now the rules and prohibitions are amended.

How many injustices do females have to suffer in the name of culture, tradition and religion- it never crosses anybody's mind.|||Ask ex-Kumaris if it felt or was cruel. Others life always looks cruel and difficult from outside point of view. If their parents don‚Äôt object the tradition, who are you as an outsider to object it? Are you saying you love someone else‚Äôs kid than their own parents?|||Do the parents not have any say in this?|||This is sick|||I feel like more people should be aware (not trying to disrespect the culture)|||OP, you‚Äôve raised a really important point. To those insisting Kumaris are always ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù or dismissing criticism by belittling others, few things we can reflect on:   1. How much do we actually know about child psychology and development, especially at such a young age when experiences shape a lifetime? 2. Yes, a Kumari is worshipped as a goddess now but when her time ends, how does a goddess step back into an ordinary life? How do peers treat her? How does she even make friends? 3. With isolation and the constant expectation to suppress emotions, what happens to her social, communication, and interpersonal skills? Who helps her navigate that later? 4. Does she ever get space to express her own feelings and thoughts or is silence part of the job description? 5. We‚Äôve all seen videos of new Kumari, some barely three years old, literally asleep in full dress during rituals. How on earth can a toddler be burdened with divine expectations when they can barely stay awake through it? 6. As Nepalis, many of us defend dal bhat tarkari because it‚Äôs what we grew up with it feels untouchable. (I know it‚Äôs not the same but for reference) For a Kumari, this role is all she has ever known. So how would she even recognise or articulate what she‚Äôs missed out on, when she never had the chance to experience it? 7. And let‚Äôs be honest do we really believe someone put on a pedestal that high, surrounded by cultural pressure, guilt, and shame, would openly talk about the negatives of being Kumari? Yes, things have changed there‚Äôs more education, some family contact,but none of that cancels out the developmental and human rights concerns we‚Äôre talking about.  And honestly, the comments here kind of prove the point: we were never really taught to think critically. Instead of having an actual discussion, people are throwing around ‚Äúbahun,‚Äù ‚ÄúChristian,‚Äù or ‚Äúother cultures‚Äù like that somehow answers the question. When we turn conversation into belittling, blaming, or name-calling, we‚Äôre not defending culture but normalising this behaviour. I mean how hard is it understand you can agree to disagree without all these?|||Actually the closest thing that happens in the west like this is children beauty pagents  AT LEAST, at the very least, this Kumari affects one child over a years. USA child beauty pageants produce so many|||I think this is so cruelüòû a kid should not be isolated from the society, and should not be sit there to just take photo with tourists ..|||People talking about normal childhood and growing up \"normal\", a lot of misconception here.  Goodness flows through Kumari.  She is worshipped for being the medium of taleju bhawani. They are taught that they as an individual are not god, but the goodness that flows through her is what makes her worshipped.  And calling Kumari as a \"virgin goddess\" is stupid and a complete disregard of religious belief. It's a literal translation not a literary translation.   A lot of misconceptions have already been debunked.  Therefore they are able to integrate back into society well. They have good societal support . They are mentored, taught and are well taken care of. They themselves have immence respect for their religion and tradition.  If you think being a Kumari is wrong, you simply look at other practices in other religions. Nuns are not allowed to marry or consummate. Denying the right to marry and consummate can be considered as an oppressive practices denying one from their human desires. In radical Islam, burka, multiple marriages, denial of human rights for wemen.  While such petty comparisons are stupid themselves, what I want to say is we are worshipping female power. We are actually looking at females as devine. Not simply blind worship.   Nothing about today's childhood is normal.  You see young boys and girls sent off to boarding schools as normal? It's more isolating depressing. Parents just sticking their child to an iPad, or a hyperactive parent forcing their child through multiple activities (music class, sports, extra activities) even when their child may not want to to them, and pushing their child to extremes, putting their child through ridiculously high expectations, so that they can fulfill own ego( yes I've seen it happen).  A lot is not normal in so called modern normal childhood.   A lot of narratives and propogandas have infiltrated our thinking. Be water and explore into the culture. A lot has been written about Kumari from a propogandist and religious infiltration viewpoint.  A lot has been written to criticize our culture and ostracize ourselves from our religion and culture. Beware.|||Yeah agreed I thought it was just culture as a child but now I see it as different|||Sadhguru has spoken about the Kumari tradition of Nepal. It is an understanding about God making.

Over last few days, I read some articles, listened to podcasts and was surprised to learn that Kumaris until 2000 A.D. were not given any education. That must have set those girls back and must have struggled to transition. A case was registered in high court of Nepal but the court didn't make decision against Kumari tradition but asked to reform. There have been quiet few reforms.  This little kid is Royal Kumari now and will be raised by care takers and I guess her parents can visit her once a week. Atleast Kumaris of other places have option to live in their own houses.

Personally I have next to no clue who Sumana is, and normally I'd think that makes her a good candidate because there's nothing but positive vibes so far. I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both.

She is the one who has been abroad for so long and has so many foreign connections and relations that even if she  doesn't want interference, there will be far more foreign interference with her as a leader.

BTW, Gen Z doesn‚Äôt just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didn‚Äôt exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who weren‚Äôt even present for the protests claim we don‚Äôt know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldn‚Äôt even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, ‚ÄòWe have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server you‚Äôre all listening to is just for public discussion‚Äô. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal.

Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.¬†    **3) We wear white.**¬†  White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that we‚Äôve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.¬†    **4) We have hope.**¬†  Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.¬†    Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.¬†    Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.¬†    Sincerely,¬†  Pantji, a Gen-Z¬†|||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger.

When the rich don't know the limits of expoliting the poor these are the consequences. Every freaking nepali politician only gave a fancy speech but never worked towards development of the country. The crowd going crazy is the result of fustration building towards government and the younger generations seeing nothing for them in nepal. All these people in power had to do was work towards uplifting of people rather exploit them, if they would have done 10% as well that would kept the citizens happy.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Why not sagar Dhakal?|||Yesss|||Just promote it in your social media handle|||K bhairacha yarr discord ma pm choose bhairacha|||Ahile non political manxe thik huncha...her or Dr ‡§∏‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Å‡§ï Ruit.

So make a solid campaign and bring your leaders out.   My few concern: 1. Why is meeting being held in closed door? Who are the Gen Z representatives?  2. If all the cabinet ministers are in army barrack then why the meeting is being conducted inside the barrack?  3. Why is there delay in dissolving parliament?  4. There is no common voice among Gen Z. It is starting to already fracture into different sub groups.   5. Sudden rise in anti- Gen Z sentiment in various online platform.  Democracy is your hands guys, protect it at any cost. Be organized and move forward cautiously.|||is it just me or lipsync seems a little off?|||Jatha deuba yawn handai xa|||![gif](giphy|1lk1IcVgqPLkA)|||what‚Äôs happening|||Jasley k vaney ni, kata kata paxi regret hunxa jasto lagirako xa man ma|||Boost|||[deleted]|||Damn mad respect.|||Boost|||boost|||But people are saying she is India‚Äôs puppet!

A message from a clear headed Indian with zero agenda. Please understand these below points very well: 1. While activism is a great way to excel IDE agency understand that it‚Äôs a double edged sword.  2. More often than not, vested interest groups will take this sword and swing it at people in power to cause unrest under the protection of protestors, bringing the protestors a bad name  3. Never under estimate the collective stupidity of a society, it is very easy to get a mob of moderately charged people to go crazy and get into arsony 4. Even a coward will act like an opportunistic lion in a mob  5. Get a hold of your ngo sector that is spreading anti govt hate. Every government is corrupt in this world but your echo chamber is so strong that some vested group could take so much advantage of your youths mind. This is very dangerous.  6. They have to make an example of all the people who have damaged the state property. In India yogi the CM of UP rounded everyone up and bulldozed their homes over night and has warned that if you destroy govt property govt will destroy your property 7. Even now in India we keep seeing anti social elements working in the ‚Äúsocial‚Äù sector and trying to topple Modi or bring disreputation but Modi Ji is a master in handling these people and he has kept a special name for them ‚Äúandolan jeevi‚Äù  Please take care of your country folks.  I‚Äôve known a lot of Nepali friends in India, all of whom are very friendly, proud, hard working people. This riot is definitely not to be allowed to form an image of your country.  Just look at the optics of it all as an international person. Protesting isn‚Äôt bad but who will want to project an image of Nepal where your parliament is on fire? Is this a message? Or is this symbolic?   Decide better dear friends.|||We are fucked up now things are going out of hand we should stop for now .

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen. When the police and the army refused to shoot, the old order was already finished.__  **I am not a political scientist, just a hobbyist, I may be wrong.**|||High possibility OF THISSS|||Maybe but not entirely garnu bela tod fod garyeu parliament jalayeu manxe jalayo ani accountability line bela ma aru lai dosh,Kati economical crisis hunxa aba|||Prachanda and men who are into dopamine shits|||No|||Him or Gyanendra.

Its grand architecture and historical importance make it a true pride of Nepal.The news of Singha Durbar burning yesterday is more than just the loss of a structure it feels like the loss of a piece of our soul. This tragedy is a blow to our heritage, to our economy, and to our sense of unity as a nation. The damage cannot be measured only in money, but also in the irreplaceable cultural and historical value that has been destroyed.  I feel deeply saddened by this loss. Singha Durbar was more than walls and pillars it was a living monument of Nepal‚Äôs journey, struggles, and achievements. Watching it go up in flames is heartbreaking for every Nepali who loves their country.",

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. üò≠üò≠2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye üò≠|||3 brsa vo dashign namanako|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

One for the 165 candidates who are elected directly (first-past-the-post), other for the party. The votes that party gets determine the remaining 110 members via proportional representation.  so aba either we need new political parties to replace the existing ones by Falgun 21, or we have to vote for the same parties again.

Yet, instead of letting darkness define his life, he chose to climb ‚Äî not just mountains, but the greatest challenges a human can face.He became the first blind person to scale the Seven Summits ‚Äî the tallest peak on every continent, including Everest.How did he do it? ‚ú® By trusting his team ‚Äî who guided him with words and sounds. ‚ú® By using his hands, feet, and tools like ‚ÄúBraille‚Äù to read the mountain. ‚ú® By refusing to bow down to fear or limitation.Erik‚Äôs story is not just about mountains. It is about the Everest within us all ‚Äî the weight of doubt, fear, and resistance.He shows us that true sight does not come from the eyes, but from clarity of purpose and unwavering determination.",

Balen is not coming until the parliament is not dissolve.  Parliament cannot be dissolved. Parliament can be disslove by Prime Minister and currently no one is Prime Minister. Other way to dissolve parliament is by president. But president has to try and appoint PM before dissolving the parliament, how can he appoint  1. By the party holding majority seat  2. By colliation  3. By the member of party who has most seat in the parliament  4. Anyone who can obtain vote of confidence  Now here is the point, everyone but Prachand has resigned and the party who has most seat in the parliament is Moist and before dissolving the parliament he will become the Prime Minister if president is dissolving the parliament.  Best thing is to not dissolve the parliament and form interim government leaded by Sushila Karki. But there are some fools who do not understand these things and are opposing Karki to be care taker of the country.  I hope you understand the mind of the mastermind 'Prachad' and spread this message as soon as possible so that interim government can be formed led by Sushila Karki.",

Most Nepalis obtain citizenship at 16 while others obtain citizenship later. Why can't the freaking Election Commission (EC) get the data from that source? Some mechanism to incorporate those that were missed out might still be needed, but it would drastically reduce the work for the EC.",
