            "body": "IтАЩm from Sri Lanka. I lived through our 2022 Aragalaya. People around the world respected us because we fought the system without destroying our own country.  At Galle Face, we protested for 124 days straight. Over 100,000 people joined at times. But hereтАЩs what made it different:  We camped peacefully on Galle Face Green. There were kitchens feeding thousands, medical centers to help anyone sick or injured, book libraries, free internet, and even coffee corners. We built a community, not chaos.  We sang songs, danced, made art, and watch movies тАФ yet we never destroyed property. Some critics complained we were тАЬtoo playful,тАЭ but that didnтАЩt stop us from being fair, disciplined, and organized.  When we finally entered the PresidentтАЩs House, we didnтАЩt loot. Not a single priceless portrait worth millions was stolen. Not a single fire was set. People laughed, swam, sang тАФ but respected the place because it belonged to the people.  Even when ministersтАЩ thugs attacked us, the world saw who was violent and who wasnтАЩt. That moral high ground is what gave us victory.   Now, I look at Nepal and I see motorbikes burned, parliament on fire, leadersтАЩ houses torched. Brothers, ask yourselves: is that really a fight for justiceтАФor are you burning your own tax money, your own peopleтАЩs livelihoods?  Because hereтАЩs the bitter truth:  The cost of every destroyed building, every burned vehicle, will come back to you in higher taxes, worse inflation, more suffering.  If you destroy what belongs to the people, the world will stop listening to your message and only see the flames.  Today you may cheer, but tomorrow youтАЩll be paying for the very damage you caused.   Please think back. DonтАЩt let your anger blind you. Sri Lanka proved you can bring down corrupt leaders without burning your country. Hold on to your moral strength. DonтАЩt make your children pay for your rage.  From one struggling nation to another: donтАЩt turn your fight for freedom into self-destruction.",

But,  We did not have a clear path moving forward, we allowed the revolution to be stolen with new corrupt faces, and now we are in a new stagnating period.  To keep this short, do not let your revolution be hijacked by opportunists, be smart, there will be hard times coming, support each other protect each other, don't fall for false promises and quick gains, countries will try to intervene with softpower, be careful from that, but also be pragmatic, not everything will work 100%, but never give up on your dreams.

But the constitution needs to be amended.|||I have been saying and posting about this since yesterday, there was perfectly constitutional way to handle this, sushila karki could have been made the incharge of a power anti-corruption body, and interim- PM could have been chosen from inside the parliament. There are others in the parliament outside of the 3 parties, why wasnt a single MP considered for this, the only mandate the PM would have is that of a holding an election. Why put shushila karki???just because some youtuber with a law degree suggested it and we had a discord poll was no reason to derail from the constitution. This cost of this derailment could be so heavy on us. Frankly speaking I think this happened because Balen didn't want it to happen. He feared and didn't take the leadership because if he can't deliver, his popularity will nose dive, and he feared if a sitting MP even outside of the 3 party were elected interim PM the very fact that they saved this train-wreck of a nation would mean that that interim PMs popularity would rise and would seriously challenge his chances in the next election. Thus what to do???? Elect an old ex judge , she  wouldn't be a challenge to the messiah BALEN in the next election. Who cares about the constitution. Fuck the constitution.|||It is Jover.

            "body": "I keep seeing a lot of posts and comments on social media calling for the immediate dissolution of parliament. I get where the frustration is coming from тАФ people are tired of the same old faces, and the mood is тАЬthrow them all out.тАЭ But hereтАЩs the problem: our constitution doesnтАЩt actually allow that in the current context.  HereтАЩs why:  1. Parliamentary System 101 Nepal runs under a parliamentary system, not a presidential one. This means the government (Prime Minister + Council of Ministers) is accountable to parliament, and parliament itself is the elected body representing the people. You canтАЩt just dissolve it like a Facebook group тАФ there are constitutional conditions.   2. When Can Parliament Be Dissolved? The 2015 Constitution (Article 76 & related provisions) says dissolution can only happen if:  A Prime Minister canтАЩt be appointed (no majority, no coalition, no consensus).  The appointed PM fails to win a vote of confidence.  After exhausting all options, parliament canтАЩt form a government.     Basically: Dissolution is the last resort, only when itтАЩs impossible to form a government.  3. What About Now? Right now, even if the sitting PM has resigned, parliament still exists and can elect or endorse a new PM or interim government. Until those options are fully tested and fail, dissolution is unconstitutional.   4. Why Keeping Parliament Matters Even if people hate the current MPs, they were legitimately elected. Throwing them out without due process creates a vacuum, which risks the army or monarchy stepping in under the pretext of тАЬstability.тАЭ ThatтАЩs a bigger danger than keeping an unpopular parliament as a placeholder until elections.   5. The Real Reform Instead of chanting тАЬdissolve parliament,тАЭ the smarter demand is to:  Force a fixed election date within a short timeline.  Put strict limits on the interim governmentтАЩs powers.  Demand transparency and monitoring during the transition.   That way, peopleтАЩs anger translates into systemic reform instead of an unconstitutional shortcut that could backfire badly.   TL;DR: The constitution doesnтАЩt allow dissolving parliament just because weтАЩre angry. Dissolution only happens if no government can be formed. Right now, parliament has to remain until elections are formally called тАФ otherwise, we risk a dangerous power vacuum.",

Most probably donтАЩt even know whatтАЩs going on. This is not meant to offend you. Nepal for most people here is like a sleepy little afterthought of a country. We are very ignorant that way.   We hope all ends well for Nepal and it gets on with human development and rising out of corruption and poverty. You guys need to understand that you are fighting base human nature when trying to bring about change through revolution. That will take a lot of sacrifice. But you guys already know that and have a turbulent history to learn from.  Politics is a game of cloaks and daggers. Long, hard road ahead. Saying that, our media is pure unadulterated trash, agreed. Our political class is equivalent to elite level maggots. A lot of Indians who come to your beautiful country are also pure trash, considering the kind of behaviour that they exhibit and are capable of. India is not a perfect country and there exists no such perfect country in the world.  Nepal is connected, literally fused, to India in every which way possible. DonтАЩt let propaganda steer you in the direction of an uncertain future because of this heated atmosphere. Antagonising your most important and fundamentally existential relationship is only going to make things worse. This is time to let cooler heads prevail. Hope your Army holds it together for you guys, till democracy can take hold again. IтАЩm certain that will happen.   India and Indians donтАЩt want to take over your country or use force to fix things there. We have our own issues to take care of. Our political class is probably 100X more corrupt and brazen than yours.   Nepal needs to be preserved at all costs, and that only you guys can do. Maybe you can teach us a thing or two about fixing our country. We sure can do with some awakening of our dormant or even non-existent will to fight injustice as a society.

One for the 165 candidates who are elected directly (first-past-the-post), other for the party. The votes that party gets determine the remaining 110 members via proportional representation.  so aba either we need new political parties to replace the existing ones by Falgun 21, or we have to vote for the same parties again. This is more complicated because Nepal is not just Kathmandu. The political players which we have termed jholey will be active outside Kathmandu.

We have to take control of the narratives eg. Dui din mai Sudan Gurung Indian bhaisakyo, NGO chalauxa, congress ko manxe ho and so many false narratives were created. Harka dai is trying to take control of the narrative by making it ethnic nationality based, political parties will try to dismantle the movement esari nai, many things will happen from today to the election date  4. Another alternative to amend constitution might be via referendum tara that will be complicated too  This is what we need to do. 1. We have to guard our mandates. There must not be any renegotiations. Maoist movement failed because of too many negotiations. 2. Our movements and pressure must not fade. We have to carry them out continuously. 3. We have to prevent any fragmentation in the groups.  I know these are hard things, but we have defeated the broken system in two days.",

They are shaping the narrative in a way that only benefits them. If we let their lies dominate, tomorrow they will win again, and all our protest, sacrifices, and unity will go to waste.  ThatтАЩs why your support is absolutely critical. We can change their narrative тАФ but only if we act together. The first step is to fight back with the truth. Make memes, share facts, expose their corruption, and flood social media with reality. Overwrite their lies with our truth.  This fight is not just about today тАФ it will decide NepalтАЩs future. So do your part. Expose them. Overthrow their lies with truth. DonтАЩt let their narrative fool us again.",

All they are asking is to save the constitution.  Nepal is currently facing a crisis it has never seen before. The vacuum is not just political but structural as well. There are people such as Prasai who are trying to repeal the constitution based on this vacuum.   The constitution has flaws, but it was made by us, the people. There are a few spaces which the political parties created to make sure they would always be on power. But the 2-day revolution has changed everything. Now we have the power to amend the constitutions in such a manner that it cannot be manipulated by anyone.  I urge you guys to make sure that our next steps does not harm the nation further. Buildings can be rebuilt, but the spirit of the country cannot be.  Save the constitution.  Note: I declare that I have never been a political cadre of any party.",

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4. Retirement age and term limits: This is a must, we need a clear retirement age for the public positions just like other jobs.     These sort of things are fundamental of any country, without getting the fundamentals right we cannot expect our country to do better. We have a chance to make things better, lets take this chance.|||also i think! what lessons can be learned from Bangladesh last year?|||Garni nai ho vani presidency system lyauni.

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

The protest that took place against a corrupt government resulted in the loss of 20 individuals, some of whom were minors present in school uniforms, and hundreds were injured.   This is what we got for speaking against a government that has leeched off of taxpayers' money. We request an immediate dismissal of Sweta Rijal's candidacy at your esteemed institution.

ItтАЩs tragic, because they also have families back home and face the same struggles as the rest of us. They should be victims of this system too, yet they show little compassion or critical thought about whatтАЩs happening around them. Why are there protests in the first place? I refuse to believe they're blind to people's frustration and the direction the country is heading.  I still remember when we joined a protest 14тАУ15 years ago. The police confronted us aggressively, and as kids we were too confused to react. Fortunately, we just stood there processing and visibly confused, and they left тАФ but I still shudder to think, *what if our reaction had been different?* TodayтАЩs young protestors are in the same position, pure in their intentions, simply voicing frustration without wanting harm.  And honestly, credit must go to these protestors. They know exactly what they are standing for, unlike us back then who needed adults to organise us. I donтАЩt see how demonstrations could be any more peaceful than they already are тАФ especially when the very leaders being protested against have blood on their hands from before this generation was even born.|||Yo bhatey haru kahi gayera sitcha holani|||randi baan machikne haru|||I mean this tracks, they only like when you're corrupt|||Its not andolan anymore its war|||We want death or at lease exile of KP Oli and other taukes.|||Randi haruko photo, name, address patta lagau.|||khate haru mug haru padne bela ma padenan aile mug ko mug ko chak sugera manche lai dukha dinxan. timi mug haru le esto dukha dekhnu paros jatha haru. maa gali pani dina sakdina timi haru ko aama ko galti haina timi haru jasta janmie. aama lai k thaaa. tara kailei bhalo nahos timi haru jasta ko. timi haru marna pani na paos bachna pani na paos.|||shamelss dogs of government|||Machikne radi harlai lakhetdai marnaparne|||Thuiyaa police vanauda haruuu|||you radiko ban harulai agolauno man xa|||ma sanga pani ganhune bhaye, kassam mardinthe radieekko ban|||Mathi bata aako order re ????

My opinion is that these are among the big players manipulating the nation, we should not be swayed by their sweet words and should see them as suspicious characters, this is the time to take initiative.       Violence, vigilantism and anarchy should stop, but we shouldn't forget the sinners.       The teacher's movement was so peaceful, i can't stop thinking about it. In any case we should focus on cleaning up the trash we made yesterday and the trash people who induce political conspiracies and terror.|||I've rarely heard bad about Jhalanath Khanal. All news i have read of him shows how honest he was and i thought he is one of few good politicians. I don't think him being involved in any corruption and I believe he mostly avoided it. He was good kind man, syals just dragged him around and overshadowed him. He wasn't a bad leader too, he was a weak leader instead and after kp oli took over and pushed him down he just accepted it and didn't cause any dispute or problems. His only mistake was he was one of the leader of yemale but in his defence what else could he do. If he leave the party, others may start a conspiracy or blame him for their wrongdoings. So he just stayed in his given position silently. He should not have been target for gen z at all. But his family member became a casualty, he had to run but his wife got trapped/unsaved in the fire and then her injured body was dragged on the road and thrown inside the ambulance and then she died. But what happened oli and his associates and his jholays? His house burnt but he didn't even suffer a scratch. He resigned and got away without getting a pinch. Sher bahadur and arju were beaten but still people helped them to escape. They will treat the injury and get help from some country to stay as a fugitive. The worst were not burnt alive or shamed publicly or got stripped off their clothing. While innocent kind person like jhala nath khanal's wife had to suffer intoxication, suffocation, excessive heat, first degree burns and later succumb to the injuries. The motive of movement was needed and right, the approach can be justified but the actions and aftermath were just unnecessary overkill. The big dogs survived and fled, but their puppies were shamed tortured and mercilessly beaten. If only they had done the same to sher bahadur and kp oli as they did to those other ministers.|||I hope every so called GEN Z who are celebrating victory be safe.. come no harm to them or their family since police is busy doing their work now and criminals are roaming freely..

Rather than looking outwards to pin ЁЯУМ the chaos, it's important that we self reflect.

The whole revolution thing was a regime change operation like which happened in Ukraine, Libya, Bangladesh. They used the youth for regime change to install their puppet government. Sad to say that our leaders are groomed to be used in the politics in the future. Looks like our neighbor used their proxies in Nepal to overtake Deep state regime change operation from the west. If we are not vigilant, we are going to get another Zelenski and Nepal may turn into another Ukraine. UN forces and Indian forces are very active to get into Nepal. Things change rapidly in geopolitics. Achieving this revolution within 24 to 48 hours is in itself very suspicious. All seems like preplanned operation. Our youth needs to be more vigilant.┬а|||how they punched that old woman was uncalled for...Nepal sinked to a new low.

In this case, it is not like that. Protestors ( violent non gen z's) they had given everyone time to evacuate the building, but she did not evacuate. Most likely cuz she was scared of the mob outside. The people outthere assumed it was empty, hence they started burning it. When people realized that women was inside the building, people came to her rescue. Unfortunately, she suffered from burn, reported to be 15% do far. Fortunately, she survived and is recovering. Even though I do not agree with what happened, I hate the narrative of us just burning a women.   Second where was this empathy for the kids that got shot? Where was this empathy for mothers and fathers that lost their children? Where was this empathy for grandfather and grandmother that lost their kids and grandkids? Where was this empathy when millions of people suffered? Where was this empathy when our voices about to be silenced?   Yes, we screwed up but before coming out and trying to shame or guilt trip us, ask yourself are you empathetic cuz you saw the video of her or are you genuinely empathetic cuz of the act? Do we all need our sufferings recorded and made public for people to feel empathetic?   Also ask yourself, people chased, dragged and beat corrupted politicians, but not of them were killed. Do you think people would burn and kill some corrupted politicians wife? If they would, then you would have seen lots of dead politicians by now.  Also I just checked your profile, you are an Indian. How can an Indian citizen empathize with Nepali people when you have not suffered under the regime we suffered. Don't just blindly follow what is being shown in your media. Do some research and you will find the truth yourself.|||Fuck, People are starting to say Save the Constitution. Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**┬аThe President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**┬аIf no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**┬аIf a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**┬аIf the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||I totally agree with this .|||Aa judai vako mancha lai kati coti marchas, sala indian godi media ko Veda.|||[deleted]|||Why are indians interfer in our business again?

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**┬аThe President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**┬аIf no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**┬аIf a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**┬аIf the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

People watched her speech where she said stuff like, тАЬWhatтАЩs my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?тАЭ  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still donтАЩt have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we donтАЩt have the right connections.  We donтАЩt get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, itтАЩs still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? ThatтАЩs probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  WeтАЩre out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor peopleтАЩs kids not boil?  On top of that, thereтАЩs already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent.

Even he ignored and disagree with the Loan to be used from ADB ( Asian Development Bank ) . 6) He speaks and protest on his own way BUT still he has some flaws unlike us even the moon has flaws then he is still human . ra usko flaws we can ignore .

(**Bank run**┬аis a situation where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a bank simultaneously, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or financial stability. This can lead to liquidity problems for the bank, as it may not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands. Bank runs can create a cycle of panic, potentially leading to the bank's failure.)  The real pain starts after the protests have calmed. Economic crash is certain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh both went through it. Stock market/real estate crash, inflation and what not.  Whoever takes charge next, likely Balen, will need to address the pointless 'Greater Nepal' rhetoric and become a moderate on this issue. Thanks to Trump, India-China relationship is stable for the first time in ages. The only way Nepal has a future is pledge allegiance to both neighbour's.  Bangladesh under Yunus has been a pain in the ass for India. Nepal cannot make the same mistake.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.┬а┬а Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.┬а┬а Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||How credible is this info?|||Use bitchat for conversation.

            "comments": "We are living in a moment where anger is boiling over. People are tired of corruption, censorship, and being silenced. Many of us are ready to take to the streets on Sept 8. But before we move forward, we must stop and think carefully.  History has shown us what happens when we rush in without preparation. In Bangladesh last year, in Sri Lanka not long ago, ordinary people gave their lives while corrupt leaders fled the country with protection and comfort. Their deaths were forgotten within weeks, while the guilty walked free. If we are not careful, Nepal risks becoming the next chapter in that same tragic story.  That is why this movement must be different. We cannot afford to be reckless. We must protect our people, keep our voices peaceful, and make sure the world is watching every step so that accountability cannot be erased.  Here is what we need to do before Sept 8:  * Get international human rights groups, UN observers, and peace monitors involved beforehand so there are eyes on the ground. * Publish clear and peaceful agendas so nobody can label us as rioters or mobs. * Document everything with photos, videos, and testimonies. Every arrest and every injury must be recorded and shared. * Avoid following local leaders who are affiliated with political parties. Big parties will try to infiltrate, hijack, and twist this movement for their own gain. * Know who is truly standing beside you. Trust matters because infiltrators can turn peaceful protests into chaos.  This movement is about dignity, rights, and accountability. It is not about violence. It is not about revenge. If we lose focus, if we let anger replace strategy, then we risk repeating the same cycle where the powerful walk free and ordinary people pay with their lives.  Nepal deserves better. The world must see us not as mobs, but as citizens united for freedom and justice. If we do this right, our voices will be impossible to silence. If we do this wrong, we risk being forgotten like so many before us.  Stay safe. Stay peaceful. Stay smart.",

Ani Few weeks ago Prachanda b**ch also visited him in the jail. Who knows what do they discuss. Maybe this all is the plans of him to release Ravi.

She is the daughter of Chabi Rijal, a communist leader and Chief District Officer in Nepal, who recently ordered a shoot-on-sight against youth peacefully protesting corruption in Nepal. His orders have killed over 18 innocent people, injured more than 100 students, and more deaths are expected. This is pure fascism and a gross misuse of power. Young people in a peaceful protest were shot dead, which is totally unacceptable. While our brothers and sisters die in Nepal, Sweta Rijal has no right to study in the US with money from corruption. Her entire funding is from the money from corruption. The US, as a democratic country and a voice for the UN, stands for freedom and justice. Allowing her to stay contradicts everything the US represents. We are struggling to fight this battle in Nepal, and she must be held accountable. I urge you to investigate her visa and take necessary action to send her back to Nepal. Regards, Concerned Citizen from Nepal",

President in hiding and Army doing nothing, when the country actually needs them.    Sigha Durbar, Parliament Building, Supreme Court , all public properties that were not significant monuments but also held importance in history were burned along with all its documents . NO leader has come forward to lead , neither from Gen Z or Balen or Rabi or Harka or even Army. Everyone seems to be in a game of wait and watch and let the anarchy unfold.

I think you've never seen what corruption can cause, or you pretend not to!  I'm from Brazil, and I'll give you an example of what corruption can do to a society.    Here, I saw young people being shot in favelas just for supporting opposition politicians, yes, ordinary people being killed for supporting the other side.  People were and are arrested, tortured, and killed on the unjust orders of corrupt politicians and judges.  The media, also corrupt, manipulates public opinion with false narratives or half-truths, always favoring the state, especially abroad. This has caused enormous polarization in the country, in addition to promoting many unjust laws.  My country is overrun by crime, and there are criminal factions that control entire regions (with the explicit support of the state), and you run a risk when you go out at night, you know? You can be robbed and killed at any moment, and nothing will be done to the criminal.  Education is also of extremely low quality, which has caused an absurd cultural and moral degradation among my people, who today lack even the capacity to think critically.  Salary increases for politicians without social approval are frequent here, and nothing happens. Search the amount of benefits they receive here.  We recently had a scandal involving millions of retirees being stolen against their will by banks and public agencies. What was the government's solution? To create more taxes to pay without punishing those who stole, and to try to inhibit investigations by using public funds to buy off those who would investigate. Search for \"INSS Scandal\".  The current president (rejected by the majority) has actively provoked other countries, especially the US, to create an open conflict between the two countries, precisely to use this as an excuse to remain in power while putting the lives of millions of people at risk.    Anyway, I could spend all day here giving examples of the harm corruption has caused in the society I live in. I recommend imagining how many future geniuses, entrepreneurs, inventors, and exemplary people for humanity could exist here, but won't, thanks to the corruption of some.  Imagine how prosperous societies would be if there weren't corrupt representatives making absurd and selfish decisions to benefit themselves and control others.    I understand that violence blinds people, and it's unpleasant to see someone in this situation, but we need to understand that in today's societies, we have two sides, one side that wants to live and enjoy life peacefully, and the other that wants to use your life to live like gods.   So, what would you prefer?    The people of Nepal are absolutely right to act as they are, and their politicians need to see what true justice is. They acted wrongly, harming thousands of people, and now they need to be punished, something that would never happen without the use of violence.   The corrupt state would never punish itself, and military forces serve and exist precisely to defend the state and its interests, meaning they would never be punished fairly, and even if they have surrendered, the disaster has already been caused, this surrender is just a way for them to try to avoid punishment, however, sooner or later, they will stab society in the back, and guess what, if society doesn't act, nothing will happen to them and their crimes!  Soon my country will go through something similar, and you will be able to see that it is not about revenge, it is about justice, something that unfortunately is disappearing in societies.  There's no point in trying to appear morally superior, evil people exist and will continue to commit atrocities, and if there are no violent reactions against them, everything will only get worse.|||Ajai kutnu partyo mardeko bhaye huntyo.

I am just a sincere, hardworking youth who remained silent because too many opinions create a ruckus. That's what I believed till September 8. When I went to the protest, it was all fine until they started firing. When you're in the battleground, all moralities go out the window. Yet, I did not throw a single stone at anyone and I am proud of that. I remained with the group who were peacefully protesting infront of the army van, I helped people with water to wash their face, tried picking up litters. The main point is I tried being a responsible person. But the moment I saw people being carried to the hospital with their blood spattering the streets, I fucking lost it. In retaliation, my protests became more louder. I came home late at night, tried my best to repost as many information I could. At one point, I felt like people should burn down the entire ministry down, all these nepo-babies should be brought to the streets to teach their parents how it feels to kill someone's child. I was furious, the word being an understatement. But seeing this people getting mob justice was what I never wanted. They don't deserve the least of anyone's sympathies, but we still have humanity in our hearts.

Gen z never planned to burn or destroy public property and jails. I believe this happened due to the presence of other opportunistic groups.

Because of this, even their own people are now suffering from security issues like the release of 1200 prisoners due to prison breaks.

I mean gross national happiness instead of gross national product. I believe every single country on this planet should take Bhutan as a role model a little bit more. Where else in the world are citizens asked what their main problems are and what they want from the government? And later, citizens are asked how satisfied they were with the government's performance. I know it's a bit naive of me to make such a suggestion from afar, as a sheltered European who is not really familiar with the form of government in Nepal.

The most expensive clothes, the biggest cars, houses, and palaces. Flying to New York for dinner in a private jet, or to Monaco for F1, or around the globe in a yacht as long as a soccer field. And in the media, they try to appear close to the people, to be there for them, to advance the country by investing in infrastructure or new hospitals, etc. But no, a large part of your taxes ends up with the rulers themselves. The rich and powerful acquire more wealth and more power. Money rules the world!

You want to hand the country over to a rookie who has no clue how the system works, how politics works, or how to deal with the mess weтАЩre already in? ThatтАЩs not bravery, thatтАЩs stupidity.  We keep repeating the same mistakes because people get blinded by shiny new faces and ignore anyone who actually knows what theyтАЩre doing. Experience doesnтАЩt mean someone is corrupt it means theyтАЩve been in the trenches and survived. Throwing it away just to see if a тАЬfresh faceтАЭ can magically save everything is how you crash a country.  Nepal isnтАЩt a playground.

Now the rising youth leaders do not have experience because these corrupt politicians did not allow that.      What we need is a system where corruption should now be absolutely dreaded, seeing how corrupt politicians had to run away for thier life. They have to realize that people will not just punish the corrupt polticians, they will also punish whoever was responsible to prevent that.       There now needs to be a collaborative development with young leaders like Balen and experienced people like Sushila. Each and everyone's characters will show with time, for now, we have to seek for stability as soon as possible.|||If we fail to appoint her then external along with internal force will play and bring more chaos to the country.

I truly want Sushila Karki to be prime minister, but according to our constitution it's not possible. And if we ditch our constitution our country is open for invasion from other countries. So, what's the best option it's BALEN. I know that he won't be able to run for prime minister for the next election but it is a risk we have to take. It's already proven that our protest was the result of different politicians 'parties'involvement. So, let's play it safe and try to choose the best result for us. Already many Indian politicians are saying that they are ready to deploy an army if needed. It's not goodwill but an invasion. So it's best we know what we do for the country.  But if it's possible for her to be prime minister without disturbing our constitution then I'm all for it. I also want a good leader who will work for the development of the country.   Indian is already eyeing the district like Lipilekh and Limpadhura. If we take too long to make a responsible decision, they are favourites to win the case.   The country is already in chaos. So we must do our best to calm it down. We protested against corruption and got unexpected results. We are not ready for it. And we don't have time to think about it and make a decision. But, we must make a decision and make it work, isn't it all there is to it ?    It's not that I don't support \"Sushila Karki\" . She has my full support. But if it is disturbing our core rules set by our constitution. I just thought it isn't right. So it's my request all my fellow citizens ( not just gen-z ) to make a right decision.   But my final warning is that if we defy our current constitution ourselves. It will not be a suprise other countries take advantage of it. So we shall make a decision ourselves and take the best route possible. But you've my support to make her ( Sushila Karki) intrim prime minister. It is the best result seeing her experience on political field.   It might have been a bit long for the attention span of gen-z but i just want to say that, neither the constitution nor the national rules be any shorter ЁЯШК. So make your protest and blood of many worthy of something great. You've already done impossible without any preparations. So make a few preparations and make our country great again.|||Divide and rule going on same old tactics which works everytime.|||This stupid ando Balen supporter haru.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.┬а┬а Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.┬а┬а Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||Jaha Bhetyo tehi thok saley madarchod lai...|||Aaos na india ma ni nepali xan birsyo kya|||Bro timro yo pic use garey haii Tiktok ma vid halchu|||kun desh jala teta bebasta garnu parxa|||yo machikne lai samatna paryo jasari bhaye ni yellai bachne kunai adhikar xaina|||Bhagey ra canada nai ja la, canada ma nee xodnu hudaina.

Nothing was going to change if things didnтАЩt go south. Personally, I didnтАЩt see the government making any changes with a peaceful protest. Even when we look at history of the world, majority of peaceful protest start peaceful and end violently. No entity in power ever gives it up easily.  Change was what we asked for and change is what we are getting. Not exactly the way we wanted things to go but seems clear from the comments that we all knew, in the back of our minds, it was never going to be a straight road to Rome.

My soul hurts to see violence, arson, anarchy, and the loot and burning of our national properties. We, Gen-Z, seem to have won, yet feel lost. Hope feels lost. Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? IтАЩve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we canтАЩt let our nation fail.** We canтАЩt let our nation burn. We canтАЩt let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**┬а    **1) We lay down our weapons.**┬а  We came in peace, we protested in peace, and weтАЩve always wanted peace. We shall end this in peace. Be it known that anybody inciting violence isnтАЩt part of our movement.┬а    **2) We extend love.**┬а  Love towards our brothers and sisters, love towards our nation, love towards our neighbours, our society, and the opposing side. The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.┬а    **3) We wear white.**┬а  White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that weтАЩve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.┬а    **4) We have hope.**┬а  Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.┬а    Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.┬а    Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.┬а    Sincerely,┬а  Pantji, a Gen-Z┬а|||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger.

Personally I have next to no clue who Sumana is, and normally I'd think that makes her a good candidate because there's nothing but positive vibes so far. I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both.

She is the one who has been abroad for so long and has so many foreign connections and relations that even if she  doesn't want interference, there will be far more foreign interference with her as a leader.  We can not deny that .   3. Sumana did absolutely nothing as a health minister apart from stunts. Ministers are supposed to amend laws and execute them. could have done so much more .   4.

BTW, Gen Z doesnтАЩt just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didnтАЩt exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who werenтАЩt even present for the protests claim we donтАЩt know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldnтАЩt even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, тАШWe have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server youтАЩre all listening to is just for public discussionтАЩ. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal. Now that itтАЩs been confirmed everywhere and with Balen posting that the Gen ZтАЩs choice former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Sushila Karki is the right choice for interim prime minister of Nepal, we look forward to what comes next.|||https://new-nepal-voting.vercel.app/  Vote here or suggest names I can add|||For interim formation CJ Sushila Karki would be the perfect choice.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Why not sagar Dhakal?|||Yesss|||Just promote it in your social media handle|||K bhairacha yarr discord ma pm choose bhairacha|||Ahile non political manxe thik huncha...her or Dr рд╕рдиреНрджреБрдХ Ruit.

A message from a clear headed Indian with zero agenda. Please understand these below points very well: 1. While activism is a great way to excel IDE agency understand that itтАЩs a double edged sword.  2. More often than not, vested interest groups will take this sword and swing it at people in power to cause unrest under the protection of protestors, bringing the protestors a bad name  3. Never under estimate the collective stupidity of a society, it is very easy to get a mob of moderately charged people to go crazy and get into arsony 4. Even a coward will act like an opportunistic lion in a mob  5. Get a hold of your ngo sector that is spreading anti govt hate. Every government is corrupt in this world but your echo chamber is so strong that some vested group could take so much advantage of your youths mind. This is very dangerous.  6. They have to make an example of all the people who have damaged the state property. In India yogi the CM of UP rounded everyone up and bulldozed their homes over night and has warned that if you destroy govt property govt will destroy your property 7. Even now in India we keep seeing anti social elements working in the тАЬsocialтАЭ sector and trying to topple Modi or bring disreputation but Modi Ji is a master in handling these people and he has kept a special name for them тАЬandolan jeeviтАЭ  Please take care of your country folks.  IтАЩve known a lot of Nepali friends in India, all of whom are very friendly, proud, hard working people. This riot is definitely not to be allowed to form an image of your country.  Just look at the optics of it all as an international person. Protesting isnтАЩt bad but who will want to project an image of Nepal where your parliament is on fire? Is this a message? Or is this symbolic?   Decide better dear friends.|||We are fucked up now things are going out of hand we should stop for now .

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen. When the police and the army refused to shoot, the old order was already finished.__  **I am not a political scientist, just a hobbyist, I may be wrong.**|||High possibility OF THISSS|||Maybe but not entirely garnu bela tod fod garyeu parliament jalayeu manxe jalayo ani accountability line bela ma aru lai dosh,Kati economical crisis hunxa aba|||Prachanda and men who are into dopamine shits|||No|||Him or Gyanendra.

Built in 1908, it has stood as a symbol of our sovereignty, democracy, and national identity. For generations, it has been the place where decisions shaping our countryтАЩs future were made. Its grand architecture and historical importance make it a true pride of Nepal.The news of Singha Durbar burning yesterday is more than just the loss of a structure it feels like the loss of a piece of our soul. This tragedy is a blow to our heritage, to our economy, and to our sense of unity as a nation. The damage cannot be measured only in money, but also in the irreplaceable cultural and historical value that has been destroyed.  I feel deeply saddened by this loss. Singha Durbar was more than walls and pillars it was a living monument of NepalтАЩs journey, struggles, and achievements. Watching it go up in flames is heartbreaking for every Nepali who loves their country.",

By colliation  3. By the member of party who has most seat in the parliament  4. Anyone who can obtain vote of confidence  Now here is the point, everyone but Prachand has resigned and the party who has most seat in the parliament is Moist and before dissolving the parliament he will become the Prime Minister if president is dissolving the parliament.  Best thing is to not dissolve the parliament and form interim government leaded by Sushila Karki.

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4. Retirement age and term limits: This is a must, we need a clear retirement age for the public positions just like other jobs.     These sort of things are fundamental of any country, without getting the fundamentals right we cannot expect our country to do better. We have a chance to make things better, lets take this chance.|||also i think! what lessons can be learned from Bangladesh last year?|||Garni nai ho vani presidency system lyauni.

Just wanted to express supreme respect to you from Ukraine.   You're really cool!   We had protests in 2014.   We made lot of mistakes after succeded in throwing down Yanukovich in 2014.

After five years people were tricked and during war elected complete scammers after watching \"servant of nation\" series with current president in main role.   Now we get kidnapping peoples on streets by police and conscripted forcely to war or you can get out for $10k until kidnapped next time. People get beaten and sometimes murdered in basements by military guys supported by police.

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

AKA the daughter of a corrupt leader, the Chief Development Officer of Kathmandu, Nepal, Chhabi Rijal, who ordered gunfire in a peaceful protest that took place in Nepal on the 8th of September. The protest that took place against a corrupt government resulted in the loss of 20 individuals, some of whom were minors present in school uniforms, and hundreds were injured.   This is what we got for speaking against a government that has leeched off of taxpayers' money. We request an immediate dismissal of Sweta Rijal's candidacy at your esteemed institution. We, as Nepali people, condemn the actions of her immediate family and believe that her degree, funded by her very disliked father, will be of NO USE to our country.

He wasn't a bad leader too, he was a weak leader instead and after kp oli took over and pushed him down he just accepted it and didn't cause any dispute or problems. His only mistake was he was one of the leader of yemale but in his defence what else could he do. If he leave the party, others may start a conspiracy or blame him for their wrongdoings. So he just stayed in his given position silently. He should not have been target for gen z at all. But his family member became a casualty, he had to run but his wife got trapped/unsaved in the fire and then her injured body was dragged on the road and thrown inside the ambulance and then she died. But what happened oli and his associates and his jholays? His house burnt but he didn't even suffer a scratch. He resigned and got away without getting a pinch. Sher bahadur and arju were beaten but still people helped them to escape. They will treat the injury and get help from some country to stay as a fugitive. The worst were not burnt alive or shamed publicly or got stripped off their clothing. While innocent kind person like jhala nath khanal's wife had to suffer intoxication, suffocation, excessive heat, first degree burns and later succumb to the injuries. The motive of movement was needed and right, the approach can be justified but the actions and aftermath were just unnecessary overkill. The big dogs survived and fled, but their puppies were shamed tortured and mercilessly beaten.

Most likely cuz she was scared of the mob outside. The people outthere assumed it was empty, hence they started burning it. When people realized that women was inside the building, people came to her rescue. Unfortunately, she suffered from burn, reported to be 15% do far. Fortunately, she survived and is recovering. Even though I do not agree with what happened, I hate the narrative of us just burning a women.   Second where was this empathy for the kids that got shot? Where was this empathy for mothers and fathers that lost their children? Where was this empathy for grandfather and grandmother that lost their kids and grandkids? Where was this empathy when millions of people suffered? Where was this empathy when our voices about to be silenced?   Yes, we screwed up but before coming out and trying to shame or guilt trip us, ask yourself are you empathetic cuz you saw the video of her or are you genuinely empathetic cuz of the act? Do we all need our sufferings recorded and made public for people to feel empathetic?   Also ask yourself, people chased, dragged and beat corrupted politicians, but not of them were killed. Do you think people would burn and kill some corrupted politicians wife? If they would, then you would have seen lots of dead politicians by now.  Also I just checked your profile, you are an Indian. How can an Indian citizen empathize with Nepali people when you have not suffered under the regime we suffered. Don't just blindly follow what is being shown in your media. Do some research and you will find the truth yourself.|||Fuck, People are starting to say Save the Constitution. Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**┬аThe President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**┬аIf no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**┬аIf a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**┬аIf the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||I totally agree with this .|||Aa judai vako mancha lai kati coti marchas, sala indian godi media ko Veda.|||[deleted]|||Why are indians interfer in our business again?

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**┬аThe President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**┬аIf no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**┬аIf a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**┬аIf the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.

People watched her speech where she said stuff like, тАЬWhatтАЩs my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?тАЭ  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still donтАЩt have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we donтАЩt have the right connections.  We donтАЩt get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, itтАЩs still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? ThatтАЩs probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  WeтАЩre out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor peopleтАЩs kids not boil?  On top of that, thereтАЩs already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent.

(**Bank run**┬аis a situation where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a bank simultaneously, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or financial stability. This can lead to liquidity problems for the bank, as it may not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands. Bank runs can create a cycle of panic, potentially leading to the bank's failure.)  The real pain starts after the protests have calmed. Economic crash is certain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh both went through it. Stock market/real estate crash, inflation and what not.  Whoever takes charge next, likely Balen, will need to address the pointless 'Greater Nepal' rhetoric and become a moderate on this issue. Thanks to Trump, India-China relationship is stable for the first time in ages. The only way Nepal has a future is pledge allegiance to both neighbour's.  Bangladesh under Yunus has been a pain in the ass for India. Nepal cannot make the same mistake. Any wrong steps and a free floating Nepali rupee against the dollar would go from 140 now to 25,000 like similar countries in our GDP range. Probably worse since our economy is in much worse shape.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.┬а┬а Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.┬а┬а Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||How credible is this info?|||Use bitchat for conversation.

            "comments": "We are living in a moment where anger is boiling over. People are tired of corruption, censorship, and being silenced. Many of us are ready to take to the streets on Sept 8. But before we move forward, we must stop and think carefully.  History has shown us what happens when we rush in without preparation. In Bangladesh last year, in Sri Lanka not long ago, ordinary people gave their lives while corrupt leaders fled the country with protection and comfort. Their deaths were forgotten within weeks, while the guilty walked free. If we are not careful, Nepal risks becoming the next chapter in that same tragic story.  That is why this movement must be different. We cannot afford to be reckless. We must protect our people, keep our voices peaceful, and make sure the world is watching every step so that accountability cannot be erased.  Here is what we need to do before Sept 8:  * Get international human rights groups, UN observers, and peace monitors involved beforehand so there are eyes on the ground. * Publish clear and peaceful agendas so nobody can label us as rioters or mobs. * Document everything with photos, videos, and testimonies. Every arrest and every injury must be recorded and shared. * Avoid following local leaders who are affiliated with political parties. Big parties will try to infiltrate, hijack, and twist this movement for their own gain. * Know who is truly standing beside you. Trust matters because infiltrators can turn peaceful protests into chaos.  This movement is about dignity, rights, and accountability. It is not about violence. It is not about revenge. If we lose focus, if we let anger replace strategy, then we risk repeating the same cycle where the powerful walk free and ordinary people pay with their lives.  Nepal deserves better. The world must see us not as mobs, but as citizens united for freedom and justice. If we do this right, our voices will be impossible to silence. If we do this wrong, we risk being forgotten like so many before us.  Stay safe. Stay peaceful. Stay smart.",

She is the daughter of Chabi Rijal, a communist leader and Chief District Officer in Nepal, who recently ordered a shoot-on-sight against youth peacefully protesting corruption in Nepal. His orders have killed over 18 innocent people, injured more than 100 students, and more deaths are expected. This is pure fascism and a gross misuse of power. Young people in a peaceful protest were shot dead, which is totally unacceptable. While our brothers and sisters die in Nepal, Sweta Rijal has no right to study in the US with money from corruption. Her entire funding is from the money from corruption. The US, as a democratic country and a voice for the UN, stands for freedom and justice. Allowing her to stay contradicts everything the US represents. We are struggling to fight this battle in Nepal, and she must be held accountable. I urge you to investigate her visa and take necessary action to send her back to Nepal. Regards, Concerned Citizen from Nepal",

President in hiding and Army doing nothing, when the country actually needs them.    Sigha Durbar, Parliament Building, Supreme Court , all public properties that were not significant monuments but also held importance in history were burned along with all its documents . NO leader has come forward to lead , neither from Gen Z or Balen or Rabi or Harka or even Army. Everyone seems to be in a game of wait and watch and let the anarchy unfold.

I think you've never seen what corruption can cause, or you pretend not to!  I'm from Brazil, and I'll give you an example of what corruption can do to a society.    Here, I saw young people being shot in favelas just for supporting opposition politicians, yes, ordinary people being killed for supporting the other side.  People were and are arrested, tortured, and killed on the unjust orders of corrupt politicians and judges.  The media, also corrupt, manipulates public opinion with false narratives or half-truths, always favoring the state, especially abroad. This has caused enormous polarization in the country, in addition to promoting many unjust laws.  My country is overrun by crime, and there are criminal factions that control entire regions (with the explicit support of the state), and you run a risk when you go out at night, you know? You can be robbed and killed at any moment, and nothing will be done to the criminal.  Education is also of extremely low quality, which has caused an absurd cultural and moral degradation among my people, who today lack even the capacity to think critically.  Salary increases for politicians without social approval are frequent here, and nothing happens. Search the amount of benefits they receive here.  We recently had a scandal involving millions of retirees being stolen against their will by banks and public agencies. What was the government's solution? To create more taxes to pay without punishing those who stole, and to try to inhibit investigations by using public funds to buy off those who would investigate. Search for \"INSS Scandal\".  The current president (rejected by the majority) has actively provoked other countries, especially the US, to create an open conflict between the two countries, precisely to use this as an excuse to remain in power while putting the lives of millions of people at risk.    Anyway, I could spend all day here giving examples of the harm corruption has caused in the society I live in. I recommend imagining how many future geniuses, entrepreneurs, inventors, and exemplary people for humanity could exist here, but won't, thanks to the corruption of some.  Imagine how prosperous societies would be if there weren't corrupt representatives making absurd and selfish decisions to benefit themselves and control others.    I understand that violence blinds people, and it's unpleasant to see someone in this situation, but we need to understand that in today's societies, we have two sides, one side that wants to live and enjoy life peacefully, and the other that wants to use your life to live like gods.   So, what would you prefer?    The people of Nepal are absolutely right to act as they are, and their politicians need to see what true justice is. They acted wrongly, harming thousands of people, and now they need to be punished, something that would never happen without the use of violence.   The corrupt state would never punish itself, and military forces serve and exist precisely to defend the state and its interests, meaning they would never be punished fairly, and even if they have surrendered, the disaster has already been caused, this surrender is just a way for them to try to avoid punishment, however, sooner or later, they will stab society in the back, and guess what, if society doesn't act, nothing will happen to them and their crimes!  Soon my country will go through something similar, and you will be able to see that it is not about revenge, it is about justice, something that unfortunately is disappearing in societies.  There's no point in trying to appear morally superior, evil people exist and will continue to commit atrocities, and if there are no violent reactions against them, everything will only get worse.|||Ajai kutnu partyo mardeko bhaye huntyo.

I am just a sincere, hardworking youth who remained silent because too many opinions create a ruckus. That's what I believed till September 8. When I went to the protest, it was all fine until they started firing. When you're in the battleground, all moralities go out the window. Yet, I did not throw a single stone at anyone and I am proud of that. I remained with the group who were peacefully protesting infront of the army van, I helped people with water to wash their face, tried picking up litters. The main point is I tried being a responsible person. But the moment I saw people being carried to the hospital with their blood spattering the streets, I fucking lost it. In retaliation, my protests became more louder. I came home late at night, tried my best to repost as many information I could. At one point, I felt like people should burn down the entire ministry down, all these nepo-babies should be brought to the streets to teach their parents how it feels to kill someone's child. I was furious, the word being an understatement. But seeing this people getting mob justice was what I never wanted. They don't deserve the least of anyone's sympathies, but we still have humanity in our hearts.

Gen z never planned to burn or destroy public property and jails. I believe this happened due to the presence of other opportunistic groups.

We're done with all the looters!|||As an unsuspecting observer from afar, from the heart of Europe, the following thought just occurred to me: How about taking Bhutan as a role model? I mean gross national happiness instead of gross national product. I believe every single country on this planet should take Bhutan as a role model a little bit more. Where else in the world are citizens asked what their main problems are and what they want from the government? And later, citizens are asked how satisfied they were with the government's performance. I know it's a bit naive of me to make such a suggestion from afar, as a sheltered European who is not really familiar with the form of government in Nepal. But it seems to be similar in many, many countries. Those in power often hold office and positions of honor for decades through their family ties. And they are similar in their decadence. The most expensive clothes, the biggest cars, houses, and palaces. Flying to New York for dinner in a private jet, or to Monaco for F1, or around the globe in a yacht as long as a soccer field.

We keep repeating the same mistakes because people get blinded by shiny new faces and ignore anyone who actually knows what theyтАЩre doing. Experience doesnтАЩt mean someone is corrupt it means theyтАЩve been in the trenches and survived. Throwing it away just to see if a тАЬfresh faceтАЭ can magically save everything is how you crash a country.  Nepal isnтАЩt a playground. Leadership isnтАЩt about hype, popularity, or being young and тАЬgreen.тАЭ ItтАЩs about surviving the chaos, making tough decisions, and knowing where the landmines are. If you think a rookie can do that better than someone experienced, youтАЩre dreaming and the whole nation will pay the price for it.",

These morons don't realize that if the parliament isn't dissolved immediately, the old mfs will again come|||People think Balen or Harka type people will just come and save the country.    Even if they have the intention and will to do so (like many of us want), they do not know how to run a country. I see them as ineffective in running even a municipality (maybe that was because of politics and in-cooperation from party elected ward heads). The thing is they have a lot more to learn and they will, with time.       This situation would not have happened if there were transfer of power to youth in timely manner. Now the rising youth leaders do not have experience because these corrupt politicians did not allow that.      What we need is a system where corruption should now be absolutely dreaded, seeing how corrupt politicians had to run away for thier life. They have to realize that people will not just punish the corrupt polticians, they will also punish whoever was responsible to prevent that.       There now needs to be a collaborative development with young leaders like Balen and experienced people like Sushila. Each and everyone's characters will show with time, for now, we have to seek for stability as soon as possible.|||If we fail to appoint her then external along with internal force will play and bring more chaos to the country.

I truly want Sushila Karki to be prime minister, but according to our constitution it's not possible. And if we ditch our constitution our country is open for invasion from other countries. So, what's the best option it's BALEN. I know that he won't be able to run for prime minister for the next election but it is a risk we have to take. It's already proven that our protest was the result of different politicians 'parties'involvement. So, let's play it safe and try to choose the best result for us. Already many Indian politicians are saying that they are ready to deploy an army if needed. It's not goodwill but an invasion. So it's best we know what we do for the country.  But if it's possible for her to be prime minister without disturbing our constitution then I'm all for it. I also want a good leader who will work for the development of the country.   Indian is already eyeing the district like Lipilekh and Limpadhura. If we take too long to make a responsible decision, they are favourites to win the case.   The country is already in chaos. So we must do our best to calm it down. We protested against corruption and got unexpected results. We are not ready for it. And we don't have time to think about it and make a decision. But, we must make a decision and make it work, isn't it all there is to it ?    It's not that I don't support \"Sushila Karki\" . She has my full support. But if it is disturbing our core rules set by our constitution. I just thought it isn't right. So it's my request all my fellow citizens ( not just gen-z ) to make a right decision.   But my final warning is that if we defy our current constitution ourselves. It will not be a suprise other countries take advantage of it. So we shall make a decision ourselves and take the best route possible. But you've my support to make her ( Sushila Karki) intrim prime minister. It is the best result seeing her experience on political field.   It might have been a bit long for the attention span of gen-z but i just want to say that, neither the constitution nor the national rules be any shorter ЁЯШК. So make your protest and blood of many worthy of something great. You've already done impossible without any preparations. So make a few preparations and make our country great again.|||Divide and rule going on same old tactics which works everytime.|||This stupid ando Balen supporter haru.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.┬а┬а Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.┬а┬а Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||Jaha Bhetyo tehi thok saley madarchod lai...|||Aaos na india ma ni nepali xan birsyo kya|||Bro timro yo pic use garey haii Tiktok ma vid halchu|||kun desh jala teta bebasta garnu parxa|||yo machikne lai samatna paryo jasari bhaye ni yellai bachne kunai adhikar xaina|||Bhagey ra canada nai ja la, canada ma nee xodnu hudaina.

I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both.

BTW, Gen Z doesnтАЩt just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didnтАЩt exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who werenтАЩt even present for the protests claim we donтАЩt know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldnтАЩt even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, тАШWe have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server youтАЩre all listening to is just for public discussionтАЩ.

Even when we look at history of the world, majority of peaceful protest start peaceful and end violently. No entity in power ever gives it up easily.  Change was what we asked for and change is what we are getting. Not exactly the way we wanted things to go but seems clear from the comments that we all knew, in the back of our minds, it was never going to be a straight road to Rome.

Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? IтАЩve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we canтАЩt let our nation fail.** We canтАЩt let our nation burn. We canтАЩt let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**┬а    **1) We lay down our weapons.**┬а  We came in peace, we protested in peace, and weтАЩve always wanted peace. We shall end this in peace. Be it known that anybody inciting violence isnтАЩt part of our movement.┬а    **2) We extend love.**┬а  Love towards our brothers and sisters, love towards our nation, love towards our neighbours, our society, and the opposing side. The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.┬а    **3) We wear white.**┬а  White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that weтАЩve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.┬а    **4) We have hope.**┬а  Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.┬а    Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.┬а    Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.┬а    Sincerely,┬а  Pantji, a Gen-Z┬а|||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Why not sagar Dhakal?|||Yesss|||Just promote it in your social media handle|||K bhairacha yarr discord ma pm choose bhairacha|||Ahile non political manxe thik huncha...her or Dr рд╕рдиреНрджреБрдХ Ruit.

Make the president declare her lawful member of parliament through Proportionate Representation System, 3. Declare her the interim prime minister, 4. The president on her cabinet's recommendation dissolves the house of Representatives, 5. Her cabinet carries forward the corruption investigation and reconstruction. 6. The elections will be declared immediately. 7. The new parliament decides the constitutional amendments. (directly elected prime minister etc. and others ) 8. Then, the prime ministerial election happens. 9. She resigns as the interim prime minister. 10. New prime minister and the cabinet are sworn in. 11. The current president resigns. 12.

But tapai haru sanga hami sanga nabhayeko euta powerful weapon cha tyo ho social media and other form of mass communication. Yeslai use purai garnus. Massive misinformation ra disinformation le social media purai confusion ma cha. Jholey haru social media ma difeerent narrative spread gardai chan. Power grab ko khel bhai ra ko cha. Time is the most crucial factor here and so is your candidate.   There has been many verified activist infiltrating your protest. Some of them are already being identified online. So make a solid campaign and bring your leaders out.   My few concern: 1. Why is meeting being held in closed door? Who are the Gen Z representatives?  2. If all the cabinet ministers are in army barrack then why the meeting is being conducted inside the barrack?  3. Why is there delay in dissolving parliament?  4. There is no common voice among Gen Z. It is starting to already fracture into different sub groups.   5. Sudden rise in anti- Gen Z sentiment in various online platform.  Democracy is your hands guys, protect it at any cost. Be organized and move forward cautiously.|||is it just me or lipsync seems a little off?|||Jatha deuba yawn handai xa|||![gif](giphy|1lk1IcVgqPLkA)|||whatтАЩs happening|||Jasley k vaney ni, kata kata paxi regret hunxa jasto lagirako xa man ma|||Boost|||why is the video out of sync, whats the context, when was the interview, any other way to verify this ?|||Damn mad respect.|||Boost|||boost|||But people are saying she is IndiaтАЩs puppet!

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen.

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4. Retirement age and term limits: This is a must, we need a clear retirement age for the public positions just like other jobs.     These sort of things are fundamental of any country, without getting the fundamentals right we cannot expect our country to do better. We have a chance to make things better, lets take this chance.|||also i think! what lessons can be learned from Bangladesh last year?|||Garni nai ho vani presidency system lyauni.

Just wanted to express supreme respect to you from Ukraine.   You're really cool!   We had protests in 2014.   We made lot of mistakes after succeded in throwing down Yanukovich in 2014. War with Russia after that happened that helped corrupted politicians a lot. After five years people were tricked and during war elected complete scammers after watching \"servant of nation\" series with current president in main role.   Now we get kidnapping peoples on streets by police and conscripted forcely to war or you can get out for $10k until kidnapped next time. People get beaten and sometimes murdered in basements by military guys supported by police.   Escaping from country costs minimum $10k, but sometimes 20 and more just for crossing border without guarantees of success.   Or some peoples are going \\~100km through wild forests to escape country hunted by border guards with drones. Some succeed, some die.

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

AKA the daughter of a corrupt leader, the Chief Development Officer of Kathmandu, Nepal, Chhabi Rijal, who ordered gunfire in a peaceful protest that took place in Nepal on the 8th of September. The protest that took place against a corrupt government resulted in the loss of 20 individuals, some of whom were minors present in school uniforms, and hundreds were injured.   This is what we got for speaking against a government that has leeched off of taxpayers' money. We request an immediate dismissal of Sweta Rijal's candidacy at your esteemed institution. We, as Nepali people, condemn the actions of her immediate family and believe that her degree, funded by her very disliked father, will be of NO USE to our country.

ItтАЩs tragic, because they also have families back home and face the same struggles as the rest of us. They should be victims of this system too, yet they show little compassion or critical thought about whatтАЩs happening around them. Why are there protests in the first place? I refuse to believe they're blind to people's frustration and the direction the country is heading.  I still remember when we joined a protest 14тАУ15 years ago. The police confronted us aggressively, and as kids we were too confused to react. Fortunately, we just stood there processing and visibly confused, and they left тАФ but I still shudder to think, *what if our reaction had been different?* TodayтАЩs young protestors are in the same position, pure in their intentions, simply voicing frustration without wanting harm.  And honestly, credit must go to these protestors. They know exactly what they are standing for, unlike us back then who needed adults to organise us. I donтАЩt see how demonstrations could be any more peaceful than they already are тАФ especially when the very leaders being protested against have blood on their hands from before this generation was even born.|||Yo bhatey haru kahi gayera sitcha holani|||randi baan machikne haru|||I mean this tracks, they only like when you're corrupt|||Its not andolan anymore its war|||We want death or at lease exile of KP Oli and other taukes.|||Randi haruko photo, name, address patta lagau.|||khate haru mug haru padne bela ma padenan aile mug ko mug ko chak sugera manche lai dukha dinxan. timi mug haru le esto dukha dekhnu paros jatha haru. maa gali pani dina sakdina timi haru ko aama ko galti haina timi haru jasta janmie. aama lai k thaaa. tara kailei bhalo nahos timi haru jasta ko. timi haru marna pani na paos bachna pani na paos.|||shamelss dogs of government|||Machikne radi harlai lakhetdai marnaparne|||Thuiyaa police vanauda haruuu|||you radiko ban harulai agolauno man xa|||ma sanga pani ganhune bhaye, kassam mardinthe radieekko ban|||Mathi bata aako order re ????

He wasn't a bad leader too, he was a weak leader instead and after kp oli took over and pushed him down he just accepted it and didn't cause any dispute or problems. His only mistake was he was one of the leader of yemale but in his defence what else could he do. If he leave the party, others may start a conspiracy or blame him for their wrongdoings. So he just stayed in his given position silently. He should not have been target for gen z at all. But his family member became a casualty, he had to run but his wife got trapped/unsaved in the fire and then her injured body was dragged on the road and thrown inside the ambulance and then she died. But what happened oli and his associates and his jholays? His house burnt but he didn't even suffer a scratch. He resigned and got away without getting a pinch. Sher bahadur and arju were beaten but still people helped them to escape. They will treat the injury and get help from some country to stay as a fugitive. The worst were not burnt alive or shamed publicly or got stripped off their clothing. While innocent kind person like jhala nath khanal's wife had to suffer intoxication, suffocation, excessive heat, first degree burns and later succumb to the injuries. The motive of movement was needed and right, the approach can be justified but the actions and aftermath were just unnecessary overkill. The big dogs survived and fled, but their puppies were shamed tortured and mercilessly beaten.

The whole revolution thing was a regime change operation like which happened in Ukraine, Libya, Bangladesh. They used the youth for regime change to install their puppet government. Sad to say that our leaders are groomed to be used in the politics in the future. Looks like our neighbor used their proxies in Nepal to overtake Deep state regime change operation from the west. If we are not vigilant, we are going to get another Zelenski and Nepal may turn into another Ukraine. UN forces and Indian forces are very active to get into Nepal. Things change rapidly in geopolitics. Achieving this revolution within 24 to 48 hours is in itself very suspicious. All seems like preplanned operation.

In this case, it is not like that. Protestors ( violent non gen z's) they had given everyone time to evacuate the building, but she did not evacuate. Most likely cuz she was scared of the mob outside. The people outthere assumed it was empty, hence they started burning it. When people realized that women was inside the building, people came to her rescue. Unfortunately, she suffered from burn, reported to be 15% do far. Fortunately, she survived and is recovering. Even though I do not agree with what happened, I hate the narrative of us just burning a women.   Second where was this empathy for the kids that got shot? Where was this empathy for mothers and fathers that lost their children? Where was this empathy for grandfather and grandmother that lost their kids and grandkids? Where was this empathy when millions of people suffered? Where was this empathy when our voices about to be silenced?   Yes, we screwed up but before coming out and trying to shame or guilt trip us, ask yourself are you empathetic cuz you saw the video of her or are you genuinely empathetic cuz of the act? Do we all need our sufferings recorded and made public for people to feel empathetic?   Also ask yourself, people chased, dragged and beat corrupted politicians, but not of them were killed. Do you think people would burn and kill some corrupted politicians wife? If they would, then you would have seen lots of dead politicians by now.  Also I just checked your profile, you are an Indian. How can an Indian citizen empathize with Nepali people when you have not suffered under the regime we suffered. Don't just blindly follow what is being shown in your media. Do some research and you will find the truth yourself.|||Fuck, People are starting to say Save the Constitution. Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**┬аThe President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**┬аIf no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**┬аIf a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**┬аIf the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||I totally agree with this .|||Aa judai vako mancha lai kati coti marchas, sala indian godi media ko Veda.|||[deleted]|||Why are indians interfer in our business again?

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**┬аThe President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**┬аIf no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**┬аIf a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**┬аIf the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

We have to investigate that, if we find anything, it will be so important for further, for choosing the leaders) But instead of drowning in sadness, we need to channel this pain into solutions.  This is the time to seek the truth, like who let Rabi out, and who is really behind the chaos. And this is also the time to seriously research those stepping forward to lead, people like Sushila Karki and others. We must check their education, experience, and their capacity to take responsibility, there background on corruption and role and everything.   One wrong choice now will cost Nepal for decades.

WeтАЩre out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor peopleтАЩs kids not boil?  On top of that, thereтАЩs already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent. Because this have  been suppressed for so long, and now the mindset is like тАФ тАЬIf we canтАЩt reach anywhere through the system, then we might as well destroy it.тАЭ  And even if some third party tries to trigger people, the truth is, it was already there deep down in their subconscious. This is just it coming out.

Even he ignored and disagree with the Loan to be used from ADB ( Asian Development Bank ) . 6) He speaks and protest on his own way BUT still he has some flaws unlike us even the moon has flaws then he is still human . ra usko flaws we can ignore . May be he isnt eligible for primeminister as the lacks some level of diplomacy and its skill but he can be best suited in ministries like : Industry and commerce , Infrastructure, Agriculture .

            "body": "What comes next? The only reason Nepal isn't going through a complete currency de-valuation and a bank run is because of the rupee peg. We need to tread water carefully. (**Bank run**┬аis a situation where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a bank simultaneously, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or financial stability. This can lead to liquidity problems for the bank, as it may not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands. Bank runs can create a cycle of panic, potentially leading to the bank's failure.)  The real pain starts after the protests have calmed. Economic crash is certain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh both went through it. Stock market/real estate crash, inflation and what not.  Whoever takes charge next, likely Balen, will need to address the pointless 'Greater Nepal' rhetoric and become a moderate on this issue. Thanks to Trump, India-China relationship is stable for the first time in ages. The only way Nepal has a future is pledge allegiance to both neighbour's.  Bangladesh under Yunus has been a pain in the ass for India. Nepal cannot make the same mistake. Any wrong steps and a free floating Nepali rupee against the dollar would go from 140 now to 25,000 like similar countries in our GDP range. Probably worse since our economy is in much worse shape. ($1 = Lao Kip 21,631.66 LAK)  Nepal needs one stable leader for the next 40 yrs. No interim gov paving way for elections bullshit. Forget the democracy experiment.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.┬а┬а Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.┬а┬а Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||How credible is this info?|||Use bitchat for conversation.

            "comments": "We are living in a moment where anger is boiling over. People are tired of corruption, censorship, and being silenced. Many of us are ready to take to the streets on Sept 8. But before we move forward, we must stop and think carefully.  History has shown us what happens when we rush in without preparation. In Bangladesh last year, in Sri Lanka not long ago, ordinary people gave their lives while corrupt leaders fled the country with protection and comfort. Their deaths were forgotten within weeks, while the guilty walked free. If we are not careful, Nepal risks becoming the next chapter in that same tragic story.  That is why this movement must be different. We cannot afford to be reckless. We must protect our people, keep our voices peaceful, and make sure the world is watching every step so that accountability cannot be erased.  Here is what we need to do before Sept 8:  * Get international human rights groups, UN observers, and peace monitors involved beforehand so there are eyes on the ground. * Publish clear and peaceful agendas so nobody can label us as rioters or mobs. * Document everything with photos, videos, and testimonies. Every arrest and every injury must be recorded and shared. * Avoid following local leaders who are affiliated with political parties. Big parties will try to infiltrate, hijack, and twist this movement for their own gain. * Know who is truly standing beside you. Trust matters because infiltrators can turn peaceful protests into chaos.  This movement is about dignity, rights, and accountability. It is not about violence. It is not about revenge. If we lose focus, if we let anger replace strategy, then we risk repeating the same cycle where the powerful walk free and ordinary people pay with their lives.  Nepal deserves better. The world must see us not as mobs, but as citizens united for freedom and justice. If we do this right, our voices will be impossible to silence. If we do this wrong, we risk being forgotten like so many before us.  Stay safe. Stay peaceful. Stay smart.",

She is the daughter of Chabi Rijal, a communist leader and Chief District Officer in Nepal, who recently ordered a shoot-on-sight against youth peacefully protesting corruption in Nepal. His orders have killed over 18 innocent people, injured more than 100 students, and more deaths are expected. This is pure fascism and a gross misuse of power. Young people in a peaceful protest were shot dead, which is totally unacceptable. While our brothers and sisters die in Nepal, Sweta Rijal has no right to study in the US with money from corruption. Her entire funding is from the money from corruption. The US, as a democratic country and a voice for the UN, stands for freedom and justice. Allowing her to stay contradicts everything the US represents. We are struggling to fight this battle in Nepal, and she must be held accountable. I urge you to investigate her visa and take necessary action to send her back to Nepal. Regards, Concerned Citizen from Nepal",

I think you've never seen what corruption can cause, or you pretend not to!  I'm from Brazil, and I'll give you an example of what corruption can do to a society.    Here, I saw young people being shot in favelas just for supporting opposition politicians, yes, ordinary people being killed for supporting the other side.  People were and are arrested, tortured, and killed on the unjust orders of corrupt politicians and judges.  The media, also corrupt, manipulates public opinion with false narratives or half-truths, always favoring the state, especially abroad. This has caused enormous polarization in the country, in addition to promoting many unjust laws.  My country is overrun by crime, and there are criminal factions that control entire regions (with the explicit support of the state), and you run a risk when you go out at night, you know? You can be robbed and killed at any moment, and nothing will be done to the criminal.  Education is also of extremely low quality, which has caused an absurd cultural and moral degradation among my people, who today lack even the capacity to think critically.  Salary increases for politicians without social approval are frequent here, and nothing happens. Search the amount of benefits they receive here.  We recently had a scandal involving millions of retirees being stolen against their will by banks and public agencies. What was the government's solution? To create more taxes to pay without punishing those who stole, and to try to inhibit investigations by using public funds to buy off those who would investigate. Search for \"INSS Scandal\".  The current president (rejected by the majority) has actively provoked other countries, especially the US, to create an open conflict between the two countries, precisely to use this as an excuse to remain in power while putting the lives of millions of people at risk.    Anyway, I could spend all day here giving examples of the harm corruption has caused in the society I live in. I recommend imagining how many future geniuses, entrepreneurs, inventors, and exemplary people for humanity could exist here, but won't, thanks to the corruption of some.  Imagine how prosperous societies would be if there weren't corrupt representatives making absurd and selfish decisions to benefit themselves and control others.    I understand that violence blinds people, and it's unpleasant to see someone in this situation, but we need to understand that in today's societies, we have two sides, one side that wants to live and enjoy life peacefully, and the other that wants to use your life to live like gods.   So, what would you prefer?    The people of Nepal are absolutely right to act as they are, and their politicians need to see what true justice is. They acted wrongly, harming thousands of people, and now they need to be punished, something that would never happen without the use of violence.   The corrupt state would never punish itself, and military forces serve and exist precisely to defend the state and its interests, meaning they would never be punished fairly, and even if they have surrendered, the disaster has already been caused, this surrender is just a way for them to try to avoid punishment, however, sooner or later, they will stab society in the back, and guess what, if society doesn't act, nothing will happen to them and their crimes!  Soon my country will go through something similar, and you will be able to see that it is not about revenge, it is about justice, something that unfortunately is disappearing in societies.  There's no point in trying to appear morally superior, evil people exist and will continue to commit atrocities, and if there are no violent reactions against them, everything will only get worse.|||Ajai kutnu partyo mardeko bhaye huntyo.

I am just a sincere, hardworking youth who remained silent because too many opinions create a ruckus. That's what I believed till September 8. When I went to the protest, it was all fine until they started firing. When you're in the battleground, all moralities go out the window. Yet, I did not throw a single stone at anyone and I am proud of that. I remained with the group who were peacefully protesting infront of the army van, I helped people with water to wash their face, tried picking up litters. The main point is I tried being a responsible person. But the moment I saw people being carried to the hospital with their blood spattering the streets, I fucking lost it. In retaliation, my protests became more louder. I came home late at night, tried my best to repost as many information I could. At one point, I felt like people should burn down the entire ministry down, all these nepo-babies should be brought to the streets to teach their parents how it feels to kill someone's child. I was furious, the word being an understatement. But seeing this people getting mob justice was what I never wanted.

I mean gross national happiness instead of gross national product. I believe every single country on this planet should take Bhutan as a role model a little bit more. Where else in the world are citizens asked what their main problems are and what they want from the government? And later, citizens are asked how satisfied they were with the government's performance. I know it's a bit naive of me to make such a suggestion from afar, as a sheltered European who is not really familiar with the form of government in Nepal. But it seems to be similar in many, many countries. Those in power often hold office and positions of honor for decades through their family ties. And they are similar in their decadence. The most expensive clothes, the biggest cars, houses, and palaces. Flying to New York for dinner in a private jet, or to Monaco for F1, or around the globe in a yacht as long as a soccer field. And in the media, they try to appear close to the people, to be there for them, to advance the country by investing in infrastructure or new hospitals, etc. But no, a large part of your taxes ends up with the rulers themselves. The rich and powerful acquire more wealth and more power. Money rules the world!

This is literally just her side of the story. Anyone can sit behind a keyboard, write a long emotional post, and instantly turn public opinion against someone. That doesnтАЩt make it the full truth.  WeтАЩve seen this before тАФ remember the Sandeep Lamichhane case? A girl accused him, media and public went wild, and people treated him as guilty before trial. Later, so many loopholes came out. ItтАЩs the same pattern here тАФ society naturally sides with the girl because we have an inbuilt bias that says тАЬthe girl must be the victim.тАЭ But is that always true? No.  LetтАЩs also not ignore that sometimes girls do play emotional games. They ghost, they manipulate, they test how much a guy will тАЬchaseтАЭ them тАФ and when he does, suddenly it becomes тАЬstalking.тАЭ WhereтАЩs the line? Maybe she had past relationships, maybe sheтАЩs not telling the full story about her own actions that led to this fallout. Why should we blindly believe only her narrative and not even question what really happened?  And now people are targeting not just him, but also his family. ThatтАЩs disgusting. Whatever the issue is between two individuals, why should parents, brothers, or sisters be dragged into it? People forget that when you destroy someone online, you destroy their whole familyтАЩs dignity too.  EveryoneтАЩs commenting with sympathy for her and anger towards him. But letтАЩs be honest тАФ most of that is just because sheтАЩs a girl and heтАЩs a guy. If the genders were reversed, would people still believe the story this blindly? I doubt it.  Look, if heтАЩs actually guilty of harassment, the law should punish him. No question about that. But until then, itтАЩs not fair to publicly assassinate someoneтАЩs character based on one-sided claims. Social media is not a courtroom, and we shouldnтАЩt let feelings override facts.|||:D|||https://www.facebook.com/share/1JV5hYfP6t/?mibextid=wwXIfr  donтАЩt bully her. Only message her.

Experience isnтАЩt a flaw, itтАЩs literally the one thing that tells you someone can handle the chaos. You want to hand the country over to a rookie who has no clue how the system works, how politics works, or how to deal with the mess weтАЩre already in? ThatтАЩs not bravery, thatтАЩs stupidity.  We keep repeating the same mistakes because people get blinded by shiny new faces and ignore anyone who actually knows what theyтАЩre doing. Experience doesnтАЩt mean someone is corrupt it means theyтАЩve been in the trenches and survived. Throwing it away just to see if a тАЬfresh faceтАЭ can magically save everything is how you crash a country.  Nepal isnтАЩt a playground. Leadership isnтАЩt about hype, popularity, or being young and тАЬgreen.тАЭ ItтАЩs about surviving the chaos, making tough decisions, and knowing where the landmines are. If you think a rookie can do that better than someone experienced, youтАЩre dreaming and the whole nation will pay the price for it.",

It's already proven that our protest was the result of different politicians 'parties'involvement. So, let's play it safe and try to choose the best result for us. Already many Indian politicians are saying that they are ready to deploy an army if needed. It's not goodwill but an invasion. So it's best we know what we do for the country.  But if it's possible for her to be prime minister without disturbing our constitution then I'm all for it. I also want a good leader who will work for the development of the country.   Indian is already eyeing the district like Lipilekh and Limpadhura. If we take too long to make a responsible decision, they are favourites to win the case.   The country is already in chaos. So we must do our best to calm it down. We protested against corruption and got unexpected results. We are not ready for it. And we don't have time to think about it and make a decision. But, we must make a decision and make it work, isn't it all there is to it ?    It's not that I don't support \"Sushila Karki\" . She has my full support. But if it is disturbing our core rules set by our constitution. I just thought it isn't right. So it's my request all my fellow citizens ( not just gen-z ) to make a right decision.   But my final warning is that if we defy our current constitution ourselves. It will not be a suprise other countries take advantage of it. So we shall make a decision ourselves and take the best route possible. But you've my support to make her ( Sushila Karki) intrim prime minister. It is the best result seeing her experience on political field.   It might have been a bit long for the attention span of gen-z but i just want to say that, neither the constitution nor the national rules be any shorter ЁЯШК. So make your protest and blood of many worthy of something great. You've already done impossible without any preparations. So make a few preparations and make our country great again.|||Divide and rule going on same old tactics which works everytime.|||This stupid ando Balen supporter haru.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.┬а┬а Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.┬а┬а Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||Jaha Bhetyo tehi thok saley madarchod lai...|||Aaos na india ma ni nepali xan birsyo kya|||Bro timro yo pic use garey haii Tiktok ma vid halchu|||kun desh jala teta bebasta garnu parxa|||yo machikne lai samatna paryo jasari bhaye ni yellai bachne kunai adhikar xaina|||Bhagey ra canada nai ja la, canada ma nee xodnu hudaina.

Let the bill for Upper House be registered by directly elected member of Upper House. Upper house will vote for foreign minister, ambassadors and diplomats.   For now, either make Mayor and Deputy Mayor of each capital of Province to be interim Governor and Magistrate to bring law and order in state-province security and function. After election they will go back to be Mayor and Deputy Mayor.     Why all this? So no dictator and political party can come in power to hijack this state again for their own gain.|||No not as PM, can rejoin as edu min tho|||Ahile lai.. interim prime minister Sushila Karki.. ahile Balen/Sumana ayo vaney interim PM le election ladna paudaina.. so ahile Sushila Karki is best and Elected PM Balen or Sumana Shrestha.  my opinion.|||WE DO NOT NEED A PARTY AFFILIATED REPRESENTATIVE.

I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both.

BTW, Gen Z doesnтАЩt just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didnтАЩt exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who werenтАЩt even present for the protests claim we donтАЩt know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldnтАЩt even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, тАШWe have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server youтАЩre all listening to is just for public discussionтАЩ. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal.

My soul hurts to see violence, arson, anarchy, and the loot and burning of our national properties. We, Gen-Z, seem to have won, yet feel lost. Hope feels lost. Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? IтАЩve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we canтАЩt let our nation fail.** We canтАЩt let our nation burn. We canтАЩt let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**┬а    **1) We lay down our weapons.**┬а  We came in peace, we protested in peace, and weтАЩve always wanted peace. We shall end this in peace. Be it known that anybody inciting violence isnтАЩt part of our movement.┬а    **2) We extend love.**┬а  Love towards our brothers and sisters, love towards our nation, love towards our neighbours, our society, and the opposing side. The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.┬а    **3) We wear white.**┬а  White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that weтАЩve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.┬а    **4) We have hope.**┬а  Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.┬а    Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.┬а    Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.┬а    Sincerely,┬а  Pantji, a Gen-Z┬а|||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Why not sagar Dhakal?|||Yesss|||Just promote it in your social media handle|||K bhairacha yarr discord ma pm choose bhairacha|||Ahile non political manxe thik huncha...her or Dr рд╕рдиреНрджреБрдХ Ruit.

Unconstitutional action will hurt Nepal on the long run. Thus, to make it constitutional;  1. Make some MP elected from Proportionate Representation System resign, 2. Make the president declare her lawful member of parliament through Proportionate Representation System, 3. Declare her the interim prime minister, 4. The president on her cabinet's recommendation dissolves the house of Representatives, 5. Her cabinet carries forward the corruption investigation and reconstruction. 6.

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen.

Its grand architecture and historical importance make it a true pride of Nepal.The news of Singha Durbar burning yesterday is more than just the loss of a structure it feels like the loss of a piece of our soul. This tragedy is a blow to our heritage, to our economy, and to our sense of unity as a nation. The damage cannot be measured only in money, but also in the irreplaceable cultural and historical value that has been destroyed.  I feel deeply saddened by this loss. Singha Durbar was more than walls and pillars it was a living monument of NepalтАЩs journey, struggles, and achievements.

Honestly, I think the rest of the world needs to see what's happening in Nepal. These politicians are acting like they're above the law, and the police are using way too much force. Someone needs to step in and do something. It's like they don't care about human life.  We need to get the word out and demand justice for these young people. Nepal needs help before things get even worse.",

Balen is not coming until the parliament is not dissolve.  Parliament cannot be dissolved. Parliament can be disslove by Prime Minister and currently no one is Prime Minister. Other way to dissolve parliament is by president. But president has to try and appoint PM before dissolving the parliament, how can he appoint  1. By the party holding majority seat  2. By colliation  3. By the member of party who has most seat in the parliament  4. Anyone who can obtain vote of confidence  Now here is the point, everyone but Prachand has resigned and the party who has most seat in the parliament is Moist and before dissolving the parliament he will become the Prime Minister if president is dissolving the parliament.  Best thing is to not dissolve the parliament and form interim government leaded by Sushila Karki. But there are some fools who do not understand these things and are opposing Karki to be care taker of the country.  I hope you understand the mind of the mastermind 'Prachad' and spread this message as soon as possible so that interim government can be formed led by Sushila Karki.",
