            "comments": "Hello everyone,  I believe this subreddit has a large Nepali community in Australia, so I wanted to share my situation and seek genuine guidance. I come from a lower middle-class family in Nepal and recently completed my B.Sc. in Physics from Tribhuvan University. (My certificate shows 2023, but the actual completion year is 2024, and I can provide a gap verification letter.)  My profile: Percentage: ~72% | IELTS: 7.5 | GRE: 317 | Publications: 2 papers in Q1 (SJR-ranked, low IF) | 1 national journal paper | 1 paper currently under review (First author in all)  My main goal is quality education and research, not money. I have applied for some PhD programs in the USA, but due to the current situation there and my uncertain chances, I am now seriously considering Australia.  However, I know that Australian universities strongly emphasize percentages, and I feel that direct PhD may be very difficult with my profile. I am open to doing a Master’s (even self-funded), but my financial condition is weak, and this is where my confusion begins.  I would be very grateful if someone could honestly answer:  1. With this profile, is it realistic to get admission into an MSc in Physics in Australia? 2. How expensive is the tuition fee for MSc Physics (approximate range)? 3. Can a student realistically pay tuition and living expenses by working part-time in Australia? 4. Are there any scholarships, fee reductions, or affordable universities that I should look into? 5. Are there other countries where a student like me can pursue higher studies in Physics without extreme financial pressure?  I truly have a deep passion for physics and research. My family cannot support me financially, so I want to study abroad on my own, without causing them stress. Any advice, experience, or guidance would mean a lot to me.  Thank you so much in advance 🙏",

            "body": "I was somehow inside the parliament premises on Sept. 8. The Special Task Forces (STF -commando trained police personnel), who did the shootings, had barrack inside the parliament premise. They were \\~100-120 in number. We could hear in the walkie talkie of the commander inspector Mr. Adhikari that the crowd outside was 12,000. Some demonstrators broke the wall on the south west corner, got inside, dragged and threw away 75+ yo mother of a BICC employee from the quarter building and set the little building on fire. It was around12. The booth of STF commander at the main gate was already burned down. The commander also had his wife living with him there. He was saying that his wedding ring, chain, other valuables, and documents were burned down. Many STF police had their wifes and kids living with them in the quarter inside the parliament premise. Demonstrators repeatedly tried to storm inside from the front gate, broke the walls in several places and got in several times. Police chased them outside repeatedly. The police started with water gun, tear gas, and rubber bullets. Ran out of ammo of rubber bullets, as we could hear. Several of us were on the ground. The commander was around us. Finally he ordered to shoot below the knees after he thought nothing was working anymore and the crowd was still repeatedly trying to break inside. We did hear that command. Several injured police personnels were being carried back by fellow policemen. We were on the ground fearing our lives and so were the police. They were telling us that they would escort us from the RBB gate in a police vehice should the crowd get in. That would have been a worse idea. We would probably have been burned alive inside. That didn't happen, thankfully. We escaped at around 8.30 PM. The police used excessive force because they were highly outnumbered and felt threatened. I personally feel they did so in order to prevent the crowd getting in due to two reasons: 1) do their duty to safeguard the parliament, 2) protect themselves, their families, and their valuables in the barrack inside. And the crowd treated the STFs like normal police who disperse crowd with laathi charge. They are deployed there for a reason. STFs were the last line of defense at BICC. Each of them were commando trained personnels. It was the innocence of the crowd or may be lost sanity, that they were teasing/threatening the sharpshooter policemen with gun, in the nishedhit chhetra. Everything that happened between police and the demonstrators that day saw equal and opposite reaction. Police and demonstrators are both justified in their action, from their own perspective.  I feel sorry for the families of the people that lost their lives that day. May the departed souls rest in peace!  Edit: I know this post is going to trigger a good debate. Let me clarify, I believe this is my objective observation. I could be biased towards the STF because I feel they saved us that day. No material facts have been added or omitted or modified. Opinions are personal. Will appreciate your civil yet airtight counter arguments. Thanks!",

            "body": "I stand with Sushila Karki, the interim Prime Minister of Nepal. She was appointed with a clear and limited mandate—to conduct a general election, not to focus on long-term national development. Her tenure lasted for around six months, which itself explains the boundaries of her authority and responsibility.  Many people over-criticize her, especially for failing to arrest KP Oli and those responsible for the killing of 77 youths during the Gen-Z protest. Such criticism ignores political reality. It is unrealistic to expect a short-term interim government, formed solely to hold elections, to take major legal and political actions of this magnitude within such a limited time frame.  I respect Sushila Karki because she chose democracy over everything else. She prioritized free and fair elections above personal popularity or political pressure. Because of her vision and restraint, Nepal is now only 40 days away from a general election, which is a major achievement given the instability she inherited.  Regarding KP Oli and the protest killings, an investigation department has already completed its report. The responsibility now lies with the next elected government. If the people of Nepal vote for the right individuals and parties, they will have the authority to act on the report—either by filing charges, making arrests, or even launching a fresh investigation into the massacre of 77 youths.  If I were in her place, I would have made the same choice. I would have placed a fair and secure election above everything else, even above my own life. Without elections, justice and accountability remain impossible.  I thank Sushila Karki for choosing elections over chaos and for not allowing Nepal to descend into prolonged instability like Bangladesh. When she assumed office, Nepal was extremely unstable, violent, and unrestful. By the end of her tenure, the country was far more stable than before.  If the upcoming election is smooth and fair, I will personally rank her among the best Prime Ministers Nepal has had, even though she led only an interim government.",

She has a really tough job trying to balance all the sides, all the voices, criticism, protests, demands, etc etc etc. And she also has to be careful not to push too fast or try to appear too powerful because the old parties are ready to rile shit up if they feel like it.

Now, It is a fact that Rabi was never a member of any Sahakari, what happened was that GB Rai put money from his sahakari into Gorkha media where Rabi was MD and yes he cut checks to pay his various employees and other things, also took out some loans I think. Question arises.. Did Rabi know the money came from sahakari and he knowingly wrote the checks or like many other MDs, the owner invests money into the company and you write checks. That's the big thing. I'm sure there are other issues too.   If Rabi was a member of a Sahakari and then he took out a loan from that sahakari and put it into Gorkha media company then for me even without a court verdict, he would feel guilty but that's not the case here.

Some genuine questions:  Do big business houses in Nepal deliberately hedge their political risks by backing multiple parties?  Is this a smart survival strategy — “whoever wins, business wins”?  Does this further show how business interests transcend political ideology in Nepal?  Or is this just normal democratic practice and we’re reading too much into it?

I was working for one of the renowned company.. they made us use the cursor. They kept telling us to have 2x productivity. We also able to burn the tickets more that we used to do in non AI days.. cursor was able to grasp a project context and was able to finish our 5 sp task as of 1 sp task 😅😅.  we work in micro service architecture and we need to constantly give cursor the context about other services and there was also dependency with others team and well cursor cannot communicate with other team like a actual human do 😁 So the point is that if the system is complex cursor/AI won't be able to do all things on its own.   But recently I switched company. Here we are now building smaller smaller project and sending it to the mass to get subscriptions as fast as possible.. and guess what we are using lovable to build the system. Lovable + supabase + stripe = boom product.   So in this case the point is that if the system you are building is simpler and you have clean vision even people from marketing can now build the system. And believe me marketing head from my company had done that in 2 weeks.    I don't know what future holds.. but guys sakney belaa paisaa shorna sakey shorum hai 😅😅|||I think it's a bit nuanced than that. Who created the design document based on client requirements?

So then I realized what I have in hand that an inexperienced ones have - already useful skill, product knowledge and codebase knowledge. That is helping me in productivity. But the real growth and survival will happen if I gain the skills of a lead like a team lead, a manager, a product owner, or solution architect or any kind of lead is fine.

            "body": "I’ve been using Cursor for years.  Not just as a tool, but almost as an extension of how I think while coding. It helped me explore ideas faster, remember syntax I hadn’t used in a while, and move smoothly from thought to implementation. Over time, I stopped noticing it as a separate thing—it just became part of my workflow.  Until one day, I couldn’t access it.  For some reason, Cursor just wasn’t available. No quick fixes. No workaround. Just… gone.  At first, I thought it would be fine. *I’ve been coding for years,* I told myself. *I should be able to handle this.*  But then something unexpected happened.  I couldn’t code.  Not in the dramatic “I forgot everything forever” sense—but in a much quieter, scarier way. My mind felt blank. Things I *knew* I knew weren’t coming to me. Simple patterns felt distant. I stared at the screen, unsure how to begin. Even planning the solution felt harder than it should have been.  It felt like trying to write with a pen after years of typing—except the pen was there, and my hand just wouldn’t move.  What bothered me most wasn’t the slowdown. It was the realization of how dependent I had become. Cursor hadn’t replaced my skills, but it had been carrying a lot of cognitive load for me: memory, structure, momentum. Without it, I had to face the raw version of my thinking—and it wasn’t as sharp as I assumed.  That day forced me to sit with an uncomfortable question:  **How much of my ability was mine, and how much was outsourced?**  This isn’t a post against tools. I still believe tools like Cursor are incredibly powerful. They make us faster, more confident, and more creative. But that experience reminded me that tools can quietly reshape how we think—not always in obvious ways.  Since then, I’ve tried to rebalance things a little:  * Writing rough logic before touching code * Letting myself struggle longer instead of immediately reaching for help * Rebuilding trust in my own memory and problem-solving  I still use Cursor. I probably always will.  But now I’m more aware of the line between **augmentation** and **dependence**.  Losing access for a day didn’t just block my workflow—it exposed a blind spot.

The current world is evolving and we are actually getting productive with AI. On the other hand imposter syndrome and fear of AI taking the job and all is normal i believe.  Cursor isn’t just autocomplete.. it holds context and your coding patterns.. when that disappears suddenly, it’s normal to feel blank for a bit. I think it’s your brain missing its external cache.  If it was down for few more days, I’m pretty sure you will still get the work done with another tool, just slower. The scary part is the interruption. I agree that awareness is valuable. Knowing what we’re making and that you can rebuild it when needed is probably the healthy middle ground.|||![gif](giphy|RlrcXMffVZaouUVPGD)  AI good for idiot like me, like I'm CSS developer (I only code CSS). code only CSS my entire life(2006 - till this date) I never bother myself to learn PHP or JavaScript.

            "body": "Looking at the positioning of GLM-4.7 Flash, it’s interesting how clearly it reflects a broader shift in LLM design priorities.  Rather than pushing toward maximum reasoning depth, GLM-4.7-Flash appears optimized for:  \t•\tLow latency responses  \t•\tCost-efficient inference  \t•\tHigh-throughput, real-time applications  This aligns with a growing pattern across the industry: many practical products don’t need frontier-level reasoning they need models that feel fast, stable, and deployable at scale.  In that sense, GLM-4.7-Flash seems less about competing with top-tier reasoning models and more about filling the “always-on” layer of AI systems chat interfaces, assistants, and embedded tools where responsiveness matters more than deep chain of thought.  For emerging tech ecosystems like Nepal, this category of model may actually be more impactful than heavyweight LLMs, simply due to infrastructure, cost, and deployment realities.  It raises an interesting question:  Will we see a clear separation where speed-optimized models dominate user facing layers, while heavier models operate quietly in the background?  Curious to hear perspectives from others following this space.",

Its not hard for them to release lighter cost optimized/speed model and i think every one has their own nano version. Once the cost of labour comes down which is coming soon (as Elon envisions through optimous robots) then cost of building data centers / energy stations will be  cheap which will massively boost the AI growth. And thats when AGI comes into play - but I am having really hard time imagining what would AGI be like - they say it will completely turn the economic model of current society upside down.

There’s so much to learn but I have no idea where to start. Whenever I start learning something new for backend, I end up having self doubt like “why am I even studying this, will it actually help?” That kills my motivation and I feel like I’m jumping between things. Any suggestions on how to upskill smartly?",

Or ask people who are already in the Field whether it's something you should learn or not.   The problem might just be unplanned learning and wanting to do a lot of things at the same time.

If your post is a mere comment or reaction on that event, there is no need for a separate post.  • if it’s a repeat content, like someone has already posted the news, you can include your own ideas, inputs, thoughts along with the post with an intention to invoke engagement and meaningful discussion, this will make your post stand out among others.  • TikTok and instagram political edits with no substance in the post are being removed.  This is a temporary measure to give space to other users, topics, maintain balance and overall quality in the subreddit.  Thank you for understanding and cooperation.",

            "body": "UML as a party is quite a peculiar case study, on the surface it looks like a regular leftist/communist party with some democratic element. But it tends to show some uncharacteristic traits contrary to a leftist party, using a traditional left-right spectrum. And I haven't gotten a satisfying explanation to this phenomenon, so I came up my own.  So here's where my theory comes in...In context of Nepal, whenever we try to assess a political party we have to take into consideration one more aspect, ie. what I like to call the 'paakhey element'. According to my assessment, UML has the highest paakhey element, making it the most 'paakhey' party in the country. UML is basically a bunch of paakheys. Once you see this aspect everything makes perfect sense.  Usually, leftist parties/left leaning people usually have educated/liberal background. But in this context we have,  Paakhey + Communism = GHAATAK  This combo results in some incurable brainrot sh\\*t, thus perfectly explaining the reta\\*ded behaviours displayed by some prominent UML politicians.  That's why some coalition don't make sense if you don't consider the paakhe element. Using the paakhey element we can construct a paakhey spectrum. So according to my analysis, here's the spectrum from highsest to least paakhey parties:  UML----->RPP---------------> (Center) -->Congress, NCP--------->RSP  UML is has the highest paakhey index, while RSP is the least paakhey party. This explains the UML+RPP coalition, on the surface it might look like they are polar opposite ie. rajabadi + communist but according to my paakhey principle, they are a match made in heaven. This shows the importance of paakhey element.  Kati hardcore Yemale haruko ta anuhar batai tha huncha yo Yemale ko ho vanera. Me and my dad used to joke about this. He had this dhaka topi theory. He used to say that you can identify which party someone belongs to by the way they wear their topi. Hardcore Maoist don't wear dhaka topi, that's easy, and between NC and UML.... Congress haru le dherai jaso golo parera, flat top banayera lauchan, for eg. look at Shekhar Koirala. Yo Yemale haru le chai (if you've noticed) agadi vaachera chuucho parera lauchan.  Extraa, off-topic: This explains why our country is like this. For eg, Mero feed ma tyo iShowspeed vanne ko clip ako thyo, African tour garira raicha, saala Africa pani kasto developed raicha jatho tyo Ethiopia, Rwanda pani kya, malai ta last chitta dukhdira yaar. Haami ta last garib raichum ta keta ho tait.",

[https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/moonie-money-in-nepal-s-politics](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/moonie-money-in-nepal-s-politics)  The letters and direct messages referenced in the investigation mention three former prime ministers: Madhav Kumar Nepal who has now joined the Nepali Communist Party, K P Oli of the Communist Party of Nepal UML (Unified Marxist-Leninist), and former Maoist ideologue Baburam Bhattarai.  The documents detail financial support from the Unification Church (now known as Family Federation for World Peace and Unification) to Nepal Paribar Dal (Nepal Family Party) and its founder Ek Nath Dhakal, who is a staunch ally of the UML. On Sunday, Dhakal signed an MoU with K P Oli of the UML to cooperate in the March election and beyond.     The leaked correspondence concerning Nepal spans the period between the first federal elections in 2017 till the 2022 polls and contains emails between Dhakal and Yong Jeong Shik, Regional President for Asia of the Unification Church, with urgent requests for funds for campaigning and to support the UML.   ‘Regarding funding, I am truly sorry, but a minimum of $500,000 is required,’ one of the messages to Yong in the report says. ‘Furthermore, as the election is scheduled for December 7th \\[2017\\], I would be very grateful if I could receive it as soon as possible. The initial $500,000 was used for overall election expenses, and the additional $500,000 is intended for campaign activities for the Family Party and supporting key leaders.’  In addition, there are also letters requesting an additional $20,000 per month in ‘maintenance costs for the Nepal Family Party and preparations for the 2022 election’.",

School ma A plus lyauni manche sidhai barely passing ko level ma pugey. Kati palta exam disakesi suicidal thoughts aauthyo fail vayo vane k hola vanera. Tara aile I realized its not that serious. Ofc sapna bokechau hola voliparsi kehi garni and u gotta work hard. But dont push yourself too hard , enjoy your life a little . Your life wont end due to a damn exam there is much more to do in life. Aba parents haru ta karai rahanchan . What even can we do lol? Ani btw you are pretty damn good in maths . You will improve in other subjects too . Dont stress out|||I am in 12 now. 11 ko first term was best for me all 60 above (except that damn physics) chem ma ta 64 aathyo but i didn't think that much and tried to do good in physics.   2nd term ma physics ma 49 aayo but chemistry ma 45 that drop of 19 marks made my mental health go blind. I gave up on chemistry and physics, I didn't even want to study these two anymore tara after 3rd term 11 final 12 pre term, finally 12 ko 1st term ma physics and chem ma 52 and 53 aathyo respectively. I was satisfied enough. Ani 2nd term ma ahile physics dhostai xa, chem chain tight teacher parexa k huni ho thaxaina.   So to explain what happened here: 1. Course ko amount badhepaxi the marks drastically drop as you and I both faced.  2. The amount of stuff you have to remember is always more than you remember.  3. For mcq and reasoning questions you must read books cuz teachers don't cover everything.  At last, 11 doesn't matter that much as marks and grades, 11 class is just about the memories you build that 12 might not give you.  You look like a study kinda guy so you might have friends like that too, so i am telling you the reality here. The friends you have might not have that chill attitude later in 12th so enjoy the memories you are building cuz in 12 everyone around you will suddenly start focusing on studying and you might fall behind so 12 ma jani bittikai start learning concepts especially physics ko.   Tips for you in 11  1. Grab any opportunity you have become CR club member Host of program sing or whatever you are good at cuz you will be remembered by that more. Also being a CR or club member will benefit your bidesh ko lagi.  2. Try understanding concepts of everything. Science is all about logic if you don't understand the logic behind it you can't understand the science behind it.  3. Feel free to ask to teachers, they are not your enemies. Friends might suppress your curiosity but it doesn't mean teachers won't listen to you. Concepts bujhdainau bhane teachers lai gayera sodha If you are shy to ask them in public. Go to the teachers in the staff room or meet them in the corridor, hallways and question them. Doing this, some of your friends might call you teacher ko chatne or something like that ignore them cuz you are the one who is gonna stand in that interview after 12th not them.  4. Chill.  Tips for 12 Doing 1 will help you be a face that everyone recognizes in 12. If you don't do 1 you might regret it in 12 so go for it.  Keep doing 2 and 3. After a few months into 12, you will realize that its all about what you understand. If you can understand the concept you will remember the formulae. Like physics ko nai kura garda, concept bujhexa bhane timle mathematically k garne yaad hunxa tespaxi dimaag ma or paper mai tyo derive garera formula lekhna sakxau.   This is all about the tips rant and motivation i have for you|||dm me",

The feeling of my heart having faster and my stomach twisting like an eel holding it's prey is not new to me but still it's not wholly mine.   The feeling of lying in the bed with inherent thoughts of disperse happiness and the want to be able to understand if that happiness is as true as it seems is not new and it's also not wholly mine   I look at all these motion picture hoping to find something. And what that might be is as ananomus to me as it is to you. I look at these things, listen as they talk, but the existence of this feeling of watching doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm lying on this virgin earth, unmolested and untouched, devoid of any feeling of any sort except for one; consciousness. The consciousness reigns supreme within and without all within the vicinity of my existence.  At this point, life as you call it feels not a moments passing by or time flowing like my thoughts.  My head feels particularly heavy, as if I'm thinking but a thought is yet to process. But how can this be? Without a thought, how can you think? How can one live, without knowing the value of death? But that's not right either. For one to know the value of death,.one must first know of its qualities, it's feature in all it's dimensions. The inherent idea of a thought being, and to think not sounds stupid as if not funny enough. But you can't overlook the idea behind such ponder.   I take very long breaths as I think. My heart beats loud enough for me to hear it. And all my bodily functions seems very much obvious to me. This isn't new but it's not wholly mine.   Ahh now my head hurts a little to. But this shall too pass.   Theres this lingering feeling of solitude that I feel very sensationally. For solitude has been my friend far longer then any. The silence that made me feel alone after some years felt not pleasing but good enough to make me feel a bit stingy if it got disturbed.  But now this solitude engulfs me, strangles me so that I choke these thoughts out of me which are yet to be. But it was this very solitude that made me form a thought but now it want it back. Like how death waits right Infront of you, lingers above you with it's hands around neck, and then takes you through the stairs of lifelessness while you climb oblivious. Similar is the solitude that I experience right now, but instead of lifelessness, I climb and climb but towards nothing, I climb and climb but climb on empty thoughts.   My agitated muscles ache in the silence of my breath while my breath gets shorter and heavier each micro instant.",

Were those AI-generated, as your party president and many party leaders were claiming?  - You have raised the Sahakari Kanda involving Rabi Lamichhane, but when will you raise the same question about your own party member, Maya Rai, who was also a member of the same sahakari in Kathmandu (I’ve forgotten the name)? What about the Dhanraj Gurung sahakari case?  - You were part of the Government Efficiency team when the recent UML–Congress coalition government was formed. Will you question or take responsibility for the recent GenZ killings? Your party member Ramesh Lekhak was also the Home Minister at that time—have you questioned him about this?  - You have been a Member of Parliament four times, and during your tenure, the Congress has formed the government multiple times. Can you point to any concrete, policy-level achievements you delivered during your party’s time in government?  - What about Aftab Alam case during your party's government was he rightfully being prosecuted or your party's government have him impunity from jail, what about that case?",

Yei Cases conceal garna Gagan Thapa lai agadi sariyeko ho. So, if Gagan Thapa power ma aayo bhane, these criminal cases won't be investigation under him. And somehow Congress will be saved.|||The real answer is Bises Mahadibesan. That itself was a bidroha against the entrenched cult politics that the Deuba gang has practiced throughout its history. Deuba, as an individual, may once have been a true leader—but over time, the gang culture around him is what turned everything rotten and made him look bhrasta.  From this point onward, Gagan is free.  Free from:  All blame linked to Arzu  All accusations about money in Deuba’s house  All baggage related to Bhutani saranarthi  All the kandas, Teramox, and backroom deals  All blame connected to Lekhaks and their networks  These were never Gagan’s sins to carry.  So why should he keep answering for other people’s cults? Why should a reformist voice be held hostage by the corruption, compromises, and power games of an old guard that refuses to let go?  If anyone needs to answer, it’s the system that protected those networks for decades—not the one who finally challenged them.  Gagan doesn’t need to answer anymore. The Mahadibesan already did.|||He can give you wai wai, not sure about answers.

Yo ahile ka purano neta haru pani desh ko lagi vandai hide ka thiye ahile aafno lagi gardai xan gagan thapa pani tehi nai ho.|||\\+ Former MP from Congress Binod Chaudhary ko CG Empire's money laundering and land scandals.|||What a poor attempt to paint somebody in bad light? Don't get me wrong there are shortcomings from him and nobody is perfect but most of the questions you raised here are poor attempt to make him look bad.  You have to realize that even though Gagan is a prominient member of Nepali Congress, he was never the executive. Every decision the party makes as a whole, the chairman (Deuba) has the supreme authority and he is little to no say in any of the decisions.  Even then, he has clearly spoken against all wrongdoings. And you say \"just speak\". But that's the problem of not being in executive power, he can only speak.  You trying to  make the money burnt in Deuba's house somehow a crime by Gagan Thapa clearly tells me that you are just trying to hate. Otherwise as everyone else has said, there is a special probe commission formed to specifically study the burnt money case and all we can do is wait for their report and the government will file the case if there is wrongdoing (which we all believe there is). And Gagan has clearly affirmed this, as any sane person would. You should read him and listen his many public interviews/videos and not just assume he didn't say anything.  He has clearly said multiple times that any and all involved in sahakari kanda should be investigated including naming people from his own party by name, again multiple times in multiple of his public appearences and writings, you should read/watch/listen those. The government should file cases. I don't understand how this would be his fault.  If you again watch his comments in good faith and listen to his parliament speeches, he as said multiple times that  the public is angry, they need delivery. He said he opposed the coalition and publicly opposed it multiple times. But he is not the executive, deuba is. When there is coaliation, he has the moral responsibility to make the government successful. He was indeed in the efficiency team and he said he tried is best to make the government successful because he knew people needed delivery even though he opposed the coalition. He publicly told long before the Gen-Z protest that he couldn't get the government to do what the efficiency team was supposed to do, and he left it. So I don't think that makes him culpable for the massacre during gen-z protest.  But still he has taken moral responsibility for what happened during the protest. He has apologized multiple times for any moral culpability he has. He said he immediately asked the party leadership to break coaliation in the first day of protest and asked Lekhak to resign. Lekhak did resign but the party didn't leave coalition because again Deuba is executive and makes the decision.  He has been parliament member four times. The first time and he failed to deliver the constitution as promised which he was elected for. The second tenure was again the CA election, which delivered the constitution and you can't deny he played crucial role in making the constitution, and he (among all others) delivered the constitution. The next term he went to the parliament again and became health minister and people say he delivered some reforms in health sector (again refer to public catalogues of his works during this tenure). And you have to grant that he has been constant voice in the parliament on various issues, which the MP is sent for. This last time was a short tenure, but as everyone he has played crucial role in voicing concerns in the parliament. Ironically he strongly demanded there be independent probe in sahakari case and there have been multiple arrests and cases filed against some major fraudsters. You should grant that this was successfull. But we can always demand more. I am not his prabakta but to me seems like he could have definitely done more here and I am sure he agrees.  Yeah what about the case? Alam was a proven convict. But congress did dirty by lobbying to release him. I haven't seen him support Alam's release. Again, I am not sure the details of his release but how is Gagan culpable for the crime Alam committed?  Again I am not his prabakta. I try to speak with reason. You could certainly question that he didn't do enough at policy level as MP to propose new laws and pass them. You could ask him that he could not do enough to break Deuba stronghold. But he precisely did that recently.  Now I am watching him closely, he is now in the position to deliver at least from his party level. Make him accountable ask him tough questions. But the aforementioned questions seemed more like an attempt to make him bad (except may be how many policy changed did he make in 1 1/2 tenure as MP except CA MP which they delivered constitution).

Also, what's up with Rakshya Bam joining Congress?|||go email him and ask him directly. it is fair to question the person involved instead of turning everything into noise. tiktokey neta haru le barbad garne nai vayo at this point. all i can say is gagan is a well versed politician, still young, and someone who could probably handle being prime minister twice pretty flawlessly. not some fantasized rapper turned politician, wildly inconsistent, barely diplomatic when on ganja, and clearly not serious half the time. another one is purely opportunistic kavi lamichhane, the way he jumped into a ghatiya party just to grab griha mantralaya and settle scores with kantipurey says everything. no clear vision. he was genuinely good as a reporter but that does not translate to governance. in nepal,, politics honestly looks like the better career now, everyone villainizes wealth blindly while actors and influencers walk straight into parliament. for god’s sake, what are kaji or hakukaley planning next, film shooting inside parliament? it blows my mind.

I know why he is liked by so many given how dysfunctional your political system as been lately, but Balen's performance during his stint wasn't that great either. Sadly, no culture of constructive criticism in Nepal.|||I am satisfied with his work because I know it’s not easy. The system itself is messed up, so obviously one person alone can’t fix everything on their own. There will be tons of hurdles, especially in the capital city of the country. Not just the capital, honestly, you can even say Kathmandu as Nepal itself, because it has become the center for everything. No matter what work you have, you somehow have to come to Kathmandu for it. So yeah, I understand his situation.  The one thing I really criticize him for is his lack of communication. That is something I am very disappointed about. During his entire campaign, he kept saying that he wouldn’t be like previous mayors and that he would stay in constant communication with the public. But after winning, he almost completely stopped connecting with people. There is no proper accountability, just one-sided Facebook status updates. This is the part where I am extremely disappointed in him and openly criticize him.  Other than that, I think he has actually shown that work can be done. He has also given inspiration to young people to enter politics.|||Done In some ways  . Even non Exciting programs .Some Jhara tareko type. Some Unfeasible .. some better options appear and done.

Being a voter of KMC i can see a lot of changes in the city after Balen came as a mayor but when i saw same changes in every big cities of Nepal. It didn’t took me long to understand that he was just overhyped.   After he joined RSP where each members are opportunistic and work in Nepal for western interests it’s clear that he is not good candidate for prime minister.  He was voted to serve as a mayor, He could have waited until next election but for him misusing people’s trust and make them go against government by burning the Nation was easiest way to experience power.

Many of his supporters don’t actually live in Nepal and therefore can’t or won’t vote for him. I personally would vote for him, not because I am his blind supporter but because he is the best candidate among all. I also think that many will assume that enough people will turn up to vote for him and decide not to vote themselves, which could ultimately work against him...  Gagan, on the other hand has an established base of supporters, many of whom belong to an older demographic and live in Nepal. This makes them more likely to show up and vote, giving him an advantage...      Edit to add: Let's also not forget the power of algorithm. What we see on our socials is merely the reality. My Insta is full of Balen supporters, but these people are similar to me in terms of demography.

Gagane has been in this game for a long time, his meticulous plan for a party coup supported by Shere's stubborness worked out fantastically. Balen is hugely popular with the Gen-Z.

Like if NC becomes largest party, Gagan may try to form government and I think he will try to do it without either UML or RSP suruma. I doubt it is gonna happen.

            "body": "I stand with Sushila Karki, the interim Prime Minister of Nepal. She was appointed with a clear and limited mandate—to conduct a general election, not to focus on long-term national development. Her tenure lasted for around six months, which itself explains the boundaries of her authority and responsibility.  Many people over-criticize her, especially for failing to arrest KP Oli and those responsible for the killing of 77 youths during the Gen-Z protest. Such criticism ignores political reality. It is unrealistic to expect a short-term interim government, formed solely to hold elections, to take major legal and political actions of this magnitude within such a limited time frame.  I respect Sushila Karki because she chose democracy over everything else. She prioritized free and fair elections above personal popularity or political pressure. Because of her vision and restraint, Nepal is now only 40 days away from a general election, which is a major achievement given the instability she inherited.  Regarding KP Oli and the protest killings, an investigation department has already completed its report. The responsibility now lies with the next elected government. If the people of Nepal vote for the right individuals and parties, they will have the authority to act on the report—either by filing charges, making arrests, or even launching a fresh investigation into the massacre of 77 youths.  If I were in her place, I would have made the same choice. I would have placed a fair and secure election above everything else, even above my own life. Without elections, justice and accountability remain impossible.  I thank Sushila Karki for choosing elections over chaos and for not allowing Nepal to descend into prolonged instability like Bangladesh. When she assumed office, Nepal was extremely unstable, violent, and unrestful. By the end of her tenure, the country was far more stable than before.  If the upcoming election is smooth and fair, I will personally rank her among the best Prime Ministers Nepal has had, even though she led only an interim government.",

            "body": "I was somehow inside the parliament premises on Sept. 8. The Special Task Forces (STF -commando trained police personnel), who did the shootings, had barrack inside the parliament premise. They were \\~100-120 in number. We could hear in the walkie talkie of the commander inspector Mr. Adhikari that the crowd outside was 12,000. Some demonstrators broke the wall on the south west corner, got inside, dragged and threw away 75+ yo mother of a BICC employee from the quarter building and set the little building on fire. It was around12. The booth of STF commander at the main gate was already burned down. The commander also had his wife living with him there. He was saying that his wedding ring, chain, other valuables, and documents were burned down. Many STF police had their wifes and kids living with them in the quarter inside the parliament premise. Demonstrators repeatedly tried to storm inside from the front gate, broke the walls in several places and got in several times. Police chased them outside repeatedly. The police started with water gun, tear gas, and rubber bullets. Ran out of ammo of rubber bullets, as we could hear. Several of us were on the ground. The commander was around us. Finally he ordered to shoot below the knees after he thought nothing was working anymore and the crowd was still repeatedly trying to break inside. We did hear that command. Several injured police personnels were being carried back by fellow policemen. We were on the ground fearing our lives and so were the police. They were telling us that they would escort us from the RBB gate in a police vehice should the crowd get in. That would have been a worse idea. We would probably have been burned alive inside. That didn't happen, thankfully. We escaped at around 8.30 PM. The police used excessive force because they were highly outnumbered and felt threatened. I personally feel they did so in order to prevent the crowd getting in due to two reasons: 1) do their duty to safeguard the parliament, 2) protect themselves, their families, and their valuables in the barrack inside. And the crowd treated the STFs like normal police who disperse crowd with laathi charge. They are deployed there for a reason. STFs were the last line of defense at BICC. Each of them were commando trained personnels. It was the innocence of the crowd or may be lost sanity, that they were teasing/threatening the sharpshooter policemen with gun, in the nishedhit chhetra. Everything that happened between police and the demonstrators that day saw equal and opposite reaction. Police and demonstrators are both justified in their action, from their own perspective.  I feel sorry for the families of the people that lost their lives that day. May the departed souls rest in peace!  Edit: I know this post is going to trigger a good debate. Let me clarify, I believe this is my objective observation. I could be biased towards the STF because I feel they saved us that day. No material facts have been added or omitted or modified. Opinions are personal. Will appreciate your civil yet airtight counter arguments. Thanks!",

            "body": "In politics, what you see is rarely the truth. If you dig deeper and treat our history not as a series of accidents, but as a dataset, a clear algorithm of disillusionment emerges.  Someone once said religion is the opium of the people. In Nepal, Hope is the opium. And every few years, we get a new \"dealer\" who feeds us a specific drug (hope) to keep us high while the system remains exactly the same.  # The \"Drug\" and the \"Dealer\"  If you look at the historical data (same thing applies for Rana's and Panchayat era as well), every major shift follows this pattern:  * The Dealer: Prachanda (treated like a God). * The Drug: One ruling family is the only obstacle. * The Result: We took the drug, got the high, the King left, but we woke up and Singapore and Switzerland was hallucination. * The Dealer: KP Oli (treated like a God). * The Drug: Ultra-Nationalism & Chuchhe Naksha. * The Result: A lot of speeches and a new map, but the \"trains and ships\" were just hallucinations. * The Dealers: The Balen/Ravi duo (treated like Gods). * The Drug: Accountability & Managerial Heroism. * The Status: The public is currently \"peaking\" on this high.  # Pani Maa Paadeko Effect  We are currently obsessed with the bubbles. Bulldozers clearing slums, viral parliamentary speeches, and aggressive social media posts create a lot of noise. But as the saying goes, it’s all \"Pani maa paadeko jasto.\" It creates a lot of air bubbles on the surface, it makes a sound, but once the bubbles pop, the water level (system) hasn't moved an inch. The water is just as deep and just as stagnant as it was before.  # Model ko Overfitting  For the tech minded, the problem is overfitting. Every new leader trains their model on a very narrow set of public frustrations (e.g. corruption, or India). Because the model is so overfitted to the public's current anger, it looks perfect during the training phase (campaign). But when they face the Test Data the actual reality of an old patronage network, a resistant bureaucracy, and international pressure, the model fails. A linear solution of one strong leader cannot fix a non linear, complex system.  # How to Break the Loop  If history and data trends tell us anything, today’s excitement will hit the same wall as the Maoists and the UML before them. Politics cannot escape the cycle of patterns. The \"Drug of Hope\" feels good, but it doesn't build nations. We will only break the loop when we stop looking for a dealer to make us high and start focusing on the unglamorous work of fixing the source code: our institutions, our rules, and our own civic responsibility.",

            "comments": "Sanitation engineer's (Janitor) perspective  I don't have datasets or algorithms. I have keys, a broom, and a schedule that never changes no matter who is in power. From where I stand, politics isn’t complicated at all. It’s like a building that keeps changing managers, but nobody ever fixes the plumbing. People argue about ideology upstairs. Down here, the pipes still leak. The Building and the Managers. Every few years, a new manager comes in wearing a clean suit and big promises. They don’t ask how the building actually works. They don’t talk to the people who clean it, guard it, or keep the lights on. They just repaint the lobby and change the signboard. From my logbook, the pattern is always the same:  The Maoist Management:  The Manager: Prachanda (spoken of like he’d demolish the old building and build a new one).  The Promise: “Once the King is gone, everything will flow.”  What I Saw: The portraits changed. The leaks didn’t. The same people kept using the service elevator.  The UML Management:  The Manager:KP Oli (spoken of like he’d modernize the whole place).  The Promise: New wings, new routes, new connections.  What I Saw: More speeches in the lobby. Still power cuts. Still broken toilets on the top floor.  The Current Management:  The Managers: Balen and Ravi (spoken of like they finally understand the mess).  The Promise: Discipline, order, accountability.  What I See Now: Sudden inspections. Loud scoldings. Cameras everywhere. The dust is finally visible but it was always there.  Cleaning During Office Hours  When bulldozers come, people cheer. When speeches go viral, people clap. But I know this rule: If you only clean when visitors are watching, the dirt just moves to another room. Slums get cleared, but no one checks where the waste water goes. Files get shouted about, but no one updates the maintenance manual. A lot of noise, a lot of dust—then silence. By evening, I’m still sweeping the same corridor.   Temporary Fixes, Permanent Problems  Some managers love quick fixes. Tape over a crack. Paint over mold. Replace a worker instead of fixing the system that broke them.They think one strict supervisor can fix a building that’s been neglected for decades. But old pipes don’t respond to shouting. Rust doesn’t care about speeches. This place isn’t broken because one person was bad. It’s broken because everyone learned how to survive the brokenness.   How Buildings Actually Get Fixed.   I’ve seen one thing that works, and it’s never glamorous. You shut down sections, even when people complain. You replace pipes nobody ever sees. You write rules and follow them even when it’s inconvenient. You train people, not just fire them. You accept that real repairs take time and look boring.Most importantly, you stop pretending the problem is the previous manager.  Final Note from the Basement.  From where I work, hope isn’t a drug. It’s a cleaning schedule.If you only feel hopeful when a new manager arrives, the building will always stink. Real change is when the lights stay on, the water runs clean, and nobody needs to clap because things just work.Until then, I’ll keep mopping the same floor while upstairs, they argue about who deserves the credit.|||As a data science student this is gold lol 😂|||Software Engineer's perspective  Nepal’s democracy behaves like a legacy system with frequent leadership swaps but no structural upgrades. Every election is a new deployment trained on short-term public mood - hope, anger, anti-corruption talk. It passes campaign tests, then fails in production when it hits the real stack: bureaucracy, patronage networks, coalition maths, foreign pressure.   Same bugs, every cycle: - Overfitting: slogans over reality. - Single-leader illusion: PM treated as the whole system. - Frontend noise: speeches, ordinances, symbolism — backend untouched. - Hope as cache: feels instant, expires fast.   Why nothing changes: - No regression tests against past governments. - No rollback when policies fail. - Institutions never get a schema migration. - Incentives reward noise, not delivery.   What democracy actually needs: - Fewer “strong leader” releases. - Slow, boring institutional refactors. - Reduced discretionary power. - Clear contracts between parliament, bureaucracy, courts, local governments. - Real observability: transparency, audits, consequences.   You can’t fix Nepal’s democratic system by rotating prime ministers. That’s not a leadership issue - it’s an architectural one.|||Not reading all that AI generated slop.|||Whats a data scientist?|||Kaslai vote dida ramro huncha, timi vanana ta.

            "body": "For a long time in Nepali political arena we needed the the big parties to completely reform and move with the flow of time. Led by leaders since panchyat system, their mindset was never going to understand the demand of time. So a big reform was necessary right after the constitution was promulgated.  As much as I absolutely despise the 10 year long violent \"war\" led (in part) by Dr. Bhattarai, he realized that communism and the political agendas like किसान मुक्ति, भुमि वितरण etc were far outdated. He tried to start a political party with mostly economic reform agenda (आर्थिक क्रान्ति). But an ideologue barely makes a good crowd-puller a rabble-rouser of some sort, he had Prachanda as a demagogue in the so called \"war\". I have to give props to Dr. Bhattarai for taking a complete U-turn right after constitution was promulgated, although he kept insisting using the word Socialism, I bet he favoured free market economy of some sort. Anyway the point is he felt the need of reform and tried doing so.  It was clear that Oli led UML, Deuba led Congress and Dahal led (whatever party names he keeps on chaning everyday) was never going to understand the demand of time. Their whole mindset was so cooked up in cycle of getting to power and remaining in power till next election, it was almost a perfectly curated impregnable wall. Voices like Gagan Thapa tried to voice reforms in the Nepali Congress party, but the wall was impregnable. For example, in one of the central committee meetings he is seen saying things like (upto my translation), \"Why precisely do we need to be in government? What are we going to do that we won't do if we are in opposition? What plans do we have and how are we executing this?\" These were very important question and almost none in the central committee would understand the true depth of what he was trying to convey.  Gagan Thapa was somewhere in the middle. He was neither a true demagogue like Oli or Dahal despite his very strong oratory skills. Nor somebody who could start from scratch like Bhattarai on a true ideologue spirit. And the Nepali Congress party kept hanging by a thread. There had been constant tussle between the old guard and the new, but the thread never quite broke. The other two, Oli led and Dahal led party had absolutely no room for any dissent. Any and every opposing voice would be silenced and expelled.  It was clear, Oli and Dahal led parties stood no chance of any reform and Gagan Thapa and co couldn't muster enough strength to finally break that thread in congress. We needed alternatives. Ujjwal Thapa (not sure how politically mature he was) attempted to do it completely from scratch, but the literacy and overall intelligence of average Nepali wasn't quite ready enough to accept the ideal political culture. And this was going to need a lot of time and people were running out of patience.  It was as if we needed a new demagogue in the political discourse, one who would capture the public sentiment. The rise of Rabi Lamichhane and RSP is the approval from the public of their desire of new demagogue. He promised reforms in the whole political landscape almost by magic. The only political ideolgy he ever needed to sell was, getting rid of three Bas, Kepi Ba, Nanika Ba and Deu ba. He didn't quite tell how he would do that, but people liked the idea of breaking the musical chair circus, that they immediately jumped ship.  Where are we now, we have a new party led by a demagogue, who are completely dearth of any sort of constancy in their ideology either economically or politically. People who seek any hint of their economic ideology are confused by whether it is free market economy (Dr. Wagle) or more socialist विना ढेऊवाके, (Balen). Dr. Wagle started a sentence with, \"People portray us as anti federalist but ... \" and then went on to stretch that sentence so long I had no idea what it was. In that long sentence all I was able to glean was that he equivocated between getting rid of \"pradesh sabha\" (very cunningly curated phrase) and denying that they were anti federalists. I would think this is not a lack of clarity within themselves, but a tool they use to please everyone. Both the anti-federalists and federalists think that they are one of them and both the socialists and the capitalists accept them as one of them. This blatant hypocracy is not because Dr. Wagle, a PhD in economics, doesn't understand the difference, but that he knows its a powerful weapon to attract votes.  People don't realize it, but they are in this trap now. Rabi is the hero they needed, the promises he makes, the emotional soap opera he recites are perfect. So much so that they are completely turning blind eye on the very reform that they actually are seeking. Making the institutions stronger, improving trust in the institutions and never compromising in the rule of law are some fundamental pillars, that he is completely shattering. The trap is that its almost unthinkable that you'd support the Oli-Deuba-Dahal trio, but also extremely hard turn blind eye on the fundamentals. People don't realize this trap, they are in this euphoric phase of escaping the Ba trio, that the fundamentals are far down in the order of priorities. But that's precisely how we make base for new age disappointment to be realized only decades later. I sometimes think the blatant disregard of rule of law (Attorney General letters), the complete distrust in institutions that RSP has perpetrated in the public might be more damaging than this power hungry ba musical chair. But it would be disingenuous to pretend that the ba trio have not damaged the fundamental pillars. So this trap is obvious and yet not so easy to get out of.  We don't have to go far back in history. We were in almost precisely identical state in the recent past as a society. It was a mixture of both euphoria and fear due to the end of so called \"war\". Another demagogue in Dahal equivocated between accepting the parliamentary politics to the public and outright describing it as another step of state capture to his cadres. He probably had better dreams to sell than Rabi now, like claiming singapore etc. Despite the vast majority his party received in the first election, he had to organize a laughable press meet during the counting phase of the following election, claiming extremely baseless accusation of widespread voter faud. It only took 5 years for people to realize that a demagogue isn't taking us anywhere. But the damage had been done, he still uses his tricks everytime to get the \"magical number\" to always be in the ba trio, to form the impregnable wall.  Take for example the events of the last month alone, Rabi got out of jail, had part of his case withdrawn (still in process I believe at this point), had the ministers the \"public government\" deny their involvement in RSP until the very last nanosecond and immediately go run for election. Now running for election isn't anything wrong, the opposite infact is the case, its the beauty of democracy. But the denial to the very last second, begs a question why? Why not declare that you are running, what did you have to hide? Self managed newspaper printed that he wasn't going to run in the morning and in the evening he resigned to register candidacy next morning. Fishy much? Not one but three ministers of \"public government\" (wanted to) joined the new party denying till the last nanosecond.  Sounds like I am selling pessimism too much. Its undeniable, the hope that RSP has sparked is truly commendable, the future PM Balen has made visible changes in the city he was Mayor of. Equally undeniable is the kind of mindset RSP has triggered out of euphoria has a long term effect. I encourage them to question and have alternative view given fair bit of thought.  Another minor qualm I have is how petty the RSP supporters are against any minor hint of opposition to RSP, especially here in reddit. But it seems like, we as a society are like that, making very petty personal attacks against opposition, so can't uniquely attribute RSP for this. This also means on average that they don't necessarily have have higher moral fibre as they grew out of the ba trio.",

I was expecting her to bring out more intellectuality in every speech she gives, because even by her professional history one can expect her to know what not to spew. But she did it anyway, why? Because janata wouldn't condemn \"little\" things like this, because ANYONE who is in that responsible position would know what is lethal for that position, what would be \"you know... acceptable\" and what they should fear. But with the quality of citizens we have, we will keep on getting the leader we deserve. Where could we make this right? Raise whole generation of kids who would know right questions and right demands. Who would ask for politically correct, accountable, ceedible leaders to run government because that too would count eventually as it is the sign that leader are fearful of people not just some shepherd who would ram all followers to the wall.

The trap you are talking about feels real to me, as someone who saw the rise of prachanda, then oli, i cant help but notice the same pattern with rabi and balen. I fear, this new frenzy, in some ways can be even more detrimental than previous ones, fueled by social media we are seeing groupthink like never before,  we are witnessing the birth of a new jholeygiri. A generation that was largely apolitical till sept 8 was suddenly forced and required to understand politics, and where did they go to do so? to social media where clout=competence. All of them are united not by principle but by the mere fact that they arent the oldies, this is just tribal instinct not politics.    With regards to RSPs ambiguity, we know in the case of swornim wagle its strategic but for most of RSP its ignorance. They sit on the fence because they have no ground to stand upon, no principle to adhere to, they are a motley crew of dissidents, influencers, tv loudmouths and youtubey wannabes. To give them credit they have few good ones who actually know whats up, but can they make rational decisions against the force they have relied on, the populist base?? Can they please both  federalists and anti federalists at once, the ones who believe government should run industries and the ones  who believe the opposite?? if tomorrow swornim says mcc was a good agreement he will be branded a \"bideshi dalal\" by many of  the RSP supporters. The only thing they can do to keep up the act will be more doublespeak.   The disillusionment this type of politics eventually brings is the real issue. 5/10 years down the line where will the people look to. Our institutions are barely surviving, oldies did no good to them, new ones are already making it worse. My fear is people will give up on democracy itself and hand this country to some \"benevolent dictator\", a fascist. Just looking around the world,  the liberal world order is dead, trump posts edicts on social media, the world is heading to absolute chaos, our leadership, our institutions are severly ill equipped to handle the coming era.|||It’s inevitable that the party is gonna break even if they win the election.

Because let’s be clear we only need few competent ministers.|||\"Criticism is rarely pleasant, but it is necessary.\" Winston Churchill said it, though the attribution matters less than the truth behind it. In Nepal, criticism is not merely discouraged; it is treated as betrayal. Anyone who questions dominant narratives is quickly labelled a bideshi dalal or a bheda serving another ideology.  This attitude existed during the Panchayat era, persisted through the monarchy, continued under the so-called Tin Tauke period, and it is likely to survive into the current Rabi Balen Gagan moment as well. And might as well pass onto the generation after that. Dissent here is only tolerated when it targets the other side. You will become bheda of opposite ideology if it comes inwards.  Nepali society understands pain, and they treat it. When the hand hurts, it is treated. When the pain returns, it is treated again. But we always avoid to look for why the pain keeps coming back.  Also, there is a persistent black and white view of politics here. Either he is Completely good or he is completely bad. Either he is god/Messiah or he is a devil. There is no in between. Today’s villain can easily become tomorrow’s hero, and vice versa. Political dialogues and debates can not foster in such society and until that happens, we can not get a government that is accountable to it's people. We will just pass on the baton from one Messiah to another and country will be in the same place it was 50 years ago.|||Damn i was thinking similar.

Genuine reform can only emerge from within society itself, and development will always be gradual, regardless of who comes to power.  I disagree with your claim that Balen is a socialist. My reading of his speech is that he was mocking the old politicians who label themselves as socialists while failing to practice it in any meaningful way. By saying that his actions are more “socialist” than theirs, he was not affirming himself as a socialist. Rather, he was highlighting the hypocrisy of those politicians and implying that even without claiming the label, his work aligns more with what they claim to stand for. The underlying message is that he does not need ideological branding to deliver results.  As I said, political patterns repeat. Just as there was massive public support when the three traditional parties first emerged....allowing them to thrive, build cadres, and consolidate power.....the same process is now happening with RSP and a new generation of politically engaged citizens.  Despite being aware of these cycles, I will still vote for RSP and Balen.....because why not? It is my democratic right. More importantly, seeing the old cadres confront the consequences of their incompetence after losing elections is part of the democratic process itself. This contestation helps democracy mature and strengthens democratic culture in the long run.|||got hooked into it right from the start; it was a great read. enjoyed it thoroughly. Though I am an RSP supporter.|||This guy needs to loose this election at all cost. Totally shameless, he just used genZ protests and all as ladder for his political journey.|||This shit needs to lose this election. He kept us in illusion. Enjoyed the perks of Minister and at the time of conducting elections he went on to contest it|||I don't think we can assume Balen as completely socialist as he was talking about the scholarships he provided in Kathmandu, He just wanted to satire the old party leaders'  free visa free ticket with free education(scholarship) instead. Will it really create an ideological war just because of it?    I completely agree with RSP's lack of transparency and support Sumana Shrestha's decision.   Right now, there is a lack of options for people to choose from. We are still a young democracy (undisturbed), so it will take time, I suppose.|||[removed]|||This needs to be the top post|||This is good|||And what do you say about Gagan Thapa?

About the plateau, it doesn't come in 1 2 months it takes time mostly seen after a long time. In reality 1kg muscle gain takes about 2 3 months for a beginner.

You can take protein powder or mass gainer, if want to speed up the process.

            "body": "I know many youths here and across Nepal are thinking about either voting for RSP or NC (Some might go for other parties but I don’t think it is a lot). Here are my reasons for voting for RSP this time.  **1.Fundamental Changes:** I believe that RSP has more chance of bringing fundamental changes in Nepal, be it amending laws or creating new ones or reforming our civil service or public education/health institutions than Gagan led NC. Gagan Thapa seems better than most old politicians but he has been part of the same system for decades and so Can he fundamentally bring changes to Nepal?? RSP is the only major political party right now with no student unions (in colleges and schools), no trade unions (in our civil service and other public institutions) while we know Gagan came from Nepal students Union. So can he then bring laws that will ban student unions in colleges or ban party unions in our bureaucracy?? Can he do really merit based appointments when we know there will be enormous party pressure to appoint their own people?? RSP has their supporters but it is much less than NC and they can do merit based appointments. Can NC bring serious changes in our economy when we all know who funds them?? I think not. The new appointments for anti corruption body CIAA is coming up, Will NC appoint people there who are gonna investigate many of their own leaders or RSP will do so who were in govt for a very small time.   **2. Diversity of candidates:** Vast majority of NC candidates have been in politics their whole lives but either changed their camp from Deuba  to Gagan, or Gagan picked his own people. Contrast that with RSP where you have some candidates involved from other parties but also many who were not in politics before, some are Doctors, many are engineers (including Balen himself), many social activists and community organizers. There is diversity and this will help in forming laws in Nepal.   **3. Balen as Prime minister:** Balen Shah is RSP PM candidate and a vote for RSP is making Balen PM. Is he perfect?? Absolutely not and he has to improve certain things but let us look at his record as KMC Mayor. Zero corruption allegations against him (If there was even a little, he would have been arrested and jailed already as CIAA is under control of old parties) and that is a major plus. His administration has preserved over 200 ropanis of publicly encroached land before, he provided scholarships in private schools and colleges to thousands of lower income students which was never done before, there has been development in KMC too. He did all this, and he also worked with other parties especially NC and UML ward chairs in doing so. Many times, his plans were thwarted by Nepal govt. With this record already in place, yes I think we should give him  a chance this time and let us see what changes he can bring as Prime minister of Nepal. There will also be checks and balances against him within his own party and in Parliament.   **4. Gen Z protest acknowledgment:** RSP was the first major party to acknowledge Gen Z movement, you have some Gen Z leaders in their central committee and also are given tickets. I believe if RSP has a government they can bring people who killed Nepali youths in Bhadra 23 to justice. Can NC do that??     These are just some reasons I have in voting for RSP this time. It is basically in hope of fundamental changes. Their party manifesto is yet to come for this election. Here are their mission and vision, [https://rspnepal.org/about/mission-and-vision](https://rspnepal.org/about/mission-and-vision).

Recent agitation of Balen during nomination, i mean now he really need to decide whether he wants to be a politician like others are or want to be a LEADER? who can bring the change for good (please don't BS like dherai manche thiyen and blah blah, what if everyone start behaving like this at the time of stress be a politician, government servant, teachers, medical people, police?)  And most importantly if they win Balen will be Pm but he is not gonna be \"The Government\", there gonna be other ministers and member aswell, so my thought is we should not make a single person \"The messiah\" as it is not gonna help us in long term, lets not make someone that powerful that people cannot question him (eg is neighbor, where they made one politician so powerful that people started comparing him to God and anyone who question the supreme is antin@tional, and bizarre is no minister is competent and got free pass because of one face).  Have u guys checked whether previous \"mananiya\" has live upto the standard be it of any party, what good they bring to their constituency? where is their report card or they just wanna swim in the wave of Balen. where is there accountability? (people may call me anything but  its totally genuine to ask question to the people u support, people u have hope with)  **Lastly** more power to current PM, she is the one standing there for all the causes and making sure nothing can put a break on her purpose. But very much hurt by all the other ministers as they used the sentiment of youth against previous government to strengthen their political game and left her in the middle of the road to fight alone. having political ambition is not wrong in itself but if u had such ambitions one shouldn't have joined the interim government  **(Ashamed)**",

At the time, he and his supporters claimed he was accepted to Harvard, that he needed financial support for his degree, and that Nepal desperately needs Harvard-educated leaders in politics. He even showed what looked like credentials and acceptance-related documents. I bought into that vision and decided to support him, even if it was a small amount.  Now, he’s contesting in Kathmandu-4, and I’m trying to look up his academic background. What’s strange is that I can’t find any clear mention of a completed Harvard degree anywhere. He just says he was accepted at Harvard, but why did he need the money if he was only accepted?",

(Should I personally ask them to deduct 5% TDS?)  I also receive USD payments from an EU-based company. In that case, tax is deducted twice: first by the platform itself (approximately 3.5%), and then another 5% TDS is deducted here. When the funds arrive, my bank automatically converts the USD to NPR based on the prevailing exchange rate and credits it to my account in Npr.  I opened a USD account (dollar card) using my PAN. The annual limit is USD 500, but as far as I understand, this limit is only for payments/spending. Is it possible to increase this limit or ask the bank to keep incoming USD directly in that USD account instead of converting it to NPR?  Another question is that, if i’am to receive payments from a subscription based service from a platform apps i made, i basically can’t from nepal, for that i either need the LLC or C-Corp registered in US banks that accepts remote workers no ?  Up to how much extent can nepal banks provide services to be able to pay and receive payments internationally ? Or which banks ? That can win over the limitation of dollar cards ?

I was working for one of the renowned company.. they made us use the cursor. They kept telling us to have 2x productivity. We also able to burn the tickets more that we used to do in non AI days.. cursor was able to grasp a project context and was able to finish our 5 sp task as of 1 sp task 😅😅.  we work in micro service architecture and we need to constantly give cursor the context about other services and there was also dependency with others team and well cursor cannot communicate with other team like a actual human do 😁 So the point is that if the system is complex cursor/AI won't be able to do all things on its own.   But recently I switched company. Here we are now building smaller smaller project and sending it to the mass to get subscriptions as fast as possible.. and guess what we are using lovable to build the system. Lovable + supabase + stripe = boom product.

            "body": "I’ve been using Cursor for years.  Not just as a tool, but almost as an extension of how I think while coding. It helped me explore ideas faster, remember syntax I hadn’t used in a while, and move smoothly from thought to implementation. Over time, I stopped noticing it as a separate thing—it just became part of my workflow.  Until one day, I couldn’t access it.  For some reason, Cursor just wasn’t available. No quick fixes. No workaround. Just… gone.  At first, I thought it would be fine. *I’ve been coding for years,* I told myself. *I should be able to handle this.*  But then something unexpected happened.  I couldn’t code.  Not in the dramatic “I forgot everything forever” sense—but in a much quieter, scarier way. My mind felt blank. Things I *knew* I knew weren’t coming to me. Simple patterns felt distant. I stared at the screen, unsure how to begin. Even planning the solution felt harder than it should have been.  It felt like trying to write with a pen after years of typing—except the pen was there, and my hand just wouldn’t move.  What bothered me most wasn’t the slowdown. It was the realization of how dependent I had become. Cursor hadn’t replaced my skills, but it had been carrying a lot of cognitive load for me: memory, structure, momentum. Without it, I had to face the raw version of my thinking—and it wasn’t as sharp as I assumed.  That day forced me to sit with an uncomfortable question:  **How much of my ability was mine, and how much was outsourced?**  This isn’t a post against tools. I still believe tools like Cursor are incredibly powerful. They make us faster, more confident, and more creative. But that experience reminded me that tools can quietly reshape how we think—not always in obvious ways.  Since then, I’ve tried to rebalance things a little:  * Writing rough logic before touching code * Letting myself struggle longer instead of immediately reaching for help * Rebuilding trust in my own memory and problem-solving  I still use Cursor. I probably always will.  But now I’m more aware of the line between **augmentation** and **dependence**.  Losing access for a day didn’t just block my workflow—it exposed a blind spot. And honestly, I’m glad it did.  Sometimes, a blank screen isn’t a failure.  Sometimes, it’s a mirror.",

The current world is evolving and we are actually getting productive with AI. On the other hand imposter syndrome and fear of AI taking the job and all is normal i believe.  Cursor isn’t just autocomplete.. it holds context and your coding patterns.. when that disappears suddenly, it’s normal to feel blank for a bit. I think it’s your brain missing its external cache.  If it was down for few more days, I’m pretty sure you will still get the work done with another tool, just slower. The scary part is the interruption. I agree that awareness is valuable. Knowing what we’re making and that you can rebuild it when needed is probably the healthy middle ground.|||![gif](giphy|RlrcXMffVZaouUVPGD)  AI good for idiot like me, like I'm CSS developer (I only code CSS). code only CSS my entire life(2006 - till this date) I never bother myself to learn PHP or JavaScript.

            "body": "Hello everyone,  I am a 16 year old Class 10 student from Nepal. I am currently working on a personal AI assistant project called Sorvx AI. I would like to share it with the community to gather technical feedback and suggestions. I also build and share other development projects and experiments on my personal website, [sagarb.com](https://sagarb.com) .You can find general information about the Sorvx platform at [sorvx.com](http://sorvx.com) , while the beta application is hosted separately.  This project started as a tool to improve coding workflows. It included AI supported coding and debugging. Over time, it has grown into a general purpose assistant that can handle tasks like research, summaries, planning, learning, and problem solving. The main goal of this project is to combine research tools, sandboxed execution, and multiple AI models into one user friendly interface for developers and general users.  I developed this project alongside my academic studies, and it is currently my largest personal software project. I continue to work on improving the system architecture, performance, and reliability.  The platform is currently in beta testing, and some features are still experimental. I recently integrated the Brave Search API for web searches. Because Brave limits requests to one per second, I am using a queue based system to handle requests. This may slow down responses during busy times. The sandbox based command execution is also in beta and may be slow or unstable in some cases. Additionally, file and image uploads are temporarily disabled due to current API limitations. Sometimes, if the OpenRouter API rate limit is exceeded, the chatbot may return an empty or failed response. I am actively monitoring and addressing these limitations.  At this stage, I am seeking feedback on usability, performance, reliability, and overall system design rather than promotion. I have hands on experience with AI integrations and web application development. I am especially interested in technical insights, best practices, or constructive suggestions from those with experience in AI platforms, search APIs, backend scaling, or production deployment.  If I receive enough community support or funding in the future, I plan to introduce additional LLM model options within the platform. I will also implement a credit based system for usage after my SEE examinations to help with scalability and fair usage management.  If you would like to test the beta version and provide feedback, the application is available here:  [https://sorvx.io/](https://sorvx.io/)  Thank you for taking the time to read this post. I truly appreciate any feedback, advice, or technical suggestions from the community.",

This has now gotten out of hand, and this type of behavior will surely spread to other tourist areas, especially those closer to the border like Sauraha and others. I have seen these 'tourists' in Thars and other SUVs riding recklessly on our highways, mocking our rules and laws. In my local area in the Terai, there have been a couple of incidents where such SUVs have hit locals, including traffic police, and fled to India.  Let's continue to do what we can from our end - I have reported the videos and his channel, and let's keep reporting those videos wherever we find them, and from any other Indian 'YouTubers'. Influencers from Pokhara need to raise their voices collectively on other popular social media channels like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Local influencers need to unite and raise this issue from their platforms in their individual capacities. Otherwise, we might be just one incident away from breaking news.  I will share this thread with a popular Indian YouTube journalist-The Deshbhakt. I have been following him, and he has made videos on such stupidity by Indian tourists. I will leave his Instagram link here so that everyone with evidence can share information.

We talk about decentralization, Federal system, we claim to have provincial capitals, yet when it comes to real power, real identity, and real rights, we are still forced to knock on Kathmandu’s doors. Why should that be? Kathmandu should be a place we visit by choice to walk its Streets, to bow our heads at Pashupatinath, Swayambhnath... not a place we are compelled to go just to be heard.|||I have seen his public speeches, they have never sounded as good as he does here.

Minor improvements to streets and basic municipal actions are being celebrated as extraordinary achievements, while far more serious national issues are at stake.  Nepal is a country with a deep-rooted identity, culture, and values that have existed for centuries. Yet today, we seem to be losing our sense of judgment, influenced heavily by social media popularity rather than thoughtful evaluation. In the process, we are slowly drifting away from our ethics, integrity, and understanding of how we should act as citizens and how we should choose to be governed.  Governance should not be reduced to visibility and viral moments. Appreciation must be based on substance, responsibility, and long-term impact, not hype.

Even Bibek Thapaliya was hiding his affiliations, and KMAG still hides theirs. This guy just picked up that post and used it to make himself look good again.  I know how biased he is or maybe he doesn’t even realize how he got used. This is how Gagan operates. He invites these influencers, keeps them close, so they don’t post or make content against him. By doing these meetings, he slowly creates a soft corner in their mind and heart. So later, when Gagan messes up, they hesitate to criticize him because they’ve met him personally and think, “He’s a good guy.”  This is also how Gagan has managed to influence journalists across different media houses. Not all of them are in his inner circle, but he subtly shapes how they think. He invites them, talks to them, and slowly pushes the narratives he wants—who’s bad, what’s bad, and how to counter certain people.  The social media ban happened when Congress was in government, right? He won’t openly say, “Support me” or “Make things favor me,” but indirectly he keeps planting ideas like, I’m the only one who can fix this, and stuff like that.  This is a very familiar pattern with Gagan Thapa. First, influencers like these create noise online, and once it starts getting attention, he jumps in and talks about the issue as if he really cares. If he genuinely cared about social media, he could’ve spoken up against the social media ban when Congress was in power.  Even during the Gen Z protest, he subtly planted leaders like Tanuja and Rakshya Bam through his media outlet, Setopati. Their interviews were pushed again and again, filling the feed with news about what Rakshya and Tanuja were saying. Slowly, that turned into posts supporting Gagan Thapa. In the end, neutral and unaware people start feeling like, oh, Gagan is the hero we were looking for, just because these figures they follow are also backing him.  Ask him if he made any contents on Gagan Thapa?  \\-  Did he made video when Congress tried to sneak in a loophole in the cooling period? What happened to Khatiwada then after?  \\- Did he made how gagan thapa surviving without doing a single job?  \\- When Congress/UML tried to pass 5 years corruption expiry bill.  \\- Even to debunk PACT corruption where Gagan Thapa was alleged, even to debunk the allegation. (he wont, cz truth or not, many will know about this case and will have -ve perception of Gagan)  \\- Why is he surrounded and hangs out with Goons?  \\- Why WikiLeaks has Gagan Thapa as key embassy contact?  No, he won’t do that, because he’ll always have a soft corner for Gagan Thapa. That’s how Gagan Thapa works he spreads narratives through influencers like him, who knowingly or unknowingly end up producing such content.  Another example is Gagan doing small meetings on “populism” and then letting influencers create content around that topic to “spread awareness.” For influencers, it looks like he’s thinking about the nation. But from Gagan’s point of view, he knows those influencers will create content that ends up being subtly targeted at new faces.  https://preview.redd.it/x4nqjclj1veg1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=5303b0b09e8b772195bbc2a80116bd3b9f25bdb5|||RONB le tetro Balen ko chusekai chusai cha ta 3 4 barsa bata yo vanda badi jholagiri ta kai dekhechaina kunai media le koi lai gareko.

            "body": "As you can see, the person highlighted in the red circle is Binayak Kuikel, a YouTuber who runs a channel called *‘Why So Offended’*. He subtly pushes a narrative portraying RSP/Rabi/Balen negatively, often labeling them as populist. You will hardly find him criticizing Gagan Thapa. He is there to set narratives.  Most of the people seen in the photo are from Gagan’s core group, who are very active on Twitter and regularly share pro-Gagan and anti-RSP posts, one of them being Raghav in the brown jacket.  You can support any leader you like, but you can’t pretend to be neutral while subtly pushing your own agenda and narratives.  ーーーー  Lol, honestly I didn’t even know he had uploaded something yesterday, but my post had perfect timing and it blew up. Even Bibek Thapaliya was hiding his affiliations, and KMAG still hides theirs. This guy just picked up that post and used it to make himself look good again.  I know how biased he is or maybe he doesn’t even realize how he got used. This is how Gagan operates. He invites these influencers, keeps them close, so they don’t post or make content against him. By doing these meetings, he slowly creates a soft corner in their mind and heart. So later, when Gagan messes up, they hesitate to criticize him because they’ve met him personally and think, “He’s a good guy.”  This is also how Gagan has managed to influence journalists across different media houses. Not all of them are in his inner circle, but he subtly shapes how they think. He invites them, talks to them, and slowly pushes the narratives he wants—who’s bad, what’s bad, and how to counter certain people.  The social media ban happened when Congress was in government, right? He won’t openly say, “Support me” or “Make things favor me,” but indirectly he keeps planting ideas like, I’m the only one who can fix this, and stuff like that.  This is a very familiar pattern with Gagan Thapa. First, influencers like these create noise online, and once it starts getting attention, he jumps in and talks about the issue as if he really cares. If he genuinely cared about social media, he could’ve spoken up against the social media ban when Congress was in power.  Even during the Gen Z protest, he subtly planted leaders like Tanuja and Rakshya Bam through his media outlet, Setopati. Their interviews were pushed again and again, filling the feed with news about what Rakshya and Tanuja were saying. Slowly, that turned into posts supporting Gagan Thapa. In the end, neutral and unaware people start feeling like, oh, Gagan is the hero we were looking for, just because these figures they follow are also backing him.  Ask him if he made any contents on Gagan Thapa?  \\- Did he made video when Congress tried to sneak in a loophole in the cooling period? What happened to Khatiwada then after?  \\- Did he made how gagan thapa surviving without doing a single job?  \\- When Congress/UML tried to pass 5 years corruption expiry bill.  \\- Even to debunk PACT corruption where Gagan Thapa was alleged, even to debunk the allegation. (he wont, cz truth or not, many will know about this case and will have -ve perception of Gagan)  \\- Why is he surrounded and hangs out with Goons?  \\- Why WikiLeaks has Gagan Thapa as key embassy contact?  No, he won’t do that, because he’ll always have a soft corner for Gagan Thapa. That’s how Gagan Thapa works he spreads narratives through influencers like him, who knowingly or unknowingly end up producing such content.  Another example is Gagan doing small meetings on “populism” and then letting influencers create content around that topic to “spread awareness.” For influencers, it looks like he’s thinking about the nation. But from Gagan’s point of view, he knows those influencers will create content that ends up being subtly targeted at new faces.",

I thought he had a very balanced views and used to follow his contents.|||This video is being pushed with a really misleading narrative.   Binayak Kuikel wasn’t part of any “core” or secret meeting of Gagan Thapa.  This happened when the Social Media Bill was being discussed. Influencers and digital stakeholders were openly invited to share their views. It was a public consultation, not some behind-the-scenes planning session. Some of those inputs were later reflected in changes to the bill, which is exactly how participatory policymaking is supposed to work.  Calling this “propaganda coordination” by cutting out all context is misleading. Criticize policies, question leaders, that’s fair. But pushing edited clips with false framing only lowers the quality of political discussion.  Before reacting to viral videos, shouldn’t we first ask what the full context is and who actually benefits when it’s removed?|||Tei vayera raixa ajkaal anti balen kura garne    tallu le chance payo aba garxa  Gagan ra unka supporters ni rsp kei kura copy garne pheri rsp lai nai populist vanne?

It wasn’t a secret or “core” meeting. It was an open discussion during the Social Media Bill talks, where influencers and stakeholders were invited to share their views.  Turning that into a propaganda story just to fit a narrative is misleading. Pages like Nepal of Routine Banda often do the same with Balen Shah—presenting him as a lone Robin Hood fighting the system, where everything else is shown as conspiracy or sabotage.  Real governance isn’t that simple. Cities aren’t run by heroes alone, and democracy doesn’t work when context is removed for clicks. If Balen is the leader people are looking for, his work should be judged with facts and honesty, not viral clips and emotional framing.  Before reacting, shouldn’t we slow down and ask what actually happened and why this narrative is being pushed?|||Spread the word, gang.

When someone says \"I am proud to be Nepali.\" You say there is nothing that the person did.   You don't say the same thing when someone says \"I am proud of my dad.\"   It is just positive gesture toward something they are attached to.  It is okay to be attached to your tribe and group.. But just as long as you are not putting other people down.|||Your caste and ethnicity influences the thinking|||That also applies for nationalism, and i haven't seen a single person who is proud of being a bahaun/chettri/rai/magar|||All of them have rampant hate against each other. But somehow bahun are the only victim of hate according to the subs here:⁠-⁠):⁠-⁠):⁠-⁠)|||This is a difference that Bahun, Chhetri people do not understand.  There is a huge difference between people saying \"I am proud to be a Brahmin\" vs. \"I am proud to be a Newar\", for example.  Brahmin represents a 3000 year old history of supremacy over others based on birth. It represents what it means to be supposedly superior based on caste, purity, lineage. It represents the root evil of our society that treats your own fellow human beings as untouchable. A society with a Brahmin will automatically have a Shudra too. That is what the 4 Hindu varnavyastha is. What Nepali Bahuns also don't realize is Brahmin, Chhetri - these varna identities are there everywhere in Indian societis too - from Kashmir down to Kerala - every Indian state, community, region has their own Brahmin and Chhetri. So calling yourself a proud Brahmin gives you absolutely no unique identity except your association as a self-superior caste.  Whereas calling yourself a Newar is not based on caste, but a linguistic identity. The notion of caste (and hence superiority-inferiority, pure-impure, higher-lower) automatically disappears when you identify based on the language you speak. You must be aware within Newars there are Hindu Brahmins (Rajopadhyayas), Kshatriyas (Malla, Pradhan, Rajbhandari, etc.) down to a whole range of Vaishyas and Shudras. But when these diverse caste groups identify singularly based on the language they speak (Nepalbhasha/Newar), the identity becomes secular. Your identity based on varna/caste slowly starts to fade off. This is exactly what happened among Newars as most non-Newars will be shocked to find out Brahmins, Kshatriyas even exist among Newars. This is exactly what Indian societies do too. For a majority of Indian people (especially young, educated, urban), their linguistic identity trumps caste identity, hence they identify as Kashmiri, Haryanvi, Bihari, Bengali, Tamilian, Maharastrian, Gujarati, etc. which are all their linguistic identity.  Of course identifying through language does not solve the root of the evil. That is always there. But at least it will be a step in the right direction.|||Magar, Brahmin haru ta tha vayena but yo rai , limbu, Kirat in general have become so full of themselves, they want a KIRAT PRADESSSH Arey.

Many kings tied themselves to religion and caste systems, which also helped them control and organize people. When society is divided into groups, it becomes harder for people to unite, which benefits those in power. So I wonder was religion only about belief, or was it also shaped to maintain authority and hierarchy? If you agree that religion has been used as a tool for control in history, raise your hand.

The feeling of my heart having faster and my stomach twisting like an eel holding it's prey is not new to me but still it's not wholly mine.   The feeling of lying in the bed with inherent thoughts of disperse happiness and the want to be able to understand if that happiness is as true as it seems is not new and it's also not wholly mine   I look at all these motion picture hoping to find something. And what that might be is as ananomus to me as it is to you. I look at these things, listen as they talk, but the existence of this feeling of watching doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm lying on this virgin earth, unmolested and untouched, devoid of any feeling of any sort except for one; consciousness. The consciousness reigns supreme within and without all within the vicinity of my existence.  At this point, life as you call it feels not a moments passing by or time flowing like my thoughts.  My head feels particularly heavy, as if I'm thinking but a thought is yet to process. But how can this be? Without a thought, how can you think? How can one live, without knowing the value of death? But that's not right either. For one to know the value of death,.one must first know of its qualities, it's feature in all it's dimensions. The inherent idea of a thought being, and to think not sounds stupid as if not funny enough. But you can't overlook the idea behind such ponder.   I take very long breaths as I think. My heart beats loud enough for me to hear it. And all my bodily functions seems very much obvious to me. This isn't new but it's not wholly mine.   Ahh now my head hurts a little to. But this shall too pass.   Theres this lingering feeling of solitude that I feel very sensationally. For solitude has been my friend far longer then any. The silence that made me feel alone after some years felt not pleasing but good enough to make me feel a bit stingy if it got disturbed.  But now this solitude engulfs me, strangles me so that I choke these thoughts out of me which are yet to be. But it was this very solitude that made me form a thought but now it want it back. Like how death waits right Infront of you, lingers above you with it's hands around neck, and then takes you through the stairs of lifelessness while you climb oblivious. Similar is the solitude that I experience right now, but instead of lifelessness, I climb and climb but towards nothing, I climb and climb but climb on empty thoughts.   My agitated muscles ache in the silence of my breath while my breath gets shorter and heavier each micro instant.",

Ofc sapna bokechau hola voliparsi kehi garni and u gotta work hard. But dont push yourself too hard , enjoy your life a little . Your life wont end due to a damn exam there is much more to do in life. Aba parents haru ta karai rahanchan . What even can we do lol? Ani btw you are pretty damn good in maths . You will improve in other subjects too . Dont stress out|||I am in 12 now. 11 ko first term was best for me all 60 above (except that damn physics) chem ma ta 64 aathyo but i didn't think that much and tried to do good in physics.   2nd term ma physics ma 49 aayo but chemistry ma 45 that drop of 19 marks made my mental health go blind. I gave up on chemistry and physics, I didn't even want to study these two anymore tara after 3rd term 11 final 12 pre term, finally 12 ko 1st term ma physics and chem ma 52 and 53 aathyo respectively. I was satisfied enough. Ani 2nd term ma ahile physics dhostai xa, chem chain tight teacher parexa k huni ho thaxaina.   So to explain what happened here: 1. Course ko amount badhepaxi the marks drastically drop as you and I both faced.  2. The amount of stuff you have to remember is always more than you remember.  3. For mcq and reasoning questions you must read books cuz teachers don't cover everything.  At last, 11 doesn't matter that much as marks and grades, 11 class is just about the memories you build that 12 might not give you.  You look like a study kinda guy so you might have friends like that too, so i am telling you the reality here. The friends you have might not have that chill attitude later in 12th so enjoy the memories you are building cuz in 12 everyone around you will suddenly start focusing on studying and you might fall behind so 12 ma jani bittikai start learning concepts especially physics ko.   Tips for you in 11  1. Grab any opportunity you have become CR club member Host of program sing or whatever you are good at cuz you will be remembered by that more. Also being a CR or club member will benefit your bidesh ko lagi.  2. Try understanding concepts of everything. Science is all about logic if you don't understand the logic behind it you can't understand the science behind it.  3. Feel free to ask to teachers, they are not your enemies. Friends might suppress your curiosity but it doesn't mean teachers won't listen to you. Concepts bujhdainau bhane teachers lai gayera sodha If you are shy to ask them in public. Go to the teachers in the staff room or meet them in the corridor, hallways and question them. Doing this, some of your friends might call you teacher ko chatne or something like that ignore them cuz you are the one who is gonna stand in that interview after 12th not them.  4. Chill.  Tips for 12 Doing 1 will help you be a face that everyone recognizes in 12. If you don't do 1 you might regret it in 12 so go for it.  Keep doing 2 and 3. After a few months into 12, you will realize that its all about what you understand. If you can understand the concept you will remember the formulae. Like physics ko nai kura garda, concept bujhexa bhane timle mathematically k garne yaad hunxa tespaxi dimaag ma or paper mai tyo derive garera formula lekhna sakxau.   This is all about the tips rant and motivation i have for you|||dm me",

My dad brought quite a few for me from KTM every few months, and I used to colour, solve crosswords etc. I event sent crossword solutions (never got published). This is where I knew about sudoku and still love sudoku to this day. I have read a lot of stories in this magazine and some of them  have been life changing for me. I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.  Few years later, through sheer luck (and a bit of reputation in my Nepali class), I got to be the guest editor of one edition of this magazine. Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र). I still absolutely vividly remember that letter, the paper, the handwriting, almost the content (almost 20 years later). The sender had found my information from the guest editor section. We had a few exchanges through postmail.  https://preview.redd.it/tfj91e7zb1dg1.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=129a8de5a073704752f011cebed54e0499c69c11|||Muna, Sunkesra, and kopila defined my childhood.

Yes, these sorts of Nepali people do exist, as the saying goes \"not all skin folks are kin folks\" but that doesn't mean they represent all nepali immigrants. There are definitely other factors which okay into this Bs. Also, colorism is a thing in nepali culture too, brother. That said, Plenty of Nepali immigrants, their kids, etc. are pissed as hell about it and are pushing back in what capacity they can.  Also, this is one of the worst times to go to the US as a brown person. I'm pretty worried about all my Nepali community members stateside right now.

They got voting rights, aba nepali buddhi lagayera america lai ni nepal kai bato ma jharna lageka chan. So enjoy the show |||Hmm generalizing blatantly. So typical.   I am in US, and I can say 98% of my friends don’t support his policies. There are a few who do but there’s always an exception.   Now many, including myself, do support some level of checks and restrictions on immigration. Those who didn’t get in take that as being opportunistic or slamming the door after I got in. Far from it.   What I don’t support is people coming through illegal means. What I don’t support is people cheating and providing 100% false representation while applying. Then once they get in, they try to game the system and just be a leech sucking in the benefits without contributing. They are making it harder for the legitimate immigrants and that’s exactly what we hate.  Now I don’t support the current position of not granting any immigration visa indefinitely to Nepal. But you know why this happened? Because almost 40% of Nepalis, about 70-80k take welfare benefits from the US government. You don’t need it if you are a contributing member of the society (except for in some disability/age related case).   There are people coming to US to get free medical treatment. One performer got the treatment and left the Us without paying the medical bills- that person is now banned from coming. Another famous pair got the DV and justified their entry by saying they get free medical for their kid (their case may be legit, but I am just giving an example of what people have been doing).   The administration is going to the other extreme to curb this- but some of it is because the past administration didn’t do anything to prevent it from happening.|||I seriously doubt the accuracy of this sentiment. Nepalis who have settled in America invariably work to bring other family members here. The effort is long and hard, and many are still in process, meaning that spouses, siblings, and others are now cut off from coming over. My brother in-law was able to finally secure his wife's visa a few weeks ago, after working on it for 2 years.  a few weeks later and she wouldn't get to come, so no, Nepali uncles and aunties aren't supportive, and there is no indication that most nepalis voted for trump.  The other thing to consider is the message behind the visa suspensions.  The trump administration is basically saying that immigrants who have come here have not improved conditions, but rather they have made it worse by taking advantage of government programs that they are not entitled to. In other words immigrants are lazy, and thieves. Not a lot to take pride in about that.|||Let me know what you are smoking..seems like good stuff.|||Just like the viral trend chori manchey ko khutta tanney chori manchey naai huncha.

I've worked with Nepali people for years at my job, they work remotely from Kathmandu. I got the chance to visit Nepal this year and loved your country. Everyone is so nice, the food is great and there are so many interesting and beautiful places.   I was a little nervous since it was only a few weeks after the Gen Z protest, but everything seemed pretty calm. I thought to myself, wow it'd sure be cool if we could overthrow our government, get rid of trump and be back to normal in a few weeks.   The Nepali living in the us would not feel happy or safe if they lived in my city I guarantee it. Legal or not they're grabbing anyone off the street that isn't white and taking them to a detention center. If they can prove their residency they get released, maybe. It is completely white supremacist Nazi shit. It's horrible and I'm ashamed to be an American. These are my friends and neighbors, I don't ask people what their immigration status is, I could care less.   It's usually portrayed that undocumented immigrants are a drain on government services, but that is a lie. They pay taxes since it's automatically deducted from the paycheck to a social security number that doesn't belong to them. If they try to use the services they're caught and deported  We're fighting back but our leaders are ineffective, the police are working with ICE and if we call in the military we're unsure of whose side they'll take.   Trust me you don't want to visit the US anytime soon|||I am also very happy.|||Same reason you and others who are aspiring to migrate toUS are sad. Immigration is not good for lot of citizens. Higher housing prices, rent, more competition for jobs. Companies benefit from supply of cheap labor while workers suffer from depressed wages. There’s no need to portray this as some kind of good vs evil thing. Those guys are looking out for their own interests just like you are. No country is required to keep its borders open to outsiders.

Why would anyone be happy about the current situation ? All of you who agree with the statement are in Nepal who couldn’t make it to the US.|||May I dare present a different perspective?   Not everyone who votes Republican is \"hiding the ladder since they've made it\". That claim is lazy, false, and ignores basic economic reality.  Some of us vote based on numbers, not slogans. When you are paying over $100,000 a year in taxes (household)—income tax, state tax, property tax, sales tax—and you don’t see proportional benefits in return, fiscal policy starts to matter a lot. At that level, voting conservative isn’t ideological—it’s rational. Lower taxes, limited government, and accountability in spending simply align better with that reality.  Paying six figures into the system and being told you’re “privileged,” “selfish,” or morally inferior for questioning where that money goes is not persuasive—it’s alienating. Wanting to keep more of what you earn does not make you hateful. It makes you financially literate.  Many Republican voters reject racism and extremism outright. What they do reject is runaway taxation, bloated government, and being constantly generalized or morally lectured by people whose policies they fundamentally can’t relate to. The same way not all Democrats are extremists, not all Republicans are villains.  And yes—we are also tired of being lumped together with fringe elements just because we don’t align with extreme progressive ideology. Disagreeing with activist politics, identity absolutism, or ideological purity tests does not make someone anti-human. It means they prioritize practicality over performative outrage.  People vote based on lived experience. For households paying $100k+ in taxes every year, conservative policies often make more sense. That’s not hate. That’s math.",

I have been seeing many Gagan-glazing posts recently, so I have a few questions for him.  - When will you speak about the Nepali and foreign currency that was found burnt in your former president’s house? Were those AI-generated, as your party president and many party leaders were claiming?  - You have raised the Sahakari Kanda involving Rabi Lamichhane, but when will you raise the same question about your own party member, Maya Rai, who was also a member of the same sahakari in Kathmandu (I’ve forgotten the name)? What about the Dhanraj Gurung sahakari case?  - You were part of the Government Efficiency team when the recent UML–Congress coalition government was formed. Will you question or take responsibility for the recent GenZ killings? Your party member Ramesh Lekhak was also the Home Minister at that time—have you questioned him about this?  - You have been a Member of Parliament four times, and during your tenure, the Congress has formed the government multiple times. Can you point to any concrete, policy-level achievements you delivered during your party’s time in government?  - What about Aftab Alam case during your party's government was he rightfully being prosecuted or your party's government have him impunity from jail, what about that case?",

Deuba, as an individual, may once have been a true leader—but over time, the gang culture around him is what turned everything rotten and made him look bhrasta.  From this point onward, Gagan is free.  Free from:  All blame linked to Arzu  All accusations about money in Deuba’s house  All baggage related to Bhutani saranarthi  All the kandas, Teramox, and backroom deals  All blame connected to Lekhaks and their networks  These were never Gagan’s sins to carry.  So why should he keep answering for other people’s cults? Why should a reformist voice be held hostage by the corruption, compromises, and power games of an old guard that refuses to let go?  If anyone needs to answer, it’s the system that protected those networks for decades—not the one who finally challenged them.  Gagan doesn’t need to answer anymore. The Mahadibesan already did.|||He can give you wai wai, not sure about answers.

Don't get me wrong there are shortcomings from him and nobody is perfect but most of the questions you raised here are poor attempt to make him look bad.  You have to realize that even though Gagan is a prominient member of Nepali Congress, he was never the executive. Every decision the party makes as a whole, the chairman (Deuba) has the supreme authority and he is little to no say in any of the decisions.  Even then, he has clearly spoken against all wrongdoings. And you say \"just speak\". But that's the problem of not being in executive power, he can only speak.  You trying to  make the money burnt in Deuba's house somehow a crime by Gagan Thapa clearly tells me that you are just trying to hate. Otherwise as everyone else has said, there is a special probe commission formed to specifically study the burnt money case and all we can do is wait for their report and the government will file the case if there is wrongdoing (which we all believe there is). And Gagan has clearly affirmed this, as any sane person would. You should read him and listen his many public interviews/videos and not just assume he didn't say anything.  He has clearly said multiple times that any and all involved in sahakari kanda should be investigated including naming people from his own party by name, again multiple times in multiple of his public appearences and writings, you should read/watch/listen those. The government should file cases. I don't understand how this would be his fault.  If you again watch his comments in good faith and listen to his parliament speeches, he as said multiple times that  the public is angry, they need delivery. He said he opposed the coalition and publicly opposed it multiple times. But he is not the executive, deuba is. When there is coaliation, he has the moral responsibility to make the government successful. He was indeed in the efficiency team and he said he tried is best to make the government successful because he knew people needed delivery even though he opposed the coalition. He publicly told long before the Gen-Z protest that he couldn't get the government to do what the efficiency team was supposed to do, and he left it. So I don't think that makes him culpable for the massacre during gen-z protest.  But still he has taken moral responsibility for what happened during the protest. He has apologized multiple times for any moral culpability he has. He said he immediately asked the party leadership to break coaliation in the first day of protest and asked Lekhak to resign. Lekhak did resign but the party didn't leave coalition because again Deuba is executive and makes the decision.  He has been parliament member four times. The first time and he failed to deliver the constitution as promised which he was elected for. The second tenure was again the CA election, which delivered the constitution and you can't deny he played crucial role in making the constitution, and he (among all others) delivered the constitution. The next term he went to the parliament again and became health minister and people say he delivered some reforms in health sector (again refer to public catalogues of his works during this tenure). And you have to grant that he has been constant voice in the parliament on various issues, which the MP is sent for. This last time was a short tenure, but as everyone he has played crucial role in voicing concerns in the parliament. Ironically he strongly demanded there be independent probe in sahakari case and there have been multiple arrests and cases filed against some major fraudsters. You should grant that this was successfull. But we can always demand more. I am not his prabakta but to me seems like he could have definitely done more here and I am sure he agrees.  Yeah what about the case? Alam was a proven convict. But congress did dirty by lobbying to release him. I haven't seen him support Alam's release. Again, I am not sure the details of his release but how is Gagan culpable for the crime Alam committed?  Again I am not his prabakta. I try to speak with reason. You could certainly question that he didn't do enough at policy level as MP to propose new laws and pass them. You could ask him that he could not do enough to break Deuba stronghold. But he precisely did that recently.  Now I am watching him closely, he is now in the position to deliver at least from his party level. Make him accountable ask him tough questions. But the aforementioned questions seemed more like an attempt to make him bad (except may be how many policy changed did he make in 1 1/2 tenure as MP except CA MP which they delivered constitution).

At home, my bags were 23 + 22 kg, and my carry-on was 20 kg.  At the check-in counter, the agent told me to move some items from my carry-on into one checked bag so I’d only have to pay excess for one bag. I did exactly that and reduced my carry-on to 12 kg.  Magically, after this:  •\tChecked bags became 32 kg and 25 kg    •\tCarry-on became 13 kg  Somehow, between weighing the bags at home, weighing them again at the counter, and then re-weighing them a third time, my bags gained weight out of nowhere.  I was exhausted and didn’t have the energy to argue, so they charged me for two excess bags — $80 each. No leeway, no consideration.  To make things worse, the agent openly suggested that if I paid cash and didn’t need a receipt, they could lower the price. At that point it was obvious they were trying to pocket the money. Absolutely shameless.  I paid by card, waited until they gave me a proper Turkish Airlines receipt, and made sure everything was legit.  If you’re flying Turkish Airlines out of Tribhuvan International Airport, I strongly suggest avoiding the chubby girl working at the Turkish Airlines check-in counter.

Happened to me in airport outside nepal as well.  The main difference is that airport scales are \"trade-legal\" industrial devices required by law to be regularly calibrated for high precision, whereas home scales are consumer-grade gadgets that use cheaper sensors and are almost never recalibrated. Additionally, the environment distorts the numbers; weighing a bag on a soft home carpet or trying to balance a large suitcase on a small bathroom scale often creates a \"lighter\" reading than reality, unlike the airport's large, stable platforms embedded in hard concrete. Because of this, the airport scale is generally accurate, while your home scale is just an estimate that tends to drift.|||[removed]|||Are we allowed to video record our interactions there?

Seriously the TIA is a joke and just the state of the airport itself is shameful + the employees and their behaviour are just the cherry on top.|||So I was flying in Business Class to Dubai.

You said he goes for night outs as well, it's pretty obvious he cheats and when you are late, he automatically assumes you did the same.

And you have also said ma pani farkauthe ani maan santa parera basthe, if you make him deport or complain about it , it would be hypocrisy.  Either separate with him just never look his face back again or go to a couple therapist.  He have anger issues and he is patriarchal you both guys need therapy and a proper communication.

The next steps depend on what you want the outcome to be.   1. If you want mediation and your relationship to continue, have a serious discussion with your husband and let him know what the stakes are, either to work on the relationship together, or to end it. Couples therapy is also helpful for many. There's no point fighting forever. Has anyone else witness the violence, do you have kids? Does your husband drink? Does he have his own social life? Does he have any mental health issues? Many things factor. But a discussion with your husband should be your first thing to do and let him know boundaries and also reflect on yourself too.   2. If you want to end it, depends on where you are. Think through everything and then only decide. If you have kids or not. You need to contact a lawyer as well. What is your financial situation. Do you have any social support nearby as things can get stressful and messy.|||You work so it seems you're independent. Report him to the police.

Having someone my close family member go through similar situation before, never believe that abusers will change, kukurko puchhar 12 barsa dhungro ma rakhne ukhan estai manxe lai banaeko ho. Assuming you are in 20s/30s, do you want to spend next 40 or so years of your life with such abuse?    Many people will try to convince you to stay and tell you that he will change but ask to yourself do you truly believe that?  Also you mentioned that “maile pani farkauthe”, if he hits you don’t hit back but report it to police (unless it is life threatening) and also talk to your parents/relatives/friends about it don’t bottle up till too late.  I know sometimes it is difficult to let go because of many reasons (eg. visa issues or money issues) but what if in the heat of the moment he hits you and you get a lifetime disability or even die; so for your own safety, i suggest to dump his ass.|||Leave before its too late|||Hi OP, garo huncha thulo decision lina divorce jastai.

Please find ways to get out from there..... Even if your parents don't support trust me and many others, this is not normal..... For the love of yourself, you should leave asap.|||I just realized you said tmle pani haat haltheu, hmmm.... If you both truly want to work it out.... Now I'm thinking about it after reading your comments that you really love him....   In that case, talk to him what is bothering him, if he has had lot of childhood trauma, stress, unprocessed emotions, it really does affect a person, they become like time bomb and a small trigger can make them very angry ..... Now note that I'm saying this in hopes that you both truly want to work it out..... Talk to him, let him know anger at this level is not normal and he can gently start a talk therapy or men's circles, or somatic healing sessions, emdr therapy (if it's a part trauma), etc. there are so many options in today's time to start a healing journey. I'm in full support for people to move this route, even if you are violent in the past. It's not easy being human and I get it. Please consider, I hope this helps. But please remember, if you are going to lead this journey for both of you, remember to be patient, kind, and loving. Sometimes you will have to let the other person be so angry and be able to watch them (it's a specific emotional release session) without you absorbing their emotions. For him, and for you too probably, when emotions come, you both have to remember it's NEVER about the other person. If you would like each other to do something, you can request but nobody is obliged to follow, just having this much boundary will help you both to process your emotions on your own. Start therapy or just start writing on your own, you will notice you stress or anger is often coming from something else within yourself, not from people around you.   I hope this help a little bit. Take care, pass love to each other. If it's easier, bring serious talk when you are getting romantic, I think that helps you both absorb and understand better. Take care please. It's not impossible to change yourself and your relationships in this time, especially with so much options, start meditation, therapy, dance, especially moving body helps move your emotions too. Take care.|||Just have a conversation with your husband. Ask him why is he is acting like that? IS he insecure about you or what? make everything clear. Why is he acting in that manner? Also, clearly state what you feel about his behaviour. You both will get a chance to understand each other. Make sure he is not going to do it again or what you think will be better. If it get repeated what action will be taken? Let him know. Its either reporting to police or having converstaion with both of your parents or divorce.|||Leave him ask for divorce report to police dont stay|||This is what an emotional vampire is.

I know why he is liked by so many given how dysfunctional your political system as been lately, but Balen's performance during his stint wasn't that great either. Sadly, no culture of constructive criticism in Nepal.|||I am satisfied with his work because I know it’s not easy. The system itself is messed up, so obviously one person alone can’t fix everything on their own. There will be tons of hurdles, especially in the capital city of the country. Not just the capital, honestly, you can even say Kathmandu as Nepal itself, because it has become the center for everything. No matter what work you have, you somehow have to come to Kathmandu for it. So yeah, I understand his situation.  The one thing I really criticize him for is his lack of communication. That is something I am very disappointed about. During his entire campaign, he kept saying that he wouldn’t be like previous mayors and that he would stay in constant communication with the public. But after winning, he almost completely stopped connecting with people. There is no proper accountability, just one-sided Facebook status updates. This is the part where I am extremely disappointed in him and openly criticize him.  Other than that, I think he has actually shown that work can be done. He has also given inspiration to young people to enter politics.|||Done In some ways  . Even non Exciting programs .Some Jhara tareko type. Some Unfeasible .. some better options appear and done.

When it comes to his family, his wife or his daughter, he is always ready to betray anyone even the country. We all know well that it can be used as a weapon by westerns to control him and the country that we Nepalese are about to give in his hand.   Being a voter of KMC i can see a lot of changes in the city after Balen came as a mayor but when i saw same changes in every big cities of Nepal. It didn’t took me long to understand that he was just overhyped.   After he joined RSP where each members are opportunistic and work in Nepal for western interests it’s clear that he is not good candidate for prime minister.  He was voted to serve as a mayor, He could have waited until next election but for him misusing people’s trust and make them go against government by burning the Nation was easiest way to experience power. He is dancing with a boot in the blood of 75 Genz martyrs.|||Constructive criticism bhandai bhukney kukur haru paile Balen lai timiharuko “constructive criticism” pauna layak mukam ma ta pugna deu.|||I am writing manifesto for RSP can you guz help by filling this up  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdxYPf7US9mge_Wgrl5DltlhI609lqz41tiiIi89O8dGPSMgA/viewform",

The content is rarely original. It is compiled from existing news articles that anyone could find doing Google. It’s a summary service, not investigative journalism.  2. As it relies on secondary sources, it never goes deep. It stays on the surface of issues, prioritizing smooth editing over raw facts.  3. The channel’s main narrative is simple: 'The country is doomed.' This is a lazy narrative. Telling us that politicians are bad or the system is broken is stating the obvious. It validates anger but offers no insight.  If you want to be entertained, it works. But if you want to be informed, this is a waste of time.",

(Should I personally ask them to deduct 5% TDS?)  I also receive USD payments from an EU-based company. In that case, tax is deducted twice: first by the platform itself (approximately 3.5%), and then another 5% TDS is deducted here. When the funds arrive, my bank automatically converts the USD to NPR based on the prevailing exchange rate and credits it to my account in Npr.  I opened a USD account (dollar card) using my PAN. The annual limit is USD 500, but as far as I understand, this limit is only for payments/spending. Is it possible to increase this limit or ask the bank to keep incoming USD directly in that USD account instead of converting it to NPR?  Another question is that, if i’am to receive payments from a subscription based service from a platform apps i made, i basically can’t from nepal, for that i either need the LLC or C-Corp registered in US banks that accepts remote workers no ?  Up to how much extent can nepal banks provide services to be able to pay and receive payments internationally ? Or which banks ? That can win over the limitation of dollar cards ?

Cant see both.|||if its real whatdo you do  ??? can you give some info or context|||I can see the angle of “look what you can get even from Nepal,” and yeah, that part can actually be motivating because a lot of people still assume they need to leave the country to reach certain compensation levels. But motivation usually comes from showing the path, not just the end result. A screenshot shows where you landed, not how you got there.  People here asked genuine questions about niche, stack, timeline, experience, etc because that’s the part that actually helps others move in that direction. That’s where the value would have been. Without that context, the post ends up reading more like a soft flex than mentorship. Nothing wrong with flexing, just don’t call it motivation if you’re not giving people anything they can learn from or replicate.  With 5+ years of experience you’ve seen enough of the field to know that the “how” matters more than the “what,” especially for people in Nepal who are trying to break into the global market.

First, you’re told to learn:   HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, Python, C, C++, SQL, React, Angular, Vue, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL.      Then comes the mandatory grind:   DSA, LeetCode, CodeChef, Codeforces, System Design, OOPs, OS, DBMS, Computer Networks.      Then tools & cloud pressure:   Git, GitHub, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, GCP, CI/CD, Jenkins, Terraform.      Then frameworks & buzzwords:   Next.js, Spring Boot, Django, Microservices, REST API, GraphQL, WebSockets.      And now the new wave:   AI, ML, Deep Learning, GenAI, ChatGPT, LLMs, Prompt Engineering, LangChain, Vector Databases.      After all this…   You might get a job.

            "comments": "This narrative of \"Software Engineering is done\" isn't new. This happens every time a revolutionary milestone in the technology space is achieved. Sure, it is not realistic to overlook the economy or the job scarcity that is so prevalant now, maybe for the longest time yet but it doesn't adjucate to the premise of Software Engineering isn't feasible as a career anymore, at least to the degree people are making it out to be. AI-driven development may very well be a 'bubble', and when it pops and the dust settles, the next big thing will provoke a similar reaction. While it is evident that people with years of experience are at a loss right now, and even more so for students trying to make it in tech, undergrads or young aspirants.  I believe it was never about how greatly any technology overshadows the current technology even if it transforms areas of it by overwhelming amounts but the ability to use it to your advantage. That is how you thrive here. You embrace, and not reject. AI cannot replace engineering but it does accelerate aspects of it that if you don't keep up, you get left behind. I mean, with AI-driven development so rampant right now, startups are at an all time high. People adapt and make it work. That mindset is obligatory now more than ever. Well, I could be speaking regardless of facts that I have yet to know, but I stand firmly on my grounds of not rejecting engineering as it has never been easier than now.|||I have 4 YOE. I don't expect to have a job in 2-3 years. I am not a people person. I don't know what else I can do besides this. Life is going to get really very difficult moving forward.|||i am in my second year studying ai and data science. I don't know what career path i should choose|||I too have been overwhelmed by the amount of people following this IT trend blindly.  I don't know where I'll end up.|||I'm not sure why people are surprised. An industry can only take so many people before saturation, especially in face of disruption / paradigm shift as is the case now. As with any other field, you have to dedicate time and effort to be good and stay good. If you are a computer engineer worth your salt, you know it's a lot more about structured and critical thinking, problem solving skills and architecting solutions than coding in the field, and if you have the basics right, tech stack changing shouldn't scare you as much.  As with any other field, only the most committed, knowledgeable and competent people will remain in the industry and that should always be the case. The gold rush is over.|||Difficult times? Yes.  First time? No.   I really want to see what time has. Best wishes.  Best will have the best.|||Not only in Nepal.

Tara the best way to develop skills nowadays is that you could be creating projects written on someone's research papers.

You will be adding more skills as you go, as your project requires it.   Yes its a challenging job but so are other jobs. If you enjoy learning/working in this field then its good for you else people can and should look for other carrier option. Do what feels natural to you.   Regarding AI, its here to stay wear we like it ir not. We don't need to me AI/ML experts we just have to learn how to use it, or embrace it, and not reject it. Its on the hype but it will die down and come back to its default.|||Jack of all with understanding of Ai tools and how to implement wins. Be the jack of all. Don’t try to master one thing. That’s what I suggest.   Decent apps can be build in a day if you know the requirements, understand system design and  logic needed. You need to understand things like how apps are build, deployed etc.  At least in US, Ai replacing engineerings is not exactly false.   With Automated workflows and Ai agents, team needing 100 members could only need couple members. That does mean Ai replaced 98 people among 100. That’s how I see.",

            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

If I have the time, I might join if I'm free. If they were inviting Harvard professors, it'd cost you 10x more to attend. Events take time and effort. Many costs. Let's switch the focus to you. Have you organized an event? Was it easy? Who did you invite as a speaker?   If you're a student, why care about an enterprise AI event? I fail to see your criticisms. Not everybody needs to start a business to prove their credibility. It literally takes <20k.  I don't expect them to cover hf peft best practices. It's an event for enterprises. I don't have expectations for food. If I meet somebody interesting, that's good enough for me.  I think you're being confused between training courses and networking events. Plenty of events if you want to learn. ANAIS, NAAMII charged 12k for students this year. Was fine. Good stuff. Made many friends.  I dislike AI non-profits that claim to do research and fail to have any publications or research projects, yet say they're open to collaborations. But the AI association isn't a research body, probably does just events. Executives don't open up VS code and grind all day. That's a very small minority. They're skilled, just not in a way that appeals to you. They bring in investors, organize events, lots of things. If you ask me, there's a lot more to a product than PRs and merges. If you're not already the Lead for some MNC, some humility helps. It's dumb to say a CEO doesn't have skills because they don't code like you do, don't you think?  I'm not affiliated with naamii or any non-profits.|||On one hand, I can see the low effort poster with multiple mistakes and the fluffy pointless nonsense that is the main paragraph probably written by ChatGPT with a 6 word prompt. There's no mention of the \"Experts\" that are supposed to lead the thing.  On the other hand, your post has offered no genuine criticism of the event. It is just as pointless as the poster. Maybe offer anecdotes? Some tangible verifiable reason to justify your \"nrs 350 for 2.5 hours is a massive waste\".  Organizing an event comes with some cost, and some of that must be passed to the visitor. NRS 350 is some money, it is definitely not a lot of money. It is most definitely not \"expensive\" for an event in any sense of the word.   Justify your claims. Why is this a \"scam\"? What other way can a person \"use nrs 350 to learn by yourself\" (your words)? Who are the speakers and why are they unqualified to speak on this program?  *disclaimer: not affilaited to this org or event*, *just a random angry redditor*",

After +2, I applied to Canada and the USA for further studies, but my visa got rejected. Instead of wasting a year, I joined BBS , and now I’m in my 3rd year.  When the visa didn’t work out, I decided to take responsibility for my own future. I started learning about AI, automation, and new technologies. Over time, I picked up practical skills, experimented a lot, and eventually started freelancing. Right now, I work as an AI Developer on Upwork, and even in the early stage, I’m earning more than 1 lakh NPR per month.  I’m not an expert and I still have a lot to learn but I know my strengths. I’m good at managing things, people, sales, content, and marketing, and I can execute fast. I have learned most of this by consuming real-world information online and applying it through actual work.  I have big plans in the AI space, but I also know that building something great alone is very difficult. That’s why I am looking for a technical co-founder, someone strong on the engineering side so we can build, learn, and grow together.  The idea is to:  * Start very small and lean * No heavy investment * Focus on AI services / automation / agency-style work * Only basic costs like hosting or APIs * Aim to generate revenue within 2–3 months  I currently live with my parents in Butwal, but I want to move to Kathmandu, take a small flat, and fully focus on building. I also plan to start creating content alongside the business.  I’m looking for someone who:  * Is disciplined and focused * Serious about long-term growth * Not into unhealthy habits * Wants a simple lifestyle with deep work * Has strong technical skills or is deeply committed to developing them  Most importantly, I want a co-founder who understands that things won’t always work. There will be hard times, failures, and uncertainty. During those phases, we should push and motivate each other, stay consistent, and keep moving forward. Even if something fails, we should come out smarter, stronger, and more experienced than before.  We don’t need much money to start just enough for basic living expenses. I have savings that allow me to manage accommodation and food for a long time, and I strongly believe we can make this sustainable within a few months.  The goal is simple:   Live together. Build together. Learn together. Grow together.  If you’re technically strong, disciplined, and serious about building a real AI business from Nepal, let’s connect.",

This has now gotten out of hand, and this type of behavior will surely spread to other tourist areas, especially those closer to the border like Sauraha and others. I have seen these 'tourists' in Thars and other SUVs riding recklessly on our highways, mocking our rules and laws. In my local area in the Terai, there have been a couple of incidents where such SUVs have hit locals, including traffic police, and fled to India.  Let's continue to do what we can from our end - I have reported the videos and his channel, and let's keep reporting those videos wherever we find them, and from any other Indian 'YouTubers'. Influencers from Pokhara need to raise their voices collectively on other popular social media channels like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Local influencers need to unite and raise this issue from their platforms in their individual capacities. Otherwise, we might be just one incident away from breaking news.  I will share this thread with a popular Indian YouTube journalist-The Deshbhakt. I have been following him, and he has made videos on such stupidity by Indian tourists. I will leave his Instagram link here so that everyone with evidence can share information.

Even Bibek Thapaliya was hiding his affiliations, and KMAG still hides theirs. This guy just picked up that post and used it to make himself look good again.  I know how biased he is or maybe he doesn’t even realize how he got used. This is how Gagan operates. He invites these influencers, keeps them close, so they don’t post or make content against him. By doing these meetings, he slowly creates a soft corner in their mind and heart. So later, when Gagan messes up, they hesitate to criticize him because they’ve met him personally and think, “He’s a good guy.”  This is also how Gagan has managed to influence journalists across different media houses. Not all of them are in his inner circle, but he subtly shapes how they think. He invites them, talks to them, and slowly pushes the narratives he wants—who’s bad, what’s bad, and how to counter certain people.  The social media ban happened when Congress was in government, right? He won’t openly say, “Support me” or “Make things favor me,” but indirectly he keeps planting ideas like, I’m the only one who can fix this, and stuff like that.  This is a very familiar pattern with Gagan Thapa. First, influencers like these create noise online, and once it starts getting attention, he jumps in and talks about the issue as if he really cares. If he genuinely cared about social media, he could’ve spoken up against the social media ban when Congress was in power.  Even during the Gen Z protest, he subtly planted leaders like Tanuja and Rakshya Bam through his media outlet, Setopati. Their interviews were pushed again and again, filling the feed with news about what Rakshya and Tanuja were saying. Slowly, that turned into posts supporting Gagan Thapa. In the end, neutral and unaware people start feeling like, oh, Gagan is the hero we were looking for, just because these figures they follow are also backing him.  Ask him if he made any contents on Gagan Thapa?  \\-  Did he made video when Congress tried to sneak in a loophole in the cooling period? What happened to Khatiwada then after?  \\- Did he made how gagan thapa surviving without doing a single job?  \\- When Congress/UML tried to pass 5 years corruption expiry bill.  \\- Even to debunk PACT corruption where Gagan Thapa was alleged, even to debunk the allegation. (he wont, cz truth or not, many will know about this case and will have -ve perception of Gagan)  \\- Why is he surrounded and hangs out with Goons?  \\- Why WikiLeaks has Gagan Thapa as key embassy contact?  No, he won’t do that, because he’ll always have a soft corner for Gagan Thapa. That’s how Gagan Thapa works he spreads narratives through influencers like him, who knowingly or unknowingly end up producing such content.  Another example is Gagan doing small meetings on “populism” and then letting influencers create content around that topic to “spread awareness.” For influencers, it looks like he’s thinking about the nation. But from Gagan’s point of view, he knows those influencers will create content that ends up being subtly targeted at new faces.  https://preview.redd.it/x4nqjclj1veg1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=5303b0b09e8b772195bbc2a80116bd3b9f25bdb5|||RONB le tetro Balen ko chusekai chusai cha ta 3 4 barsa bata yo vanda badi jholagiri ta kai dekhechaina kunai media le koi lai gareko.

Without intervention, boys with DMD lose the ability to walk by their early teens, and many don’t survive past their 20s.  But, there is a ray of hope: A one-time **Gene Therapy (Elevidys)** that can stop this progression. But the cost is a staggering **$2.9 Million USD**.  I am posting from a business Reddit ID to maintain total transparency and accountability.  Yes, we know $2.9M sounds impossible, but we are fighting for every cent.  * Total Goal: **$2.9 Million USD** * Cost in Nepalese Rupees: **Approx. रु 41,92,00,000 (41.92 Crore NPR)** * Raised so far: **$85909** * Remaining: **$2814091**  Liam is nearly 4. This therapy is most effective the earlier it is given. We are racing against time and biological markers that could disqualify him if we wait too long.

DMD is heartbreaking, and I genuinely hope he gets the care he needs 🙏  Just sharing information for awareness (not to diminish the importance of Elevidys): there are FDA-approved medications available for DMD today that can slow progression and improve outcomes, depending on the child’s mutation and age. These include corticosteroids (like deflazacort or vamorolone), exon-skipping therapies (for specific mutations), and non-steroidal options like givinostat, in addition to gene therapy.  Of course, treatment choice depends on genetic testing, eligibility criteria, and specialist guidance, and early intervention is critical, which I understand is why Elevidys is being pursued.  Posting this only so families reading this thread know there are multiple therapeutic pathways worth discussing with a neuromuscular specialist. Wishing Liam strength, access, and support and hoping this campaign reaches the right hands. 🤍|||.|||I am sorry, baby. He is so cute. Ma yei ausadi banaune thau ma kaam garchu.

            "heading": "Binayak Kuikel in core meeting of Gagan Thapa",
            "body": "As you can see, the person highlighted in the red circle is Binayak Kuikel, a YouTuber who runs a channel called *‘Why So Offended’*. He subtly pushes a narrative portraying RSP/Rabi/Balen negatively, often labeling them as populist. You will hardly find him criticizing Gagan Thapa. He is there to set narratives.  Most of the people seen in the photo are from Gagan’s core group, who are very active on Twitter and regularly share pro-Gagan and anti-RSP posts, one of them being Raghav in the brown jacket.  You can support any leader you like, but you can’t pretend to be neutral while subtly pushing your own agenda and narratives.  ーーーー  Lol, honestly I didn’t even know he had uploaded something yesterday, but my post had perfect timing and it blew up. Even Bibek Thapaliya was hiding his affiliations, and KMAG still hides theirs. This guy just picked up that post and used it to make himself look good again.  I know how biased he is or maybe he doesn’t even realize how he got used. This is how Gagan operates. He invites these influencers, keeps them close, so they don’t post or make content against him. By doing these meetings, he slowly creates a soft corner in their mind and heart. So later, when Gagan messes up, they hesitate to criticize him because they’ve met him personally and think, “He’s a good guy.”  This is also how Gagan has managed to influence journalists across different media houses. Not all of them are in his inner circle, but he subtly shapes how they think. He invites them, talks to them, and slowly pushes the narratives he wants—who’s bad, what’s bad, and how to counter certain people.  The social media ban happened when Congress was in government, right? He won’t openly say, “Support me” or “Make things favor me,” but indirectly he keeps planting ideas like, I’m the only one who can fix this, and stuff like that.  This is a very familiar pattern with Gagan Thapa. First, influencers like these create noise online, and once it starts getting attention, he jumps in and talks about the issue as if he really cares. If he genuinely cared about social media, he could’ve spoken up against the social media ban when Congress was in power.  Even during the Gen Z protest, he subtly planted leaders like Tanuja and Rakshya Bam through his media outlet, Setopati. Their interviews were pushed again and again, filling the feed with news about what Rakshya and Tanuja were saying. Slowly, that turned into posts supporting Gagan Thapa. In the end, neutral and unaware people start feeling like, oh, Gagan is the hero we were looking for, just because these figures they follow are also backing him.  Ask him if he made any contents on Gagan Thapa?  \\- Did he made video when Congress tried to sneak in a loophole in the cooling period? What happened to Khatiwada then after?  \\- Did he made how gagan thapa surviving without doing a single job?  \\- When Congress/UML tried to pass 5 years corruption expiry bill.  \\- Even to debunk PACT corruption where Gagan Thapa was alleged, even to debunk the allegation. (he wont, cz truth or not, many will know about this case and will have -ve perception of Gagan)  \\- Why is he surrounded and hangs out with Goons?  \\- Why WikiLeaks has Gagan Thapa as key embassy contact?  No, he won’t do that, because he’ll always have a soft corner for Gagan Thapa. That’s how Gagan Thapa works he spreads narratives through influencers like him, who knowingly or unknowingly end up producing such content.  Another example is Gagan doing small meetings on “populism” and then letting influencers create content around that topic to “spread awareness.” For influencers, it looks like he’s thinking about the nation. But from Gagan’s point of view, he knows those influencers will create content that ends up being subtly targeted at new faces.",

I thought he had a very balanced views and used to follow his contents.|||This video is being pushed with a really misleading narrative.   Binayak Kuikel wasn’t part of any “core” or secret meeting of Gagan Thapa.  This happened when the Social Media Bill was being discussed. Influencers and digital stakeholders were openly invited to share their views. It was a public consultation, not some behind-the-scenes planning session. Some of those inputs were later reflected in changes to the bill, which is exactly how participatory policymaking is supposed to work.  Calling this “propaganda coordination” by cutting out all context is misleading. Criticize policies, question leaders, that’s fair. But pushing edited clips with false framing only lowers the quality of political discussion.  Before reacting to viral videos, shouldn’t we first ask what the full context is and who actually benefits when it’s removed?|||Tei vayera raixa ajkaal anti balen kura garne    tallu le chance payo aba garxa  Gagan ra unka supporters ni rsp kei kura copy garne pheri rsp lai nai populist vanne?

It wasn’t a secret or “core” meeting. It was an open discussion during the Social Media Bill talks, where influencers and stakeholders were invited to share their views.  Turning that into a propaganda story just to fit a narrative is misleading. Pages like Nepal of Routine Banda often do the same with Balen Shah—presenting him as a lone Robin Hood fighting the system, where everything else is shown as conspiracy or sabotage.  Real governance isn’t that simple. Cities aren’t run by heroes alone, and democracy doesn’t work when context is removed for clicks. If Balen is the leader people are looking for, his work should be judged with facts and honesty, not viral clips and emotional framing.  Before reacting, shouldn’t we slow down and ask what actually happened and why this narrative is being pushed?|||Spread the word, gang.

The feeling of my heart having faster and my stomach twisting like an eel holding it's prey is not new to me but still it's not wholly mine.   The feeling of lying in the bed with inherent thoughts of disperse happiness and the want to be able to understand if that happiness is as true as it seems is not new and it's also not wholly mine   I look at all these motion picture hoping to find something. And what that might be is as ananomus to me as it is to you. I look at these things, listen as they talk, but the existence of this feeling of watching doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm lying on this virgin earth, unmolested and untouched, devoid of any feeling of any sort except for one; consciousness. The consciousness reigns supreme within and without all within the vicinity of my existence.  At this point, life as you call it feels not a moments passing by or time flowing like my thoughts.  My head feels particularly heavy, as if I'm thinking but a thought is yet to process. But how can this be? Without a thought, how can you think? How can one live, without knowing the value of death? But that's not right either. For one to know the value of death,.one must first know of its qualities, it's feature in all it's dimensions. The inherent idea of a thought being, and to think not sounds stupid as if not funny enough. But you can't overlook the idea behind such ponder.   I take very long breaths as I think. My heart beats loud enough for me to hear it. And all my bodily functions seems very much obvious to me. This isn't new but it's not wholly mine.   Ahh now my head hurts a little to. But this shall too pass.   Theres this lingering feeling of solitude that I feel very sensationally. For solitude has been my friend far longer then any. The silence that made me feel alone after some years felt not pleasing but good enough to make me feel a bit stingy if it got disturbed.  But now this solitude engulfs me, strangles me so that I choke these thoughts out of me which are yet to be. But it was this very solitude that made me form a thought but now it want it back. Like how death waits right Infront of you, lingers above you with it's hands around neck, and then takes you through the stairs of lifelessness while you climb oblivious. Similar is the solitude that I experience right now, but instead of lifelessness, I climb and climb but towards nothing, I climb and climb but climb on empty thoughts.   My agitated muscles ache in the silence of my breath while my breath gets shorter and heavier each micro instant.",

Ofc sapna bokechau hola voliparsi kehi garni and u gotta work hard. But dont push yourself too hard , enjoy your life a little . Your life wont end due to a damn exam there is much more to do in life. Aba parents haru ta karai rahanchan . What even can we do lol? Ani btw you are pretty damn good in maths . You will improve in other subjects too . Dont stress out|||I am in 12 now. 11 ko first term was best for me all 60 above (except that damn physics) chem ma ta 64 aathyo but i didn't think that much and tried to do good in physics.   2nd term ma physics ma 49 aayo but chemistry ma 45 that drop of 19 marks made my mental health go blind. I gave up on chemistry and physics, I didn't even want to study these two anymore tara after 3rd term 11 final 12 pre term, finally 12 ko 1st term ma physics and chem ma 52 and 53 aathyo respectively. I was satisfied enough. Ani 2nd term ma ahile physics dhostai xa, chem chain tight teacher parexa k huni ho thaxaina.   So to explain what happened here: 1. Course ko amount badhepaxi the marks drastically drop as you and I both faced.  2. The amount of stuff you have to remember is always more than you remember.  3. For mcq and reasoning questions you must read books cuz teachers don't cover everything.  At last, 11 doesn't matter that much as marks and grades, 11 class is just about the memories you build that 12 might not give you.  You look like a study kinda guy so you might have friends like that too, so i am telling you the reality here. The friends you have might not have that chill attitude later in 12th so enjoy the memories you are building cuz in 12 everyone around you will suddenly start focusing on studying and you might fall behind so 12 ma jani bittikai start learning concepts especially physics ko.   Tips for you in 11  1. Grab any opportunity you have become CR club member Host of program sing or whatever you are good at cuz you will be remembered by that more. Also being a CR or club member will benefit your bidesh ko lagi.  2. Try understanding concepts of everything. Science is all about logic if you don't understand the logic behind it you can't understand the science behind it.  3. Feel free to ask to teachers, they are not your enemies. Friends might suppress your curiosity but it doesn't mean teachers won't listen to you. Concepts bujhdainau bhane teachers lai gayera sodha If you are shy to ask them in public. Go to the teachers in the staff room or meet them in the corridor, hallways and question them. Doing this, some of your friends might call you teacher ko chatne or something like that ignore them cuz you are the one who is gonna stand in that interview after 12th not them.  4. Chill.  Tips for 12 Doing 1 will help you be a face that everyone recognizes in 12. If you don't do 1 you might regret it in 12 so go for it.  Keep doing 2 and 3. After a few months into 12, you will realize that its all about what you understand. If you can understand the concept you will remember the formulae. Like physics ko nai kura garda, concept bujhexa bhane timle mathematically k garne yaad hunxa tespaxi dimaag ma or paper mai tyo derive garera formula lekhna sakxau.

He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

My dad brought quite a few for me from KTM every few months, and I used to colour, solve crosswords etc. I event sent crossword solutions (never got published). This is where I knew about sudoku and still love sudoku to this day. I have read a lot of stories in this magazine and some of them  have been life changing for me. I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.  Few years later, through sheer luck (and a bit of reputation in my Nepali class), I got to be the guest editor of one edition of this magazine. Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र). I still absolutely vividly remember that letter, the paper, the handwriting, almost the content (almost 20 years later). The sender had found my information from the guest editor section.

I am in US, and I can say 98% of my friends don’t support his policies. There are a few who do but there’s always an exception.   Now many, including myself, do support some level of checks and restrictions on immigration. Those who didn’t get in take that as being opportunistic or slamming the door after I got in. Far from it.   What I don’t support is people coming through illegal means. What I don’t support is people cheating and providing 100% false representation while applying. Then once they get in, they try to game the system and just be a leech sucking in the benefits without contributing. They are making it harder for the legitimate immigrants and that’s exactly what we hate.  Now I don’t support the current position of not granting any immigration visa indefinitely to Nepal. But you know why this happened? Because almost 40% of Nepalis, about 70-80k take welfare benefits from the US government. You don’t need it if you are a contributing member of the society (except for in some disability/age related case).   There are people coming to US to get free medical treatment. One performer got the treatment and left the Us without paying the medical bills- that person is now banned from coming. Another famous pair got the DV and justified their entry by saying they get free medical for their kid (their case may be legit, but I am just giving an example of what people have been doing).   The administration is going to the other extreme to curb this- but some of it is because the past administration didn’t do anything to prevent it from happening.|||I seriously doubt the accuracy of this sentiment. Nepalis who have settled in America invariably work to bring other family members here. The effort is long and hard, and many are still in process, meaning that spouses, siblings, and others are now cut off from coming over. My brother in-law was able to finally secure his wife's visa a few weeks ago, after working on it for 2 years.  a few weeks later and she wouldn't get to come, so no, Nepali uncles and aunties aren't supportive, and there is no indication that most nepalis voted for trump.  The other thing to consider is the message behind the visa suspensions.  The trump administration is basically saying that immigrants who have come here have not improved conditions, but rather they have made it worse by taking advantage of government programs that they are not entitled to. In other words immigrants are lazy, and thieves. Not a lot to take pride in about that.|||Let me know what you are smoking..seems like good stuff.|||Just like the viral trend chori manchey ko khutta tanney chori manchey naai huncha.

They pay taxes since it's automatically deducted from the paycheck to a social security number that doesn't belong to them. If they try to use the services they're caught and deported  We're fighting back but our leaders are ineffective, the police are working with ICE and if we call in the military we're unsure of whose side they'll take.

Not everyone who votes Republican is \"hiding the ladder since they've made it\". That claim is lazy, false, and ignores basic economic reality.  Some of us vote based on numbers, not slogans. When you are paying over $100,000 a year in taxes (household)—income tax, state tax, property tax, sales tax—and you don’t see proportional benefits in return, fiscal policy starts to matter a lot. At that level, voting conservative isn’t ideological—it’s rational. Lower taxes, limited government, and accountability in spending simply align better with that reality.  Paying six figures into the system and being told you’re “privileged,” “selfish,” or morally inferior for questioning where that money goes is not persuasive—it’s alienating. Wanting to keep more of what you earn does not make you hateful. It makes you financially literate.  Many Republican voters reject racism and extremism outright. What they do reject is runaway taxation, bloated government, and being constantly generalized or morally lectured by people whose policies they fundamentally can’t relate to. The same way not all Democrats are extremists, not all Republicans are villains.  And yes—we are also tired of being lumped together with fringe elements just because we don’t align with extreme progressive ideology. Disagreeing with activist politics, identity absolutism, or ideological purity tests does not make someone anti-human. It means they prioritize practicality over performative outrage.  People vote based on lived experience. For households paying $100k+ in taxes every year, conservative policies often make more sense. That’s not hate. That’s math.",

And the major businesses that were attacked were in some kind of overtly public affiliation with political actors|||at least not in religious way.|||I know you did not watched or followed Bangladesh zen-z protest.  Government killed 1000+ youths and they burned down so many buildings. Even media houses for spreading false narrative.   And every time I see this kinda post they always undermine people’s life.   What would you do if your brother or sister were killed in that protest ?  Did you forget those videos of kids being shot??   And I hate this logic of that much destruction and all.  Do not ever compare human life against any short of building.   Building can be recreated or rebuilt. Can you recreate those innocent lives ?? Precedent has to be set that if you ever kill innocent people, consequences are inevitable.   And hate to see people preaching about businesses and job like they care.  Why the fuck import based economy who is fully dependent on remittances talking about job ?  Job in kantipur ? Job in bhatbhateni ?  These are blood sucking insects , Have you checked bhatbhateni business model ? Whole atmadaha in front of BICC was bcuz of bhatbhateni not paying money.   Even if they leave someone will come up to replace them.   Get your life together and find some kindness towards lost lives.|||Destruction is not an competition|||At least we are not as extremist as the dutch.   They shot their PM, mutilated the PM and his brother's body. Then they strung it up on a gibbet and cooked and ate their livers.|||I don't feel any sympathy for these conry capitalist and their political overlords, with their illegal building made from ill-gotten gains. These businesses have been involved in tax evasion, quid pro quo, illegal construction, land grab scams, corruption, and lord knows what else. I actually feel really sad that our public properties and institutions got torched along with millions of documents. Whatever happened shouldn't have happened. It was very unfortunate. But let's not sympathize with these cronies and corrupt politicians. For decades, the real victims have been the everyday citizens of our country. Our Parliament, the Supreme Court, and Singha Durbar getting burned down is a bigger tragedy than some 5-star hotel or supermarket chain. We have been screwed over by these politicians and their business counterparts for so long that on that day, the entire country became a rage room. Extreme events were a result of us getting pushed to the extremes after decades of built-up anger, frustration, and fatally shooting our fellow school and college-going citizens by our own government.|||I think OP forgets the fact that on September 8th ... Videos and photos of kids with their brains splattered on the road were on full display... These kids of schools and colleges had no fault other than practising their constitution given right to protest peacefully..  and yet our security system deemed it right to kill these students .. through closed gates.. not one rubber bullet was fired not a single one. And these were live ammunitions... videos of cops giving the middle finger after shooting and terrorising the shops till 9-10 o'clock at night  were circulating .. What happened on September 9th was a reaction to that. Yes heavy damages were done and many anarchists got the chance to create chaos on September 9th.. but only an idiot would compare this event which was completely reactionary .. to the on going protests and acts of violence going on in Bangladesh in the name of religion without any proof .. these acts of violence in Bangladesh is not reactionary . It is targeted by a mob of illitrate extremists..|||23 ko tyo frustration niskya ho tara 24 ma|||As far as I understand what happened in Bangladesh was religion war in false accusations.    What happened in Nepal was class war and we knew it. Not that race, caste, or religion war cannot happen in Nepal. We always need to be careful on who our real enemy is.|||yo sab khaubadi muzi harule ho|||A not very wise man once said “We r all 3 meals away from anarchy “|||ever wondered how many people might have been left inside that huge building? no bodies could have been recovered from that inferno right?|||mob is always extremist, be it nepal desh or bangladesh|||The last protest reminded that we are no different. Never thought that Nepali society would go so low and become so polarised. It’s sad, it’s tragic hope we all will still find a common ground to agree on.|||People dying is in no way good on both sides, but at least whichever government comes, they'll never be clueless about people's power and ability going forward.|||We are slowly turning to extreme left and extreme right. You are 100% correct |||[ Removed by Reddit ]|||Can we just not compare ourselves to them? Most south asian countries are poor and underdeveloped, that shouldnt be where we set the standard for ourselves.|||I think i can perhaps contribute a slightly different perspective here. I don’t think Nepali youth burning down this hotel or Bangladeshi youth burning down/breaking during the uprising in both countries have anything to do with extremism or religion for that matter. When you are going to protest against a bad government, practically I don’t think anyone have religion, race, color or anything of that sort in the back of their mind, the adrenaline is so high you are only focused on one thing.   During protests, when you see protesters burning down or breaking down anything, it is usually because that structure represent something significant. I know a lot of structures were burned, broken because they represented the tyranny under fascism. A significant driver behind Nepali uprising was corruption from what I understand, and I’m pretty sure this hotel was owned/majority stakeholder by some Nepali politicians, if so, then I see them burning a symbol of rampant corruption rather than a hotel.  That’s their perspective I suppose, nonetheless, I think it’s foolish to do things like this, and I’m sure some of them will look back and realize maybe it was foolish.|||You witnessed a freaking big-ass revolution, not some child-play games.   We are lucky that things didn't go that bad. Also, new emerging figures are actually being open-minded about this destruction. They are hopeful they will rebuild Nepal brick by brick.|||I mean I am yet to hear about a person in Nepal getting lynched on allegations of blasphemy because the person said all god are equal.    Mob mentality is bad , there is reason why 99% of revolutions fail. Mobs hijack them.|||Isn't it ironic that burnt Hilton makes them more profit? Owners had already made bank with over invoicing during construction. Now they get to do it again and build an even better hotel with nirman sampanna.|||Commenters and deleters, we are all taxpayers in this country. Every single purchase, every import, and every rupee earned is taxed. As citizens, we have all done our part in paying taxes and funding our politicians' pockets. At least, everyday citizens don't evade taxes and pay their fair share. When it comes to employment, there are many more small and medium businesses providing way more employment than a handful of large business families. Cronies are squeezing the labour market from every single rupee and forcing productive working-class youth abroad for employment. We need a reality check on who is actually living in dreamland. Your choice of words, using \"Your Parliament\" instead of \"Our Parliament,\" says it all...|||If this type of disastrous behavior of Nepalese youth doesn’t change then country will be in trouble.|||Yo ta ma media lai dosh dinchu + bhatbhateni|||Let's make it clear 24 was not a protest but that doesn't make it right  Mob psychology testai huncha in a crowd of 200-500 one person is enough to create massive destruction crowd doesn't think Tara Nepal ma all was not hopeless tyo crowd laai citizens were trying to control and in many places we were successful as well don't know about Bangladesh   Ani tyo level of burning might have been done by experienced players natra building jalauna sajilo chaina Kantipure le sample haru send garako cha don't know about the results|||[deleted]|||It's a country with the lowest IQ what would you expect? Everyone shows their anger that day some show their words, and some choose violence it's based on their own thinking capacity. But what causes this is the main problem? Was everything normal and people went outside and burned down everything?  Even from those people who are asking about those incidents now, some were resigning from their political parties, some were posting their dissatisfaction in social media.   And this is a society if you have civic sense doesn't mean everyone has. Some people will always try to find a way to vandalize and that day it was a great opportunity for them because the state was without a government and no chain of commands. Neither the protestors wanted this nor the supporters, all those happened because of the dissatisfaction and the anger. And the cause you know better.",

            "body": "It’s 2026 now, and we’re still having to deal with this.  A few days ago, early in the morning, I was on the street and saw a public bus with people literally hanging from the door. It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this. This issue really needs more attention and more noise.|||KTM has enough budget with 40 percent going unused. these transportation comes under metropolitan ko authority. ask Mayor balen.

            "body": "Congratulations to Gagan for becoming the Congress Party Sabhapati. I have been seeing many Gagan-glazing posts recently, so I have a few questions for him.  - When will you speak about the Nepali and foreign currency that was found burnt in your former president’s house? Were those AI-generated, as your party president and many party leaders were claiming?  - You have raised the Sahakari Kanda involving Rabi Lamichhane, but when will you raise the same question about your own party member, Maya Rai, who was also a member of the same sahakari in Kathmandu (I’ve forgotten the name)? What about the Dhanraj Gurung sahakari case?  - You were part of the Government Efficiency team when the recent UML–Congress coalition government was formed. Will you question or take responsibility for the recent GenZ killings? Your party member Ramesh Lekhak was also the Home Minister at that time—have you questioned him about this?  - You have been a Member of Parliament four times, and during your tenure, the Congress has formed the government multiple times. Can you point to any concrete, policy-level achievements you delivered during your party’s time in government?  - What about Aftab Alam case during your party's government was he rightfully being prosecuted or your party's government have him impunity from jail, what about that case?",

And somehow Congress will be saved.|||The real answer is Bises Mahadibesan. That itself was a bidroha against the entrenched cult politics that the Deuba gang has practiced throughout its history. Deuba, as an individual, may once have been a true leader—but over time, the gang culture around him is what turned everything rotten and made him look bhrasta.  From this point onward, Gagan is free.  Free from:  All blame linked to Arzu  All accusations about money in Deuba’s house  All baggage related to Bhutani saranarthi  All the kandas, Teramox, and backroom deals  All blame connected to Lekhaks and their networks  These were never Gagan’s sins to carry.  So why should he keep answering for other people’s cults? Why should a reformist voice be held hostage by the corruption, compromises, and power games of an old guard that refuses to let go?  If anyone needs to answer, it’s the system that protected those networks for decades—not the one who finally challenged them.  Gagan doesn’t need to answer anymore. The Mahadibesan already did.|||He can give you wai wai, not sure about answers.

Don't get me wrong there are shortcomings from him and nobody is perfect but most of the questions you raised here are poor attempt to make him look bad.  You have to realize that even though Gagan is a prominient member of Nepali Congress, he was never the executive. Every decision the party makes as a whole, the chairman (Deuba) has the supreme authority and he is little to no say in any of the decisions.  Even then, he has clearly spoken against all wrongdoings. And you say \"just speak\". But that's the problem of not being in executive power, he can only speak.  You trying to  make the money burnt in Deuba's house somehow a crime by Gagan Thapa clearly tells me that you are just trying to hate. Otherwise as everyone else has said, there is a special probe commission formed to specifically study the burnt money case and all we can do is wait for their report and the government will file the case if there is wrongdoing (which we all believe there is). And Gagan has clearly affirmed this, as any sane person would. You should read him and listen his many public interviews/videos and not just assume he didn't say anything.  He has clearly said multiple times that any and all involved in sahakari kanda should be investigated including naming people from his own party by name, again multiple times in multiple of his public appearences and writings, you should read/watch/listen those. The government should file cases. I don't understand how this would be his fault.  If you again watch his comments in good faith and listen to his parliament speeches, he as said multiple times that  the public is angry, they need delivery. He said he opposed the coalition and publicly opposed it multiple times. But he is not the executive, deuba is. When there is coaliation, he has the moral responsibility to make the government successful. He was indeed in the efficiency team and he said he tried is best to make the government successful because he knew people needed delivery even though he opposed the coalition. He publicly told long before the Gen-Z protest that he couldn't get the government to do what the efficiency team was supposed to do, and he left it. So I don't think that makes him culpable for the massacre during gen-z protest.  But still he has taken moral responsibility for what happened during the protest. He has apologized multiple times for any moral culpability he has. He said he immediately asked the party leadership to break coaliation in the first day of protest and asked Lekhak to resign. Lekhak did resign but the party didn't leave coalition because again Deuba is executive and makes the decision.  He has been parliament member four times. The first time and he failed to deliver the constitution as promised which he was elected for. The second tenure was again the CA election, which delivered the constitution and you can't deny he played crucial role in making the constitution, and he (among all others) delivered the constitution. The next term he went to the parliament again and became health minister and people say he delivered some reforms in health sector (again refer to public catalogues of his works during this tenure). And you have to grant that he has been constant voice in the parliament on various issues, which the MP is sent for. This last time was a short tenure, but as everyone he has played crucial role in voicing concerns in the parliament. Ironically he strongly demanded there be independent probe in sahakari case and there have been multiple arrests and cases filed against some major fraudsters. You should grant that this was successfull. But we can always demand more. I am not his prabakta but to me seems like he could have definitely done more here and I am sure he agrees.  Yeah what about the case? Alam was a proven convict. But congress did dirty by lobbying to release him. I haven't seen him support Alam's release. Again, I am not sure the details of his release but how is Gagan culpable for the crime Alam committed?  Again I am not his prabakta. I try to speak with reason. You could certainly question that he didn't do enough at policy level as MP to propose new laws and pass them. You could ask him that he could not do enough to break Deuba stronghold. But he precisely did that recently.  Now I am watching him closely, he is now in the position to deliver at least from his party level. Make him accountable ask him tough questions. But the aforementioned questions seemed more like an attempt to make him bad (except may be how many policy changed did he make in 1 1/2 tenure as MP except CA MP which they delivered constitution).

At home, my bags were 23 + 22 kg, and my carry-on was 20 kg.  At the check-in counter, the agent told me to move some items from my carry-on into one checked bag so I’d only have to pay excess for one bag. I did exactly that and reduced my carry-on to 12 kg.  Magically, after this:  •\tChecked bags became 32 kg and 25 kg    •\tCarry-on became 13 kg  Somehow, between weighing the bags at home, weighing them again at the counter, and then re-weighing them a third time, my bags gained weight out of nowhere.  I was exhausted and didn’t have the energy to argue, so they charged me for two excess bags — $80 each. No leeway, no consideration.  To make things worse, the agent openly suggested that if I paid cash and didn’t need a receipt, they could lower the price. At that point it was obvious they were trying to pocket the money. Absolutely shameless.  I paid by card, waited until they gave me a proper Turkish Airlines receipt, and made sure everything was legit.  If you’re flying Turkish Airlines out of Tribhuvan International Airport, I strongly suggest avoiding the chubby girl working at the Turkish Airlines check-in counter. She was incompetent from the start — struggling to even open the computer system and issue a boarding pass, while agents at nearby counters were processing passengers with ease.

Happened to me in airport outside nepal as well.  The main difference is that airport scales are \"trade-legal\" industrial devices required by law to be regularly calibrated for high precision, whereas home scales are consumer-grade gadgets that use cheaper sensors and are almost never recalibrated. Additionally, the environment distorts the numbers; weighing a bag on a soft home carpet or trying to balance a large suitcase on a small bathroom scale often creates a \"lighter\" reading than reality, unlike the airport's large, stable platforms embedded in hard concrete. Because of this, the airport scale is generally accurate, while your home scale is just an estimate that tends to drift.|||[removed]|||Are we allowed to video record our interactions there?

Stood for political, social and economic justice throughout his life and didn't compromise for anything.    He took most of the responsibility and he did make mistakes (and he has accepted them gracefully in is biography).      You see, the problem with our generation is we read too less to judge a person and almost fail to account the then social and political scenario of the country. So, my suggestion would be you read yourself and don't judge him based on my opinion or other few incidents or stories mentioned in the comments.   Personally, He gave me the definition of democracy. Here is one story of his conversation with his nephew Naresh Koirala.   *Naresh himself had been puzzled by his uncle’s decision to accept the result. On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP. Mahendra and Birendra believed themselves to be the savior of common \"*naive\"* Nepali.    While BP simply believed that Nepali people irrespective of their education, culture, caste, religion, sex or whatsoever are capable to choose their leaders themselves and make them responsible.|||One of the greatest writers, Nepal has ever produced.|||This guy high moral values unlike present  Congress.

The next steps depend on what you want the outcome to be.   1. If you want mediation and your relationship to continue, have a serious discussion with your husband and let him know what the stakes are, either to work on the relationship together, or to end it. Couples therapy is also helpful for many. There's no point fighting forever. Has anyone else witness the violence, do you have kids? Does your husband drink? Does he have his own social life? Does he have any mental health issues? Many things factor. But a discussion with your husband should be your first thing to do and let him know boundaries and also reflect on yourself too.   2. If you want to end it, depends on where you are. Think through everything and then only decide. If you have kids or not. You need to contact a lawyer as well. What is your financial situation. Do you have any social support nearby as things can get stressful and messy.|||You work so it seems you're independent. Report him to the police.

Having someone my close family member go through similar situation before, never believe that abusers will change, kukurko puchhar 12 barsa dhungro ma rakhne ukhan estai manxe lai banaeko ho. Assuming you are in 20s/30s, do you want to spend next 40 or so years of your life with such abuse?    Many people will try to convince you to stay and tell you that he will change but ask to yourself do you truly believe that?  Also you mentioned that “maile pani farkauthe”, if he hits you don’t hit back but report it to police (unless it is life threatening) and also talk to your parents/relatives/friends about it don’t bottle up till too late.  I know sometimes it is difficult to let go because of many reasons (eg. visa issues or money issues) but what if in the heat of the moment he hits you and you get a lifetime disability or even die; so for your own safety, i suggest to dump his ass.|||Leave before its too late|||Hi OP, garo huncha thulo decision lina divorce jastai.

Please find ways to get out from there..... Even if your parents don't support trust me and many others, this is not normal..... For the love of yourself, you should leave asap.|||I just realized you said tmle pani haat haltheu, hmmm.... If you both truly want to work it out.... Now I'm thinking about it after reading your comments that you really love him....   In that case, talk to him what is bothering him, if he has had lot of childhood trauma, stress, unprocessed emotions, it really does affect a person, they become like time bomb and a small trigger can make them very angry ..... Now note that I'm saying this in hopes that you both truly want to work it out..... Talk to him, let him know anger at this level is not normal and he can gently start a talk therapy or men's circles, or somatic healing sessions, emdr therapy (if it's a part trauma), etc. there are so many options in today's time to start a healing journey. I'm in full support for people to move this route, even if you are violent in the past. It's not easy being human and I get it. Please consider, I hope this helps. But please remember, if you are going to lead this journey for both of you, remember to be patient, kind, and loving. Sometimes you will have to let the other person be so angry and be able to watch them (it's a specific emotional release session) without you absorbing their emotions. For him, and for you too probably, when emotions come, you both have to remember it's NEVER about the other person. If you would like each other to do something, you can request but nobody is obliged to follow, just having this much boundary will help you both to process your emotions on your own. Start therapy or just start writing on your own, you will notice you stress or anger is often coming from something else within yourself, not from people around you.   I hope this help a little bit. Take care, pass love to each other. If it's easier, bring serious talk when you are getting romantic, I think that helps you both absorb and understand better. Take care please. It's not impossible to change yourself and your relationships in this time, especially with so much options, start meditation, therapy, dance, especially moving body helps move your emotions too. Take care.|||Just have a conversation with your husband. Ask him why is he is acting like that? IS he insecure about you or what? make everything clear. Why is he acting in that manner?

If it get repeated what action will be taken? Let him know.

The system itself is messed up, so obviously one person alone can’t fix everything on their own. There will be tons of hurdles, especially in the capital city of the country.

No matter what work you have, you somehow have to come to Kathmandu for it. So yeah, I understand his situation.  The one thing I really criticize him for is his lack of communication. That is something I am very disappointed about. During his entire campaign, he kept saying that he wouldn’t be like previous mayors and that he would stay in constant communication with the public. But after winning, he almost completely stopped connecting with people. There is no proper accountability, just one-sided Facebook status updates. This is the part where I am extremely disappointed in him and openly criticize him.  Other than that, I think he has actually shown that work can be done.

The content is rarely original. It is compiled from existing news articles that anyone could find doing Google. It’s a summary service, not investigative journalism.  2. As it relies on secondary sources, it never goes deep. It stays on the surface of issues, prioritizing smooth editing over raw facts.  3. The channel’s main narrative is simple: 'The country is doomed.' This is a lazy narrative. Telling us that politicians are bad or the system is broken is stating the obvious. It validates anger but offers no insight.  If you want to be entertained, it works. But if you want to be informed, this is a waste of time.",

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.  I (21M) and my sibling (15F) are taking care of our parents during the day and our cousins help at night. Because of this, we’ve missed months of classes but we don’t really have a choice right now.  If anyone is able to help even a small amount, it would mean a lot to us.  I’ve verified the case with two of the mods and I’ll be posting medical reports in the comments as well.  Please DM or comment if you can help in any way. Even sharing this post would really help.",

Esto kaam ekdum kam huncha hamro desh ma|||Kudos to subham vai. I remember when he talked about doing this in his free time.|||This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

It's an individual-thing and not a profession-thing. Girls sending DMs to get referred (when they have no skills) is also more common than you think. I get many DMs asking for free help (refactors)/ referrals (barely know them/ barely seen their code) and I just ignore them. I help many people (m/f) on a daily basis, and I've never met most of them. I know many of my 'male' senior friends (no female senior dev friends) do the same.  You should clear your exams first. Last bullet point sounds like a good plan.  Most people here will be happy to review 1-2 projects for free. I'll jump in if it's Python/ Next.js/ ML. Just post your github repo on some relevant community and they'll do free reviews.   Edit: I dont do free mentorships, happy to review repos/ coding practices.|||In my experience, Girls seem to help girl only when they are on some “female tech organization” and it’s rarely a technical mentorship.

Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

But my experience tells me having multiple clients is safe and secure for the long run. The more financially secure thing you can do is make a sensible investment inside Nepal.

(Should I personally ask them to deduct 5% TDS?)  I also receive USD payments from an EU-based company. In that case, tax is deducted twice: first by the platform itself (approximately 3.5%), and then another 5% TDS is deducted here. When the funds arrive, my bank automatically converts the USD to NPR based on the prevailing exchange rate and credits it to my account in Npr.  I opened a USD account (dollar card) using my PAN. The annual limit is USD 500, but as far as I understand, this limit is only for payments/spending. Is it possible to increase this limit or ask the bank to keep incoming USD directly in that USD account instead of converting it to NPR?  Another question is that, if i’am to receive payments from a subscription based service from a platform apps i made, i basically can’t from nepal, for that i either need the LLC or C-Corp registered in US banks that accepts remote workers no ?  Up to how much extent can nepal banks provide services to be able to pay and receive payments internationally ? Or which banks ? That can win over the limitation of dollar cards ?

Also, the *cost of vehicles* in Nepal is much higher than in India. Cars that cost ₹7–10 L in India often cost 2–3× more in Nepal (sometimes even higher when taxes + import duties are added), and this is widely reported.  This means:  1. The same car/automobile can cost roughly 2–3 times more in Nepal because of heavy import taxes and logistics costs. 2. Almost everything (especially cars, electronics, imported goods) is more expensive in Nepal, except for some basic categories like food and rent, which are generally cheaper compared to big Indian cities.",

Cant see both.|||if its real whatdo you do  ??? can you give some info or context|||I can see the angle of “look what you can get even from Nepal,” and yeah, that part can actually be motivating because a lot of people still assume they need to leave the country to reach certain compensation levels. But motivation usually comes from showing the path, not just the end result. A screenshot shows where you landed, not how you got there.  People here asked genuine questions about niche, stack, timeline, experience, etc because that’s the part that actually helps others move in that direction. That’s where the value would have been. Without that context, the post ends up reading more like a soft flex than mentorship. Nothing wrong with flexing, just don’t call it motivation if you’re not giving people anything they can learn from or replicate.  With 5+ years of experience you’ve seen enough of the field to know that the “how” matters more than the “what,” especially for people in Nepal who are trying to break into the global market. If the goal was to motivate, sharing the path would have done it way better than just the screenshot.|||Chyya kasto salty manche haru comments ma.

When you know exactly what to do it's pretty easy to write the code for it. The hardest part of IT is trying to find out what the right questions to ask is so that you have a semblance on what exactly to code. It's trying to understand what the users of your software want.

Shitty code, more bugs and more opportunities for IT devs. Not every company can afford AI that is going to cost fortune in long run. Mid-level devs would collapse, there would be junior then senior. Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||[deleted]|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||Skill issue.

Don't get me wrong - vibe coding and low code/no code methods are getting popular with some LLM coders (Claude, Gemini) becoming absolute beasts, but, the real need of a human is in problem solving and building scalable systems. My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.  The problem is people jumping on the bandwagon which is creating a terrible environment for business owners, recruiters and stakeholders.  I hope you do well in your career my friend.

Sure, it is not realistic to overlook the economy or the job scarcity that is so prevalant now, maybe for the longest time yet but it doesn't adjucate to the premise of Software Engineering isn't feasible as a career anymore, at least to the degree people are making it out to be. AI-driven development may very well be a 'bubble', and when it pops and the dust settles, the next big thing will provoke a similar reaction. While it is evident that people with years of experience are at a loss right now, and even more so for students trying to make it in tech, undergrads or young aspirants.  I believe it was never about how greatly any technology overshadows the current technology even if it transforms areas of it by overwhelming amounts but the ability to use it to your advantage. That is how you thrive here. You embrace, and not reject. AI cannot replace engineering but it does accelerate aspects of it that if you don't keep up, you get left behind. I mean, with AI-driven development so rampant right now, startups are at an all time high. People adapt and make it work. That mindset is obligatory now more than ever. Well, I could be speaking regardless of facts that I have yet to know, but I stand firmly on my grounds of not rejecting engineering as it has never been easier than now.|||I have 4 YOE.

An industry can only take so many people before saturation, especially in face of disruption / paradigm shift as is the case now. As with any other field, you have to dedicate time and effort to be good and stay good. If you are a computer engineer worth your salt, you know it's a lot more about structured and critical thinking, problem solving skills and architecting solutions than coding in the field, and if you have the basics right, tech stack changing shouldn't scare you as much.  As with any other field, only the most committed, knowledgeable and competent people will remain in the industry and that should always be the case. The gold rush is over.|||Difficult times? Yes.

If one guy is ready to meet then you can get them nabbed. - If you have family or friends in any of the banks scammers used, then ask them to find their original name, number, location, if account still has any money (this worked for me, I got number and names)  If you got details you can ask police to help by scaring them or freezing the amount etc. You can try these and come back to me here to proceed.|||cyber bureau ma report garne all details .|||haha movies haina ni bro. reverse hack hanera location track hanera firta linu sounds good in fantasy only . only logical option is to go to police/bank or whatever institutions involved|||Sakyeo no chance ull ever recover ur amount..but register ur case to cyber bureau|||First do register police complaint.

            "heading": "We built a social/dating app for KU students.",
            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

If I have the time, I might join if I'm free. If they were inviting Harvard professors, it'd cost you 10x more to attend. Events take time and effort. Many costs. Let's switch the focus to you. Have you organized an event? Was it easy? Who did you invite as a speaker?   If you're a student, why care about an enterprise AI event? I fail to see your criticisms. Not everybody needs to start a business to prove their credibility. It literally takes <20k.  I don't expect them to cover hf peft best practices. It's an event for enterprises. I don't have expectations for food. If I meet somebody interesting, that's good enough for me.  I think you're being confused between training courses and networking events. Plenty of events if you want to learn. ANAIS, NAAMII charged 12k for students this year. Was fine. Good stuff. Made many friends.  I dislike AI non-profits that claim to do research and fail to have any publications or research projects, yet say they're open to collaborations. But the AI association isn't a research body, probably does just events. Executives don't open up VS code and grind all day. That's a very small minority. They're skilled, just not in a way that appeals to you. They bring in investors, organize events, lots of things. If you ask me, there's a lot more to a product than PRs and merges. If you're not already the Lead for some MNC, some humility helps. It's dumb to say a CEO doesn't have skills because they don't code like you do, don't you think?  I'm not affiliated with naamii or any non-profits.|||On one hand, I can see the low effort poster with multiple mistakes and the fluffy pointless nonsense that is the main paragraph probably written by ChatGPT with a 6 word prompt.

Maybe offer anecdotes? Some tangible verifiable reason to justify your \"nrs 350 for 2.5 hours is a massive waste\".  Organizing an event comes with some cost, and some of that must be passed to the visitor. NRS 350 is some money, it is definitely not a lot of money. It is most definitely not \"expensive\" for an event in any sense of the word.   Justify your claims. Why is this a \"scam\"? What other way can a person \"use nrs 350 to learn by yourself\" (your words)? Who are the speakers and why are they unqualified to speak on this program?  *disclaimer: not affilaited to this org or event*, *just a random angry redditor*",

I’m thinking of creating a community where people can learn how to spot these scams and report them properly. Would you join a group like this? Do you think it’s something worth doing, or would it cause more problems than it solves? Looking for honest opinions.    A community solely to mass report scams!!      The following picture is also involving a kind of scam pyramid scheme where people never actually earn through real stuff rather than fooling teenagers into investing some money and encouraging them to find others who would invest into their scheme so they can get a cut.",

            "body": "Hi, I’m a 20-year-old student and freelancer who genuinely wants to build something meaningful in life.  After +2, I applied to Canada and the USA for further studies, but my visa got rejected. Instead of wasting a year, I joined BBS , and now I’m in my 3rd year.  When the visa didn’t work out, I decided to take responsibility for my own future. I started learning about AI, automation, and new technologies. Over time, I picked up practical skills, experimented a lot, and eventually started freelancing. Right now, I work as an AI Developer on Upwork, and even in the early stage, I’m earning more than 1 lakh NPR per month.  I’m not an expert and I still have a lot to learn but I know my strengths. I’m good at managing things, people, sales, content, and marketing, and I can execute fast. I have learned most of this by consuming real-world information online and applying it through actual work.  I have big plans in the AI space, but I also know that building something great alone is very difficult. That’s why I am looking for a technical co-founder, someone strong on the engineering side so we can build, learn, and grow together.  The idea is to:  * Start very small and lean * No heavy investment * Focus on AI services / automation / agency-style work * Only basic costs like hosting or APIs * Aim to generate revenue within 2–3 months  I currently live with my parents in Butwal, but I want to move to Kathmandu, take a small flat, and fully focus on building. I also plan to start creating content alongside the business.  I’m looking for someone who:  * Is disciplined and focused * Serious about long-term growth * Not into unhealthy habits * Wants a simple lifestyle with deep work * Has strong technical skills or is deeply committed to developing them  Most importantly, I want a co-founder who understands that things won’t always work. There will be hard times, failures, and uncertainty. During those phases, we should push and motivate each other, stay consistent, and keep moving forward. Even if something fails, we should come out smarter, stronger, and more experienced than before.  We don’t need much money to start just enough for basic living expenses. I have savings that allow me to manage accommodation and food for a long time, and I strongly believe we can make this sustainable within a few months.  The goal is simple:   Live together. Build together. Learn together. Grow together.  If you’re technically strong, disciplined, and serious about building a real AI business from Nepal, let’s connect.",

This has now gotten out of hand, and this type of behavior will surely spread to other tourist areas, especially those closer to the border like Sauraha and others. I have seen these 'tourists' in Thars and other SUVs riding recklessly on our highways, mocking our rules and laws. In my local area in the Terai, there have been a couple of incidents where such SUVs have hit locals, including traffic police, and fled to India.  Let's continue to do what we can from our end - I have reported the videos and his channel, and let's keep reporting those videos wherever we find them, and from any other Indian 'YouTubers'. Influencers from Pokhara need to raise their voices collectively on other popular social media channels like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Local influencers need to unite and raise this issue from their platforms in their individual capacities. Otherwise, we might be just one incident away from breaking news.

Yet today, we seem to be losing our sense of judgment, influenced heavily by social media popularity rather than thoughtful evaluation. In the process, we are slowly drifting away from our ethics, integrity, and understanding of how we should act as citizens and how we should choose to be governed.

Even Bibek Thapaliya was hiding his affiliations, and KMAG still hides theirs. This guy just picked up that post and used it to make himself look good again.  I know how biased he is or maybe he doesn’t even realize how he got used. This is how Gagan operates. He invites these influencers, keeps them close, so they don’t post or make content against him. By doing these meetings, he slowly creates a soft corner in their mind and heart. So later, when Gagan messes up, they hesitate to criticize him because they’ve met him personally and think, “He’s a good guy.”  This is also how Gagan has managed to influence journalists across different media houses. Not all of them are in his inner circle, but he subtly shapes how they think. He invites them, talks to them, and slowly pushes the narratives he wants—who’s bad, what’s bad, and how to counter certain people.  The social media ban happened when Congress was in government, right? He won’t openly say, “Support me” or “Make things favor me,” but indirectly he keeps planting ideas like, I’m the only one who can fix this, and stuff like that.  This is a very familiar pattern with Gagan Thapa. First, influencers like these create noise online, and once it starts getting attention, he jumps in and talks about the issue as if he really cares. If he genuinely cared about social media, he could’ve spoken up against the social media ban when Congress was in power.  Even during the Gen Z protest, he subtly planted leaders like Tanuja and Rakshya Bam through his media outlet, Setopati. Their interviews were pushed again and again, filling the feed with news about what Rakshya and Tanuja were saying. Slowly, that turned into posts supporting Gagan Thapa. In the end, neutral and unaware people start feeling like, oh, Gagan is the hero we were looking for, just because these figures they follow are also backing him.  Ask him if he made any contents on Gagan Thapa?  \\-  Did he made video when Congress tried to sneak in a loophole in the cooling period? What happened to Khatiwada then after?  \\- Did he made how gagan thapa surviving without doing a single job?  \\- When Congress/UML tried to pass 5 years corruption expiry bill.  \\- Even to debunk PACT corruption where Gagan Thapa was alleged, even to debunk the allegation. (he wont, cz truth or not, many will know about this case and will have -ve perception of Gagan)  \\- Why is he surrounded and hangs out with Goons?  \\- Why WikiLeaks has Gagan Thapa as key embassy contact?  No, he won’t do that, because he’ll always have a soft corner for Gagan Thapa. That’s how Gagan Thapa works he spreads narratives through influencers like him, who knowingly or unknowingly end up producing such content.  Another example is Gagan doing small meetings on “populism” and then letting influencers create content around that topic to “spread awareness.” For influencers, it looks like he’s thinking about the nation. But from Gagan’s point of view, he knows those influencers will create content that ends up being subtly targeted at new faces.  https://preview.redd.it/x4nqjclj1veg1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=5303b0b09e8b772195bbc2a80116bd3b9f25bdb5|||RONB le tetro Balen ko chusekai chusai cha ta 3 4 barsa bata yo vanda badi jholagiri ta kai dekhechaina kunai media le koi lai gareko.

She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

My nephew, **Liam Thapa**, is battling **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)**.  It is a rare, cruel genetic disease that causes muscles to waste away. Without intervention, boys with DMD lose the ability to walk by their early teens, and many don’t survive past their 20s.  But, there is a ray of hope: A one-time **Gene Therapy (Elevidys)** that can stop this progression. But the cost is a staggering **$2.9 Million USD**.  I am posting from a business Reddit ID to maintain total transparency and accountability.  Yes, we know $2.9M sounds impossible, but we are fighting for every cent.  * Total Goal: **$2.9 Million USD** * Cost in Nepalese Rupees: **Approx. रु 41,92,00,000 (41.92 Crore NPR)** * Raised so far: **$85909** * Remaining: **$2814091**  Liam is nearly 4. This therapy is most effective the earlier it is given. We are racing against time and biological markers that could disqualify him if we wait too long.  I have compiled all medical records, hospital documents from Australia, and identity proofs in a transparent folder for anyone who wishes to verify our story: [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1BHeXMPMnw7DZFLJZM3bBLWGqn7Rp8wc8](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1BHeXMPMnw7DZFLJZM3bBLWGqn7Rp8wc8)  If you can’t donate, please share.

DMD is heartbreaking, and I genuinely hope he gets the care he needs 🙏  Just sharing information for awareness (not to diminish the importance of Elevidys): there are FDA-approved medications available for DMD today that can slow progression and improve outcomes, depending on the child’s mutation and age. These include corticosteroids (like deflazacort or vamorolone), exon-skipping therapies (for specific mutations), and non-steroidal options like givinostat, in addition to gene therapy.  Of course, treatment choice depends on genetic testing, eligibility criteria, and specialist guidance, and early intervention is critical, which I understand is why Elevidys is being pursued.  Posting this only so families reading this thread know there are multiple therapeutic pathways worth discussing with a neuromuscular specialist. Wishing Liam strength, access, and support and hoping this campaign reaches the right hands. 🤍|||.|||I am sorry, baby. He is so cute. Ma yei ausadi banaune thau ma kaam garchu.

            "body": "As you can see, the person highlighted in the red circle is Binayak Kuikel, a YouTuber who runs a channel called *‘Why So Offended’*. He subtly pushes a narrative portraying RSP/Rabi/Balen negatively, often labeling them as populist. You will hardly find him criticizing Gagan Thapa. He is there to set narratives.  Most of the people seen in the photo are from Gagan’s core group, who are very active on Twitter and regularly share pro-Gagan and anti-RSP posts, one of them being Raghav in the brown jacket.  You can support any leader you like, but you can’t pretend to be neutral while subtly pushing your own agenda and narratives.  ーーーー  Lol, honestly I didn’t even know he had uploaded something yesterday, but my post had perfect timing and it blew up. Even Bibek Thapaliya was hiding his affiliations, and KMAG still hides theirs. This guy just picked up that post and used it to make himself look good again.  I know how biased he is or maybe he doesn’t even realize how he got used. This is how Gagan operates. He invites these influencers, keeps them close, so they don’t post or make content against him. By doing these meetings, he slowly creates a soft corner in their mind and heart. So later, when Gagan messes up, they hesitate to criticize him because they’ve met him personally and think, “He’s a good guy.”  This is also how Gagan has managed to influence journalists across different media houses. Not all of them are in his inner circle, but he subtly shapes how they think. He invites them, talks to them, and slowly pushes the narratives he wants—who’s bad, what’s bad, and how to counter certain people.  The social media ban happened when Congress was in government, right? He won’t openly say, “Support me” or “Make things favor me,” but indirectly he keeps planting ideas like, I’m the only one who can fix this, and stuff like that.  This is a very familiar pattern with Gagan Thapa. First, influencers like these create noise online, and once it starts getting attention, he jumps in and talks about the issue as if he really cares. If he genuinely cared about social media, he could’ve spoken up against the social media ban when Congress was in power.  Even during the Gen Z protest, he subtly planted leaders like Tanuja and Rakshya Bam through his media outlet, Setopati. Their interviews were pushed again and again, filling the feed with news about what Rakshya and Tanuja were saying. Slowly, that turned into posts supporting Gagan Thapa. In the end, neutral and unaware people start feeling like, oh, Gagan is the hero we were looking for, just because these figures they follow are also backing him.  Ask him if he made any contents on Gagan Thapa?  \\- Did he made video when Congress tried to sneak in a loophole in the cooling period? What happened to Khatiwada then after?  \\- Did he made how gagan thapa surviving without doing a single job?  \\- When Congress/UML tried to pass 5 years corruption expiry bill.  \\- Even to debunk PACT corruption where Gagan Thapa was alleged, even to debunk the allegation. (he wont, cz truth or not, many will know about this case and will have -ve perception of Gagan)  \\- Why is he surrounded and hangs out with Goons?  \\- Why WikiLeaks has Gagan Thapa as key embassy contact?  No, he won’t do that, because he’ll always have a soft corner for Gagan Thapa. That’s how Gagan Thapa works he spreads narratives through influencers like him, who knowingly or unknowingly end up producing such content.  Another example is Gagan doing small meetings on “populism” and then letting influencers create content around that topic to “spread awareness.” For influencers, it looks like he’s thinking about the nation. But from Gagan’s point of view, he knows those influencers will create content that ends up being subtly targeted at new faces.",

I thought he had a very balanced views and used to follow his contents.|||This video is being pushed with a really misleading narrative.   Binayak Kuikel wasn’t part of any “core” or secret meeting of Gagan Thapa.  This happened when the Social Media Bill was being discussed. Influencers and digital stakeholders were openly invited to share their views. It was a public consultation, not some behind-the-scenes planning session. Some of those inputs were later reflected in changes to the bill, which is exactly how participatory policymaking is supposed to work.  Calling this “propaganda coordination” by cutting out all context is misleading. Criticize policies, question leaders, that’s fair. But pushing edited clips with false framing only lowers the quality of political discussion.  Before reacting to viral videos, shouldn’t we first ask what the full context is and who actually benefits when it’s removed?|||Tei vayera raixa ajkaal anti balen kura garne    tallu le chance payo aba garxa  Gagan ra unka supporters ni rsp kei kura copy garne pheri rsp lai nai populist vanne?

It wasn’t a secret or “core” meeting. It was an open discussion during the Social Media Bill talks, where influencers and stakeholders were invited to share their views.  Turning that into a propaganda story just to fit a narrative is misleading. Pages like Nepal of Routine Banda often do the same with Balen Shah—presenting him as a lone Robin Hood fighting the system, where everything else is shown as conspiracy or sabotage.  Real governance isn’t that simple. Cities aren’t run by heroes alone, and democracy doesn’t work when context is removed for clicks. If Balen is the leader people are looking for, his work should be judged with facts and honesty, not viral clips and emotional framing.  Before reacting, shouldn’t we slow down and ask what actually happened and why this narrative is being pushed?|||Spread the word, gang.

The feeling of lying in the bed with inherent thoughts of disperse happiness and the want to be able to understand if that happiness is as true as it seems is not new and it's also not wholly mine   I look at all these motion picture hoping to find something. And what that might be is as ananomus to me as it is to you. I look at these things, listen as they talk, but the existence of this feeling of watching doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm lying on this virgin earth, unmolested and untouched, devoid of any feeling of any sort except for one; consciousness. The consciousness reigns supreme within and without all within the vicinity of my existence.  At this point, life as you call it feels not a moments passing by or time flowing like my thoughts.  My head feels particularly heavy, as if I'm thinking but a thought is yet to process. But how can this be? Without a thought, how can you think? How can one live, without knowing the value of death? But that's not right either. For one to know the value of death,.one must first know of its qualities, it's feature in all it's dimensions. The inherent idea of a thought being, and to think not sounds stupid as if not funny enough. But you can't overlook the idea behind such ponder.   I take very long breaths as I think. My heart beats loud enough for me to hear it. And all my bodily functions seems very much obvious to me. This isn't new but it's not wholly mine.   Ahh now my head hurts a little to. But this shall too pass.   Theres this lingering feeling of solitude that I feel very sensationally. For solitude has been my friend far longer then any. The silence that made me feel alone after some years felt not pleasing but good enough to make me feel a bit stingy if it got disturbed.  But now this solitude engulfs me, strangles me so that I choke these thoughts out of me which are yet to be. But it was this very solitude that made me form a thought but now it want it back. Like how death waits right Infront of you, lingers above you with it's hands around neck, and then takes you through the stairs of lifelessness while you climb oblivious. Similar is the solitude that I experience right now, but instead of lifelessness, I climb and climb but towards nothing, I climb and climb but climb on empty thoughts.

We skipped the formal lectures and kept things simple—just hands-on demos and honest conversations. The goal wasn’t to teach a full curriculum in an afternoon; it was to show these kids that technology isn't out of reach.  As a student-led initiative, we don't have a big corporate engine behind us. We’re just a group of peers showing up and leading where we can. This reel captures some of the curiosity we saw that day—it’s a small start, but a meaningful one.

Ofc sapna bokechau hola voliparsi kehi garni and u gotta work hard. But dont push yourself too hard , enjoy your life a little . Your life wont end due to a damn exam there is much more to do in life. Aba parents haru ta karai rahanchan . What even can we do lol? Ani btw you are pretty damn good in maths . You will improve in other subjects too . Dont stress out|||I am in 12 now. 11 ko first term was best for me all 60 above (except that damn physics) chem ma ta 64 aathyo but i didn't think that much and tried to do good in physics.   2nd term ma physics ma 49 aayo but chemistry ma 45 that drop of 19 marks made my mental health go blind. I gave up on chemistry and physics, I didn't even want to study these two anymore tara after 3rd term 11 final 12 pre term, finally 12 ko 1st term ma physics and chem ma 52 and 53 aathyo respectively. I was satisfied enough. Ani 2nd term ma ahile physics dhostai xa, chem chain tight teacher parexa k huni ho thaxaina.   So to explain what happened here: 1. Course ko amount badhepaxi the marks drastically drop as you and I both faced.  2. The amount of stuff you have to remember is always more than you remember.  3. For mcq and reasoning questions you must read books cuz teachers don't cover everything.  At last, 11 doesn't matter that much as marks and grades, 11 class is just about the memories you build that 12 might not give you.  You look like a study kinda guy so you might have friends like that too, so i am telling you the reality here. The friends you have might not have that chill attitude later in 12th so enjoy the memories you are building cuz in 12 everyone around you will suddenly start focusing on studying and you might fall behind so 12 ma jani bittikai start learning concepts especially physics ko.   Tips for you in 11  1. Grab any opportunity you have become CR club member Host of program sing or whatever you are good at cuz you will be remembered by that more. Also being a CR or club member will benefit your bidesh ko lagi.  2. Try understanding concepts of everything. Science is all about logic if you don't understand the logic behind it you can't understand the science behind it.  3. Feel free to ask to teachers, they are not your enemies. Friends might suppress your curiosity but it doesn't mean teachers won't listen to you. Concepts bujhdainau bhane teachers lai gayera sodha If you are shy to ask them in public. Go to the teachers in the staff room or meet them in the corridor, hallways and question them. Doing this, some of your friends might call you teacher ko chatne or something like that ignore them cuz you are the one who is gonna stand in that interview after 12th not them.  4. Chill.  Tips for 12 Doing 1 will help you be a face that everyone recognizes in 12. If you don't do 1 you might regret it in 12 so go for it.  Keep doing 2 and 3. After a few months into 12, you will realize that its all about what you understand. If you can understand the concept you will remember the formulae. Like physics ko nai kura garda, concept bujhexa bhane timle mathematically k garne yaad hunxa tespaxi dimaag ma or paper mai tyo derive garera formula lekhna sakxau.
