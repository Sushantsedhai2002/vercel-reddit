They claim the leadership‚Äôs ‚Äústand down‚Äù order led to chaos, loss of lives, and the breakdown of national security.  The complaint says over 1,500 weapons and 90,000 rounds of ammunition were lost to mobs during the unrest.  Allegations also link AIGP Karki to helping Rabi Lamichhane escape custody with political backing.  The officers have demanded a special investigation, suspension, and criminal action against those responsible.  Protesters and citizens are calling it the first internal revolt inside Nepal Police in decades.  The issue is now before a high-level commission in Kathmandu for further investigation.",

            "body": "**Namaste everyone,**  I'm 16, from Rautahat - yes, that district everyone jokes about for illiteracy and underdevelopment. I'm Madhesi, Muslim by birth (though I don't really practice - I'm more rationalist/agnostic), and I have what might sound like a crazy dream: **I want to be Nepal's Prime Minister.**  Before you laugh or close this tab, hear me out.    # Who Am I?  I'm just a kid who refuses to give up on Nepal. My family, relatives, even I myself until a year ago thought: \"This country is for losers. Just study abroad, get PR, and forget this place.\" But my heart couldn't accept it.  I was born in the most backward part of Nepal. Hill elites don't see us Madhesis as \"real Nepalis.\" Muslims are less than 5% of the population. I'm probably the most \"un-prime-ministerable\" person you can imagine. But I don't care about that anymore.  I'm tired of seeing Nepal stuck while our neighbors move forward. I'm tired of corruption eating our future. I'm tired of smart Nepali youth feeling like they have to leave to have a good life.  **I want to be the Lee Kuan Yew of Nepal. The Deng Xiaoping of Nepal. The Barack Obama of Nepal.**  And I'm not just dreaming - I'm preparing. I'm going to study development economics (bachelor's and master's). I'm going to learn from every country that went from poor to rich. And one day, I'm going to lead Nepal to become a developed nation. The Gen Z revolution gave me hope.    # My Vision: Nepal 2065  **Simple question: Can Nepal become a developed, prosperous nation in 40 years?**  **My answer: YES. Absolutely yes.**  Here's my plan - **8 Pillars of Development**. I'll keep it short because this is already getting long:    # PILLAR 1: EDUCATION - Make Every Nepali Skilled  **The Problem:**  * Government schools are so bad that even poor families sacrifice everything for private schools * Teachers are underpaid and unmotivated * Rote learning, no critical thinking * English weak (we can't compete globally)  **My Solution:**  * **Pay teachers like professionals** (NPR 60,000-150,000/month based on experience) * **Make teaching prestigious** \\- only top 20% of graduates can become teachers * **English-medium education** (but keep strong Nepali language and culture classes) * **World-class facilities** \\- labs, computers, sports, arts in EVERY school * **Free quality education** K-12, so 90-95% of kids go to government schools (not private) * **Schools open 12-14 hours/day** \\- free homework help, clubs, sports after regular classes * **AI-powered personalized learning** \\- every student learns at their own pace  **Timeline:** 10 years to transform 50% of schools, 20 years for all schools world-class  **Cost:** \\~$300-400 billion over 30 years (sounds huge but totally doable with growing economy)  **Result:** By 2050, every Nepali kid gets education as good as Singapore or Finland. We become the most educated country in South Asia.    # PILLAR 2: INFRASTRUCTURE - Connect Every Part of Nepal  **The Problem:**  * Roads are terrible (takes 2 days to reach places that should be 8 hours) * Electricity cuts (though better now) * Rural areas isolated * Kathmandu traffic nightmare  **My Solution:**  **Roads:**  * Upgrade East-West Highway to 4-6 lane international standard * Build 10-15 North-South corridors (connect Terai to hills to mountains) * Every village connected with all-weather roads * **Investment:** $45-65 billion over 25 years  **Railways:**  * Terai railway connecting major cities (compatible with India) * Hill railways to Kathmandu, Pokhara (expensive but necessary) * **Investment:** $40-80 billion over 40 years * *(No bullet trains - too expensive for mountains, but modern 120-160 km/h trains? Yes!)*  **Electricity - Our BIGGEST Advantage:**  * Nepal can produce 40,000+ MW of hydropower * **Plan:** Build massive hydro projects, produce way more than we need * **Export to India, Bangladesh, Pakistan** \\- earn $20-30 billion/year * Cheap electricity attracts factories, industries * **Investment:** $40-65 billion * **Return:** $200-300 billion over time - **this pays for everything else!**  **Urban Transit:**  * Kathmandu Metro (4-6 lines) * Modern bus systems in all major cities * **End traffic hell**  **Internet:**  * High-speed fiber optic everywhere * 100 Mbps internet in every village by 2035 * Enable remote work, online businesses  **Total Infrastructure Investment:** $160-270 billion over 40 years    # PILLAR 3: ECONOMIC POLICY - Create Jobs and Wealth  **The Problem:**  * Too dependent on agriculture (60% of people, only 25% of economy) * Almost no manufacturing * Youth have no jobs * Everyone wants to go abroad  **My Solution:**  **Phase 1 (Years 1-10): Light Manufacturing**  * Textiles and garments (like Bangladesh) - **500,000-1 million jobs** * Food processing (tea, spices, dairy) - **200,000-300,000 jobs** * Construction materials - **150,000-250,000 jobs** * Target: $15-20 billion exports  **Phase 2 (Years 10-25): Heavy Industry**  * **Aluminum smelting** using cheap hydropower (like Iceland) - **huge export potential** * Steel production * Electronics assembly (like Vietnam) - **300,000-500,000 jobs** * Pharmaceuticals * Target: $50-80 billion exports  **Phase 3 (Years 25-40): High-Tech Economy**  * IT services (like India's BPO) - **500,000-1 million high-paying jobs** * AI and software development * Financial services hub * Advanced manufacturing * Target: $150-250 billion exports  **Special Economic Zones:**  * Create 8-12 SEZs with tax breaks, ready infrastructure * Attract foreign investment * Make it EASY to do business (start company in 1-2 days, not 6 months)  **Support Small Businesses:**  * Cheap loans (3-5% interest) * Business training and mentorship * Remove bureaucratic barriers  **Target:** By 2065, Nepal exports $500 billion - 1 trillion worth of goods and services    # PILLAR 4: GOVERNANCE - End Corruption, Make Government Work  **The Problem (We All Know This):**  * Massive corruption at every level * Nothing gets done without bribes * Politicians care about power, not people * Bureaucracy is nightmare  **My Solution - Learn from Singapore:**  **Zero Tolerance for Corruption:**  * Pay government officials WELL (so they don't need bribes)    * Ministers: $200K-300K/year    * Senior civil servants: $100K-150K/year * But **HARSH punishment** for corruption:    * Minimum 10 years jail    * Take all their stolen money + more    * Lifetime ban from public service    * Publicize their names (shame them) * **Independent anti-corruption commission** with real power * Fast-track corruption courts (decide cases in 6-12 months)  **Transparency:**  * Every rupee of government spending online, trackable * All government tenders open and transparent * Officials must declare assets publicly every year  **Meritocracy:**  * Hire best people, not party members or relatives * Tough exams for civil service (like IAS but tougher) * Promote based on performance, not seniority * Fire people who don't perform  **Digital Government:**  * 90% of government services online * Get licenses, permits in hours, not months * No need to visit offices and bribe officials  **This is CRITICAL - without this, everything else fails**    # PILLAR 5: HEALTHCARE - Healthy People, Productive Nation  **The Problem:**  * Government hospitals terrible * Healthcare expensive * Rural areas have almost nothing * People die from preventable diseases  **My Solution:**  **Three-Tier System:**  * **Health centers:** One per 5,000-10,000 people (basic care, vaccinations, maternal health) * **District hospitals:** 100-120 modern hospitals across Nepal (surgery, emergency, specialists) * **Major medical centers:** 8-12 world-class hospitals (advanced treatments, teaching, research)  **Universal Health Insurance:**  * Everyone covered from birth * Poor: 100% government paid * Middle class: Subsidized * Rich: Pay themselves * **No one goes bankrupt from medical bills**  **Train More Doctors:**  * Need 60,000-80,000 doctors by 2040 (currently have \\~30,000) * Expand medical schools * Pay doctors well so they don't leave for abroad  **Use AI/Technology:**  * AI diagnosis in every health center (even villages get expert-level care) * Telemedicine (video call with specialists) * Electronic health records  **Investment:** $100-150 billion over 30 years  **Result:** Life expectancy goes from 70 to 83-85 years. Everyone gets world-class healthcare regardless of wealth.    # PILLAR 6: AGRICULTURE - Modernize and Prosper  **The Problem:**  * Farming is still medieval (manual labor, low productivity) * Farmers are poor despite working hard * Young people don't want to farm  **My Solution:**  **Modernize:**  * Tractors, harvesters, modern equipment (subsidized) * Irrigation everywhere (80-90% irrigated by 2040) * Hybrid seeds, proper fertilizers, training * Result: **Productivity increases 3-5x, farmers earn well**  **High-Value Crops:**  * Premium tea and coffee (marketed as \"Himalayan\") * Organic fruits and vegetables (off-season for India) * Spices (cardamom, ginger, turmeric) * Medicinal plants * Export to India, China, Europe, Gulf  **Only 10-15% in agriculture by 2065, but they're prosperous** (like US farmers - few but rich)  **Investment:** $17-27 billion over 30 years    # PILLAR 7: TOURISM - Our Natural Goldmine  **Current:** \\~1 million tourists, $2 billion revenue  **Potential:** 8-12 million tourists, $35-50 billion revenue  **How:**  * Better airports (Kathmandu, Pokhara, Lumbini, plus new ones) * Good roads to tourist destinations * Range of hotels (budget to luxury) * Safety and cleanliness * Promote beyond trekking:    * Lumbini (Buddhist pilgrimage - huge potential)    * Cultural heritage    * Adventure sports    * Wellness/yoga retreats    * MICE (conferences, business events)  **Marketing:** Spend $200-500 million/year promoting Nepal (like Thailand does)  **Investment:** $13-26 billion over 30 years  **Result:** Tourism becomes massive foreign exchange earner, creates 2-2.5 million jobs    # PILLAR 8: SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT - Inclusive, Equal Society  **The Problem:**  * Inequality (rich-poor gap, regional disparities) * Discrimination (against Madhesis, Dalits, women, minorities) * Brain drain (educated youth leaving) * Social tension  **My Solution:**  **Equal Opportunity:**  * Education and healthcare free for all (no advantage from wealth) * Merit-based system everywhere * Special programs for historically disadvantaged groups (temporary) * All regions developed (not just Kathmandu)  **Gender Equality:**  * Equal pay enforced * Maternity leave (6-12 months paid) * Universal childcare (so women can work) * Safety and protection laws enforced  **Pension and Social Security:**  * Everyone 65+ gets pension ($100-150/month minimum) * Unemployment insurance * Disability support  **Stop Brain Drain:**  * Create opportunities at home (good jobs, good life) * Pay competitively (can't match US but reasonable) * Make Nepal attractive to live in * Engage diaspora (bring back their expertise and money)  **National Identity:**  * Nepali identity that includes everyone (Madhesi, Pahadi, Dalit, Janajati - all equally Nepali) * Respect diversity but build common purpose * Federal system works (provinces have power)    # THE BIG PICTURE: Nepal 2065  **If we do all this:**  **Economy:**  * GDP: $3-4 Trillion (from $40 billion today) * Per capita: $75,000-100,000 (from $1,350 today) * **Rich, developed nation - on par with South Korea, Poland**  **Quality of Life:**  * Life expectancy: 83-85 years * Everyone educated to university level * Everyone has comfortable home, good job, healthcare * Clean environment, modern cities, connected villages * Low crime, stable democracy, respected globally  **Global Standing:**  * Top 20-25 economy in the world * Regional leader (South Asia's success story) * Respected for renewable energy, education, sustainable development  **Most importantly:** Every Nepali child has opportunity to reach their potential. No more \"I have to leave Nepal to succeed.\"    # THE CATCH: Population & Technology Challenges  **Warning from Japan/South Korea:** When countries develop, birth rates collapse. Korea now has 0.72 children per woman - population will halve! Aging society, economic stagnation.  **Nepal must avoid this:**  * Support families (generous parental leave, free childcare, child allowances) * Make having kids compatible with career (especially for women) * Keep fertility at 2.0-2.1 (stable population, not shrinking) * Use AI/technology to maintain productivity even with older population  **Technology opportunities:**  * **AI in education:** Every student has personal AI tutor (learn at own pace, reach remote villages) * **AI in healthcare:** Expert diagnosis in every village health post * **AI in agriculture:** 3x productivity with precision farming * **AI in government:** Automated services, no corruption opportunities * Nepal can LEAPFROG - skip old technology, go straight to cutting-edge    # THE COST & FUNDING  **Total investment needed:** $870 billion - 1.35 trillion over 40 years  **Sounds impossible? It's not. Here's how:**  * **Government budget:** 40% (from growing tax base as economy grows) * **Private investment:** 30% (domestic and foreign) * **International loans:** 20% (World Bank, ADB - cheap long-term loans) * **Hydropower revenue:** Pays for itself + generates surplus ($20-30B/year exports)  **The math works. South Korea, Singapore, China did similar investments. Nepal can too.**    # THE REAL QUESTION  **Can Nepal really do this?**  **Historically, YES:**  * South Korea: $100 per person (1960) ‚Üí $35,000+ (2020) in 60 years * Singapore: Poor city-state (1965) ‚Üí $65,000+ per person (2020) in 55 years * China: $200 per person (1980) ‚Üí $12,000+ (2020) in 40 years * Estonia: Soviet legacy (1991) ‚Üí $28,000+ (2020) in 29 years  **What they had in common:**  * Long-term vision * Investment in education * Good governance (low corruption) * Strategic economic policy * Sustained effort over decades  **Nepal has everything needed:**  * Natural resources (hydropower, tourism) * Strategic location (between India and China) * Young population (demographic advantage NOW) * Democracy (legitimate government) * Can learn from others' successes and mistakes * Technology available to leapfrog  **What's missing? Political will and execution.**    # MY COMMITMENT  I'm 16 now. I'll be 26 in 2034. I'll be 46 in 2054. I'll be 56 in 2065.  **My plan:**  1. **2025-2029:** Complete high school, go to best university for development economics 2. **2029-2035:** Bachelor's and Master's in Development Economics, study successful transformations 3. **2035-2045:** Work in development (World Bank, ADB, or Nepal Planning Commission) - gain experience 4. **2045:** Enter politics seriously (I'll be 35-36, eligible for PM) 5. **2045-2065:** Lead Nepal's transformation (ideally as PM, or in other leadership roles)  **I'm not just dreaming. I'm preparing.**  And here's the thing - **I don't need to be PM to start this**. This vision needs thousands of committed people - in government, business, education, civil society. If you believe in this vision, YOU can contribute too.    # THE FINAL QUESTION (The One That Matters)  **Would you accept a Madhesi Muslim as your Prime Minister?**  I'm not asking you to vote for me now - I'm 16, that would be weird.  I'm asking: **If someone from Rautahat, someone Madhesi, someone from a Muslim family (even though I'm not religious), came to you in 20-30 years with this vision, this plan, this commitment - would you give them a chance?**  Or would you say: \"No, PM must be Bahun/Chhetri from Kathmandu hills\"?  Because honestly, that's what I'm most afraid of. Not that the plan is hard (it is, but doable). Not that it costs too much (it's affordable). Not that Nepal can't do it (we absolutely can).  **I'm afraid that Nepal will reject good leadership because of caste, ethnicity, religion.**  I want to believe we're better than that. Gen Z is showing we can be better than that.  So tell me honestly:  **Would you accept a PM who is:**  * Madhesi (from Terai, not hills) * Muslim by birth (though rationalist/agnostic in belief) * From Rautahat (most backward district) * But has the vision, knowledge, and commitment to make Nepal developed?  **Or would you prefer:**  * Traditional hill elite * \"Right\" caste and religion * From \"right\" family * But continuing same old politics that kept us poor for 70 years?    # Why I'm Posting This  I know I sound crazy. I know I'm just a kid. I know the odds are against me.  But someone has to say this. Someone has to have the audacity to dream that Nepal can be great. Someone from Rautahat, someone Madhesi, someone Muslim has to stand up and say: **\"I refuse to accept that we're destined to be poor. I refuse to accept that I have to leave Nepal to succeed. I refuse to accept that my identity disqualifies me from serving my nation.\"**  If you think this vision is stupid, tell me why (genuinely - I want to learn).  If you think it's impossible, show me what I'm missing.  If you think someone like me can never be PM because of where I'm from, at least be honest about it.  But if you think - even a little bit - that this could work, that Nepal deserves better, that maybe, just maybe, we should judge leaders by their vision and ability rather than their last name and birthplace...  **Then let's start a conversation.**  Because real change doesn't start in Singha Durbar. It starts in conversations like this.    **‡§ß‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§¶ for reading this essay. I know it's long. But Nepal's future is worth a long post.**  **Would you accept a Madhesi Muslim PM? Would you accept THIS vision for Nepal?**  **Let's discuss. ‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§ï‡§®‡•ç ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä (Truth and righteousness) - that's what Nepal needs, regardless of who brings it.**    *P.S. - To those who'll say \"just another kid dreaming, will forget in 2 years\": Maybe. But every leader who transformed their nation started by dreaming when young. Lee Kuan Yew was 35 when he became PM. Obama was community organizer in his 20s. Balen was just engineer before he became mayor. You have to dream before you can build.*  *P.P.S. - Yes, I know $3-4 trillion sounds insane when we're at $40 billion now. But Korea went from $4 billion to $1.6 trillion (400x) in 60 years. Nepal going from $40B to $3T (75x) in 40 years with modern technology? Actually conservative.*  *P.P.P.S. - If you're from Rautahat or Madhesi community or any minority - this post is especially for you. Don't let anyone tell you that you don't belong in Nepal's future. We belong just as much as anyone else. Maybe even more, because we know what it's like to be left behind.*      **What do you think?)**",

But it gets super annoying when the people planting the stuff get all emotionally attached to the land and act as if it‚Äôs their own property.   There‚Äôs a piece of property right next to my house and an uncle from a house down the road has been using it as his garden. He spends his time there from 6 am - 9:30 am and from 2:30- 6 pm.  It‚Äôs about 1 ghatta land and he acts as if he owns it. He gets annoyed if we park our vehicles in front of it - because he has planted flowers all around the border. He gets annoyed if we do anything near it. He gets annoyed if I walk my dog past it.  It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre driving inside his garden and parking the bike on top of his cabbages or whatever, it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre letting our dog dig out his precious flowers.   I‚Äôve been carrying my 6-7 kg dog whenever I walk past his garden just to stop annoying him.   The thing is, the property is right next to our house not his. And he gets all cranky.

            "body": "Following the dramatic events of the Gen Z Revolution that forced his resignation, K.P. Sharma Oli's immediate political focus has crystallized into one core objective: securing his survival and consolidating his power base for the next round of political conflict.  His strategy flows along three main channels:  1. The Blame Game and National Defender Stance: Oli is working hard to control the national story. He smoothly dismisses the massive anti-corruption protests as not being genuine, claiming they were \"hijacked by conspirators\" - a neat way to shift the blame from his government's failings to a vague, nefarious plot. By warning that the nation's sovereignty is under \"major attack,\" he seeks to instantly transform himself from a deposed leader into the unwavering protector of the country and its constitution, a move designed to rally traditional and nationalist sentiment back to his side. May be it was hijacked, but Oli is definitely the prime instigator, not the victim.   2. Clinging to the Party Chair: This is where things get truly tense. Despite losing the Prime Minister‚Äôs office, Oli is utterly determined to keep his title as Chairman of the CPN-UML. This persistence is extraordinary because he is facing a significant, high-profile rebellion: several prominent, senior leaders within the party-including Vice-Chairs and Secretaries-are now openly calling for him to step down. Even as reports suggest he may have lost the support of the top decision-making bodies, Oli simply refuses to budge. He is currently meeting with loyalists and leveraging his institutional power to silence this dissent, believing that his departure would cause the party to fracture, and thus, \"there is no alternative\" to him. But already his opinions are echoed only by his few loyalists (gundas of gundu). His influence is slipping and he is shouting louder.   3. Undermining the New Regime: Finally, he is systematically working to delegitimize the new interim government. By labeling it as one born from \"chaos\" and potentially serving \"foreign interests,\" he attempts to inject doubt into the public's mind about its legality and motives. This prevents the new administration from achieving stability, keeps the political climate unstable, and allows Oli to perpetually hover as the only experienced alternative, ready to step back in should the situation allow.  In essence, every move Oli makes is geared toward externalizing fault and internally consolidating authority, ensuring that even out of office, he remains the most indispensable (and disruptive) force in Nepali politics.",

IT/Engineering is one of those fields where its relatively easy to find such remote roles. But degreee nai huna parxa vane xaina usually.  If I had to advise myself, +2 sakera US / EU jaau vanthey. Could have got bigger exposure early on, but things could have not worked as well. Teti bela mbbs/engg nai sabai ho jasto lagthyo, but world is much bigger than that.   Generic suggestion would be to go abroad if family/finance permits. If Nepal mai garne ho vane, can speak for Computer Engineering. Highly Saturated xa, lots of engineers and IT graduates. Have to be good at what you do and reaching out, but highly rewarding. Have friends earning upto 15K dollars per month, Nepal basera.|||B.Sc. Nursing. Maile baki kei padhina‚ù§Ô∏è",

I no longer use Wordlink, but the router still works fine ‚Äî except it‚Äôs completely locked down.  When I access its IP, I only see a status/information page. There‚Äôs no login prompt at all, and I can‚Äôt change passwords, SSID, or any settings. It looks like Wordlink has installed their own custom firmware.  Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve tried so far: - Default logins like admin/admin, admin/1234, root/root ‚Äî none worked. - Hidden paths such as `/admin`, `/engineer.html`, `/userRpm/LoginRpm.htm` ‚Äî still no luck. - Factory reset with the reset button ‚Äî didn‚Äôt unlock anything. - Checked for Nokia firmware online ‚Äî found only G-2425G or G-1425G models, not G-0425G-B.  So I‚Äôm wondering: - Has anyone successfully gained admin access to this exact model (G-0425G-B)? - Are there known hidden URLs, default credentials, or engineer logins for it? - Is there any way to flash or restore the *original Nokia firmware* (not the Wordlink-locked one)? - Or should I just use this as an ONT and connect my own router behind it?  If you‚Äôve done this before (even with a similar Nokia GPON router), please share the steps, any firmware files, or recovery tips.   You can DM me too if you prefer not to post publicly.

            "body": "Yesterday, I received what seemed like a great opportunity. A nonprofit reached out saying I'd be a perfect fit for their full stack role. My previous colleagues vouched for me, and everything felt right.  Then came the reality check.  They couldn't figure out how to send payments to Nepal. Something about international payment systems, tax handling, and complications I honestly didn't fully understand. The conversation ended there.  I'm 18 and actively looking for frontend roles. I've got the skills and the drive, but I'm clearly missing something important about how remote work actually works from Nepal.  Here's what I'm trying to figure out:  How do you handle international payments when companies can't use standard methods? What platforms or workarounds do Nepali developers use? Are there specific things I should know about taxes and compliance? Should I only target certain types of companies that can handle these complications?  If you're from Nepal and working remotely for international companies, I'd really appreciate hearing how you navigated this. What do you wish someone had told you when you were starting out?  I don't want to miss the next opportunity because of something I could have prepared for.  Open to connecting with anyone who's been through this or has advice to share.",

Reasonable: You are getting paid directly to your bank with a nominal transfer fee. 2. Legal: Bank will deduct 5% tax as per government rule 3. Scalable: This action is repeatable month-after-month regardless of amount.  If you're doing any third party systems, like Wise, you lose on three fronts:   A. Wise cuts a transfer commission   B. The amount needs to be converted to NPR before sending and costs money   C. Depositing in Nepali bank has another processing fee in rupees  So this is not a good way to receive salary every month. See how much money you're losing even before paying a single rupee in tax amount.  Some companies do have issues setting up complex arrangements for just one person. I say this because I am the only Nepali person there. Everyone, including Indians are cool with receiving salaries in crypto, Wise wallet or other forms that do not work in Nepal.  The finance team in Dublin, Ireland was extremely helpful and they corresponded directly to the folks at Nabil Bank here and got my salary account set up. I just had to do some signatures and IDs and that's all.

If you want to pay taxes, just inform the bank.|||Its really easy to send money from abroad to Nepal.   I have done it multiple times when employing full stack developers.|||SWIFT. Go them your ac details and swift code of the bank|||Use wise or open foreign deposit account in laxmi, himalayan, nabil. Its easy. They also handle tax for you.|||That shouldn't even have been a problem. Essentially, they won't file taxes for Your salary in US. You'll have a w8 or sth like a form to fill up. If they commission the salary on bank account then they should have no problem of wiring it straight to your bank account. They'd send you invoice and use that Invoice to show the bank in Nepal as proof of your income and you can setup that recurring payment as your employment payment and bank'll deduce 5% on each transaction from that party, hence your tax payment for Nepal government.  Ask or search for your Bank's SWIFT code and provide necessary documents, that should suffice for international payment afaik.  Edit : unconventional payment should involve third party transaction. Paypal & payoneer work but payoneer is very unreliable. If everything works, no problem but to resolve ANY problem with payoneer is a nightmare. Skrill (I haven't used it) could be an alternative. You could use someone trusted who's abroad to use their paypal. But due to multiple transaction, multiple person's involvement & its extra fees I won't recommend it.|||Ppl saying swift so easily, clients won‚Äôt easily do swift transfer it costs more than wise, remitly or whatever that payoneer is.|||Deel works fine.|||Use bank Bro!

Much like his followers, he does possess \"Desh banauna gaaro chaina\" which infact is actually very very hard. He does not understand society, diplomacy and inherent nuances/dichotomy of public life and service.

Because there was no one to guide me, i failed this year's neb board.   so from someone who learned from his own experience, my best advice is that you don't depend only on teachers from your school. there are tons of videos on youtube and tons of notes and  straight up answers in the internet.   if you do not understand and get anything at all, then only focus on the questions that are asked many times or repeated i.e only imp questions.   you have to make sure that you atleast passing marks, so look focus on the chapters you understand and master them first then only focus on others.   You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

Even after taking reexam on both, i don't think i will pass. because of me failing on my exams, my mother and entire relatives blame me that i didn't try hard enough, didn't study and other similar things. my mother calls me a faliure, that i destroyed her dreams and i brought her nothing but pain etc etc.       i tried , i tried to focus on class, watched youtube, searched notes, asked the topper friends what they did at home and studied. heck, because of that tension and stress my hair started falling out, at age 17.    i was not even a bad student before. i even got A on SEE.       when choosing what to study, my friends choose management, but following the WISHES of my family and relatives, i choose science. after a week, i told her that i find science hard but she said just \"**The admission money is already paid and is only half can be refunded**\" totaL was 20,000+ BOOKS. and i failed again and again and again.    and still to this day, she screams and brings up my results in every argument and uses me as a example infront of my sister everyday.  now, she has said \" **if you fail again, then go get a room away from home and do what you want or study again from class 11 in management from the start\".**  now, i don't want to get out of my house without proper source of income. i can do every single house work and can even cook nearly everything , no problem if i start living alone. but it will be problem with no money or limited money.  and i would rather die than study and take that tension for another two years again. my mind is already way too damaged from that.  so, if i fail is there a course that i can get in techical line or something. like i heard that there are courses (18 months - 3 years ) that one can complete and start working , even if only SEE passed.    so , if there is any course that exists, please tell me.",

In this process they completely ignore their career and progress, they don't focus on their studies, skills, get distant from their family, they don't care anything but their love. which is bullshit  I'm not against teenage love, but it feels that it is doing more harm than good. Youths don't simply understand how to take it through, how to continue it accordingly and progressively.   Take it as  you wish, this was all my observation and inference. Rest is up to you, how you take it.",

            "comments": "Can agree.   Most boys think that having a chick makes them cool and reach the top of their ego. Some boy casually talks with her? Gang fight leading to some serious consequence. They'll be spending crazy amount of parent money on cafes and dates and shit. Girls also be flocking towards the jhyaple bad boy type. Both sides will have attachment-less fun for some months and proceed to the next like no big deal.  My own classmates used to change bf like changing clothes. One was stupid enough to send her bf n-des and the whole school got hold of it, just imagine the trauma it will give her in future. Everyone doing whatever the fk it is in the same of true love which changes every few month.      Being a serious guy with some goals in mind used to be the black sheep, still is in colleges. I used to get kinda bullied and the odd one just cuz I didn't have a chick and I didn't goto the cafes and inhale some expensive flavoured shit lmao. (not the reason im attacking this topic tho). Yea the vape, hookah and drugs are yet another story.|||Hello u/No-Iron3588, thank you for contributing to r/NepalPlusTwo.

So its simple man a big country in size doesn't mean big population because the more than half the country might only be freaking forest and stuff. And I think in Mongolia all the people live in like 1% of the land.|||Wait till you hear about Bangladesh|||Well Australia is 6 times bigger than Peru, yet has a smaller population than peru.|||India has 1.5 billion Bangladesh 170million. So Nepal population is low for the region but Almost 40%water in the ganges basin also comes from Nepal. This basin supports 600million people. Which is more than the population of south America. Nepal has also not suffered colonization like in Peru where most native populations died after contact with Europeans.|||My question is, how do only 34 million people live in such a huge country.|||Nepal is 71st in this list  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_countries\\_and\\_dependencies\\_by\\_population\\_density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population_density)  Yes, many of them can hardly be considered countries, but that leaves at least 30 proper countries before nepal|||Bad example, another example is Nepal, is bigger than England in land mass, yet England has double the population.  you could argue how so few people live in Nepal from the example i gave.

History shows that the European contact vanished your almost 80% of the population due to the disease like Smallpox and measles and your population could not ever recover again unlike here in Nepal where we did not had any epidemic of such level which would wipe out almost 4/5th of the country's population. Our factor is liveable land if you see in N. America, the two countries Canada and USA are one of the biggest countries in the world, But USA has almost more than 10x population of Canada as most of the land is Canada is Tundra and life cannot flourish there.|||well maybe cuz people of Peru aren't spread out across the entire country??|||Favorable climate, fertile plains, and river systems enable multiple harvests a year.

This affectes every country in south Asia including Nepal. That's a problem we should solve. IT's gradually under control I guess.|||Google Bangladesh. And let me know if you found the answer|||Don‚Äôt look up bangladesh/australia. Nepal has average population density.|||Population in SE Asia seems to be quite high in general. I think regarding your question about where the population is concentrated, you will find that the population is scattered throughout the country - everywhere minus above 3000m up the himalayas. Then if you do a deep assessment what % of Perus Land actually has people vs % of Nepal where people reside, you may find the two land sizes may not be off by a magnitude like now when you compare the full size of the country. For eg UK has a landmass of 250k but has a population of 69 mil. That's 2x population of Peru in 1/5th of land. In the other hand australia has a population of 27mil in 7.7mil km2. Russia has 143mil people in 17mil km2 (4x Pop of Peru in 16x land area).  You are also looking at the mercader projection which further makes Nepal look more visually small in the map. Not that it should have any basis when you talk about numbers.   I suppose what I am trying to say is the population may still be high in Nepal but it may not be as high as you think when you factor in livable land in the country. Total land mass alone is not a great indicator.|||Fertile land, fertile people, most are on terai belt. Look at india and bangladesh, how densely populated they all are. Nepal's population comes from the region similar to them. I have no clue why peru has low population, maybe there isn't most habitable land. Like how russia is so massive but its population is low¬†|||If you know Peru, it's almost all mountainous terrain like a huge chunk of it is the Andes, and another chunk of it is the Amazon, with the rest being deserts where most people live.  Absolute extremes. The terrain absolutely messes things up.  Nepal ain't no heaven land but I would say the climate is very hospitable.|||Tokyo has 14 million people in 2,194 km ¬≤|||Such a great question. Most of the people are concentrated in the cities and in the low lands where theres lots of rivers and fertile land till 1990s people procreate and like crazy plus modern medicine less infant mortality and less knowledge of contraceptives. Also temperate climate.|||Time zones bro.|||Look at bangaldesh's area and population. You'll be shocked my guy|||The reported surface area of a country is always the 2D surface area. It calculated on a flat, two-dimensional plane, not by measuring the surface area of its mountains, hills, and valleys. The total land area of a country is determined by projecting its borders onto a standardized reference surface, typically an ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the Earth.      Nepal is roughly a \\~1000 km long, and 150 km wide and so the approximate area of 150 sq km.   Now if you count the mountains and valleys that covers like 70% of that 2D area, the actual habitable space is order of magnitide larger. maybe even 50x.   So the actual living space is quite a lot for mountainous country like Nepal. I would imagine same for Peru.|||You know about canada?|||You should have started with Bangladesh and it's population density.  Regardless, depends on how fertile and navigable the lands are.

While they may be *better* than others, the main point is that they can't survive against other parties' well-established forces if they don't have one of their own.  They simply can't sustain themselves against the cyber operations of the established parties.  Let me share an incident with you all. I'm friends with a current or former RSP Member of Parliament (*samsad*), and he literally invited me to like a specific Facebook page‚ÄîI think he did it by mistake. I checked out that page, and what I found was a newly created, fresh page named **\"Gen Z Sunsari.\"** That page is now continuously promoting Ravi Lamichhane and his colleagues.  Let me be clear: I support the RSP, and I think it's a **good thing** that they have a cyber sena. If they don't, they're cooked for sure. Oli, Deuba, and Prachanda all have massive cyber armies and huge amounts of money to distribute, often hidden away in the homes of various party workers (*karyakarta*).  The RSP needs to fight fire with fire to survive and thrive.But I think Facebook and tiktok is better place to let your sena attack then here|||RSP kids don't understand its about ideology not about a coward populist leader|||Not only them.

We worship daily, but divine care seems absent when it comes to national progress.  Temples often make headlines for thefts and misappropriation of funds, with some priests even selling sacred ornaments. If they truly fear God, why does this happen?  This is not limited to Hinduism; similar patterns exist across many religions.   It raises a question: is religion about faith, or has it become a tool to control and exploit the poor?  Interestingly, countries where many do not believe in God are often far more developed. Development is driven by people, not deities, yet the contrast is striking.

It is all scams. All man made religion and cult.  There are 33 Crore hindu gods.  Lots of Gods are forgotten already.   There is no possible way to count the number of forgotten gods because by their very nature, they have been lost to history.  However, we can explore the scale and reasons for this \"divine forgetting\" to understand just how vast that number must be. Think of it not as a number, but as an ocean compared to the few droplets of water that are the gods we still remember.  Here‚Äôs a breakdown of where these forgotten gods come from and why the number is essentially infinite:  1. Gods of Lost Cultures and Civilizations  For every major ancient civilization we know about (Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Mesopotamian), there were dozens, if not hundreds, of smaller cultures, tribes, and city-states that were absorbed, destroyed, or simply died out.  ¬∑ Example: The Canaanite pantheon is largely forgotten except for figures who appear in the Bible as villains or rivals. Where are the worshippers of Ba'al, Anat, or El today? Their stories are fragmentary. ¬∑ Scale: Across the Americas, Africa, Asia, and prehistoric Europe, countless tribes with their own unique spirits, creator gods, and deities vanished without a written record. Each tribe might have had a dozen or more significant divine figures. The collective number from this category alone is staggering.  2. Hyper-Local and Niche Deities  The ancient world was filled with gods who had very specific, limited portfolios.  ¬∑ Examples:   ¬∑ Roman Numina: These were minor spirits of specific places‚Äîthe god of a particular stream, a particular forest, a particular crossroads, or even the god of your household's front door (Cardea) or the pantry (Penates).   ¬∑ Greek River Gods: Every major river had its own god, like Achelous or Scamander. How many minor streams and springs had gods whose names were forever lost? ¬∑ Scale: If every village, spring, hill, and family had its own protective spirit or deity, the total number across the globe throughout history is unimaginably large.  3. Gods Who Evolved or Were Absorbed  As cultures merged, many gods were fused with others or simply fell out of favour.  ¬∑ Example: The Egyptian god Amun was merged with the sun god Ra to become Amun-Ra. What if Ra had been the one to be forgotten instead? Many lesser gods were likely absorbed in this way, their original identities lost. ¬∑ Example: The Roman god Sylvanus was an ancient god of the woods largely overshadowed by more popular gods like Diana or Mars. Countless others like him simply faded from popular worship.  4. Gods of Abandoned Religions  Entire religious systems have disappeared, taking their entire pantheons with them.  ¬∑ Examples:   ¬∑ The Hittite Empire had a pantheon of thousands of gods, most of whom are now only names on clay tablets, understood by a handful of scholars.   ¬∑ The Manichaean religion, once a major world faith, is now extinct, and its complex cosmology of gods and divine beings is largely forgotten.   ¬∑ Pre-Christian Slavic, Celtic, and Baltic paganism are reconstructed from fragments and folklore. We know the names of a few major gods like Perun or Cernunnos, but the vast majority of their divine beings are unknown to us.  A Philosophical and Literary Perspective  The concept of forgotten gods is a powerful theme in modern fantasy and horror (most famously in H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos and Neil Gaiman's American Gods). These stories suggest that gods are sustained by belief, and when belief dies, the gods fade into a shadowy, powerless existence, waiting in the void. From this perspective, the \"forgotten gods\" are a near-infinite multitude, a silent chorus of the divine that humanity has left behind.  Conclusion  So, to answer \"how many?\":  ¬∑ Historically: The number is countless and uncountable. It includes all the household spirits, local river gods, and tribal deities from cultures that left no written record. ¬∑ Metaphorically: The number is infinite, limited only by the number of places, concepts, and fears that humans have ever tried to personify and worship, only to eventually move on.  The forgotten gods outnumber the remembered ones not by dozens or hundreds but by orders of magnitude that we can never truly comprehend. They are the dark matter of the divine cosmos‚Äîthe overwhelming majority of what was once there, now invisible and unknown.|||If you've watched the movie PK then it sums up religion very well.

The first one we don't even know if exists or not whereas the second one is people created for their own goals|||Some  believe in god only when they come between a paranormal entity.|||God is a lie.¬†   And Krishna said, if a lie does good to someone, that is not a lie.   Camus said there are three options for life.   Either kill yourself because there is no meaning.   Or submit to a higher power and live under that.   Third option is to live the life even if it doesn't have meaning. You got the life, so might as well enjoy it while living. Taste the chicken. Listen to a song. Look around. One day you will die anyway.|||\"If there is a god, atheism must seem less as an insult to him than religion\" - Edmond  de Goncourt|||Of course it is, religion was made up by ancient people to control other people.|||Yes it is|||This kind of thought can only arrive when you reach some level of consciousness.

It is only a belief system; people have to cope with the different facets of reality. At least, that's how I take religion and many other systems of thinking. It's neither a tool to control nor a tool to exploit the poor. But it has gotten that way now, though. When people are overly reliant on religions, that's when they get exploited. We need to understand that religion itself isn't a bad thing, but having a blind trust in it is wrong. It is bad for you, your family, your society, your nation and for the whole world.|||‡§Ü‡§´‡•ç‡§®‡•ã ‡§ó‡§æ‡§â, ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ú, ‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§∏‡§¨‡•à ‡§ú‡§ó‡§æ‡§â‡§®‡•á ‡§¨‡•á‡§≤‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§Ø‡•ã¬†  STAY AWAKE ->> ‡§Ö‡§¨ ‡§∏‡§¨‡•à ‡§®‡•á‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§ú‡§®‡§§‡§æ ‡§è‡§ï ‡§≠‡§è‡§∞ ‡§ß‡•á‡§∞‡•à ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§ó‡§∞‡•ç‡§®‡•Å ‡§õ¬†  ‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§¨‡•ç‡§Ø‡§¨‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§æ ‡§ó‡§∞‡•ç‡§®‡•á ‡§§‡§ø‡§∞ ‡§≤‡§æ‡§ó‡•å‡§Ç ‚úä|||Yes; i go to a religious place, and people perform some religious practices which they are doing since they were kids; did they ever ask themselves why?

Buddhism ma god concept nai chaina|||The reason we have such temples, architecture, culture and religious devotion particularly in Kathmandu valley - newa culture, tradition and religion, was that at some point of time, they were a very stratified community i.e. resource rich, abundance of resource and time, and also isolated from much of external territorial clashes. Thus people were able to explore culture, develop tradition and dedicate time and resources to the religious pursuit.   Religion and culture is a way to explore divinity,  philosophy, metaphysics, life, death and beyond. It has its beauty, strengths and flaws like every human philosophical exploration.  But to answer the question of Development, infrastructure being built, particularly Western countries and many other countries while contrasting Asian countries is a complex historical and economic topic. You need to look at how modern development and infrastructure came to be. Why development occurred in some fields faster than others. And Why have our countries lagged behind in the past 300 years. And also the population boom and industrial revolution of the 19th and 20th century.   They've been constantly at war , so they had to take initiatives to outgrow and outperform their rivals leading to rapid research and development.   It's a big topic to cover.   And your misconception of Western countries and developed countries not being religious is not true.  Look at the big churches they've built, their art development alongside their religion eg- Davincis last resort.    You can see they have created a strong religious identity and are trying their best at spreading it wherever they go.  Whole Villages here in Nepal have converted to Christianity religion. And then there's factions of Muslims trying to do the same in other countries. ( Not in Nepal atm.)  They have contested their religion against others, they have seminars for religious conversions, research to pit their religious views against other religions, and actually are investing huge into conversions towards their religion. This can't be denied.  You look at china and Japan today, investing tons into their history and identity. Just a few decades ago, china was hugely behind in development and infrastructure. They've played their cards well in recent times.  You must understand today, the notions of absolute opposition to religion stems from leftist, communist and socialist narratives. Bending facts with fiction to push their ideology one way or another, all for pursuit of power. Eg- how maoist in Nepal manipulated facts and ficticious ideas to captivate the populus.   But, There have always been ways in our culture to be agnostic and still be a part of society.   Well, tldr, West is very religious, but they outpaced most due to rapid industrialization, marketisation, their investment into RnD and human resource.  India was under opressive British rule. Us in Nepal, fell behind when we failed to initiate our industrial revolution and we went to isolation during the industrial revolution. (Rana regime)  But, with positive steps, we are catching up.|||it's necessay to run and regulate for better of humanity! not everyone like books nerds!|||Human Being are fragile being. They need a belief system to operate. Religion is that belief system.   There are super powers no doubts which are beyond our imagination. People have given different names to those power, some call them god, some call them angel, some call them energy, ghost and some aliens.   I supposedly believe that, concept of god and religion are two different things. Religion is collective belief system inspired, moreover conspired by smart-dominant human whereas concept of God is figurative and representation of something supreme.   In different era, to control or to discipline the mass, the smart-dominant human infused the concept of god and religion together. To validate this infusion, they created rituals, process, procedure, preachings and formalized the purity of ‚Äòsupreme power of god‚Äô into a belief system of Religion.|||From moral compass perspective its good. We don‚Äôt want to harm other people even though there wont be legal consequences, or sometimes stick to ethical choices even though that might be detrimental to ourselves. Fear of god creates a harmony and balance in society.  I watched a podcast where the guest had brought a very good point about science and non-science:  In science facts can be proven wrong, latest findings are considered truthful, bigger the fact you debunk with proper evidence - its celebrated more in the community, there is no violence between scientific community given there is enough evidence (have you seen Newton gang vs Einstein gang chopping one another with machete?). Whereas in  non-science you dare not say a word against established facts, oldest beliefs are considered truthful, if you debunk the biggest beliefs then you are scrutinised the most, and you will see different gangs fighting and killing one another. So it‚Äôs evident what is scientific and what is not.|||No, god is great. Religion is also great.

            "body": "30-40 barsa pachi pani hamiley yei news Sunna parney. \"Yo pali dashain ma 20 lakh- 30 lakh Jana le Kathmandu valley chodyo bhanera\"? Ani Mugling ma jaam? Landslide ani Bus trishuli ma khasyo? Decentralization of Nepal from Kathmandu is extremely needed and planned city outside of Kathamandu is must. Every year floods fill up houses in Kathmandu. Also it is earthquake prone zone plus pollution reaches record index topping the world chart.  But when ever politicians make any plans mono -rail, high performance sports centre, IT hub, Stadiums, etc. they all plan to build it inside Kathmandu. Why? There is no Nepal outside Kathmandu? We should think of decentralizing Kathamandu soon. For reference: in India Delhi is capital city but Banglore, Pune is IT city, Mumbai is film city, and India is building Sports city in Ahmedabad to bid for Olympics. But in Nepal everything happens in one city and that is Kathmandu.   We need atleast one planned city in Middle of east Nepal (near fast track end and BP Sindhuli highway terai end) and one in middle of West Nepal (Dang valley) as form of IT hub or Sports city, etc. at least for now.  1. We don't win a single Olympics medal. But building Sports city with sports arenas, stadiums of all sports, high performance training centre, trauma centre for minor and major injuries recovery of players, etc. so about thousand, lakhs of players, coaches, etc. will be in that city reducing dependency on Kathmandu and decreasing population of Kathmandu. We can bid for SAARC games and Asian Games if we have infrasture.   2. We could move ahead to build metro station for connecting major cities like Biratnagar- Itahari, Dharan-Birtamode in east. Chitwan-Hetauda-Birgunj in mid Nepal, Butwal-Bhairawa-Dang as for Lumbini Tourism enhancement, on site Dhangadi-Attariya, etc.  3. We can choose Dang valley as potential IT city like silicon valley or Banglore. We could build metro connection (Ghorahi-Tulsipur) there and make in PPP partnership with the buildings and government buildings with Nepali western architecture enhancing beauty. We can ask National Innovation centre of Mahabir Pun, Yatri motorcycles and IT companies and others to move there and do research and innovations for things needed to Nepal and be IT hub like Banglore and Silicon valley. Hiking route to pyuthan and trekking route to Dhorpatan could be developed for weekends plan.   4. Major cities should be reconstructed and all DPR should be canceled and major roads, highways should made with (wider footpath-cycle lane-Trees -4/6 lanes in middle and same on both sides). So that terai cities like Biratnagar, Birtamode, Itahari, Janakpur, Birgung, Nepalgunj, Butwal, Dhangadi, etc. with excessive heat in summer would be liveable as trees shade would fall upon footpaths and cycle lane and buses and motorcycle while travelling. And terai cities to hill stations and mountains route should be developed for travel and holidays/weekends.  5. All universities infrastructure outside Kathmandu should be upgraded and maintained and also major building should be in Nepali design as most foreign universities are like Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard, etc with proper infrasture development to attract students study there.  6. Additionally not related to decentralization but minimum monthly salary for 8 hours duty should be determined by dividing jobs in caterogies like other countries non-skilled, Semi skilled, skilled and fully skilled. Most industries make enginners work 12 hours and don't pay even minimum of labors salary of 8 hours and even Saturday is not given holiday in many industries. Also in hospitals is same case for nurses and other professionals as well. Also player should be paid minimum salary and law should be passed.   Addressing these things will help population to be divided among Nepal and reduce necessity to live in Kathmandu. Kathmandu is already historic city and we don't need flyovers, monorail, etc. and ruin it's beauty. Please add if you have more ideas in the given needs and mail to necessary authorities like kulman ghising, mahabir pun, etc. if you have mail I'd or number.",

As citizens, we are not asking for luxuries  only the basics: proper roads, quality education, justice, industries, sports infrastructure, transparency in taxation, and genuine support for agriculture. If nations like the USA, Ireland, Canada, Japan, and China could transform within decades, Nepal can too  but only if we focus on unity, discipline, and vision.  1. Agriculture and Export Driven Economy   Instead of importing almost everything, we should prioritize exports. Nepals fertile land can support large scale organic farming and high value crops. Marijuana and hemp, legalized strictly for export, could become billion dollar industries. Like Canada and Ireland, agricultural cooperatives should be modernized with technology, irrigation, and subsidies to farmers.   2. Tourism and Cultural Heritage   Tourism should be developed as one of our strongest economic backbones. Kathmandu Valley must be preserved as a world class cultural heritage hub, like Kyoto in Japan.  Mountain and adventure tourism should be expanded with world class trekking routes, cable cars, and eco tourism villages. Each district should showcase unique cultural, historical, or natural heritage to attract domestic and international tourists.   3. Industrial and Technological Hubs  Every district should host at least four to five industries based on local resources.  Cities like Chitwan, Hetauda, Birgunj, Biratnagar, and Nepalgunj should be major industrial corridors, like Shenzhen in China or Detroit in the USA. IT hubs must be developed to stop brain drain, inspired by Irelands Tech Island model. Encourage startups, innovation centers, and digital infrastructure.   4. Sports and National Identity  Establish national sports training grounds in every province. Focus on Olympic level facilities for football, cricket, martial arts, and athletics.  Take inspiration from China and Japan, who invested in sports to uplift national pride. Sports can create jobs, unity, and international recognition.  5. Infrastructure and Connectivity   All districts must be connected within four to five hours of travel with highways, regional airports, and modern public transport. Introduce metro or rapid rail linking Kathmandu Valley to nearby cities. Smart transportation like Japans Shinkansen or Canadas efficient highways should be our model.   6. Governance and Accountability  Strict rules and regulations for politicians ‚Äî no one above the law.  Police and media must be independent, like in developed democracies. Civil service and government jobs should be limited to ten years, not lifetime tenure, so fresh talent always enters the system. Adopt transparency systems like Canada and the USA where every rupee of tax is accounted for.   7. Education and Innovation   Free quality education up to secondary level, with strong focus on STEM, arts, and culture. Universities should link directly with industries, like in the USA and Japan, to create job ready graduates.  Encourage vocational training and research so youth can become innovators, not just job seekers abroad  8. Country First System  Above all, every policy, project, and law must prioritize Nepals prosperity.  National interest must come before political parties or individual gains.  If Japan and China could rise from devastation, if Ireland could transform from poverty into Europes tech hub, if the USA and Canada can sustain growth with diversity Nepal too can build a proud future.|||This is needed very much for the development of nepal.|||u are absolutely correct|||Yes and the goal should be does a KTM person want to move to that city or not.¬†   Start with establishing education institute to lure students and setup business around to stick them there.

This evolution reflects a shift from centralized monarchy to decentralized federalism, driven by ethnic inclusion and regional equity, though rooted in ancient feudal practices adapted to modern demands.  The necessity of decentralized governance through federal provinces in Nepal stems from the country's diverse geography, ethnicity, and historical centralization, which created disparities and marginalization.   Below is a concise explanation of why federalism was deemed essential, based on key factors:  Addressing Ethnic and Cultural Diversity: Nepal has over 125 ethnic groups and 123 languages.   Centralized governance historically marginalized groups like Madhesis, Janajatis, and Dalits, favoring Kathmandu-centric elites. Federalism allows provinces to preserve linguistic, cultural, and ethnic identities through local governance, reducing discrimination and fostering inclusion.\r Reducing Regional Disparities: Nepal‚Äôs diverse terrain (Himalayas, hills, Tarai) led to uneven development, with remote areas neglected. Federal provinces enable localized decision-making, allowing regions to prioritize their economic and infrastructural needs, such as agriculture in Tarai or tourism in mountainous areas.  \r Political Representation and Autonomy: Centralized rule concentrated power in Kathmandu, alienating regions like the Tarai and far-west. Federalism devolves power to provinces, granting them legislative and administrative authority to address local issues, enhancing political participation and accountability.  \r Mitigating Conflict and Unrest: The Maoist insurgency (1996‚Äì2006) and Madhesi movements (2007‚Äì2008) highlighted demands for regional autonomy. Federalism was a response to these conflicts, aiming to prevent further unrest by ensuring equitable representation and resource distribution.  \r Strengthening Democracy: By decentralizing power, federalism promotes grassroots democracy, allowing local governments to address community-specific needs. This counters the autocratic tendencies of past monarchical and centralized systems, fostering cooperative governance across federal, provincial, and local levels.  \r Economic Efficiency and Development: Provinces can tailor policies to their economic strengths (e.g., hydropower in hilly provinces, agriculture in Tarai), optimizing resource use. Decentralized governance reduces bureaucratic delays from Kathmandu, enabling faster implementation of development projects.\r \r Despite its necessity, challenges like resource allocation, inter-provincial disputes, and incomplete devolution persist, requiring ongoing refinement to ensure effective governance. Federalism remains critical to balancing Nepal‚Äôs diverse needs with national unity.",

I would love to quote this from my idol Milton Friedman \"Government has three primary functions. It should provide for military defense of the nation. It should enforce contracts between individuals. It should protect citizens from crimes against themselves or their property. When government-- in pursuit of good intentions tries to rearrange the economy, legislate morality, or help special interests, the cost come in inefficiency, lack of motivation, and loss of freedom. Government should be a referee, not an active player.\"   GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT INTERVENE BUSINESS OF PEOPLE but ENSURE THE PLAYGROUND IS FREE OF FOUL PLAY.|||Won't because the implementation part is cooked .

I'm Madhesi, Muslim by birth (though I don't really practice - I'm more rationalist/agnostic), and I have what might sound like a crazy dream: **I want to be Nepal's Prime Minister.**  Before you laugh or close this tab, hear me out.    # Who Am I?  I'm just a kid who refuses to give up on Nepal. My family, relatives, even I myself until a year ago thought: \"This country is for losers. Just study abroad, get PR, and forget this place.\" But my heart couldn't accept it.  I was born in the most backward part of Nepal. Hill elites don't see us Madhesis as \"real Nepalis.\" Muslims are less than 5% of the population. I'm probably the most \"un-prime-ministerable\" person you can imagine. But I don't care about that anymore.  I'm tired of seeing Nepal stuck while our neighbors move forward. I'm tired of corruption eating our future. I'm tired of smart Nepali youth feeling like they have to leave to have a good life.  **I want to be the Lee Kuan Yew of Nepal. The Deng Xiaoping of Nepal. The Barack Obama of Nepal.**  And I'm not just dreaming - I'm preparing. I'm going to study development economics (bachelor's and master's). I'm going to learn from every country that went from poor to rich. And one day, I'm going to lead Nepal to become a developed nation. The Gen Z revolution gave me hope.    # My Vision: Nepal 2065  **Simple question: Can Nepal become a developed, prosperous nation in 40 years?**  **My answer: YES. Absolutely yes.**  Here's my plan - **8 Pillars of Development**. I'll keep it short because this is already getting long:    # PILLAR 1: EDUCATION - Make Every Nepali Skilled  **The Problem:**  * Government schools are so bad that even poor families sacrifice everything for private schools * Teachers are underpaid and unmotivated * Rote learning, no critical thinking * English weak (we can't compete globally)  **My Solution:**  * **Pay teachers like professionals** (NPR 60,000-150,000/month based on experience) * **Make teaching prestigious** \\- only top 20% of graduates can become teachers * **English-medium education** (but keep strong Nepali language and culture classes) * **World-class facilities** \\- labs, computers, sports, arts in EVERY school * **Free quality education** K-12, so 90-95% of kids go to government schools (not private) * **Schools open 12-14 hours/day** \\- free homework help, clubs, sports after regular classes * **AI-powered personalized learning** \\- every student learns at their own pace  **Timeline:** 10 years to transform 50% of schools, 20 years for all schools world-class  **Cost:** \\~$300-400 billion over 30 years (sounds huge but totally doable with growing economy)  **Result:** By 2050, every Nepali kid gets education as good as Singapore or Finland. We become the most educated country in South Asia.    # PILLAR 2: INFRASTRUCTURE - Connect Every Part of Nepal  **The Problem:**  * Roads are terrible (takes 2 days to reach places that should be 8 hours) * Electricity cuts (though better now) * Rural areas isolated * Kathmandu traffic nightmare  **My Solution:**  **Roads:**  * Upgrade East-West Highway to 4-6 lane international standard * Build 10-15 North-South corridors (connect Terai to hills to mountains) * Every village connected with all-weather roads * **Investment:** $45-65 billion over 25 years  **Railways:**  * Terai railway connecting major cities (compatible with India) * Hill railways to Kathmandu, Pokhara (expensive but necessary) * **Investment:** $40-80 billion over 40 years * *(No bullet trains - too expensive for mountains, but modern 120-160 km/h trains? Yes!)*  **Electricity - Our BIGGEST Advantage:**  * Nepal can produce 40,000+ MW of hydropower * **Plan:** Build massive hydro projects, produce way more than we need * **Export to India, Bangladesh, Pakistan** \\- earn $20-30 billion/year * Cheap electricity attracts factories, industries * **Investment:** $40-65 billion * **Return:** $200-300 billion over time - **this pays for everything else!**  **Urban Transit:**  * Kathmandu Metro (4-6 lines) * Modern bus systems in all major cities * **End traffic hell**  **Internet:**  * High-speed fiber optic everywhere * 100 Mbps internet in every village by 2035 * Enable remote work, online businesses  **Total Infrastructure Investment:** $160-270 billion over 40 years    # PILLAR 3: ECONOMIC POLICY - Create Jobs and Wealth  **The Problem:**  * Too dependent on agriculture (60% of people, only 25% of economy) * Almost no manufacturing * Youth have no jobs * Everyone wants to go abroad  **My Solution:**  **Phase 1 (Years 1-10): Light Manufacturing**  * Textiles and garments (like Bangladesh) - **500,000-1 million jobs** * Food processing (tea, spices, dairy) - **200,000-300,000 jobs** * Construction materials - **150,000-250,000 jobs** * Target: $15-20 billion exports  **Phase 2 (Years 10-25): Heavy Industry**  * **Aluminum smelting** using cheap hydropower (like Iceland) - **huge export potential** * Steel production * Electronics assembly (like Vietnam) - **300,000-500,000 jobs** * Pharmaceuticals * Target: $50-80 billion exports  **Phase 3 (Years 25-40): High-Tech Economy**  * IT services (like India's BPO) - **500,000-1 million high-paying jobs** * AI and software development * Financial services hub * Advanced manufacturing * Target: $150-250 billion exports  **Special Economic Zones:**  * Create 8-12 SEZs with tax breaks, ready infrastructure * Attract foreign investment * Make it EASY to do business (start company in 1-2 days, not 6 months)  **Support Small Businesses:**  * Cheap loans (3-5% interest) * Business training and mentorship * Remove bureaucratic barriers  **Target:** By 2065, Nepal exports $500 billion - 1 trillion worth of goods and services    # PILLAR 4: GOVERNANCE - End Corruption, Make Government Work  **The Problem (We All Know This):**  * Massive corruption at every level * Nothing gets done without bribes * Politicians care about power, not people * Bureaucracy is nightmare  **My Solution - Learn from Singapore:**  **Zero Tolerance for Corruption:**  * Pay government officials WELL (so they don't need bribes)    * Ministers: $200K-300K/year    * Senior civil servants: $100K-150K/year * But **HARSH punishment** for corruption:    * Minimum 10 years jail    * Take all their stolen money + more    * Lifetime ban from public service    * Publicize their names (shame them) * **Independent anti-corruption commission** with real power * Fast-track corruption courts (decide cases in 6-12 months)  **Transparency:**  * Every rupee of government spending online, trackable * All government tenders open and transparent * Officials must declare assets publicly every year  **Meritocracy:**  * Hire best people, not party members or relatives * Tough exams for civil service (like IAS but tougher) * Promote based on performance, not seniority * Fire people who don't perform  **Digital Government:**  * 90% of government services online * Get licenses, permits in hours, not months * No need to visit offices and bribe officials  **This is CRITICAL - without this, everything else fails**    # PILLAR 5: HEALTHCARE - Healthy People, Productive Nation  **The Problem:**  * Government hospitals terrible * Healthcare expensive * Rural areas have almost nothing * People die from preventable diseases  **My Solution:**  **Three-Tier System:**  * **Health centers:** One per 5,000-10,000 people (basic care, vaccinations, maternal health) * **District hospitals:** 100-120 modern hospitals across Nepal (surgery, emergency, specialists) * **Major medical centers:** 8-12 world-class hospitals (advanced treatments, teaching, research)  **Universal Health Insurance:**  * Everyone covered from birth * Poor: 100% government paid * Middle class: Subsidized * Rich: Pay themselves * **No one goes bankrupt from medical bills**  **Train More Doctors:**  * Need 60,000-80,000 doctors by 2040 (currently have \\~30,000) * Expand medical schools * Pay doctors well so they don't leave for abroad  **Use AI/Technology:**  * AI diagnosis in every health center (even villages get expert-level care) * Telemedicine (video call with specialists) * Electronic health records  **Investment:** $100-150 billion over 30 years  **Result:** Life expectancy goes from 70 to 83-85 years. Everyone gets world-class healthcare regardless of wealth.    # PILLAR 6: AGRICULTURE - Modernize and Prosper  **The Problem:**  * Farming is still medieval (manual labor, low productivity) * Farmers are poor despite working hard * Young people don't want to farm  **My Solution:**  **Modernize:**  * Tractors, harvesters, modern equipment (subsidized) * Irrigation everywhere (80-90% irrigated by 2040) * Hybrid seeds, proper fertilizers, training * Result: **Productivity increases 3-5x, farmers earn well**  **High-Value Crops:**  * Premium tea and coffee (marketed as \"Himalayan\") * Organic fruits and vegetables (off-season for India) * Spices (cardamom, ginger, turmeric) * Medicinal plants * Export to India, China, Europe, Gulf  **Only 10-15% in agriculture by 2065, but they're prosperous** (like US farmers - few but rich)  **Investment:** $17-27 billion over 30 years    # PILLAR 7: TOURISM - Our Natural Goldmine  **Current:** \\~1 million tourists, $2 billion revenue  **Potential:** 8-12 million tourists, $35-50 billion revenue  **How:**  * Better airports (Kathmandu, Pokhara, Lumbini, plus new ones) * Good roads to tourist destinations * Range of hotels (budget to luxury) * Safety and cleanliness * Promote beyond trekking:    * Lumbini (Buddhist pilgrimage - huge potential)    * Cultural heritage    * Adventure sports    * Wellness/yoga retreats    * MICE (conferences, business events)  **Marketing:** Spend $200-500 million/year promoting Nepal (like Thailand does)  **Investment:** $13-26 billion over 30 years  **Result:** Tourism becomes massive foreign exchange earner, creates 2-2.5 million jobs    # PILLAR 8: SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT - Inclusive, Equal Society  **The Problem:**  * Inequality (rich-poor gap, regional disparities) * Discrimination (against Madhesis, Dalits, women, minorities) * Brain drain (educated youth leaving) * Social tension  **My Solution:**  **Equal Opportunity:**  * Education and healthcare free for all (no advantage from wealth) * Merit-based system everywhere * Special programs for historically disadvantaged groups (temporary) * All regions developed (not just Kathmandu)  **Gender Equality:**  * Equal pay enforced * Maternity leave (6-12 months paid) * Universal childcare (so women can work) * Safety and protection laws enforced  **Pension and Social Security:**  * Everyone 65+ gets pension ($100-150/month minimum) * Unemployment insurance * Disability support  **Stop Brain Drain:**  * Create opportunities at home (good jobs, good life) * Pay competitively (can't match US but reasonable) * Make Nepal attractive to live in * Engage diaspora (bring back their expertise and money)  **National Identity:**  * Nepali identity that includes everyone (Madhesi, Pahadi, Dalit, Janajati - all equally Nepali) * Respect diversity but build common purpose * Federal system works (provinces have power)    # THE BIG PICTURE: Nepal 2065  **If we do all this:**  **Economy:**  * GDP: $3-4 Trillion (from $40 billion today) * Per capita: $75,000-100,000 (from $1,350 today) * **Rich, developed nation - on par with South Korea, Poland**  **Quality of Life:**  * Life expectancy: 83-85 years * Everyone educated to university level * Everyone has comfortable home, good job, healthcare * Clean environment, modern cities, connected villages * Low crime, stable democracy, respected globally  **Global Standing:**  * Top 20-25 economy in the world * Regional leader (South Asia's success story) * Respected for renewable energy, education, sustainable development  **Most importantly:** Every Nepali child has opportunity to reach their potential. No more \"I have to leave Nepal to succeed.\"    # THE CATCH: Population & Technology Challenges  **Warning from Japan/South Korea:** When countries develop, birth rates collapse. Korea now has 0.72 children per woman - population will halve! Aging society, economic stagnation.  **Nepal must avoid this:**  * Support families (generous parental leave, free childcare, child allowances) * Make having kids compatible with career (especially for women) * Keep fertility at 2.0-2.1 (stable population, not shrinking) * Use AI/technology to maintain productivity even with older population  **Technology opportunities:**  * **AI in education:** Every student has personal AI tutor (learn at own pace, reach remote villages) * **AI in healthcare:** Expert diagnosis in every village health post * **AI in agriculture:** 3x productivity with precision farming * **AI in government:** Automated services, no corruption opportunities * Nepal can LEAPFROG - skip old technology, go straight to cutting-edge    # THE COST & FUNDING  **Total investment needed:** $870 billion - 1.35 trillion over 40 years  **Sounds impossible? It's not. Here's how:**  * **Government budget:** 40% (from growing tax base as economy grows) * **Private investment:** 30% (domestic and foreign) * **International loans:** 20% (World Bank, ADB - cheap long-term loans) * **Hydropower revenue:** Pays for itself + generates surplus ($20-30B/year exports)  **The math works. South Korea, Singapore, China did similar investments. Nepal can too.**    # THE REAL QUESTION  **Can Nepal really do this?**  **Historically, YES:**  * South Korea: $100 per person (1960) ‚Üí $35,000+ (2020) in 60 years * Singapore: Poor city-state (1965) ‚Üí $65,000+ per person (2020) in 55 years * China: $200 per person (1980) ‚Üí $12,000+ (2020) in 40 years * Estonia: Soviet legacy (1991) ‚Üí $28,000+ (2020) in 29 years  **What they had in common:**  * Long-term vision * Investment in education * Good governance (low corruption) * Strategic economic policy * Sustained effort over decades  **Nepal has everything needed:**  * Natural resources (hydropower, tourism) * Strategic location (between India and China) * Young population (demographic advantage NOW) * Democracy (legitimate government) * Can learn from others' successes and mistakes * Technology available to leapfrog  **What's missing? Political will and execution.**    # MY COMMITMENT  I'm 16 now. I'll be 26 in 2034. I'll be 46 in 2054. I'll be 56 in 2065.  **My plan:**  1. **2025-2029:** Complete high school, go to best university for development economics 2. **2029-2035:** Bachelor's and Master's in Development Economics, study successful transformations 3. **2035-2045:** Work in development (World Bank, ADB, or Nepal Planning Commission) - gain experience 4. **2045:** Enter politics seriously (I'll be 35-36, eligible for PM) 5. **2045-2065:** Lead Nepal's transformation (ideally as PM, or in other leadership roles)  **I'm not just dreaming. I'm preparing.**  And here's the thing - **I don't need to be PM to start this**. This vision needs thousands of committed people - in government, business, education, civil society. If you believe in this vision, YOU can contribute too.    # THE FINAL QUESTION (The One That Matters)  **Would you accept a Madhesi Muslim as your Prime Minister?**  I'm not asking you to vote for me now - I'm 16, that would be weird.  I'm asking: **If someone from Rautahat, someone Madhesi, someone from a Muslim family (even though I'm not religious), came to you in 20-30 years with this vision, this plan, this commitment - would you give them a chance?**  Or would you say: \"No, PM must be Bahun/Chhetri from Kathmandu hills\"?  Because honestly, that's what I'm most afraid of. Not that the plan is hard (it is, but doable). Not that it costs too much (it's affordable). Not that Nepal can't do it (we absolutely can).  **I'm afraid that Nepal will reject good leadership because of caste, ethnicity, religion.**  I want to believe we're better than that. Gen Z is showing we can be better than that.  So tell me honestly:  **Would you accept a PM who is:**  * Madhesi (from Terai, not hills) * Muslim by birth (though rationalist/agnostic in belief) * From Rautahat (most backward district) * But has the vision, knowledge, and commitment to make Nepal developed?  **Or would you prefer:**  * Traditional hill elite * \"Right\" caste and religion * From \"right\" family * But continuing same old politics that kept us poor for 70 years?    # Why I'm Posting This  I know I sound crazy. I know I'm just a kid. I know the odds are against me.  But someone has to say this. Someone has to have the audacity to dream that Nepal can be great. Someone from Rautahat, someone Madhesi, someone Muslim has to stand up and say: **\"I refuse to accept that we're destined to be poor. I refuse to accept that I have to leave Nepal to succeed. I refuse to accept that my identity disqualifies me from serving my nation.\"**  If you think this vision is stupid, tell me why (genuinely - I want to learn).  If you think it's impossible, show me what I'm missing.  If you think someone like me can never be PM because of where I'm from, at least be honest about it.  But if you think - even a little bit - that this could work, that Nepal deserves better, that maybe, just maybe, we should judge leaders by their vision and ability rather than their last name and birthplace...  **Then let's start a conversation.**  Because real change doesn't start in Singha Durbar. It starts in conversations like this.    **‡§ß‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§¶ for reading this essay. I know it's long. But Nepal's future is worth a long post.**  **Would you accept a Madhesi Muslim PM? Would you accept THIS vision for Nepal?**  **Let's discuss. ‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§ï‡§®‡•ç ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä (Truth and righteousness) - that's what Nepal needs, regardless of who brings it.**    *P.S. - To those who'll say \"just another kid dreaming, will forget in 2 years\": Maybe. But every leader who transformed their nation started by dreaming when young. Lee Kuan Yew was 35 when he became PM. Obama was community organizer in his 20s. Balen was just engineer before he became mayor. You have to dream before you can build.*  *P.P.S. - Yes, I know $3-4 trillion sounds insane when we're at $40 billion now. But Korea went from $4 billion to $1.6 trillion (400x) in 60 years. Nepal going from $40B to $3T (75x) in 40 years with modern technology? Actually conservative.*  *P.P.P.S. - If you're from Rautahat or Madhesi community or any minority - this post is especially for you. Don't let anyone tell you that you don't belong in Nepal's future. We belong just as much as anyone else. Maybe even more, because we know what it's like to be left behind.*      **What do you think?)**",

We have some historical erasure in this country to make a certain period look worse than it was, the contributions of your people have been abandoned with it.

Unfortunately this is the dominant economic policy in the world. So if your a 16 year old, you will unconsciously gravitate towards it.

The police-inmate conflict is not as escalated as other countries where criminal groups are more \"institutionalized\" (USA, India, ...) The jails are, therefore, not as tense and unsafe. Combined with the general attitude towards foreigners (especially white ones) and the culture of regarding them as \"guests\", I would assume that a white American would have a pretty easy time in Nepali jails.|||If local Nepalis find the living condition bad then it's probably 100x bad for you.

I would hope things have improved since then,  ut doubt it. I was working on Nepal and one of my employees was arrested. I went to visit him in the Patan jail. The ‚Äújail‚Äù was one large very dark room with about 30 people locked up in it. There was a trough running down the middle of the floor that inmates used for pee and poop. Food was the bare minimum - rice and a very watery potato dhal. No beds, and the only garments or bedding used by prisoners were whatever was brought by family members who had to bribe the jailers to pass it on. Again this was a long time ago so take it with a grain of salt and hope conditions are better. I would assume that if an inmate had the funds they could secure nicer accommodations.|||From my experience of visiting Nepali prisons for research purposes, there are a few factors that determine how bad it is, each location is different in terms of the facilities and practices. Overall I would say the living conditions are pretty bad in most prisons, places are cramped, so not a lot of personal space, hygiene and access to healthcare is an issue. However, There are also some good prisons with facilities like gym, some providing mental health support, vocational training and so on. So it really depends on which prison but there really isn‚Äôt any imminent threat to life or gang violence or anything extreme. From what I saw, everybody does their own thing and it‚Äôs pretty chill, there are ‚Äúleaders‚Äù like a class captains who pretty much run the place and communicate with the police officers. I also met some foreigners although they were not white or American. Ofcourse they were treated really well like any other place in Nepal, the only complaint they had was about the justice system and how fucked up it is in Nepal and how many innocent people are in jail.|||It‚Äôs pretty chill they‚Äôll let you out once in a while when there‚Äôs like a protest or smth or like a flood and expect you to report yourself so they can put you back.

Reasonable: You are getting paid directly to your bank with a nominal transfer fee. 2. Legal: Bank will deduct 5% tax as per government rule 3. Scalable: This action is repeatable month-after-month regardless of amount.  If you're doing any third party systems, like Wise, you lose on three fronts:   A. Wise cuts a transfer commission   B. The amount needs to be converted to NPR before sending and costs money   C. Depositing in Nepali bank has another processing fee in rupees  So this is not a good way to receive salary every month. See how much money you're losing even before paying a single rupee in tax amount.  Some companies do have issues setting up complex arrangements for just one person. I say this because I am the only Nepali person there. Everyone, including Indians are cool with receiving salaries in crypto, Wise wallet or other forms that do not work in Nepal.

If they commission the salary on bank account then they should have no problem of wiring it straight to your bank account. They'd send you invoice and use that Invoice to show the bank in Nepal as proof of your income and you can setup that recurring payment as your employment payment and bank'll deduce 5% on each transaction from that party, hence your tax payment for Nepal government.  Ask or search for your Bank's SWIFT code and provide necessary documents, that should suffice for international payment afaik.  Edit : unconventional payment should involve third party transaction. Paypal & payoneer work but payoneer is very unreliable. If everything works, no problem but to resolve ANY problem with payoneer is a nightmare. Skrill (I haven't used it) could be an alternative. You could use someone trusted who's abroad to use their paypal.

This issue directly impacts Nepal‚Äôs growing digital workforce and limits the country‚Äôs potential in the global freelancing market. I kindly request you to post about this problem and urge the Finance Minister and related authorities to take action.

What do they mean?   22 seeders mean there are 22 people who have the complete torrent downloaded to their machines, and are sharing it.  144 leechers mean people who have partial torrent but not the complete torrent.  If you are downloading a torrent, you first become a leecher. If you download the complete torrent, and keep it active in your torrent client, then you become a seeder. If you only download partial torrent but keep sharing (seeding) what you have downloaded, then you will still be reported just as a leecher.   > Don't the people (servers) need to communicate to each other to send me the files for download, where does it take place? Doesn't it needs some sorts of coordination server?  There are torrent trackers, such as The Pirate Bay. Trackers normally don't host any content themselves, they will just have a listing of the content, and the tracker will track the seeders and leechers. So when you download a torrent file (or use a magnet link), the torrent file will have information on what content the torrent should have (the actual torrent content will be with seeders/leechers) as well as information on seeders/leechers.  > And if there is one, can't people who don't want their stuff illegally downloaded track those coordination servers?  It's not so easy. It's fairly easy to start your own torrent tracker. If you take out one torrent tracker, then many more would pop up to take its place. And the seeders/leechers would continue to have access to the files, they could just switch to another tracker.   There are also countries with cheap internet access and loose copyright laws who won't cooperate with US/EU, so many trackers are hosted on those countries.  > Also can I become seeder too if I want to put out something on pirate bay myself with my 16 GB RAM laoptop?   You don't need to upload to become a seeder, you just need a completed version of the torrent active on your torrent client.  You can upload torrents on various trackers, or even have your own tracker. There are many legitimate uses of torrents such as hosting Linux ISOs.  > And what do people who provide their own computing resources get for their efforts? Why do they do it?   It doesn't really take much computing resources other than disk space and bandwidth (CPU and RAM usage will be low on a decent torrent client).  Torrenting does require generous people who have the spirit of sharing. Without this, torrenting won't work.  There are also private torrent trackers which have seeding and ratio rules (you may need to seed each torrents for at least a minimum amount of time set by the tracker and/or maintain a good upload to download ratio, and there are generally incentives for seeding long term). Here you will have to follow the rules of seeding if you want to download. What this means is the files will be better seeded in private trackers, and the quality of files will be higher too.|||**Basically, if you've already downloaded the file or parts of the file, and have enabled seeding, other downloaders can request chunks of the file, and it will be sent from your computer to their computer. Hence termed peer-to-peer.**  **If you've enabled seeding, you're a seeder.**  **If you're just downloading without enabling seeding, you're a leecher.**  **There are communities dedicated to keeping popular torrents active for years, with server farms that keep seeding thousands of torrents 24/7. And some torrent creators seed it themselves with gigabytes per second speeds. Spreading the file throughout the network.**  Torrent files or magnet links just tell your client where to look; trackers(hosted somewhere) or DHT help it find other peers sharing that file. Trackers or DHT don‚Äôt host the actual file, just a list of connected peers and info about which chunks they have.  Once connected, it grabs tiny chunks from many at once and shares what it‚Äôs got back, pure decentralized magic.  See the graph highlighted in red?  https://preview.redd.it/kr31xb3u7xtf1.png?width=976&format=png&auto=webp&s=c84151228f898cc0e6eb3846e87737d6714745d0  The black lines are the chunks that you've already downloaded. As you can see, the chunks are requested in random order.  However, some applications like WebTorrent allow you to download the chunks in order, from beginning to end. Hence, it lets you stream the video without downloading the entire file. Possibly, [goku.sx](http://goku.sx) does this as well.  **That's why torrents are hard to counter.**  Because everyone who's downloaded the file can send it to the ones who request it.  **It's truly genius.**  And people usually **don‚Äôt get paid**. They seed because they want to **help others download faster** and keep torrents alive, like giving back to the community that helped them.  Some do it for **reputation on private trackers**, or just **because they enjoy being part of a swarm**.|||Peer to peer transfer ma seeder bhaneko jo sanga tyo file paila dekhi hunxa ani aru download garne harulai usle share garxa tyo ho   ani leecher bhaneko chai kati thaau ma tyo seeder harule share gareko file download garirako hunxan tiniharuko number ho.|||From my knowledge, Seeders are the providers who have the files installed on their system and they are distributing it in parts to the leechers that is you in this case.   And to be a seeder is not a heavy task, after finishing the download by taking bits one by one and arranging the file, the torrent itself starts to seed if the torrent client is open. I seed on my 4 gb ram laptop too. It's not done for profit, it's done cuz you wanna help others out cuz you also got helped by others. And use QBittorrent if not alr.|||Torrenting is just file sharing among people. The torrent file is not the movie,it is really like a map that shows where the pieces are located. Seeders have the full file and share it out. Leechers download but also share what they got. Your computer downloads small pieces from many people at the same time. It also shares the pieces you've already downloaded with others. No single server contains the file,trackers just help computers find one another. You may share your own files also by leaving your torrent running. People generally share to help others and keep torrents running. The more you share, the faster your downloads are.|||What it is: 1. p2p nai ho. 2. Decentralized vatekole files are divided into equal parts. Each part may be a small chunk of 2MB, 4MB, 8MB etc depending on configuration. 3. Example: 64MB filr would have 16 parts each of 4MB or, 8 parts each 8MB. 4. SEEDER = who hosts parts (seeds)source 5. LEECHER is who downloadeds(leeches) from source 6. For this to work, SEED (Part of File) must exist with ATLEAST one Seeder.  Gow it works: 1. When you do a torrent download, you are initially a Leecher Only. For all parts. 2. As soon as you download ANY part, you become a Seeder for that part. 3. Meaning, you are now a source for that part for someone on the network  4. If more people have the part that you want, and if they are nearby, your download of that part will be significantly faster. 5. If a single Seeder is serving some particular PART, the download of that part (Leeching) will be painfully slow. 6. Thankfully, many Leechers for that PART means someone downloading closest to that Seeder will complete the download faster, and they in-turn will become Seeder for that part. So, -1 Leecher +1 Seeder happens. This makes your download faster. You can download each part from 1 peer by default, but you also have the option to choose multiple peers for a PART. 7. If you leave the file as-is after the complete download. That file will continue being seeded. You will act as a peer with all parts. Essentially, making the download faster for everbody. 8. Downloads are not sequential by design, because UDN will grab whatever is available. But modern torrent clients have the option of concurrent download. You trade download speed with serial download of parts. Useful for things like streaming video (You can play video on VLC as it is downloading, that way!)|||Simply understand like,  seeders - those who have complete files  leechers - those who have incomplete files  In this case the new downloader also becomes leechers as it has incomplete files.   In Torrent the client who is downloading is also uploading at the same time to others that doesn't have incomplete files. Only when the file is completely downloaded the client becomes a seeder.   There is no server here. All leechers act on its own who wants which chunk of missing file and completes it from the easiest seeder or peecher.  Count that the more the seeder the better the download as multiple chunks of files can be taken from multiple seeders which may find the easiest.  For a file to be downloaded completely there needs to be atleast one seeder and none or any no. of leechers.  More the leechers means multiple clients has incomplete files. In this case each leechers acts selfish grasping incomplete file of its own from any leechers or seeders with the shortest or easiest available route or port.   Note that when there is only single seeder then leechers downloads from any other leachers which file is available but since the complete file is only one so the missing piece is only completed through that single seeder. As soon as the leecher completes its file it instantly becomes seeder.  Also there is role of port which can make complex for time being.|||lots of questions but i will try to answer them one by one!  Seeders are those who have the complete file. leachers are those who are still downloading the file and have parts of it.  Most  .torrent has a tracker url. its doesnot host the file but keeps the ip addresses of the people who have the file i.e seeder and leechers. when you start downloading you client qbittorrent ask for the file and the trackers replies with the ip addresses of the people who have it. and then you client directly connects you to the seeder (no server in between).  Yes ‚Äî trackers are public, and law enforcement or copyright agencies can (and do) monitor them. and join in the swarm and look for seeder or people who are downloading. That‚Äôs how copyright notices often originate by logging IPs seen sharing a particular movie or software.   you are saring the file as you are downloading(leacher). Once the download is complete you client automatically starts seeding it as long as you are kepping the application open, and everytime you open the application. in the case of seeding it does not take much bandwidth.  torrenting is bandwidth, I/O heavy not ram or cpu, You are not hosting the file Like a server you are just sharing it.  For the love of the game. if nobody shares it the torrent dies. most client forces their users to seed or do it on auto . some do it for the freedom. and sharing is caring.  No significant computing power is needed torrenting mostly uses bandwidth and disk I/O, not CPU or RAM.  Torrenting itself is completely legal  it‚Äôs just a peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol. What can be illegal is *what* you download or share. Distributing copyrighted material (like commercial movies, games, or software) without permission can violate copyright laws in many countries. In practice, enforcement often focuses on large uploaders or tracker sites rather than individual users. so you are safe.|||Basically, you are looking for a packet of parle G. Say, 10 people on this thread have a packet of parle G each. So we agree to share you a copy of our individual biscuit each. Some will give you 2 piece, some will give 5 etc untill you complete an entire packet worth of biscuits. Sharing a copy of your file is Seeding.  Getting said file from other sharing the same file is leeching.  Now, you asked for a friend to help you look for said parle g is the torrent file/sites  After you get your copy of file, just let it be on the torrent. Others who'd want it will then get connected to you and you will share a copy of your file with them.  Torrenting itself is not illegal, sharing copyrighted files is. (But who cares, most of us can't afford any useful softwares legally anyway :D)|||Just set your torrent client to run at startup & keep it running in the background to seed. Office wifi ma chai torrent nagare hola. Don't want to risk issues with company or them potentially getting legal letter (Nepal ma ta nahola). Natra at least naya torrent chai add nagara, feri aru ko internet speed affect huncha. Download complete bhayesi seed matra garda ta dherai bandwidth khadaina.|||Beware of malware while using it.

Follow the pattern‚Ä¶ the outfits, the wedding decorations, jewellery, she made it come to reality. She followed it diligently - color, design, looks, everything. Likewise, will be her uncountable homes and more plethora of jewellery. You are making people aware what she was upto on the days of the protests and the tragedy of losing innocent lives. Some people will always defend her no matter what as most of them are paid PR people.   Her homes which she shared with the husband are perhaps and most probably their upcoming homes and redecorations which she has said she is renovating three of her houses. The Sirohiya house that was burnt down was surprisingly not lavish at all despite the corruption scale. They are of course building a new house, what else would you do with all that black money. She wants to get into politics and the scale of the house will be similar. She does everything for the clout and to portray this picture perfect curated lifestyle.  Whenever someone wants to warn people, they are always ridiculed. There were people who exposed her long time back but they were also met with unfair repercussions. People are speaking up now because her hypocrisy has been on the forefront.  You did your job, let the people do whatever they want with the info. When the time comes, they will think back and say yes there were signs but‚Ä¶.This is exactly how the corruption went overboard cause few people called out things but they were never taken seriously, this continued for decades giving the corrupt people the benefit of the doubt and even after they have been exposed now, they still have the audacity to say that they have been nothing but victims. All happened because no one listened, no one cared, no one acknowledged and there was no accountability until it was too late.  Srinkhala, her parents, her in laws and her husband are frauds and parasites. Everyone knows that but still some people don‚Äôt want to accept it and live in denial. Her brother was supposed to get married the week or following after the protests. It‚Äôs a fact! She did not disclose this, the media did. She pinned the jewelry ideas around the same time and if people still defend her then just leave it at that. If the protests did not happen, we would have seen her never ending posts about the wedding, what she wore, what she is working on as ‚Äúan architect‚Äù. Her home- her dream project will be a lavish one because it has to match her ambition and ego. She makes everything about herself, you think she won‚Äôt make her dream project about herself? Then she will come out and say it was all her vision, she got inspired by this sustainability and how her husband guided her into making better decisions like her wedding speech.  If she was really talented, her Gaatha and skincare line would not have been what it is today. Whatever little publicity those are getting are because she has been endorsing both. Nepal ma alikati kei ramro bhayo ki successful bhaihalcha. Yo ta jhan afailay endorse gareko brainchild ho re in her own words. If it is not making any rounds and not doing well then there is clearly no talent with the amount of money, position, connections, power and influence that she has especially after getting married.  So thank you for sharing what you saw to make us aware. You can‚Äôt do anything with people who want to turn a blind eye and stay oblivious/ ignorant. Bujhnay le bujhihalchan.  Yo ta kei hoina, people will see how ruthlessly ambitious she is in coming days with political scenario. ‚ÄúSamanya ghar ko tapai hami jasto manchay‚Äù dekhcha balla manchay haru le when it‚Äôs too little too late.

You can always decide whether to share or not. For now, I think saving and sharing those would have exposed her more for people who are gullible and want to remain ignorant.

Nothing and  make excuses like this. Bro if you dont have the capacity then hire good advisors. But they are busy hiring their brother in law, nephews and jhole karyakarta in such posts - all they know is to praise their lord day and night. Just F off and let more capable people take charge.",

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. üò≠üò≠2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye üò≠|||3 brsa vo dashign namanako|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

To this young innocent guy here , I too thought about reporting it and asking a bug bounty but I already knew I was not going to get any so I just opened my laptop and got an extension named M8UL downloader or something to download all those videos , ( why I downloaded an extension?? : cause institutions upload videos in small small chunks of file that play altogether to form a video , like you you download from other extension you will find files of 8sec 15sec more than 100 of such files will exist there and the extension I mentioned just compiles them all and let you download the full video ) .|||Hello u/Space_X_Offical, thank you for contributing to r/NepalPlusTwo.

You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

Even after taking reexam on both, i don't think i will pass. because of me failing on my exams, my mother and entire relatives blame me that i didn't try hard enough, didn't study and other similar things. my mother calls me a faliure, that i destroyed her dreams and i brought her nothing but pain etc etc.       i tried , i tried to focus on class, watched youtube, searched notes, asked the topper friends what they did at home and studied. heck, because of that tension and stress my hair started falling out, at age 17.    i was not even a bad student before. i even got A on SEE.       when choosing what to study, my friends choose management, but following the WISHES of my family and relatives, i choose science. after a week, i told her that i find science hard but she said just \"**The admission money is already paid and is only half can be refunded**\" totaL was 20,000+ BOOKS. and i failed again and again and again.    and still to this day, she screams and brings up my results in every argument and uses me as a example infront of my sister everyday.  now, she has said \" **if you fail again, then go get a room away from home and do what you want or study again from class 11 in management from the start\".**  now, i don't want to get out of my house without proper source of income. i can do every single house work and can even cook nearly everything , no problem if i start living alone. but it will be problem with no money or limited money.  and i would rather die than study and take that tension for another two years again. my mind is already way too damaged from that.  so, if i fail is there a course that i can get in techical line or something. like i heard that there are courses (18 months - 3 years ) that one can complete and start working , even if only SEE passed.    so , if there is any course that exists, please tell me.",

            "body": "We all know most ISP here lock the router and dont give any access to the web management. As a devops practitioner and someone who is very invested in homelabbing and selfhosting, locked router was my biggest achilles heels.   Requirement: A secondary router, you main router will stop working and secondary router will only work through LAN1 port.   Solution: All you have to do is create a ticket on vianet app stating \"Turn the router into bridge/modem only mode\". Someone will call you back, just ask them username and password for PPPOE and use your secondary router to configure through PPPOE instead of DHCP. Tada!!! you now have full control over your router.   Bonus 1: You can flash openwrt with Luci web interface and you will be able to configure anything you can think of. extra advantage is you can configure mesh routing without needing a special router. I have managed to easily flash it on my Mi router and a old tp link router, search for guides depending on your model or ask Claude or Gpt to search specifically for your router model.   Bonus 2: Vianet gives you globally accessible IPV6. That means you are free from CGNAT. Use this to access your home services without needing any relay like Cloudflare Tunnel or Tailscale VPN. Direct connection means no extra latency and maxed bandwidth and you can use this to host online game servers to play with your friends!! But for some reason Worldlink doesnt connect sometimes. Ncell and ClassicTech seems to have no problem tho. I am not sure if NTC offers IPV6.  Bonus 3: Host a adguard DNS server and configure your openwrt to use it as your default DNS server. This way you will have adblocking for your whole network. Your parents and old grannies wont have to see ads no more (wont work with Youtube app - use revance) and it keeps them safe from online phishing and malwares. You can also set some static ip and adguard to block some websites like gambling and pornography if there are minors in your household.   Disadvantage: The only downside of this is your main router will turn pretty much useless. Internet wont work through wireless and extra ports. So dont forget the vianet tech support to turn off the DHCP and wireless on the main router. Since my secondary router also has 2 ports only I had to invest some money on extra gigabyte switch.   I know some of you will appreciate this so this is my appreciation and giving back to this community. enjoy and have fun!! Happy Dashain!!!

I already have a secondary Mi 4a router with OpenWRT + Adblock + HTTPS DNS Proxy configured. I'll create a ticket right now.

Did it impact your internet speed in any way?   Also, directly exposing your local network and devices through IPv6 is not really a good idea.

So I have a camera that allows remote viewing. However, when I connect the camera to Vianet, remote viewing doesn't work and I need to be within my home network to view the feed through the app.  The remote feed viewing works in Worldlink and Ncell's mobile data.

The child will have access to education and almost everything another child can ask for. We have belief that the child carries spirit of Taleju Bhawani, which gives the child immense power. Again, in an age where we have lost our belief, I cannot prove it.  The kumaris I have visited emit strong aura (i may have been brainwashed to feel this). But she does have to be disciplined (i dont mean someone disciplines her). The child is treated with utmost respect by the best people in a homely environment.   Aba before age of 15 16, Manang Mustang ghumna khasai koi jaadaina hola (only speaking for myself) After she is no longer a Kumari, she can go whereever she wants to.

A 3 year old child has no idea what she is getting into. She cannot grasp what a normal childhood is, what is right and what is wrong. The only thing she knows and does is based on her likes and dislikes, which is heavily depended upon how her parents/surrounding elders dictates.   Ani about 'No complains' from past Kumaris:   Newari culture is super sensitive. You cannot say anything against their culture. Otherwise, you'll have to face \"Tom n Jerry\" like people. I think, every ex Kumaris understands this at some point. With this much pressure along with the grooming done from a very young age, I don't think anyone dares to speak up. Which basically means none of us know what they really feel inside.    Well, of course, keeping in mind how they're thrown away once they reach a certain age or goes through ü©∏. At least, a life time opportunity to be a Kumari where they could renounce their position if they don't feel like it should be a way.   They don't preach, they don't teach, they only show up during jatras. I've never seen Kumaris actively participating in rituals or any sort of activities.

The only thing you should feel bad about is her parents who now have to be her full time care takers probably having to leave their jobs and careers and move into the kumari house with her.|||I used to extremely religious before and used to glorify ts But realising Kumari tradition is cruel was my first step towards atheism|||As a Newar, I understand the cultural side of it.

If you‚Äôve seen Little Miss Sunshine, you‚Äôll get the context.||| The Living Goddess tradition of Nepal is a complex institution rooted in centuries of culture. While modern concerns about child rights are valid, the practice is governed by strict rituals and has evolved to address contemporary welfare standards. Here are the key facts:  1. The Selection is Meticulous and Considered an Honor:  ¬∑ A Kumari is chosen from the specific Shakya clan of the Newari community, a Buddhist goldsmith caste. ¬∑ The selection process is incredibly rigorous. Candidates must meet 32 strict physical perfection requirements (e.g., eye shape, voice quality, hair color) and demonstrate a fearless and serene demeanor (e.g., by not crying during a ceremony in a room of 108 ritually sacrificed animal heads). ¬∑ For the family and community, her selection is not a punishment but the highest spiritual honor.  2. The Role is Central to National Culture and Unity:  ¬∑ The Kumari is not just a religious figure but a national symbol. ¬∑ Her most important public duty is during the Indra Jatra festival, where she blesses the President of Nepal, providing divine legitimacy to the state in a ceremony that blends Hindu and Buddhist traditions. This is a key event for national identity.  3. Significant Reforms and Safeguards Have Been Implemented:  ¬∑ Education: By law, the Kumari now receives a formal education from private tutors within her residence. The government provides a monthly stipend specifically for this purpose. ¬∑ Family Presence: Contrary to isolation claims, her family (typically her mother) lives with her throughout her tenure. ¬∑ Financial Security: Upon retiring at puberty, the state grants her a lifetime pension. As of recent years, this is approximately NPR 10,000 per month (roughly $75 USD), along with a lump sum of NPR 1 million (roughly $7,500 USD) to support her transition. ¬∑ Successful Reintegration: Former Kumaris like Dr. Chanira Bajracharya, who served until 14, have publicly spoken about their positive experiences, pursued higher education, and built successful careers, demonstrating that life after the role is viable.  The Kumari tradition is a deeply embedded socio-religious institution. It is factually inaccurate to frame it simply as the \"isolation\" of a child. It is a state-sanctioned, culturally sacred role with defined rituals, significant community support, and legally mandated provisions for the girl's education, family life, and long-term financial security. The debate around it highlights the global tension between cultural preservation and evolving child rights, but the practice itself has demonstrably adapted to modern norms.|||I ain't newar but also I think aaba yesto kura chai parents haru le vhaneko ramro hami third party le vhannu vhanda pani . look if kumari ko parents le chahanu hudaina vhani tyo kumari ko candidate mai na leraunu parni ho . so parents lai kehi problem xaina , kumari le as a normal human being ni basna paunu hunxa after completion so I think we are no one to question sodhna lai|||What about the tradition of marrying off daughters into the inlaws house?|||After giving this some thought question is of a philosophical one. What freedom does a child have?  What life does a child choose? Isn‚Äôt everyone forced and fed their parent‚Äôs beliefs?   Also, can you give some evidence of abuse? If not your post would be baseless and in attempt of defamation of our culture.  One Kumari‚Äôs time ended when she was just 12. How much do you remember of your life before you were 12? I asked myself the same question and the answer is not much.   I disagree with your claim that the Kumari‚Äôs are discarded. They are always welcome. What it shows is the core principle of Buddhism that nothing is permanent. All things, even being revered as the living goddess, comes to an end. It teaches humility, an art that is now lost in this modern time.

You‚Äôve engrained yourself with too much western influence and think that the culture needs to be reformed. Kumaris have friends, education, and the choice is with them and their families.

Khaire ko documentary haru herera brainrot kura nagara na. Not everyone is privileged to become kumari and nor they are selected randomly. The family members themself have to fill the form and there's a long running selection process. Only a certain clan of newar can become Kumari. There are lots of inhuman and child abusive traditions going on all over. In case of kumari they get highest level of love and respect. They can live with their parents, they can play, they can watch TV, they can even play video games. It would be better if you watch podcasts of ex kumaris it's really helpful. I used to think same like everyone calling this inhuman before but they are living the normal life as you and me. And the fact that you can't speak up being kumari is totally false, yes you can't but only in jatras and other religious ceremonies, do you speak up during sharad and other pujas(it's prohibited to talk during sharad if you don't know). Go visit sudurpaschim hundreds of girls are being raped during their chhaupadi bas. Go visit terai Muslim villages girls at the age of 15 are getting married and at the age of 21 they are booned with 3 childs. Ex Kumaris themself enjoy being kumari and love to live their that phase again. If they are fine, their parents are fine no need to talk about that. Now the rules and prohibitions are amended.

Yes, a Kumari is worshipped as a goddess now but when her time ends, how does a goddess step back into an ordinary life? How do peers treat her? How does she even make friends? 3. With isolation and the constant expectation to suppress emotions, what happens to her social, communication, and interpersonal skills? Who helps her navigate that later? 4. Does she ever get space to express her own feelings and thoughts or is silence part of the job description? 5. We‚Äôve all seen videos of new Kumari, some barely three years old, literally asleep in full dress during rituals. How on earth can a toddler be burdened with divine expectations when they can barely stay awake through it? 6. As Nepalis, many of us defend dal bhat tarkari because it‚Äôs what we grew up with it feels untouchable. (I know it‚Äôs not the same but for reference) For a Kumari, this role is all she has ever known. So how would she even recognise or articulate what she‚Äôs missed out on, when she never had the chance to experience it? 7. And let‚Äôs be honest do we really believe someone put on a pedestal that high, surrounded by cultural pressure, guilt, and shame, would openly talk about the negatives of being Kumari? Yes, things have changed there‚Äôs more education, some family contact,but none of that cancels out the developmental and human rights concerns we‚Äôre talking about.  And honestly, the comments here kind of prove the point: we were never really taught to think critically. Instead of having an actual discussion, people are throwing around ‚Äúbahun,‚Äù ‚ÄúChristian,‚Äù or ‚Äúother cultures‚Äù like that somehow answers the question. When we turn conversation into belittling, blaming, or name-calling, we‚Äôre not defending culture but normalising this behaviour. I mean how hard is it understand you can agree to disagree without all these?|||Actually the closest thing that happens in the west like this is children beauty pagents  AT LEAST, at the very least, this Kumari affects one child over a years. USA child beauty pageants produce so many|||I think this is so cruelüòû a kid should not be isolated from the society, and should not be sit there to just take photo with tourists ..|||People talking about normal childhood and growing up \"normal\", a lot of misconception here.  Goodness flows through Kumari.  She is worshipped for being the medium of taleju bhawani. They are taught that they as an individual are not god, but the goodness that flows through her is what makes her worshipped.  And calling Kumari as a \"virgin goddess\" is stupid and a complete disregard of religious belief. It's a literal translation not a literary translation.   A lot of misconceptions have already been debunked.  Therefore they are able to integrate back into society well. They have good societal support . They are mentored, taught and are well taken care of. They themselves have immence respect for their religion and tradition.  If you think being a Kumari is wrong, you simply look at other practices in other religions. Nuns are not allowed to marry or consummate. Denying the right to marry and consummate can be considered as an oppressive practices denying one from their human desires. In radical Islam, burka, multiple marriages, denial of human rights for wemen.  While such petty comparisons are stupid themselves, what I want to say is we are worshipping female power. We are actually looking at females as devine. Not simply blind worship.   Nothing about today's childhood is normal.  You see young boys and girls sent off to boarding schools as normal? It's more isolating depressing. Parents just sticking their child to an iPad, or a hyperactive parent forcing their child through multiple activities (music class, sports, extra activities) even when their child may not want to to them, and pushing their child to extremes, putting their child through ridiculously high expectations, so that they can fulfill own ego( yes I've seen it happen).  A lot is not normal in so called modern normal childhood.   A lot of narratives and propogandas have infiltrated our thinking. Be water and explore into the culture. A lot has been written about Kumari from a propogandist and religious infiltration viewpoint.  A lot has been written to criticize our culture and ostracize ourselves from our religion and culture. Beware.|||Yeah agreed I thought it was just culture as a child but now I see it as different|||Sadhguru has spoken about the Kumari tradition of Nepal. It is an understanding about God making.

Over last few days, I read some articles, listened to podcasts and was surprised to learn that Kumaris until 2000 A.D. were not given any education. That must have set those girls back and must have struggled to transition. A case was registered in high court of Nepal but the court didn't make decision against Kumari tradition but asked to reform. There have been quiet few reforms.

But let‚Äôs be real: he‚Äôs the only king after Prithvi Narayan Shah who actually did something that mattered for the survival of Nepal.    Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus ‚Äî with nine governments in ten years. That wasn‚Äôt democracy, it was chaos. Leaders were busy stabbing each other in the back while the nation stayed dirt poor, uneducated, and vulnerable. Tell me, what ‚Äústable democracy‚Äù exists when governments collapse every year? None. Mahendra saw this and did what no one else had the guts to do: he hit reset.    Yes, he dissolved parliament. Yes, he banned parties. And you know what? He was right to. Without stability, Nepal was on track to become India‚Äôs backyard project or another pawn in the Cold War. Mahendra‚Äôs Panchayat system gave the country one thing it desperately lacked: stability.    And let‚Äôs talk achievements:    He balanced India and China like a chess master. Without him, we‚Äôd have been swallowed by one side decades ago.    He pushed Nepal onto the global stage ‚Äî Non-Aligned Movement, a stronger UN presence, and an independent foreign policy.    He jump-started modernisation: roads, schools, universities, tourism. These are things no king before him, and very few leaders after him, have been able to deliver at that scale.    But historians? They love to cry about ‚Äúdemocracy dying in 1960.‚Äù These same historians never admit that the so-called ‚Äúdemocrats‚Äù of the 50s were busy running the country into the ground. It‚Äôs easy to glorify B.P. Koirala in hindsight, but Mahendra was the one cleaning up the mess in real time.    Here‚Äôs the hard truth: Mahendra was the only king who actually acted like a king ‚Äî a protector of sovereignty. Everyone after him either coasted on his legacy or failed miserably. Without him, Nepal might not even exist as the independent state it is today.    Call him authoritarian all you want, but facts don‚Äôt lie. After Prithvi Narayan Shah, King Mahendra was the only true king Nepal ever had.",

He saved Nepal from being a puppet of foreign countries. He was a gem.|||Its not an unpopular opinion though. Those who know history know how Progressive Mahendra was. One thing though, his rapid advancements did over heat a fledgling Nepalese economy which is why we needed to privatize our industries. But the privatization was a joke,   they privatized it too quickly and privatization advocates in Nepal did admit they made a huge mistake later on.|||Mahendra is a complicated figure. On one hand, he did keep Nepal intact at a time when regional instability and internal divisions could have easily spiraled out of control.  On the other, his coup dismantled the first democratic experiment and concentrated power in the monarchy, which created long-term issues that Nepal is still untangling today.   It‚Äôs less that historians hate admitting he saved Nepal, and more that they frame it as a tradeoff between short-term stability and long-term democratic development.|||Popular opinion. It's because of Prithvi Narayan Shah and King Mahendra that modern day Nepal even exists as a separate country in its current form. Otherwise there would not have even been an independent country known as Nepal.|||His authoritarian enforcement of the Nepali language and Hindu traditions on a diverse population that wanted nothing to do with them was one of the causes of the civil war that would follow.  He killed democracy in its crib and pulled us back into medieval institutions. Even if I were to hypothetically accept that he was a good ruler for the sake of argument, there is no guarantee and his heirs and his heirs‚Äô heirs would have been good rulers, which is why absolute monarchy fails. Any good that he might have done during his reign is negated by the fact that long term institutions are more important than charismatic rulers, and he ruined the institution of democracy. All the instability that we have faced since 2008- would have happened in the 1950s and we could have been a prosperous democracy by the present. This guy pulled us decades back.  It‚Äôs easy to look back at the past with rose tinted glasses and romanticize it, that is the first step on the road to fascism, but the truth of life, prosperity and happiness is in the future and progressive institutions.|||The problem with Monarchy in Nepal and everywhere else is that there are few good apples in 1 crore ropani orchard.  Except PN Shah, Mahendra and maybe Birendra (many sources call him spineless but I don't know), no one else were fit to rule. The country fell into Ranas dictatorship  because of Monrachy system failure.  So here we are, dealing with generational political trauma.|||A quick ChatGPT will give you some real perspective:  Most historians and political analysts agree that King Mahendra‚Äôs reasons were more of a pretext to consolidate royal power rather than genuine democratic concerns. Here‚Äôs why:  1. Political instability was exaggerated  Nepal‚Äôs first elected government (1959‚Äì1960) under B. P. Koirala had been in office for only 18 months.  While there were some administrative problems, it wasn‚Äôt long enough to judge the parliamentary system a failure.  Corruption and inefficiency existed, but not at the level Mahendra claimed.   2. Fear of losing monarchical dominance  The 1959 elections gave the Nepali Congress a clear majority.  Koirala‚Äôs government was popular and gaining legitimacy, which posed a direct threat to the king‚Äôs absolute authority.  Mahendra feared the monarchy would become a ceremonial institution like in India or Britain.   3. Foreign policy pretext  Koirala pursued a relatively independent foreign policy, maintaining balance between India and China.  Mahendra accused him of endangering Nepal‚Äôs sovereignty, but in reality, the king wanted direct control over diplomacy, which was vital for aid and recognition.   4. Use of \"underdeveloped society\" argument  Mahendra claimed that Nepalese people weren‚Äôt ‚Äúready‚Äù for democracy due to illiteracy and lack of experience.  This was partly true, but instead of strengthening democratic institutions, he abolished parties and built a system where only the king‚Äôs will mattered.   5. The Panchayat system benefited him most  Under Panchayat, all political power flowed through the king.  It created the image of \"guided democracy,\" but in practice, it was royal autocracy with no accountability.   üìå Conclusion: Mahendra used the excuses of instability, corruption, and national unity to justify a royal coup. The deeper reason was to preserve absolute monarchy and prevent Nepal from transitioning into a genuine parliamentary democracy.|||Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus, with nine governments in ten years. That wasn‚Äôt democracy, it was chaos.  LOL. The King chose PM. He was the one responsible.|||Yes man agreed. He is the guy who defined Nepal and Nepali people. He did a lot of great works for the country. But many people and our school books consider him as a dictator telling about how he banned political parties and not mention about the reforms and development made by him for the country. One of the greatest leader of our country King Mahendra!!|||Ali history paddam, 1959 ma first election vako ho tyo vanda aagadi sab PM king le choose garya ho, 1st election ko 1.5 years ma coup vako ho.|||But his policies are disastrous for Nepal till this day  He opened Nepal's border with India, opened free trade with India, allowed India to build its Army base in Lipulekh Limpiyadhura Kalapani since then these territories are occupied by India  He also forced Khas culture on Newaris and Janjatis which influenced them to become Communists|||Agreed!|||Will not let anyone discredit the blood of 17k Nepali|||We wouldn't have been swallowed by any side. Non-alignment was the default policy from the beggining, and B.P koirala would have continued that policy. Nepal would have 'modernized' without an iron-fisted dictatorship.|||Matrika literally wanted to suck cock of india..   He was puppet of India...while BP was good...Matrika and BP's power struggle caused mahendra to step in...and take all the powers..   Thats my unpopular opinion too.|||I agree with most of your points. But your point about 10 governments in nine years doesn't show the instability created by parties but by the monarchs. The monarchs were the ones that were making them unstable. The one time it seemed to be stable, he couped the government. That doesn't diminish the fact thought, that his rule saw probably the most balanced foreign policy of Nepal, where Nepal truly stood out as a sovereign nature. I still believe that had Mahendra controlled a bit of his authoritarian ways and worked together with B.P. Koirala, Nepal would have been in a much better position that it is currently. Both of them are the best leaders Nepal had post P.N. Shah. It might be an unpopular opinion but I think P.N. Shah might be more important historically, but these two are probably the best leaders Nepal got, even better than P.N. Shah.|||Unpopular hoina, brain-dead opinion.

Mahendra model of nation-building was \"one religion, one custom, one language.\" Hindu orthodoxy was enforced as state ideology, treating non-Hindu communities as second-class. Nepali was imposed as the only legitimate language, sidelining rich traditions like Maithili, Newar, Tharu, Tamang, Limbu, etc. This wasn't genuine unity - it was control through forced uniformity. What looked like stability was in fact suppression. That brittle foundation is why today's Nepal wrestles with federalism, ethnic assertion, and identity politics: democracy didn't invent division, it revealed what had long been silenced.  The Koiralas, born and educated in Banaras, were accused of being \"too Indian.\" But Nepal had no universities, no political freedom, no space for intellectual growth - precisely because the tyrants had closed those doors. Should they be condemned for seeking ideas in India, or credited for importing the democratic imagination Nepal lacked?  So the paradox is clear:  Mahendra centralized the state but weakened society.|||First question, why was Nepal unstable during those years? And second more important question, if stability was the most important thing for us, why did he take over from a parliament that had a 2/3 majority and the government was led by THE BP Koirala? There was a little chance that the Koirala govt would have toppled and was doing good work..  Yes, there were some long term projects under him that were very good for Nepal. There‚Äôs no denying that and kudos to him. But he was authoritarian, there is no denying that either.

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. üò≠üò≠2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye üò≠|||3 brsa vo dashign namanako|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

I know that indian media is misreporting the revolution as silly protests to reinstate scrapy social media and belittle the ambition of GenZ. Media wants the status quo in India forever. They belittled the Bangladesh protests similarly and painted it as Muslims vs Hindus in Bangladesh. They paint a high opinion of the fugitive Shaik Hasina but curse Nobel laureate Mohammed Yunus. Indian media is the judge, jury and executioner of all the happenings in Nepal, Bangladesh, Srilanka and Pakistan. According to them, India is Ramarajya but others were Raavan rajya. India has become a dead democracy in the past decade. We have no jobs, extremely costly education and no health. We are just scrapping by but nothing to show as the media paints cooked up Indian GDP.

It‚Äôs simple.|||Disclaimer: I am not a Balen supporter or cultist.  This post is conflicting for me. But, the post is characterizing the man based on:  1. What the man didn‚Äôt do or didn‚Äôt say. 2. What people expected him to do.  The man himself has said enough in his posts.   It‚Äôs what, he DIDN‚ÄôT do that impresses me the most about him. Saying ‚ÄúNo‚Äù is harder than saying ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, when everyone wanted him to say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.  (Think about this.)  He put out only a couple of posts, which I think served as guide posts during the revolution.   1. He was the first widely known public figure (that I know) who defined who Gen Z was and gave his support to the protest. 2. When the tempo rose, he clarified that Gen Z should lead, he accepted Sushila even when all of his cultists were going crazy about making him the interim PM.  Removing himself from the picture, brought focus back on the revolution and the task ahead, rather than turn the confusion situation, even more confusing with a popularity contest as a side gig.   There is a lot of things to think about and I think in time we can all make sense of it all.   That‚Äôs my two paisa about him.|||Leading KTM municipality vs leading the nation are totally different. The followers of Balen urging and rushing him to lead 'right now' and come out by 2PM are the same people who will criticize him within one year if he were to be them PM someday. They don't have patience and want to see changes immediately.  Personally, I would like to see him running in the upcoming election as deputy/vice roles first and not immediate PM role...assuming how parties will be formed and if there are any good lead independent candidate who will run with him. He's one of those few worthy to be PM but this is not his peak yet. He just became a mayor like 3 years ago and he still has a lot to show to the general public. If and when he wins to the election, it will be his peak and he has high chances of being a two term PM...assuming two term limit will be in place hopefully. Time will tell.|||GenZ aren't immune to celeb worship culture.|||Hami Nepal has already stated it was part of a plan and they want balen for 5 years.

Yes it is definitely an opportunistic behaviour by balen. But how is this behaviour wrong and how is taking over PM position now and securing interim govt now and not taking part in politics for next 5 years do any good to the country.    He is practicing patience to achieve the goal he desires and what people actually wants from a young leader like him.

Give it some time and our voices will get echoed.|||If there‚Äôs one thing old political leaders never learned, it was how to handle criticism. The moment anyone spoke up, they tried to shut it down and let‚Äôs not even start on the behavior of their hardcore supporters(jholey as we call them).  Even leaders like Balen need to address this with their own supporters, as do all the new representatives entering the upcoming elections. They must say publicly that they welcome criticism, will reflect on it, and use it as a tool for improvement. Leaders should make it clear to their base: don‚Äôt bully or silence people for simply asking questions or raising concerns. Do not perform character assassination against someone just for criticizing. After all, in a democracy, freedom of speech is our right.  At the same time, we the general public also carry responsibility. We need to recognize the difference between constructive criticism and defamation. What we must not do is fall for propaganda, spread rumors, or engage in baseless character assassination.  And if we realize that our criticism or questioning was wrong, we should have the courage to apologize in the same way we raised the question. After all, apologizing will never make you small. It‚Äôs just a simple five letter word: ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù A word that can and should be spoken from both sides.|||Just because you‚Äôre against the system, doesn‚Äôt make you Balen-Supporters. Balen has no experience. Balen should wait and gain some experience. Criticism is a backbone of democracy and one must welcome it.|||EXACTLY. They lack this ability to critically analyse any action of any leader. Like no one is perfect and no one is a good. Let's be honest. Let's criticize people for their actions. People should be held accountable for their actions. Most importantly, leaders who run our nation. If we don't point out their wrongdoings, will they ever stop? Nepalese have such a bheda mindset, istg. Let's be more aware and let's know how to discern leaders and their actions.   By criticizing these leaders, we aren't hating on them. We're trying to bring awareness so that they won't repeat the same thing again and can do things better for the country.|||They need to be aware party KO jhole become jhole because they were andabhakt of party leader ( just like they are blind follower of balen rn)|||I think holding politicians accountable is crucial.

I see people thanking Balen for this movement and saying he was the reason this movement happened and succeeded and all after Sushila Karki became interim PM, and this made me very sad for actual people who started the movement and also faced the consequences and this was even more big realization for me for how blind youth and supporters these days are and this concerns me even more for future|||This. This is what I‚Äôve been saying for some time. Like the post says, I‚Äôve also been labeled as a party ko jhole and what not. Even here in this sub, people have called me jhole lol just because I questioned him.  I am a Balen supporter. I supported him and did my part by sharing about his campaign on social media and making everyone aware about it. And I was super happy when he won, I still am. But I‚Äôve been criticizing him on various points that I find valid. The top one is communication.  During the election, he constantly criticized Bidya Sundar (the previous mayor) for not communicating publicly. He even said that once he became mayor, he wouldn‚Äôt be like that and would stay in constant touch. He proposed starting a ‚ÄòMayor with the Public‚Äô TV program and even set aside a budget for it, but nothing has happened. He hasn‚Äôt given a single interview.  And then come his jhole supporters who always argue with the same line: ‚ÄòPailai kei chaieko ho.‚Äô With that logic, we should never question anyone. Just look at how Balen has become now, he just posts one-sided, no-context Facebook statuses and nothing else.|||Balen is a hypocrite in my opinion, like he encouraged the protest and even promised to provide a safe and secure environment for the protest but when things turned south he vanished like horn from a donkeys head|||Finally someone spoke about this, belun has literally become a god complex among some people out there, which is kinda concerning, the only time he speaks is to not let his adhabhatka interfere in every other stuff out there.

Moreover, Sagar Dhakal‚Äôs brother has been working actively to eradicate the dictatorship of these political parties. Maybe your parents are bootlicking those rotten political parties, so you only see what Balen has never done and will never do. Just because he supported the movement does not mean he said he wants to become prime minister. You must understand that he posts only a few things because his words are weapons. One word from him has many consequences in such a movement. He is very clever and very wise; unlike Harka Sampang, though I like Harka as a person.

If Balen had come out saying he‚Äôs ready to lead, a lot of people would‚Äôve jumped in claiming he planned the whole movement and just used Gen Z for his own benefit. That‚Äôs probably why in his statements, he keeps stressing that this is Gen Z‚Äôs movement and that the government will be formed by them. imo, staying out of it was the smartest move he could have made.  I‚Äôm all for questioning and criticizing leaders. I agree that its a problem if you dont want to do it. But when someone has shown that they are dedicated, not corrupt, and actually get things done, you‚Äôve got to give them some benefit of the doubt. Save the tough questions for real concerns. Dont critise just because you think no one can ever be good enough.|||Yes Balen has fallen badly as he didnt seem to care about the youths when they needed him the most. But, when we are talking about selection of interim PM, he did the right thing by not coming out. If he had come out, more number of the youngsters would have gone to Army Headquarters causing a ruckus. Thankfully, that didnt happen. It could have been worse than Harka dai case. It still remains a fact that he could have interacted with us when he we needed him the most.|||such simple world if it did exist why would so many intellects be in the world of politics.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**¬†The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**¬†If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**¬†If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**¬†If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn‚Äôt make you brave‚Äîit makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that‚Äîsurrounded by a wave of so-called ‚Äúyouths‚Äù who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let‚Äôs not sugarcoat it‚Äîthe so-called Gen Z ‚Äúwarriors‚Äù hiding in the mob weren‚Äôt heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country‚Äôs social fabric. He still can‚Äôt step foot in certain countries because he‚Äôs internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he‚Äôs propped up as a ‚Äúleader.‚Äù  Let‚Äôs be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn‚Äôt an accident‚Äîit was a setup. While Deuba‚Äôs family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don‚Äôt get it twisted‚Äîthose sharpshooters in the crowd weren‚Äôt just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres‚Äîformer insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let‚Äôs stop pretending this was ‚Äúthe people rising up.‚Äù It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist‚Äîthe one who drowned this nation in blood‚Äîwalks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don‚Äôt for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn‚Äôt that Deuba suffered humiliation‚Äîthe real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn‚Äôt a flower; he‚Äôs a weed choking the soil of Nepal‚Äôs democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too na√Øve to realize they‚Äôre being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||Prachanda and Baburam are India's puppet.

This has been ongoing for more than two decades. Behind the few visible figures, there are countless others who have either assisted them or benefitted through their association‚Äîranging from major brands in Nepal to traders. For example, Sher Bahadur Deuba‚Äôs son and his sanitary pad importing company stand as an illustration.  They have institutionalized corruption by appointing foreign ambassadors based on party loyalty and financial gains, extending even to the transfer of bureaucrats to preferred locations in exchange for bribes and other undue benefits. The problem is not limited to the political system alone; bureaucrats, too, require checks and balances. A mechanism must be established to regulate the power of bureaucrats over politicians. Since bureaucrats are permanent stakeholders, their influence is even greater. One effective way to mitigate this is to appoint domain experts as ministers‚Äîfor instance, a professional civil engineer as a minister cannot be misled about the cost estimates of a construction project.  There remains much to be done. Moreover, these political parties will attempt to form alliances before elections, bringing forward the same candidates and restoring the same exploitative system. Therefore, the first and most meaningful reform must be a change in the electoral process, with the inclusion of a ‚ÄúNOTA‚Äù (None of the Above) option.  Further accountability can be ensured by eliminating political appointments to certain positions. At present, even temporary (karar) appointments are made based on party affiliation rather than merit. As a result, even highly qualified experts are compelled to seek political approval. The recent appointments of Vice-Chancellors at B.P. Koirala Institute in Dharan and Gangalal Hospital are prime examples.  In addition to these issues, several other structural flaws persist. What we urgently require is a comprehensive systemic reform|||Gen Z laid them in the grave, and now they're shoveling the dirt themselves.|||# How to make Gen Z movement bullet proof ?

If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?‚Äù  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still don‚Äôt have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we don‚Äôt have the right connections.  We don‚Äôt get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, it‚Äôs still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? That‚Äôs probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  We‚Äôre out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor people‚Äôs kids not boil?  On top of that, there‚Äôs already so much frustration bottled up inside youth.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**¬†The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**¬†If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**¬†If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**¬†If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Army should not interfere in internal problems|||‡§Ü‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡•Ä‡§≤‡•á ‡§ï‡§§‡§ø ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ó‡§∞‡•ç‡§õ‡§®‡•ç ‡§®‡§æ‡§ó‡§∞‡§ø‡§ï‡§≤‡§æ‡§à? ‡§ú‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ ‡•®/‡•® ‡§ù‡§æ‡§™‡§°, ‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§π‡•Ä ‡§†‡§æ‡§â‡§Å‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ã‡§≤‡§®‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§ñ‡§ü‡§ø‡§è‡§ï‡§æ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§≠‡§è ‡§¨‡•á‡§π‡•ã‡§∏ ‡§®‡§π‡•Å‡§®‡•ç‡§ú‡•á‡§≤ ‡§ï‡•Å‡§ü‡•ç‡§®‡•á ‡§•‡§ø‡§è ‡•§|||asti belai ma aayera yo radaban harlai yesari handeko bhaye singhadurbar jaldainathyo|||Obviously Nepal is not a democracy.

            "body": "I‚Äôm from Sri Lanka. I lived through our 2022 Aragalaya. People around the world respected us because we fought the system without destroying our own country.  At Galle Face, we protested for 124 days straight. Over 100,000 people joined at times. But here‚Äôs what made it different:  We camped peacefully on Galle Face Green. There were kitchens feeding thousands, medical centers to help anyone sick or injured, book libraries, free internet, and even coffee corners. We built a community, not chaos.  We sang songs, danced, made art, and watch movies ‚Äî yet we never destroyed property. Some critics complained we were ‚Äútoo playful,‚Äù but that didn‚Äôt stop us from being fair, disciplined, and organized.  When we finally entered the President‚Äôs House, we didn‚Äôt loot. Not a single priceless portrait worth millions was stolen. Not a single fire was set. People laughed, swam, sang ‚Äî but respected the place because it belonged to the people.  Even when ministers‚Äô thugs attacked us, the world saw who was violent and who wasn‚Äôt. That moral high ground is what gave us victory.   Now, I look at Nepal and I see motorbikes burned, parliament on fire, leaders‚Äô houses torched. Brothers, ask yourselves: is that really a fight for justice‚Äîor are you burning your own tax money, your own people‚Äôs livelihoods?  Because here‚Äôs the bitter truth:  The cost of every destroyed building, every burned vehicle, will come back to you in higher taxes, worse inflation, more suffering.  If you destroy what belongs to the people, the world will stop listening to your message and only see the flames.  Today you may cheer, but tomorrow you‚Äôll be paying for the very damage you caused.   Please think back. Don‚Äôt let your anger blind you. Sri Lanka proved you can bring down corrupt leaders without burning your country. Hold on to your moral strength. Don‚Äôt make your children pay for your rage.  From one struggling nation to another: don‚Äôt turn your fight for freedom into self-destruction.",

Under Nepal‚Äôs Constitution, elections must be held within six months if a stable government cannot be formed.

Harka and Mahabir for direct involvement in restorations. Sagar Dhakal flexible in advisory and reformation (But doubt due to links with RSP) .

The president on her cabinet's recommendation dissolves the house of Representatives, 5. Her cabinet carries forward the corruption investigation and reconstruction. 6.

            "body": "The country is burning, and Shrinkhala uploaded a 34 minute PR reel. I just finished watching 11 minutes of the 34 long video Shrinkhala Khatiwada uploaded to ‚Äúexplain her silence‚Äù and I had to stop, not because I was bored, but because it was painful to watch someone so out of touch, so self-absorbed, and so deep into their own victim complex that they‚Äôve become completely blind to reality. I‚Äôm making this post and hoping people don‚Äôt fall for the carefully packaged sob story. First off is the immediate red flag that there is zero acknowledgment of her privilege. She talks about having a simple life, and claims her parents worked hard for her and her brother. That they had a house with 3 bedrooms, didn‚Äôt have to pay rent, had a good upbringing and she still thinks that counts as simple. And that‚Äôs the only privilege she‚Äôs ever had. That alone shows how detached she is from what ‚Äúaverage‚Äù really means in Nepal. She never even briefly reflects on the fact that her father is a powerful politician, and instead, she makes it sound like she built her life from scratch. It‚Äôs baffling.  She genuinely believes her name shouldn‚Äôt have been dragged into any of the national discourse and says that people were using her name just to get content and she literally says something along the lines of, if people got attention that way, ‚Äúso be it.‚Äù That‚Äôs her takeaway. The entire nation is in shambles, people are angry, protesting, waking up to decades of injustice and she still can't look beyond her own image. It's almost unbelievable how someone can watch a country crumble and somehow make it all about themselves. She positions herself as the one being targeted ‚Äúfor no reason‚Äù and says she wanted to fight back but was too overwhelmed by people turning against her. Again, not a word about why people might be justifiably critical, just a one-sided narrative of being attacked unfairly.  She says TikTok posts were changing the narrative of her entire life. But does she stop for a second to reflect on why people are questioning her? No. Instead, she keeps doubling down on this idea that she‚Äôs misunderstood, and that her critics are just trying to take her down for no reason. There is no realization that being the daughter of a well-known and allegedly corrupt politician is a reason why people hold you accountable especially when you‚Äôve benefitted from that influence. That‚Äôs not defamation. That‚Äôs public scrutiny. Then comes the part where she calls herself ‚Äúself-made.‚Äù And at that point, I had to pause and ask how? You‚Äôre born into a powerful and connected family. You have access to platforms, resources, and networks that most Nepalis can‚Äôt even dream of. And yet here you are, trying to claim some underdog story? She goes on to brag about her accomplishments, how she‚Äôs made so much money, and how people apparently can‚Äôt handle the fact that someone as young as her is so successful. As if that‚Äôs why people are questioning her. No, Shrinkhala, people aren‚Äôt criticizing you because you‚Äôre young and successful. They‚Äôre angry because you‚Äôre trying to rewrite your origin story while skipping over the very privileges that made your success possible.  She even says she never felt the need to justify herself to anyone before because ‚Äúsatya ko saath cha.‚Äù That‚Äôs when I realized how deep her delusion runs. She genuinely believes she‚Äôs standing on moral high ground, and yet her video is filled with nothing but self-praise, image management, and emotional manipulation. She talks about being ‚Äúsatya‚Äù while ignoring every contradiction, every unfulfilled promise, and every instance where she stayed silent when it mattered. Then she says if she doesn‚Äôt defend herself, then ‚Äúthe rest of the world will write her narrative.‚Äù Again, it‚Äôs about her. Not the truth, not justice, not accountability, not the people, but her narrative. The country is collapsing under the weight of corruption, and her priority is that her public image might be misunderstood. She even says her future generations will suffer if she doesn‚Äôt clear her image like that‚Äôs the greatest injustice here. Not the looted resources, not the betrayed citizens, but her family name. She thanks those who ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt unfollow her‚Äù and those who supported her privately. That‚Äôs her criteria for support which is social media metrics. Then she starts talking about her life story, narrates her autobiography, and once again, takes the opportunity to list her accomplishments and how she was a topper, won design competitions, etc. But does she ever stop to think about why she got those platforms? Does she reflect on how being a politician‚Äôs daughter might have given her access others don‚Äôt have? Of course not. Instead, she paints herself as someone with a ‚Äúsmall-town mindset‚Äù while talking about winning designer competitions. How many small-town Nepalis get to do that? There‚Äôs such a massive contradiction in her story, and she doesn‚Äôt even seem to see it.  She even says ‚Äúma maa nai kei kami thiyo hola‚Äù and tries to sound reflective, but it‚Äôs just another way to victimize herself. As if people criticizing her now are just reinforcing her lifelong feeling of being ‚Äúnot enough.‚Äù Then she addresses people who accuse her of not following through on the promises and ideals she expressed during Miss Nepal. And honestly, that criticism is completely valid. If you stood on a national stage making tall claims about development and change, then yes, people will hold you accountable. That‚Äôs not trolling. That‚Äôs responsibility. And finally, the most absurd part that she says she never had any power. How? You were Miss Nepal and are one of the most followed influencers in the country, daughter of a powerful political figure, a Harvard graduate. And you don‚Äôt have power? Then who does? If you truly believe you never had any power to make a difference, then what was the point of all the public positioning, speeches, and social impact projects? That‚Äôs not humility. That‚Äôs denial.  She tries to play down her travel experiences too. Says that before Miss Nepal, she had only been to India, and that‚Äôs ‚Äúnot an achievement,‚Äù and that her Hong Kong trip immediately after the pageant was the only international travel till then. Then she brings up her UK trip, saying it was funded by youth, and she didn‚Äôt really get to enjoy it because she was only there for work, so apparently, that doesn‚Äôt count as privilege either. Every step of the way, she undermines and downplays her privilege, refuses to acknowledge her advantages, and continues to position herself as a victim. And all of this? Is just the first 11 minutes. I honestly couldn‚Äôt keep watching. It became clear very quickly that this wasn‚Äôt a sincere explanation. It was a 34 minute long PR video just to clear her image, filled with narcissistic reflections, gaslighting, and image control disguised as vulnerability. I really hope people don‚Äôt fall for victimized narrative. Please don‚Äôt.",

We thought she was genuine, we supported her, and that‚Äôs the only reason she ever got those PR packages and brand deals. She‚Äôs not ‚Äúself-made‚Äù.

Like cleaning garbage on the street or starting a free tuition for street children. We should make heroes of those ordinary people. We should also start questioning our perception of beauty. Why is Shrinkhala Khadka considered *anything*? Is she physically appealing or sexually affable or glamorous? Why should she have *any* followers, to begin with? Then we should start questioning the perception of our 'beauty standard'. Why should only fair skinned, better looking people get millions of followers. It's not going to be easy but we should always question. If we play the same pop culture game and dig deep into how propaganda and algo can be manipulated then we can perhaps start asking questions like the way you have did.   It's not easy because it's a biased platform where heritage money and incumbent power are in bed with the forces of propaganda (e.g. Insta algorithm). Its a hard battle to win.

There are way worse people than her in Nepal. In my view, arson who damaged the private and public properties are way worse than her and legally criminals. Similarly, there are better faces of nepo babies - the OG nepo baby, the ex-king.  I am saddened that there is no empathy. Literally, her house was burned down by an angry mob. Have some empathy.  Nepal has systematic corruption at every level. Everyone has either given or taken bribes.  There are minimal financial opportunities within Nepal. It makes financially more sense for an honest person to seek employment abroad. By destroying businesses and targeting the elites, the country will witness even less investment. It needs money to create investments for more jobs. Ironic thing was people who protested showed their own corruption by looting private companies - which again legally is a crime.   If I can have empathy for arsons and thieves who destroyed and looted public and private properties, have some empathy for another Nepali who was threatened and attacked viciously online just for being more successful than most people.|||If you guys really think she got what she deserved - having her old parents house.

You have a very good skill set.|||dfdfd|||dfdfdfgfgfg|||Need a TL;DR version of this too|||Why are people so jealous about her success?|||If it isn't a girl crying and saying she didn't mean to do/support a crime and everyone in her comments going \"yess, more power to you dijju üòò\"|||Disagreed . She won many competitions in school , always an A student , won beauty pageant because she deserved it . Not because she was some politicians daughter. The majority of the people didn‚Äôt even know who her father is . It‚Äôs easy to blame her , easy to hate her now , but that‚Äôs the sad part of brainwashed social media freaks who are on their phones 24-7 . Her point was that she never lived a luxurious life until she was Miss Nepal , because that‚Äôs the truth . Weren‚Äôt people blaming her for living off tax payers money ? That‚Äôs why she is defending it with proof . When the whole nation attacks you , questions your integrity it‚Äôs natural to be defensive . I‚Äôm not against you or her , I am just saying she is not going to say 100% of what you all wanna hear . She is human , she gave her reason as to the reason why didn‚Äôt speak up as she was targeted with so much hate and rape threats. And the privilege you‚Äôre talking about , would have probably agreed with you if you were talking about Jayvir guy. ¬†But why aren‚Äôt people targeting him as well . Most of the nepokids or so called elite people don‚Äôt even know a world outside of Kathmandu , can‚Äôt speak fluent Nepali . People connected with Shrinkhala from the beginning because she spoke like one of us , was grounded . And this whole point of not acknowledging her privilege . What part of privilege she used to win Miss Nepal ? Anybody can participate in the pageant - regardless of who your parents are . It‚Äôs easy to pinpoint others, especially a public figure , especially a woman public figure , and you know it‚Äôs so easy to spread negativity. And at this time when the whole comment section is flown with negative comments about her , you expect her to say all the Right words , sentences - who are you all ? Can you all focus on how better you can be as human beings instead of being so wild in this game ? Haven‚Äôt you never made a mistake in your life ? What good are you getting in being so critical of another public figure and expecting her to say all the right things that belongs to your narrative. Nobody is perfect . Time will always reveal the truth . Stop spreading negative. If people wanna like her support her , let them . If you don‚Äôt , just stop spreading hate - it only drains you man¬†|||I don't quite know what Gen Z's problem is with Shrinkhala.. we ourselves loved her, we voted for her, we spent our money to send her to international platforms, we cheered for her success. And then she did succeed. She made millions as a result through brands, sponsorships, youtube, etc. If anything she is a smart business woman who capitalized her fame into actual money. Then she got married to the son of Kantipur. She goes on expensive foreign trips with him. She is the daughter-in-law of the most influential media company.  What is really our problem with her? What do we want from her? Are we jealous she became rich and famous? Are we mad at her because both her parents are CPN UML politicians? Are we mad at her for marrying with a rich guy? Are we mad at her because she carried around an expensive label bag? Are we mad at her because she did not single handedly end corruption like she said she wanted to 10 years back in a fucking beauty pageant? What do you want Shrinkhala to tell the world? Yes she is privileged? Yes she married into a well-off family? Yes she went to Harvard?   What is it really? We need to be really clear about these conversations first before dragging someone down.|||Enough has been said about this girl. Let's close this chapter, ignore and move on.|||Not a single shred of self-realization and the level of denial of privilege is just whole another level.  It is/was too easy to fool people in social media. She will bounce back coz of all the simps and biggest of them all, Sisan Baniya. Sisan baniya, what a joke you've become.|||She cannot stick to one story. She used to go around Harvard telling everyone that she received a prestigious Nepal government scholarship to fund her education. She lied about receiving the scholarship s she can appear smart amongst other students who got there on their own merit. She kept quiet for a long time when Nepali people asked her about her educational expenses. Now, all of a sudden, she is claiming she funded it with her own influencer money.¬†",

They should work on keeping peace in the streets, addressing those who try to cause chaos, exposing and punishing any infiltrators if they exist, and recovering the documents and data we‚Äôve lost. It‚Äôs also important to let the country run smoothly, stop outsiders from taking advantage, reduce bribery and misleading acts during the election, and rebuild trust between the police and citizens.

Who is going to build the country brick by brick? It is so easy to burn everything to burn things down not build it up. Our hearts are crying.¬†|||Yeah it was a series of unfortunate events. From what I understand, the protests were originally supposed to be peaceful but that all changed when the police shot non-violent protestors. At that point, the protestors wanted vengeance, and chaos ensued. No one thought the police would shoot at protestors, so the situation understandably turned chaotic.  I was rooting for the protestors and I felt so cathartic watching them:  - beat the shit out of deuba and his wife  - drag the finance minister out onto the streets in his underwear  - burn the politicians' houses and reveal stacks and stacks of money   But then things went too far when someone decided to:  - burn public government buildings (e.g. central bank, singha durbar, parliament, supreme Court). People complain that the politicians waste their tax money, and yet they go and destroy public buildings, which will take years (and taxpayers' money) to rebuild.  - burn hotels and resorts (e.g. Hilton). There were innocent people there including tourists.  - release criminals from prisons. This is the most egregious and low IQ move I've ever seen like what on earth were they thinking? Now there are armed criminals and opportunists roaming the streets, robbing banks and businesses.  - use discord chat to decide who the \"leader\" of the Gen Z protestors is lol. Discord. The glorified online chatroom where anyone can join and spam propaganda, and sow discord (pun not intended). I joined the server to see what they were doing and... It's exactly what I expected -- trolling, spamming, rage-baiting, everyone talking all at once but nobody listening, etc. What a mess. Why was there no moderation? Why weren't there bots that detected and prevented spam messages? People are deciding on an interim PM as if they're choosing the best answer on a multiple choice question on an exam lmao. What a joke.|||Peaceful protest my ass.  They were all so happy the next day when people starting burning politicians house. Their social echo chamber was full of influencers trying to locate and burn the politicians. Airport ma drone attack gar re, ambulance roki roki her re. The herd was fully enjoying the violence.

Hamro protest ta peaceful thiyo re.  Don't you think the people who were barbaric enough to burn women alive and mercilessly kill policemen were capable enough to burn Singadurbar and government offices.   They wanted to have it all without losing anything. They wanted revolution without any cost. Didn't they know that revolution requires large sacrifices, civil wars last for many years and cost thousand of lives. But this revolution cost us more than lives: the country itself.|||It's true, people are just as problematic as their leaders. We feel hopeless|||What was necessary happened, but at the same time, things escalated, and a lot of unnecessary things happened as well. Whats done is done, there is no way to salvage the milk that has boiled over. Please let us stop with the blame game and finger pointing here.   Nobody is perfect and not everything will be perfect, but the young generation did start something with good intentions. Let's not let he crazy ones who did wrong things dictate the movement. Now is the time to get together and and make better choices moving forward and not go back to the same mindset that nothing will change, blame the other, and sit doing nothing ourselves.   In life an opportunity to start over does not come easily, so we should urge everyone to stop the violence, pause and think properly and make decisions that will work for every working people.|||[removed]|||Indeed 42.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**¬†The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**¬†If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**¬†If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**¬†If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||What kind of bullshit post is this? Do you think revolution is easy?

            "body": "We all know most ISP here lock the router and dont give any access to the web management. As a devops practitioner and someone who is very invested in homelabbing and selfhosting, locked router was my biggest achilles heels.   Requirement: A secondary router, you main router will stop working and secondary router will only work through LAN1 port.   Solution: All you have to do is create a ticket on vianet app stating \"Turn the router into bridge/modem only mode\". Someone will call you back, just ask them username and password for PPPOE and use your secondary router to configure through PPPOE instead of DHCP. Tada!!! you now have full control over your router.   Bonus 1: You can flash openwrt with Luci web interface and you will be able to configure anything you can think of. extra advantage is you can configure mesh routing without needing a special router. I have managed to easily flash it on my Mi router and a old tp link router, search for guides depending on your model or ask Claude or Gpt to search specifically for your router model.   Bonus 2: Vianet gives you globally accessible IPV6. That means you are free from CGNAT. Use this to access your home services without needing any relay like Cloudflare Tunnel or Tailscale VPN. Direct connection means no extra latency and maxed bandwidth and you can use this to host online game servers to play with your friends!! But for some reason Worldlink doesnt connect sometimes. Ncell and ClassicTech seems to have no problem tho. I am not sure if NTC offers IPV6.  Bonus 3: Host a adguard DNS server and configure your openwrt to use it as your default DNS server. This way you will have adblocking for your whole network. Your parents and old grannies wont have to see ads no more (wont work with Youtube app - use revance) and it keeps them safe from online phishing and malwares. You can also set some static ip and adguard to block some websites like gambling and pornography if there are minors in your household.   Disadvantage: The only downside of this is your main router will turn pretty much useless. Internet wont work through wireless and extra ports. So dont forget the vianet tech support to turn off the DHCP and wireless on the main router. Since my secondary router also has 2 ports only I had to invest some money on extra gigabyte switch.   I know some of you will appreciate this so this is my appreciation and giving back to this community. enjoy and have fun!! Happy Dashain!!!

Government should have a very strict consumer protection law which include modification of DNS in ISP issued router.  P.S. I recommend to use nextdns as it allows more flexible configuration and selective lists to block or allow sites. It has free quota of 300k queries but it is enough for 3-4 users who use internet all day as most sites normal people use are the same 3/4 sites these days.|||NO WAYYY. i didn't bother to ask them about modem mode LMAOOO. i hope worldlink lets me do the same. i plan to have a virtualized router and AP for wireless, then ipv6 port forwarding.|||Guys haru k gardai xau ho , homelab ki ???

I already have a secondary Mi 4a router with OpenWRT + Adblock + HTTPS DNS Proxy configured. I'll create a ticket right now. However, a question on IPV6, does it need a separate ticket or I will get the IPV6 after turning the ISP's router into bridge/modem only mode?|||I mean you don't even have to do anything about the main vianet router, you can just turn off the wifi of it and use secondary Mi Router as the main thing.|||Good job on this. Did it impact your internet speed in any way?   Also, directly exposing your local network and devices through IPv6 is not really a good idea. Make sure to reverse proxy it or add additional layers of authentication like TailScale. Or, you can setup usage of keys for SSH and fail2ban for access control limits. I have a setup that works without the need for a dedicated IPv6 and it‚Äôs much safer ngl.|||And what about nettv, does it also work after this?|||Ipv6 is being implemented in NTC, old BRAS are being replaced to support it|||Nokia ko worldlink router xa euta tara lock xa any solution?|||Hmm.

So I have a camera that allows remote viewing. However, when I connect the camera to Vianet, remote viewing doesn't work and I need to be within my home network to view the feed through the app.  The remote feed viewing works in Worldlink and Ncell's mobile data.

            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada‚Äôs classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.¬†  We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking‚Äìmuch to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in¬† Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate -¬†the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala‚Äôs approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.¬†  Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn‚Äôt mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‚Äòhelp‚Äô. One time, she even said airily, ‚ÄúI wash my own dishes, you know.‚Äù She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala‚Äìa beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth‚Äìlingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don‚Äôt intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‚Äònepo babies‚Äô who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).¬†  Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It‚Äôs a troubling idea to think that despite what‚Äôs happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

And a few after she became miss nepal... I can somewhat vouch for the \"I'm busy with this and that... Can you help me with this\" part...  People around her always had the same feedback.. and I quote as I recall \"Euta kaam pani garna parexaina yo kt lai.. jahile ni help help vanxa...  help magne pro vikhari..\"  üòÇ (she barely does a thing on her own, always keeps asking for help , she like pro-beggar ..)   I never liked her naak ma singan adke jasto boli.. And always felt she has a cunning personality that clings over you until she can no more use you for her advantage..  Sisan literally dodged a  bullet.. all thanks to her greed though..|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn‚Äôt some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake ‚Äúbeauty with brains‚Äù narrative. Do you guys remember Niti‚Äôs big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let‚Äôs not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala‚Äôs prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it‚Äôs her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let‚Äôs be real- Sisan wasn‚Äôt perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they‚Äôd known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn‚Äôt even exist. This just proves it- they weren‚Äôt just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can‚Äôt just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala‚Äôs career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav‚Äôs narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What‚Äôs the lesson we can learn from here ?  Karma is real af & money can‚Äôt give you lifelong happiness, night Redditors|||Wish we had more tea like this on all nepo babies.|||She didn't get any fucking scholarship from the Nepali government.

Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don‚Äôt even make sense to begin with. Don‚Äôt know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don‚Äôt even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It‚Äôs so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It‚Äôs astounding what the world has come to and it‚Äôs deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can‚Äôt be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn‚Äôt she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It‚Äôs better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has. It‚Äôs disheartening!|||[deleted]|||What do you expect from a pageant queen?

Every move, every word, every connection seems like part of a bigger calculation. While most people get dragged through the mud on social media, she somehow stays a step ahead. Of all platforms, she was clever enough to pull the LinkedIn card first. That‚Äôs not by accident, it‚Äôs calculation. She knows the bashing on Tiktok or Instagram doesn‚Äôt matter as long as her professional side stays spotless, especially where she might work with people internationally who will never know the side of her life in Nepal that‚Äôs been exposed and torn apart ever since the truth came out.  It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs playing this endless game of Ludo, always climbing the ladder, polishing her image as she goes. But at the same time, you can‚Äôt help but feel she‚Äôs only ever a roll away from hitting 98 and sliding right back down the snake.|||We wont know if what you claim is true. But I wouldn't be surprised if its true either or even worse. I would assume that she was in her best behavior since she was not in Nepal and probably wanted to portray the best of her image.  My moment of disdain for her came about when her father one of the members of the parliament who were on monthly housing allowance along with the monthly pay. The beinfit is probably meant for the MPs who had to move temprorarily to the capital or who didn't have their own residence. Iirc, they had to manually opt in to get that added housing allowance. When the news published, her father's reaction was something along the line of \"I didn't know, I was getting it. I am happy to return it.\"  Question for her, how come you dont know the source of wealth and your parent's ethics?

These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!! And the way she's silent when the country is bleeding says alottt too!!!!!!  And about the Nepal's government scholarship for harvard,this is not true, she is telling an entire different story about harvard scholarsip & how she paid fees there. She said she got 30% scholarship at harvard and the remaining 70% is paid through her brand endorsements money as she is brand ambassador to few company. We didnt buy that story, she tried hardest to sell it though and still fools people with this shitty madeup script about harvard's 30% scholarship & 70% funding through brand endorsement's money lmao. And lately she's being questioned on 50,000USD she got during miss world competition after winning \"beauty with the purpose\" title.

Continue on --|||Thanks for sharing your raw and real experience, thoughts and opinion. This is valuable for those of us who were shocked and skeptical about her success right from the day she got into limelight. I watched her view on Youtube yesterday and couldn't get past a minute of that video, she is clearly playing victim and trying to play the game.  Nope! she doesn't deserve any chance at all.  The students that I know personally who went to Harvard, MIT and many other prestigious institutions had grit, determination, belief in hard-work, may be little bit of luck but most of all they had \"humility\". They NEVER used their \"Harvard degree\" or Ivy league label to show off. It's those who want to fame and fake pride that put up social media posts to show off their diplomas. Honestly, it was very very clear even before she went to Harvard that she was on the wrong side of fame game.  For the longest time I thought it was a generational difference, since there are many other Harvard students who have publicized themselves in several Youtube videos and they are all Gen Z, and as a Gen Y (Millennial) observing this trend seemed justifiable.  However, Shrinkhala was building a house of cards and the fact that she had the audacity to publicize and put Sambhav Sirohiya in the limelight using Harvard freebies was just laughable a few years ago.  Like you pointed out, the fact that she still has 900K followers is troubling for sure but let's hope those are just her fake followers (some % are bought/in-organic followers, some her closest elite allies like \"Other Miss Nepals/ Businessmen/political affiliates etc. and some her enemies) as they say, **keep your friends close and enemies closer.**|||I heard that B.arch is the easiest subject to get at Pulchowk and that too for a girl as they have separate reservations for women.

Miss World organization saw through her, so didn't let her go to the final round. There is no substance in her words and it  sounds exactly like a politician speech. Idealistic statements with no action. Look at the legacy of previous Miss Nepal winners. Most of them marry rich businessman and secure a rich, lavish life.

But still getting into Harvard is not a small feat- so she must have some intellectual capacity to get picked by the best educational institutions in the world.|||All I can say here is that who ever wrote this has poor English and I am doubtful he/she/they attended Harvard.|||Your views on her seem completely emotion-based, lacking any factual concreteness. They exude your bitterness towards her. I think you envy her followers ( which you have mentioned a lot) and her beauty, its common for ugly people to have this jealousy. Her prowess is enough to get admitted into Harvard and she also has a private architecture company. You creating a burner account to throw dirt at her shows your pettiness as well.|||So she was just like an ordinary college student like all of us, so what if she wasn‚Äôt a studious/intellectual kid, still she was an opportunist, many of us are & maybe that turned out in her favour. And there is nothing wrong with this. She was a title holder that‚Äôs why she could be getting benefited after that. Plus, getting into Harvard is not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea no matter how much money one wishes to spend. Frankly speaking, linking her Harvard degree with nepotism& corruption is making ordinary people like us into more likely believing her part of the story. Targeting her is only gonna make her more famous, still 900k+ followers believe her part. She is getting sympathy from people as people are still forgetting about the real agenda and getting jealous about her getting into Harvard.|||i mean knowing she did try to contribute to nepal rest of the thing was from the breakup scandal right , i don't know about the beauty though everyon is beautiful you try to find it !!!the system will surely benefit her , but a lot of people are unaware of transparecy can't connect the dot in larger scale if she can do great things with her face that has been blessed and for the achievement sh won once title ie miss nepal, she should do great things for the nation in upcoming years and time and hope she get equal value from the scandals!! and serve !!!|||[deleted]|||Still Beautiful though",

The child will have access to education and almost everything another child can ask for. We have belief that the child carries spirit of Taleju Bhawani, which gives the child immense power. Again, in an age where we have lost our belief, I cannot prove it.  The kumaris I have visited emit strong aura (i may have been brainwashed to feel this). But she does have to be disciplined (i dont mean someone disciplines her). The child is treated with utmost respect by the best people in a homely environment.   Aba before age of 15 16, Manang Mustang ghumna khasai koi jaadaina hola (only speaking for myself) After she is no longer a Kumari, she can go whereever she wants to.

A 3 year old child has no idea what she is getting into. She cannot grasp what a normal childhood is, what is right and what is wrong. The only thing she knows and does is based on her likes and dislikes, which is heavily depended upon how her parents/surrounding elders dictates.   Ani about 'No complains' from past Kumaris:   Newari culture is super sensitive. You cannot say anything against their culture. Otherwise, you'll have to face \"Tom n Jerry\" like people. I think, every ex Kumaris understands this at some point. With this much pressure along with the grooming done from a very young age, I don't think anyone dares to speak up. Which basically means none of us know what they really feel inside.    Well, of course, keeping in mind how they're thrown away once they reach a certain age or goes through ü©∏. At least, a life time opportunity to be a Kumari where they could renounce their position if they don't feel like it should be a way.   They don't preach, they don't teach, they only show up during jatras. I've never seen Kumaris actively participating in rituals or any sort of activities. Yestai ho vane, why not create a statue of a Kumari for the rest of our lives and stay quiet???|||Also it adds to the stereotype that period blood is impure|||Yeah the 1sttime ever I saw Kumari it was not aww like I hoped but pity to the \"Living Goddess\" she had the look of not a girl her age but of an \"ice princess\" in anime.

The only thing you should feel bad about is her parents who now have to be her full time care takers probably having to leave their jobs and careers and move into the kumari house with her.|||I used to extremely religious before and used to glorify ts But realising Kumari tradition is cruel was my first step towards atheism|||As a Newar, I understand the cultural side of it. But living in the US and having global exposure, I also see it as more of a pageant. If you‚Äôve seen Little Miss Sunshine, you‚Äôll get the context.||| The Living Goddess tradition of Nepal is a complex institution rooted in centuries of culture. While modern concerns about child rights are valid, the practice is governed by strict rituals and has evolved to address contemporary welfare standards. Here are the key facts:  1. The Selection is Meticulous and Considered an Honor:  ¬∑ A Kumari is chosen from the specific Shakya clan of the Newari community, a Buddhist goldsmith caste. ¬∑ The selection process is incredibly rigorous. Candidates must meet 32 strict physical perfection requirements (e.g., eye shape, voice quality, hair color) and demonstrate a fearless and serene demeanor (e.g., by not crying during a ceremony in a room of 108 ritually sacrificed animal heads). ¬∑ For the family and community, her selection is not a punishment but the highest spiritual honor.  2. The Role is Central to National Culture and Unity:  ¬∑ The Kumari is not just a religious figure but a national symbol. ¬∑ Her most important public duty is during the Indra Jatra festival, where she blesses the President of Nepal, providing divine legitimacy to the state in a ceremony that blends Hindu and Buddhist traditions. This is a key event for national identity.  3. Significant Reforms and Safeguards Have Been Implemented:  ¬∑ Education: By law, the Kumari now receives a formal education from private tutors within her residence. The government provides a monthly stipend specifically for this purpose. ¬∑ Family Presence: Contrary to isolation claims, her family (typically her mother) lives with her throughout her tenure. ¬∑ Financial Security: Upon retiring at puberty, the state grants her a lifetime pension. As of recent years, this is approximately NPR 10,000 per month (roughly $75 USD), along with a lump sum of NPR 1 million (roughly $7,500 USD) to support her transition. ¬∑ Successful Reintegration: Former Kumaris like Dr. Chanira Bajracharya, who served until 14, have publicly spoken about their positive experiences, pursued higher education, and built successful careers, demonstrating that life after the role is viable.  The Kumari tradition is a deeply embedded socio-religious institution. It is factually inaccurate to frame it simply as the \"isolation\" of a child. It is a state-sanctioned, culturally sacred role with defined rituals, significant community support, and legally mandated provisions for the girl's education, family life, and long-term financial security. The debate around it highlights the global tension between cultural preservation and evolving child rights, but the practice itself has demonstrably adapted to modern norms.|||I ain't newar but also I think aaba yesto kura chai parents haru le vhaneko ramro hami third party le vhannu vhanda pani . look if kumari ko parents le chahanu hudaina vhani tyo kumari ko candidate mai na leraunu parni ho . so parents lai kehi problem xaina , kumari le as a normal human being ni basna paunu hunxa after completion so I think we are no one to question sodhna lai|||What about the tradition of marrying off daughters into the inlaws house?|||After giving this some thought question is of a philosophical one. What freedom does a child have?  What life does a child choose? Isn‚Äôt everyone forced and fed their parent‚Äôs beliefs?   Also, can you give some evidence of abuse?

I asked myself the same question and the answer is not much.   I disagree with your claim that the Kumari‚Äôs are discarded. They are always welcome. What it shows is the core principle of Buddhism that nothing is permanent. All things, even being revered as the living goddess, comes to an end.

Khaire ko documentary haru herera brainrot kura nagara na. Not everyone is privileged to become kumari and nor they are selected randomly. The family members themself have to fill the form and there's a long running selection process. Only a certain clan of newar can become Kumari. There are lots of inhuman and child abusive traditions going on all over. In case of kumari they get highest level of love and respect. They can live with their parents, they can play, they can watch TV, they can even play video games. It would be better if you watch podcasts of ex kumaris it's really helpful. I used to think same like everyone calling this inhuman before but they are living the normal life as you and me. And the fact that you can't speak up being kumari is totally false, yes you can't but only in jatras and other religious ceremonies, do you speak up during sharad and other pujas(it's prohibited to talk during sharad if you don't know). Go visit sudurpaschim hundreds of girls are being raped during their chhaupadi bas. Go visit terai Muslim villages girls at the age of 15 are getting married and at the age of 21 they are booned with 3 childs.

To those insisting Kumaris are always ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù or dismissing criticism by belittling others, few things we can reflect on:   1. How much do we actually know about child psychology and development, especially at such a young age when experiences shape a lifetime? 2. Yes, a Kumari is worshipped as a goddess now but when her time ends, how does a goddess step back into an ordinary life? How do peers treat her? How does she even make friends? 3. With isolation and the constant expectation to suppress emotions, what happens to her social, communication, and interpersonal skills? Who helps her navigate that later? 4. Does she ever get space to express her own feelings and thoughts or is silence part of the job description? 5. We‚Äôve all seen videos of new Kumari, some barely three years old, literally asleep in full dress during rituals. How on earth can a toddler be burdened with divine expectations when they can barely stay awake through it? 6. As Nepalis, many of us defend dal bhat tarkari because it‚Äôs what we grew up with it feels untouchable. (I know it‚Äôs not the same but for reference) For a Kumari, this role is all she has ever known. So how would she even recognise or articulate what she‚Äôs missed out on, when she never had the chance to experience it? 7. And let‚Äôs be honest do we really believe someone put on a pedestal that high, surrounded by cultural pressure, guilt, and shame, would openly talk about the negatives of being Kumari? Yes, things have changed there‚Äôs more education, some family contact,but none of that cancels out the developmental and human rights concerns we‚Äôre talking about.  And honestly, the comments here kind of prove the point: we were never really taught to think critically. Instead of having an actual discussion, people are throwing around ‚Äúbahun,‚Äù ‚ÄúChristian,‚Äù or ‚Äúother cultures‚Äù like that somehow answers the question.

Goodness flows through Kumari.  She is worshipped for being the medium of taleju bhawani. They are taught that they as an individual are not god, but the goodness that flows through her is what makes her worshipped.  And calling Kumari as a \"virgin goddess\" is stupid and a complete disregard of religious belief. It's a literal translation not a literary translation.   A lot of misconceptions have already been debunked.  Therefore they are able to integrate back into society well. They have good societal support . They are mentored, taught and are well taken care of. They themselves have immence respect for their religion and tradition.  If you think being a Kumari is wrong, you simply look at other practices in other religions. Nuns are not allowed to marry or consummate. Denying the right to marry and consummate can be considered as an oppressive practices denying one from their human desires. In radical Islam, burka, multiple marriages, denial of human rights for wemen.  While such petty comparisons are stupid themselves, what I want to say is we are worshipping female power. We are actually looking at females as devine. Not simply blind worship.   Nothing about today's childhood is normal.  You see young boys and girls sent off to boarding schools as normal? It's more isolating depressing. Parents just sticking their child to an iPad, or a hyperactive parent forcing their child through multiple activities (music class, sports, extra activities) even when their child may not want to to them, and pushing their child to extremes, putting their child through ridiculously high expectations, so that they can fulfill own ego( yes I've seen it happen).  A lot is not normal in so called modern normal childhood.   A lot of narratives and propogandas have infiltrated our thinking. Be water and explore into the culture. A lot has been written about Kumari from a propogandist and religious infiltration viewpoint.  A lot has been written to criticize our culture and ostracize ourselves from our religion and culture.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Why not sagar Dhakal?|||Yesss|||Just promote it in your social media handle|||K bhairacha yarr discord ma pm choose bhairacha|||Ahile non political manxe thik huncha...her or Dr ‡§∏‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Å‡§ï Ruit.

            "body": "People love to throw shade at King Mahendra, calling him an authoritarian who killed democracy. But let‚Äôs be real: he‚Äôs the only king after Prithvi Narayan Shah who actually did something that mattered for the survival of Nepal.    Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus ‚Äî with nine governments in ten years. That wasn‚Äôt democracy, it was chaos. Leaders were busy stabbing each other in the back while the nation stayed dirt poor, uneducated, and vulnerable. Tell me, what ‚Äústable democracy‚Äù exists when governments collapse every year? None. Mahendra saw this and did what no one else had the guts to do: he hit reset.    Yes, he dissolved parliament. Yes, he banned parties. And you know what? He was right to. Without stability, Nepal was on track to become India‚Äôs backyard project or another pawn in the Cold War. Mahendra‚Äôs Panchayat system gave the country one thing it desperately lacked: stability.    And let‚Äôs talk achievements:    He balanced India and China like a chess master. Without him, we‚Äôd have been swallowed by one side decades ago.    He pushed Nepal onto the global stage ‚Äî Non-Aligned Movement, a stronger UN presence, and an independent foreign policy.    He jump-started modernisation: roads, schools, universities, tourism. These are things no king before him, and very few leaders after him, have been able to deliver at that scale.    But historians? They love to cry about ‚Äúdemocracy dying in 1960.‚Äù These same historians never admit that the so-called ‚Äúdemocrats‚Äù of the 50s were busy running the country into the ground. It‚Äôs easy to glorify B.P. Koirala in hindsight, but Mahendra was the one cleaning up the mess in real time.    Here‚Äôs the hard truth: Mahendra was the only king who actually acted like a king ‚Äî a protector of sovereignty. Everyone after him either coasted on his legacy or failed miserably. Without him, Nepal might not even exist as the independent state it is today.    Call him authoritarian all you want, but facts don‚Äôt lie. After Prithvi Narayan Shah, King Mahendra was the only true king Nepal ever had.",

He saved Nepal from being a puppet of foreign countries. He was a gem.|||Its not an unpopular opinion though. Those who know history know how Progressive Mahendra was. One thing though, his rapid advancements did over heat a fledgling Nepalese economy which is why we needed to privatize our industries. But the privatization was a joke,   they privatized it too quickly and privatization advocates in Nepal did admit they made a huge mistake later on.|||Mahendra is a complicated figure. On one hand, he did keep Nepal intact at a time when regional instability and internal divisions could have easily spiraled out of control.  On the other, his coup dismantled the first democratic experiment and concentrated power in the monarchy, which created long-term issues that Nepal is still untangling today.   It‚Äôs less that historians hate admitting he saved Nepal, and more that they frame it as a tradeoff between short-term stability and long-term democratic development.|||Popular opinion. It's because of Prithvi Narayan Shah and King Mahendra that modern day Nepal even exists as a separate country in its current form. Otherwise there would not have even been an independent country known as Nepal.|||His authoritarian enforcement of the Nepali language and Hindu traditions on a diverse population that wanted nothing to do with them was one of the causes of the civil war that would follow.  He killed democracy in its crib and pulled us back into medieval institutions. Even if I were to hypothetically accept that he was a good ruler for the sake of argument, there is no guarantee and his heirs and his heirs‚Äô heirs would have been good rulers, which is why absolute monarchy fails. Any good that he might have done during his reign is negated by the fact that long term institutions are more important than charismatic rulers, and he ruined the institution of democracy. All the instability that we have faced since 2008- would have happened in the 1950s and we could have been a prosperous democracy by the present. This guy pulled us decades back.  It‚Äôs easy to look back at the past with rose tinted glasses and romanticize it, that is the first step on the road to fascism, but the truth of life, prosperity and happiness is in the future and progressive institutions.|||The problem with Monarchy in Nepal and everywhere else is that there are few good apples in 1 crore ropani orchard.  Except PN Shah, Mahendra and maybe Birendra (many sources call him spineless but I don't know), no one else were fit to rule. The country fell into Ranas dictatorship  because of Monrachy system failure.  So here we are, dealing with generational political trauma.|||A quick ChatGPT will give you some real perspective:  Most historians and political analysts agree that King Mahendra‚Äôs reasons were more of a pretext to consolidate royal power rather than genuine democratic concerns. Here‚Äôs why:  1. Political instability was exaggerated  Nepal‚Äôs first elected government (1959‚Äì1960) under B. P. Koirala had been in office for only 18 months.  While there were some administrative problems, it wasn‚Äôt long enough to judge the parliamentary system a failure.  Corruption and inefficiency existed, but not at the level Mahendra claimed.   2. Fear of losing monarchical dominance  The 1959 elections gave the Nepali Congress a clear majority.  Koirala‚Äôs government was popular and gaining legitimacy, which posed a direct threat to the king‚Äôs absolute authority.  Mahendra feared the monarchy would become a ceremonial institution like in India or Britain.   3. Foreign policy pretext  Koirala pursued a relatively independent foreign policy, maintaining balance between India and China.  Mahendra accused him of endangering Nepal‚Äôs sovereignty, but in reality, the king wanted direct control over diplomacy, which was vital for aid and recognition.   4. Use of \"underdeveloped society\" argument  Mahendra claimed that Nepalese people weren‚Äôt ‚Äúready‚Äù for democracy due to illiteracy and lack of experience.  This was partly true, but instead of strengthening democratic institutions, he abolished parties and built a system where only the king‚Äôs will mattered.   5. The Panchayat system benefited him most  Under Panchayat, all political power flowed through the king.  It created the image of \"guided democracy,\" but in practice, it was royal autocracy with no accountability.   üìå Conclusion: Mahendra used the excuses of instability, corruption, and national unity to justify a royal coup. The deeper reason was to preserve absolute monarchy and prevent Nepal from transitioning into a genuine parliamentary democracy.|||Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus, with nine governments in ten years. That wasn‚Äôt democracy, it was chaos.  LOL. The King chose PM. He was the one responsible.|||Yes man agreed. He is the guy who defined Nepal and Nepali people. He did a lot of great works for the country. But many people and our school books consider him as a dictator telling about how he banned political parties and not mention about the reforms and development made by him for the country. One of the greatest leader of our country King Mahendra!!|||Ali history paddam, 1959 ma first election vako ho tyo vanda aagadi sab PM king le choose garya ho, 1st election ko 1.5 years ma coup vako ho.|||But his policies are disastrous for Nepal till this day  He opened Nepal's border with India, opened free trade with India, allowed India to build its Army base in Lipulekh Limpiyadhura Kalapani since then these territories are occupied by India  He also forced Khas culture on Newaris and Janjatis which influenced them to become Communists|||Agreed!|||Will not let anyone discredit the blood of 17k Nepali|||We wouldn't have been swallowed by any side. Non-alignment was the default policy from the beggining, and B.P koirala would have continued that policy. Nepal would have 'modernized' without an iron-fisted dictatorship.|||Matrika literally wanted to suck cock of india..   He was puppet of India...while BP was good...Matrika and BP's power struggle caused mahendra to step in...and take all the powers..   Thats my unpopular opinion too.|||I agree with most of your points. But your point about 10 governments in nine years doesn't show the instability created by parties but by the monarchs. The monarchs were the ones that were making them unstable. The one time it seemed to be stable, he couped the government. That doesn't diminish the fact thought, that his rule saw probably the most balanced foreign policy of Nepal, where Nepal truly stood out as a sovereign nature. I still believe that had Mahendra controlled a bit of his authoritarian ways and worked together with B.P. Koirala, Nepal would have been in a much better position that it is currently. Both of them are the best leaders Nepal had post P.N. Shah. It might be an unpopular opinion but I think P.N. Shah might be more important historically, but these two are probably the best leaders Nepal got, even better than P.N. Shah.|||Unpopular hoina, brain-dead opinion.

Mahendra model of nation-building was \"one religion, one custom, one language.\" Hindu orthodoxy was enforced as state ideology, treating non-Hindu communities as second-class. Nepali was imposed as the only legitimate language, sidelining rich traditions like Maithili, Newar, Tharu, Tamang, Limbu, etc. This wasn't genuine unity - it was control through forced uniformity. What looked like stability was in fact suppression. That brittle foundation is why today's Nepal wrestles with federalism, ethnic assertion, and identity politics: democracy didn't invent division, it revealed what had long been silenced.  The Koiralas, born and educated in Banaras, were accused of being \"too Indian.\" But Nepal had no universities, no political freedom, no space for intellectual growth - precisely because the tyrants had closed those doors. Should they be condemned for seeking ideas in India, or credited for importing the democratic imagination Nepal lacked?  So the paradox is clear:  Mahendra centralized the state but weakened society.|||First question, why was Nepal unstable during those years? And second more important question, if stability was the most important thing for us, why did he take over from a parliament that had a 2/3 majority and the government was led by THE BP Koirala? There was a little chance that the Koirala govt would have toppled and was doing good work..  Yes, there were some long term projects under him that were very good for Nepal. There‚Äôs no denying that and kudos to him. But he was authoritarian, there is no denying that either. Let‚Äôs not over glorify someone and gloss over facts because they don‚Äôt fit our views..|||Educated boomers hate him(my boomer dad lol).|||Nepal was too small for the OG Mahendra.

Our future is a republic, not a relic.  #NoCrownsOnlyAccountability  2Ô∏è‚É£ NO to Old Parties & Fake Student Unionsüö´üßë‚Äçüéì  Please Share and remember this¬†,We didn‚Äôt burn down the old system to let the vultures pick at the pieces.üá≥üáµStudent wings of UML, Congress, and Maoists (NSU, ANNFSU) are crawling out of their holes to hijack our movement. They are lackeys of the corrupt. We must boycott them and build our own indpnt forums.  3Ô∏è‚É£ YES to Transparency & Real Gen Z Voice üîç  Our movement is leaderless, but it must not be voiceless. We choose our own voice. No backroom deals. All talks must be public. We choose our reps through open polls, not NGO plants or party proxies.  4Ô∏è‚É£ STOP Foreign Interference & Divisionüåç‚ö†Ô∏è  Nepal‚Äôs future = We must expose NGOs/INGOs spreading fake news and division.Our future is decided by Nepalis only. Expose disinfo, unite across caste/ethnicity/religion, audit NGOs.  üöÄ Our Unified Demands:  Our Path Forward:  ‚úÖ Interim Government: Support clean, trusted figures like Balen Shah to lead a short-term, neutral government to guide us to fresh elections. This is about transition, not dictatorship.  ‚úÖ Hunt the Corrupt: Chase the old leaders who are still here posting in social media and trying to grab their last power.Confiscate their black money from Swiss banks and use it to rebuild our nation. They must face justice.  ‚úÖ People's Power: Reform the constitution for more transparency, independent institutions, and power directly in the hands of the people.  The Final Call: Back to the Streets! üö®  The conversation has moved from the streets to backroom shady deals. This is the most dangerous time for our movement and ou country.  To ensure our voices are heard loud and clear, and to stop the jholeys from hijacking our revolution, we must return to peaceful protest.  üì¢ Final Call:  Peaceful rallies, louder than ever. No monarchy, no mask,no bags ,no old parties, no imposters. Only the people, only the truth.  #NepalRevolution #GenZNepal #NoCorruption #JayGorkhali|||[removed]|||GenZ ma josh chha bibek chhaina|||tol tol bata gen z leader niskina laye tah|||[removed]|||https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal360/s/4BesIcG2lI|||sala yesto xa hamro leader..

While the country was grieving and people were literally risking their lives for justice, she was sitting back, polishing a script and preparing an Excel sheet to clear her image.

And to drop that while the nation is still mourning? It‚Äôs actually disgraceful.

It‚Äôs a different story but that‚Äôs exactly how I felt watching Shrinkhala‚Äôs videos.  I never idolized her or hated her, but this is too much. It was giving manipulation & narcissism. It‚Äôs one thing to defend her reputation, but completely another to do so by playing the victim card, shifting narratives & repeatedly saying things so that they are perceived as truth & dodging accountability by blaming others. Tbh it really bothered me that she (and her PR team) thought that we‚Äôre dumb enough to believe those excel sheets. Maybe what she said is true, but she could have showed the actual proof.  In her place, all of us would feel terrible. But to say things like leaving instagram account as it is so that it can be a testament to hate while not acknowledging her silence on a platform with a million followers over deaths of youth is crazy. Becoming an influencer means you are sometimes answerable to questions & accusations, it‚Äôs not just about making your feed aesthetic & scoring brand deals. People turned her into an influencer, so ofc she will have to be answerable sometimes. I wonder what she thought? Yea it‚Äôs not easy, but it‚Äôs part of all that fame & money.  To see that she was so concerned about setting her narrative & defending her image while not even feeling sorry for those who died, were injured & whose families are now forever incomplete is baffling.   Her narrative has been set forever now. Clearly, not to everyone, but to lots of us. Someone said that she‚Äôs only sad now because she lost followers, and that pretty much sums up how I see her now.|||Tesko bhanda ta Anmol KC ko acting ramro yarr|||Aafule khaneko khaldo ma aafai parnu vaneko ehi ho :D|||Yeah couldn't agree more.

Was Binod Khatiwada known to be corrupt? Please dont tell me that every politician is corrupt. I am asking if there has been any concerns raised regarding Binod Khatiwada like he owning multiple buildings, cars etc when he is only a politician.    If no one really knows that her dad is corrupt, her defensiveness makes sense to me. I too would be devastated if my image was destroyed for no apparent reason.   Again..

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. üò≠üò≠2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye üò≠|||3 brsa vo dashign namanako|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

One for the 165 candidates who are elected directly (first-past-the-post), other for the party. The votes that party gets determine the remaining 110 members via proportional representation.  so aba either we need new political parties to replace the existing ones by Falgun 21, or we have to vote for the same parties again. This is more complicated because Nepal is not just Kathmandu. The political players which we have termed jholey will be active outside Kathmandu.   So if we need the change in constitution, we have to be more careful. The mandates of the movement are more at risk now than before.",
