Picked me up from airport, help me find a job a house, and gave me space to stay when things didn't work out with my friend. So basically she helped a lot. I am now working at hers and staying with her.  The job wages is really low (super low) and I dont get much hour. I earn like not even 1k. And as I'm a student so ive to pay my uni fee 1k per month, need to pay rent 500 for double room (sleeping with a 8yr old kid- her daughter) and traveling expenses etc.   And in return for stying in hers, I pay that amt, clean every corner, dishes and everything (not only mine), babysit her daughter,  teach or daughter, etc. I dont have personal space here, like if I say in shower or toilet for long she is gonna call and say where. Doing my uni hour  as soon as I am off I get call telling me to rush home to look after her daughter.  Mind you im not getting paid.   Now I got this another job right, its a night shift 5 to 3, sometime 4 to 2. Ut pays higher, includes tips which I didn't in ajnts job. Aand they also said ill have full time in my vaacation butbin my aunts job its 20 hour still in vacation. And obviously, I need to change place as well.   But like she is super angry, and not talking to me now. Even I asked if I could go on trial cause I am in desperate need of money I can't ask my parent back home, and I dont have money. She is idk.   Now can you suggest me like should I do the aunts job or move out and do the night shift one.",

Everything was working fine until recently when we received a concerning claim.  A company from Germany reached out to us, claiming that an image on our website was improperly used and was licensed. They are now demanding compensation of 800 euros for the unauthorized use of the image.  At first, I was really confused and wasn't sure whether this was a legitimate claim or some kind of scam. I did some research and it seems like it could be real. The image was also licensed but nobody in my team knew about it when it was uploaded nor from website developer part. It was part of the content that was delivered to us when the website was built, and it never occurred to us to check the image licensing.  Has anyone here faced a similar situation where an image on your website was flagged for license infringement? If so, how did you handle it? Did you negotiate the compensation amount, or did you take legal action? Any advice or experience you can share would be really helpful!  Thanks",

I used to work in a marketing agency here in Nepal, where one of our designers used paid fonts without buying them. We received license infringement from the company and they requested us to remove it along with the compensation amount of 2x the money it was selling for.   If it's the first warning, you can just remove the Image and inform them of it. If they pressure you into paying, you can just let the agency handle it. Best case scenario: Maybe the agency has license to it. They just didn't attribute it. Worse case scenario: Let them handle it.   For now you can remove the image and inform them about it.|||Most of the time they're just extorting. I'd say remove the image from your website, or replace it with something licensed / open source and call it a day. I reckon they are trying to contact you via an Email?  I'd not even bother responding to them without any form of legal notice, which I bet they don't have yet. Alone filing legally for the compensation is ought to take them a lot of money, so 99% they won't bother with it.  Ar any rate it's a good idea to consult a copyright focused lawyer.",

            "body": "I’ve been holding this inside for a long time, and I just want to let it out.  I wasn’t a “smart kid” in school. I never understood things as fast as my friends did. I struggled even to read a paragraph and find the right answer, even in class 10. I used to feel dumb every single day. Some of my friends got things so quickly, but I didn’t. I still feel cringe thinking about it.  I also had tics. I don’t know if it was Tourette’s or something else, because I never checked. When I get excited or angry, my eyes blink hard and my back twists. It was embarrassing, and it distracted me so much in school. I used to wish I could just be “normal.”  But after my S.E.E., something changed. That 3-month break gave me a new life. I had my “aha” moment. Somehow, I finally started understanding things. Maybe it was the silence, maybe it was being away from all the noise, maybe it was just loneliness giving me space to think. But everything shifted.  I taught myself how to code. I got a job as a software developer. I didn’t finish my degree because my college wouldn’t let me work while studying, so I said “forget it” and focused on work. It was well paid, and nobody asked for a degree anyway. So yeah, I’m a dropout who made it this far.  I’m still not “super smart,” but I’m definitely smarter than the version of me back then. I still have tics, they still distract me sometimes, but I’m living with it.  I just needed to get this off my chest. I’ve kept it inside for too long.  **And to anyone reading this who feels like they’re slow, or not smart, or different:**   I hope you find your moment too. I hope you realize that you’re not broken. Sometimes loneliness or silence gives you a new life. You grow in ways you don’t even notice at first. You don’t have to be a genius to make it. You just have to keep going. If I can do it, anyone can.  Stay strong. You’ll get your moment too.      ***Note: Yes, I did use ChatGPT to improve this text, mainly to fix grammar mistakes.

Suppose you are new in Kathmandu and don't know which bus go where , or if a bus even goes to that route. An app that keeps record of the all of the public vehicles route by showing them on the map. You will see different colors lines on the map road , and when you touch it it shows a pop up with a vehicle photo showing this bus / micro / tampoo whatever it is that always make a round trip from that route.  Having in detail knowledge of public vehicles routes that also in a map view with rich details like images and cost would be great and really helpful.  I hike a lot in the ktm valley. Had lot of trouble to do research on if a public vehicles goes to the chagunarayan temple from the ratnapark directly. Due to not knowing that, we had to catch a bus from bhaktapur first, but later found out a bus goes directly there.  Now suppose there is an app, with a map interface, that highlights the route with colors showing if that routes have any public vehicle coming. That would be a life saver.|||A map like interface app where users can post what they want or what they can do.

You can learn others if u want but 80% of the openings are these.||| Learning  upto 2 programming language is enough .|||Bro you don't realise (maybe) but you are ahead of the curve. Languages are just layman term for describing binaries - so mostly they don't matter unless you are enjoying them and not starving ofc  but, being golang developer I want to tell you why tf would you need try catch in golang when there is such a good error handling mechanism in it! For the god's sake never say that again  just kidding enjoy!|||I don’t think there is a right or wrong answer. The attitude to learn and tackle problem is really good in itself. But staying on topic, over 10 years ago, in university I was taught PHP by professors, my final year project was iPhone app using Objective-C. In my first job as junior I used C#, Objective-C, JS. After I was promoted to mid soon after and I had to learn TypeScript for Angular 2 project. Then I changed job and was asked to learn React for a front end project. Since then I only had to use C# mainly which got me senior role.  So, from junior to senior I “had to” go through many languages but I made choice to master C# and SQL and not focus too much on other languages. During sprint planning I would deliberately try to pick backend tasks. That decision got me a senior backend role.  Overall I have felt the most important thing was gaining valuable knowledge of good programming patterns and principles, solid, clean code, ability to finding bottlenecks in systems, designing reliable systems, etc. are most important things that are common across any language and can be carried over whatever that maybe used. Good luck.|||It’s about breadth as well. How well do you know the language?   Can you create solutions to problems using them? For their strengths (each language has it), are you using it for the right solutions?  I had a friend who was making a blog website in rust and a server in node. He was cuckoo and said he did it for the lols but it would have been a lot better if he used the proper language for their respective purposes.|||It is not bad to learn too many languages, but it is bad if you do not know the depth of how the language ecosystem executes programs.  You are where I am at, I did projects in python, internship at JavaScript, fulltime on Typescript, Gig on Python/ Rust.  If you know TS in web domain(backend frontend) Try to dive deeper into Node.js itself, easy way would be to create a desktop software or leetcode algoeithms if you are lazy for software.  It ia a good idea to learn a language that has low abstractions, like C. It will give you insights on all other languages you have learned, data structures and algorithms as well.  My suggestion is go with a desktop app. With a low level language and you will thank your future self. If you feel stuck and progress feels like a one year old could do it better, then you are at right track.|||Not always , but to the point you should know when to use which and what balancing both pros and cons. Good luck ＼(^^)／|||First language doesn't matter much as most end up picking ones in trend or C. But tespaxi you learn as you need, so it's good to learn multiple languages if you need them, but if you don't why bother? ... You might wanna explore... different story but not helpful in terms of usefulness as you can just rest, have fun or dive deeper with what you're working already(as more you work, you come up with more tricks to get things done and those tricks make your work easier and you a better programmer).|||Yo internship kasari payu, tyo bana ta bro.|||\"Jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one\" ahh moment",

You try to make sense out of pain. Then you realize pain isn't something you make sense out of it. You just feel the moment and let it go.  Life moves on and so do you. You had to keep on moving with your life because you had no choice. You as always, ended up being a side character in someone's story who didn't even count you as one. Yet, they ended up leaving an imprint upon you.  Sometime you remember them. Cry out loud and then feel okay. Because you have to keep going on with your life. You wanna cry, scream, feel stuffed but helpless. And when finally things are going well for you, they appear.   They appear in their convenience. Not because they miss you or they love you. Their life is just going fine without you, and when they have no one to listen, they \"decide\" to lean on you. That is the power they have over you. As if they are your owner.   That is the moment you should realize, the break wasn't because you weren't good enough. Infact, they keep on coming back because they couldn't find someone like you. You are so precious that it makes them jealous. They are not there to love you, but they are their for your love. They want to keep that love for themselves. You know why? Because they're selfish. So you should learn to become selfish like them and stand up for yourself and move.  After that you have no desire to connect with them. And then again, suddenly something appears i.e. a person related to them, a news or something. You don't want them. But you wanna know more. It's like you're an addict of the drug they supply you. You want more of them. Maybe a stalk, a hint? Maybes maybes!!   Does he miss me? Does he think about me? Will he come back? What would change? I wish we could at least remain on good terms...  Etc etc...  BUT  STOP THERE!!  Just STOP!!!  Those answers won't heal you. And they won't go away. And they will keep coming back until it stops effecting you. But till then, carry on with your life and let your every wound heal through the time. Up until it fades. It doesn't heal. It makes it bearable and tolerable. Gives you enough strength to face it harder.",

I realized that whenever I spoke Hindi around some Indians, they treated me differently. One employer even started talking to me like I was some “inferior Indian” they could insult anytime. That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.  Growing up in Nepal, almost all TV channels were in Hindi. Indian serials and movies basically forced Hindi onto us. Now I’m choosing to learn Newari and other Nepali ethnic languages instead. I want to promote my own culture, not get mistaken as part of another country.  I don’t want foreigners thinking Nepal = India just because we speak Hindi in movies or daily life. We have our own languages, our own culture, our own identity.  Speaking English abroad and promoting our own languages at home feels like the right direction",

What really gets me is the fact them Indians start speaking in Hindi with fellow south Asians. I see that as them being arrogant and ignorant.|||I tell them I understand but don’t speak. Also most of my Indian colleagues are South Indian and they don’t understand Hindi either.|||Why’d we speak a language we don’t even know well? Just because we can understand some of it, doesn’t mean we have learnt it in the right way. We’ve learnt Nepali and English since childhood and those are the only languages we feel confident in.|||Bro, why did you even start speaking hindi ????   Your language is your weapon. Since hindi is not your identity, you have a disadvantage. They look down on you if you speak their language with them. That’s literally saying: you are my master, i will follow you.   You will only be a sidekick on someone else’s story.   You have more control and power over your own language. You can say anything in Nepali and no one can correct you cus you are the native speaker. You are fluent and can express yourself better. That gives you the leverage to take a stand for yourself.   I am surprised, that you used to speak hindi man. You compromised your language for their convenience. Ofcourse they will treat you like their follower.   But i am glad you realised your mistake.|||Agree completely. I never entertain anyone who assumes I speak Hindi and doesn't see a difference between our cultures and languages. I never willingly consume Indian media and always try to give Nepali content more of my attention. I think it's high time we did something about the rampant encroachment of not just Indian but also Western culture into our collective psyche.|||Lived in the states for 18 yrs, never responded in Hindi. In fact, respond them with English, which for most Nepalese, is better in terms pronunciation than theirs.|||I have true blooded Nepali family (I am also true blooded Nepali myself) and they say it’s the same thing. I say why wouldn’t you speak Hindi to communicate with these guys and they say it’s an identity thing. We are not Hindi, we are Nepali. it’s like a kinda stand on business kinda thing. “we are not just an offshoot of India we are better” kinda thing, and I get it lol|||Exactly.  Most Nepalis think it shows intelligence or something by speaking Hindi or broken hindi.  Speaking hindi as a Nepali is the best way to show that we are somehow part of India.   I have also seen firsthand that that some Indians will treat you shittier if you speak their language. Its not all indians, but there are too many.   Cmon people have some self respect. |||Well most Indians don't speak Hindi anyway. I live in Delhi and even I speak more English than Hindi. Anyway, like some guy here said language is just a medium of exchange. I doubt the people who are making you feel inferior will automatically stop doing so if you stop communicating in Hindi. You should search other remedies.|||I've faced the same at an apple care Tokyo. Seeing us the technician request another to guide us. One indian man arrived with loud tone \"Kya Problem hai Bhaiya ?\". I said I don't understand Hindi can we communicate in English ? He went back and the previous technician came to guide us again. The problem with my iPad remain unsolved though.  But if somebody (Normally senior citizens) asks for help in Hindi, I help them with my broken hindi.|||It’s been 10 years since I watched Indian movies or listened to hindi songs. I can’t even name a single post 2015 actor, singer or celebrity. I haven’t seen Indian content except for a few educational or academic contents and even that is rare.|||Agreed.

Which forces them to talk to me in English. Also whenever I mention I’m Hindu they’re like we have the same religion and all. I like to tell them that even tho we have the same religion our practices are different and I am not familiar with their practices and beliefs. I just try to separate myself and our country from them as much as I can, cause we’re not the same. I don’t like those who try to be like them in terms of everything. Like please have your own identity.|||I went to an Indian Restaurant here in Finland. I was talking to the owner he asked me where are you from? I told him I’m from Nepal. He then said Toh Phir Hindi Bolo Na Ek Hi toh bhasa hai. I told him do you speak Nepali cuz I don’t speak Hindi. So from that day I have stopped speaking in Hindi to Indians and other people I only speak in English.|||It's unfortunate you had that experience, but Hindi is the 3rd most spoken language in the world, right behind English and Mandarin.   To tell someone to stop speaking that language isn't going to fix the issue. You should be confident and talk to the people who make you feel this way that Hindi is not your native language and you can only converse in a limited way. Any person who insults you by considering you \"inferior\" is stupid and arrogant. You have to call them out on it.   Since you are in Canada, there are many people who speak French. And French is the 6th most spoken language in the world. If you can learn it and speak, that'd give you a boost in talking to more people. It doesn't always have to be English.   Language is just a medium to communicate. It doesn't belong to any particular nation or a group of people. Don't be afraid to speak out your thoughts.   In Nepal, if you can't speak English well, the people consider you illiterate. It doesn't matter how good you can speak Nepali or a native language.  It's the behaviour and expectations of people in language that's judged.|||this should be the way, mero bhutani sathi lai ni \"Hindi to ati hogi\" bhanchan everytime, i hate it.|||Bruh you need job application|||Yes, either speak Nepali or English, no other language|||I dont think hindi is the problem here,instead that emploer.|||We should tell that to Nepali wanna be Bollywood’s artists also.|||This but speaking in hindi for indian tourist, why do we do that?|||It always depends on personal experience.  But having to know more than 1 language is always good.|||Balla buddhi palyexa jasto kura aayo tw!!!|||yeah fk hindi only newari|||Sooooo true!! Can confirm (Australia). I just refuse to speak hindi. My blood boils when people i don't know approach me in domineering hindi (ajha sometime ta straight punjabi or gujrati) and i am like WTFFF!!!!! And i hate when people ask me which state i am from. I used to say no, i am from nepal. But i started straight up saying i am not indian instead of nepal. Cuz the more i said nepal as a answer to they \"which state are you from\" question, i found them interpreting it as something like nepal is a part of india🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ and if someone asks me 'Are you from india?' I just say 'No' and that's the end of my answer. 😆😆😆 it bugs people so much and unless people ask me 'where are you from' i just avoid that question after 'No'|||i don't know hindi https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalNP/comments/1pgcdh3/i_dont_know_%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%A6/     |||In Nepal I've never spoken Hindi, and I don't watch hindi movies or listen to hindi songs either. Only know old ones which I was forced to watch with my mom.|||[deleted]|||[removed]|||Absolutely agree! Lets start with leaderships in Nepal who give CNN and BBC interviews in Hindi for some godawful reason. Have been seeing this for decades now.|||I am in Canada as soon as I say I am Nepali, Indian people automatically start speaking in hindi like we are supposed to know the language. I always reply in English some are consistently speaking in hindi maybe because their english is not as good or just ignorant. But once you say \"what?\" like 5 times they usually stop. Had an amazing Indian co worker she respected me enough to never speak to me in hindi even tho she knew I could.|||I'm sorry you experience this, Nepal is beautiful and wonderful and you should be encouraged to speak Nepali or Hindi without racism.   I would report the people making inappropriate comments.|||Same thing as well i simply refuse to speak hindi and only talk English cause its better to practice English. Also i am amazed by the audacity of these indian who straight up assume i know hindi and straight up talk hindi without even asking do i know hindi like its a natural thing.|||knowing hindi gives you advantage as well|||Indian haru lai English aaye po English bolni😭😭😭 i would prefer talking in hindi instead of hearing their shit accents. I work with Pakistanis tho and it’s the same case for them too.|||I can speak almost Indian passing Hindi (PUBG lobbies lol) but I never speak Hindi with Indians in the US.|||Yes, please stop to speak Hindi.|||I just tell them that i am from northern nepal so I don’t understand hindi, i have been working there for 1.5 yrs they have no cluee about itt|||That's why i only Speak either Nepali or English. I just pretend like i don't understand Hindi whenever an Indian tries to yap in Hindi|||I NEVER speak Hindi and never will, I say I can understand but cannot speak Hindi so I reply in English. Don’t let these Indians think they can go around speaking Hindi to every South Asia, it’s time they learn to respect other South Asians.  Also I’m Mongolian so they think I’m Chinese or Filipino when they meet me and talk to me in English but when they find out I’m Nepali they start talking to me in Hindi out of nowhere and treat me VERY different. Hell with these Indians.|||If we look at the Fact,  Nepali language is derived from Hindi and Urdu. We use same devnagiri script. Whereas many local languages are marginalised.|||Whenever I’ve switched from English and then spoken to someone in Hindi, I’ve felt a commonness and even respect. Being tri-lingual is a skill, not a downgrade.   I go to small family owned grocery store, I greet them in Hindi and they say namastey, and my usual the liquor store guy asks me how I’ve been doing and gives me discount.   Language was invented by humans to make connections. Rather than saying dont speak a particular language, maybe saying something about how to develop relationships would have been better.|||I speak Hindi to my Nepali family for fun. but with exaggeration|||This post and the comments just reek of inferiority complex.|||Learning any language is good not speaking them in front of them is your choice.  If you don't want to speak in Hindi, that's fine, although Hindi and Nepali words are so much similar just the structure of sentences is what makes the difference between them(These similarities  made me understand the language more , listen to the song and even sing them as if I were an native speaker) .   If you show some love to the language outside of the valley will be even more meaningful as most of the language spoken out of the Valley is at a decreasing rate.  It will help save the culture and language, I would like you to focus on that.  Hey, just to be cleared I'm not trying to force you here. It's your choice at the end.|||bakchodi band 2 chicken plate momo laga or pyaaz rakh dio thode se",

At the moment, i would suggest you to keep doing your jobs and garnering your skills so you land up one job with a handsome pay. Good luck.|||dude you're just like me, but 10 years ago. i've been exactly where you are and it sucks ass. i had to maintain multiple jobs because none would pay on time, and i had to support my parents and two siblings. so when i say i know what you're going through, i mean it. and as much i appreciate people being nice here, no one (except for one) is trying to help you navigate this shituation.  the one thing that you need more of isn't money or opportunities, its time. **you need more time**. more time for proper sleep, more time to gather your thoughts, more time to pause and evaluate your current situation, more time to plan out the next few months. you're like a engine that's constantly running 24/7, and you haven't had the chance to rest for a single moment, and it sucks soooo much because as much as you want to stop, you just can't. its all on you, everything depends on you, and you have to keep moving, or else everything will fall apart. and this will only end one way, and its not good dude.  thats why you have to take your time back. you need at least 2 more hours of sleep (sleeping an hour early and waking up 30 minutes late). at least 1 hour of free time to plan your next steps. you weekends need to be for yourself, and yourself alone. whatever precious time you have, you keep it and don't let anyone or anything take it from you.   if you have college every morning, talk with the administration and ask them to let you check-in an hour late - explain your situation, tell them that you have no other option; this worked for me, and will work for you.  if you have small spare time where its not too long to start working but not too short to just sit around (like 25-40 minutes of downtime), just get to the next task/next job. baru duita day shifts ko bich ma kei downtime hunai nadeu. inform your office you'll arrive early and leave early. explain that you have a tight schedule and you don't want to waste your time. companies will try to make up some nonsense about proper timing and all that bullshit but don't let them bully you to submission. ask them to understand your situation, and make up shit like you also study and go to college everyday and do your assignments daily because you're a weak student, and normally don't get enough sleep because of that, so instead of just wasting time after college, you just come to work early - you know, make it sappy if that helps. but whatever you say, make sure that they let you leave early. take back your time.  if this helps you gather even 1-2 hours extra everyday, thats the time you can invest on yourself now. if you can get home by 5pm instead of 6:30pm, thats around 3 hours before your night shift starts. you can use that time to either plan your next move. work on your portfolio. add things to your showreels that you wish you could but weren't allowed to. talk with your parents about what you're going through and ask them to help you with planning for the future. like the other user said, actually start tracking all your expenses and see where all your money is going. excel is free in the browser, and you can search for \"excel free budget templates\". categorize all your expenses and see where the money is being wasted. do you smoke regularly? are your lunches expensive? is your electricity bill too high? not a single rupee goes untracked. you need every penny to be accounted for. if there's an unnecessary expense, cut it out completely. the more you can save, the easier it will be for you.  you can also request your night shift company to let you start early, and end early. sounds like it's a remote job, so your reasoning could be that you're already free by 6pm, and instead of waiting around, you'd like to start early when you're still feeling energized and not drained of energy by 3 in the morning. you can give your work report by 12 midnight and go to sleep 30 minutes early, even.  if you travel by bus or micros, take that time to complete errands that can be done via your phone. create a checklist for what you need to do before you can apply for better jobs. look for potential companies that have a good company culture (normally has better pay too). connect with past colleagues online just to say hi (this one might feel weird at first but its better to say hi how are you rather than hi do you have a job in your company). update your expense tracking sheet. look for templates and plugins that can help your portfolio be better than the rest.  spend every single free minute to get yourself on a better situation.  you're drowning every hour every day, but you're taking the first step towards pulling yourself out. it's going to be difficult the next few months and you may feel more drained than ever, but if you do all these for yourself, you'll be in a much better mental state in the next couple of months. here's to hoping that you update us in a few months that you got a job that pays as much as all three jobs combined 🤞  all the best. do yourself proud.|||On person told me, rather focusing making money from 2-3 small jobs. Be professional at single then! You can make more from one single job.  But right now I'm also in your situation searching for day jobs.|||I just want to add one more thing…  if anyone here knows about any freelance work, side gigs, or small online jobs, I’m more than willing to take them too. Anything that can help me earn a little extra and reduce some of this pressure would honestly mean a lot.|||Find something you can release your emotions, for me it's futsal or dota. Give 1 hour to yourself to go through and talk about it or write about. It will give you a different perspective on life. And yeah kudos to you. You are doing great. In future turn your 3 jobs to 1 and keep money consistent.|||The first thing that matters is mental peace, I know its easy to say but once you figure that out.  Everything will be same but you will be different  Try meditating, clearing your mind. Once you have a clear mind you can think.  The more you panic, the more it gets worse. Thinking about the future and trying to make life better is good but when you over think the same thing over and over, that thought is what making you demotivated not the situation. If you can’t change the situation, don’t over think it.  I know its hard, but don’t loose the hope.  Stay calm, plan and proceed and will be a matter of time you see the changes.  It is a process not an immediate action. At the end its you and I know someone who is handling everything as you said can do lot better in life. Don’t forget, Some people dream to be in your place. Be positive. You got this.|||I hear you can make more with pathao or similar ride services as a rider.|||Keep the hustle going. Peace 🙏|||i am not the sole earner    but similar situations   i feel you bro|||Try putting all your income and expenses into an Excel sheet. It really helps to see where your money goes. If you have any debts, create a small, steady repayment plan so they don’t keep snowballing.      Separate essential and non-essential expenses, even small adjustments can make a difference. And try to save at least a tiny amount each month. Even a symbolic sum gives a bit of control and stability.      Look at how much free time you have outside of work and try to set aside a small, consistent window to learn skills that are in demand. Little steps add up and can help you increase your income over time.      I’ve been in a similar situation myself, and I know how heavy it can feel. But it is possible to climb out of it slowly, with small steady actions. You’re already doing an incredible amount, don’t be too hard on yourself. You’re stronger than you think, and you’re not alone.|||You are a legend for doing that, god will bless you and open your path|||Good luck 👍 |||Is it just you and your parents ?

            "body": "So why don’t Nepalese freak out about it? Why is no one protesting?  Honestly? Because:  1. Most Nepalese just vibe. The average Nepali is busy surviving, working, studying, or trying to get that visa. No one has the energy to fight strangers every time they say “Same thing hai na?”   2. We’re used to being ignored. Globally, Nepal = Everest + Gautam Buddha + trekking. That’s it. Our language barely enters the conversation.   3. Nepali people learn Hindi without even trying. Bollywood, TV serials, Indian YouTube, cross-border trade, songs, memes  Hindi is everywhere. Even if you never sat in a classroom for it, you’ll magically understand 80% of Hindi just by growing up Nepali.   4. Hindi influenced us… but we also influenced Hindi. Half the words are cross-shared across Sanskrit roots. It’s natural for South Asian languages to overlap. But overlap ≠ identical.   5. We’re too chill about our identity. We love our nationality, but we rarely assert it the way other countries do. We quietly adapt instead of loudly correcting people.  Meanwhile Indians think… “Nepali? Isn’t that just Hindi?”  Not all, but many Indians:  Have never heard Nepali spoken properly  Don’t know it’s the official national language of an entire country  Think it’s a dialect because it’s written in Devanagari  Assume everyone around the subcontinent speaks Hindi because Bollywood is huge   And because Nepalis speak Hindi fluently, Indians assume we learned their language, not realizing we absorbed it out of necessity, media exposure, and proximity.  Why this triggers our nationality (my pov):  Because to us:  Nepali isn't “small.” It’s our identity.  It's the language of our moms yelling at us, our jokes, our culture, our songs, our poems.  When someone reduces it to “Hindi but different,” it feels like our whole culture gets downgraded.   We’re not against Hindi. We’re not against Indians. We’re just tired of Nepali being treated like background noise.   Lastly  Nepali is not Hindi.  Nepalese know Hindi because of exposure, not because it’s taught.  Indians often don’t recognize Nepali as a separate language.  Nepalese rarely complain, but deep down, it does poke our sense of nationality.  It’s a hate in my pov.  Drop your statement if you have kinda same feeling.",

I’ve never heard of anyone in Australia bad mouthing Nepali people, in fact they remember that 1 staff member from a couple of jobs ago, and how kind, considerate and hard working they were.   I can’t say my disdain for Indian people/culture/behaviour has been known from visiting India or interacting with Indian tourists in Nepal but rather, the Indians in Australia who have created a negative sentiment to the Australian people because they are not willing to assimilate.   I guess it is the same notion that Indians see themselves and their culture/language as superior, regardless of the perception of Nepali people or the way they are perceived in Australian society. The Indians in Australia don’t integrate themselves well into society because they don’t really get what it means to be Australian, as opposed to just obtaining PR/citizenship. (Maybe someone can comment from a Canadian perspective)  Nepali people have that general enthusiasm to share and have intercultural exchange because of the diversity in language, ethnicity, drinks and food we have and the cultural traditions/events that occur almost every day of the week.. heck, the Indians who visit Nepal, come for these very reasons!   I’m just incredibly proud that real human interactions with my dajus/didis in Australia has made it easy to be forward with my heritage and culture because many Aussies have had nothing but those glowing things to say. Nepali people abroad have truly represented Nepal well despite the 3rd world experience in the country where most locals will do anything to make an extra buck and have given tourists some negative experiences.   Overall, absolutely love being a part of this Nepali generation, I don’t think I’ve ever met a Nepali person and not befriended them. Jai Nepal!🇳🇵|||I find it kinda funny whenever someone paints the Nepali language as something that every Nepali should have affinity for. Though I understand the power dynamic behind Nepalis being spoken to Hindi in Nepal by the Indians, which in my opinion kinda problematic in that context, I don't actually see any problem in people speaking in whatever language they feel comfortable with. Personally, I reply in English or use broken Hindi without putting much effort in those situations.         I am a newari guy. I don't actually care much about Nepali language aside from using it as a communication tool with fellow Nepalis. Yes, it's one of the languages spoken in Nepal, hence there's a general obligation to say that we should preserve the national langauges just like any other non-newari person will say about Newari language.      And, strictly speaking about my personal attachment or pride associated with Nepali language, it's practically zero.    So, please stop enforcing the narrative that (all) Nepalis have similar feeling towards Nepali language as the ones whose mother tongue is Nepali language.|||RELAX lmao|||It's just indian mentality i think. They got colonized but in the process they themselves have developed the same mindset. So I think it'll take some time before they realize thier own persona.  Tbh i don't give a shit about this.

At the same time, I think we both indians and nepalese are kind of same ( like in a human character way ).|||It’s always north Indians who start speaking Hindi after knowing I’m Nepali.

Parties are digging their own grave by playing blame games instead of fixing themselves.  Question to you all:   Do these numbers match what you see on the ground?   Is the Army’s trust well-deserved?   Can political parties ever recover from 44%, or is this the new normal?

I had applied for some position at United Distributors Nepal (UDN). During the first round of the interview, the HR straight-up told me:  * “You must come in formal dress for the next round of the interview if you are selected,” * “Long hair is strictly against our policy,” * “If you get hired you *must* cut your hair,” * and also, “For the second round you *have* to come with your hair cut & in formal dress”  I had been growing my hair for almost **2 years**. It was something I was attached to; part of my identity honestly but I really wanted that job and the way HR said it made it sound like it was basically mandatory, so…  Yeah.   I cut it.   The whole thing.  And here's the kicker; once I actually went to the second interview, I was so nervous and scared (because I recently resigned from my job without any backup plan) that I messed up the interview.  And of course…   I didn’t get the job.  No feedback, no apology, nothing & now I'm having a feeling like I sacrificed something important for absolutely nothing.  I know it sounds silly to some people “it’s just hair.” But nah, when you’ve kept something for years and you give it up because someone in HR says you must… and then you still don’t get the job? It stings.

They gave me love, care, and a good life, but deep inside I always felt something was missing.  I lived in the village with my grandparents, and I was happy there. When I was sent to Kathmandu for school, I missed them so much that I came back. Later I went again and changed schools many times. Even though my life moved from village to city and from one uncle’s home to another, I always tried to adjust and stay strong.  I completed my schooling and always dreamed of going abroad. I worked hard, made my passport, prepared for IELTS, joined many Telegram groups, and became well known among students applying to the U.S. Even when I failed many times, I didn’t stop. I applied to the U.S. five times. Every time I arranged the money myself, except once when I asked my uncle. I tried again and again because I believed in myself.  Later I joined Tri Chandra and studied BSc Physics for two years. But I still wanted to study abroad. I got accepted by a college in the U.S. but was refused the visa again. After that I applied to South Korea and came here. Life here has been difficult the language, the loneliness, the pressure. But I survived for 2.5 years.  One month ago, I found out that my father tried to take his own life by drinking poison. My family hide it from me because they didn’t want to give me stress. It broke me. It made me question everything.my journey, my dreams, and what I was chasing.  Still, I didn’t give up. I applied again to transfer to the U.S. and now my visa interview is in 10 days. I don’t know what will happen. But I know one thing: I have struggled, I have fallen, and I have stood up again. My life has not been easy, but I have always tried my best.

Dad transferred all the property except one which is called (rokka). Still took 25% of the land's value upfront to give up that land. We paid some loans off and bought another land near where we rent.  Got a big loan on our head now. My elder brother regrets studying expensive college like Islington where the money was gone for almost nothing. Didnt even get job related to the subject. Just took another huge loan to send him abroad. Still not able to send money back. Many other loans still on us.  I kind of saw this coming so I went for the cheaper college for bachelors. Started working from 1st semester. Almost 3 years later, I have a good income where I can atleast sustain my mom and myself while paying rent. But ya the loan is still there and we can barely manage to pay the interest.  Forgive that background. My point is you need to study no matter what. College jau. I suggest 12 samma majale padha.

I struggled even to read a paragraph and find the right answer, even in class 10. I used to feel dumb every single day. Some of my friends got things so quickly, but I didn’t. I still feel cringe thinking about it.  I also had tics. I don’t know if it was Tourette’s or something else, because I never checked. When I get excited or angry, my eyes blink hard and my back twists. It was embarrassing, and it distracted me so much in school. I used to wish I could just be “normal.”  But after my S.E.E., something changed. That 3-month break gave me a new life. I had my “aha” moment. Somehow, I finally started understanding things. Maybe it was the silence, maybe it was being away from all the noise, maybe it was just loneliness giving me space to think. But everything shifted.  I taught myself how to code. I got a job as a software developer. I didn’t finish my degree because my college wouldn’t let me work while studying, so I said “forget it” and focused on work. It was well paid, and nobody asked for a degree anyway. So yeah, I’m a dropout who made it this far.  I’m still not “super smart,” but I’m definitely smarter than the version of me back then. I still have tics, they still distract me sometimes, but I’m living with it.  I just needed to get this off my chest. I’ve kept it inside for too long.  **And to anyone reading this who feels like they’re slow, or not smart, or different:**   I hope you find your moment too. I hope you realize that you’re not broken. Sometimes loneliness or silence gives you a new life. You grow in ways you don’t even notice at first. You don’t have to be a genius to make it. You just have to keep going. If I can do it, anyone can.  Stay strong. You’ll get your moment too.      ***Note: Yes, I did use ChatGPT to improve this text, mainly to fix grammar mistakes.

Logic-gate and multiplayer chess were interesting because i got to learn new data structures and algorithms.  for chess logic i used data structure called BitBoard instead of 2d arrays. It uses clever bit manipulation to make a move, find valid moves faster with less memory usage.

Most of them were saying no vacancy and some asked to send them mail. One of them said that they will contact me later and after an hour one of them contacted me on WhatsApp with another number. They were seeking someone with TS/JS/React/Laravel but I didn't know much of these as I mostly work in Python and C++. Then without any interview, he gave me a simple task to do in React/Laravel and submit the next day and I did it. Then he didn't respond for 4 days and when I again messaged on WhatsApp and asked him, he said me to come tomorrow to their office.  I went there looking at Google Maps. In Google Maps there was an image of a building next to their basement office lol. I went there, and there was no sign, no company name, nothing. I went to that building and called that number and he came outside of the basement and waved his hand. Then he took me to the basement office.  There were like 2 rooms, one was like a small office area and in the other area there were 2 people. There were just 3 people at that time and I thought everyone was outside for lunch because it was 12:30. Then they started talking to me, within the first minutes they asked me what my salary expectation was. Then they asked me how I came here and if I had a bike or not (probably looking for overtime). Then they asked what my future plans were, if I had plans to go to a foreign country or not. Then one of the guys came and said about their product and they were apparently making some “revolutionary” POS device which he literally said “is not some normal product like others make here.”  Then another guy came and wrote something in his phone and showed it to the other guy and he agreed and then asked me to come to another room and gave me a to-do task. It was related to Laravel/React/MySQL about some session stuff. They gave me that task when they explicitly knew that I didn't know much about React/Laravel which they would monitor while I did the work and would see my level.  Then they literally said to not use too much AI. At that point, I was sure that this job was not for me. They had connected WiFi to my laptop and initially I started coding for real but at the same time they were vibe coding using Copilot to code themselves! Then I was sure it’s not for me. If I wanted I could have easily done that with any coding agent. So, I opened Claude/ChatGPT/Gemini side by side and started chatting with them telling them about my situation. And all of them said the same, “Leave now!” They gave me the task to see my skill and work but they barely looked at me the whole time. They probably looked at me 2 times the whole time.  I wanted to leave but I didn’t know how to escape. Then I suddenly shut down my laptop and then opened the bag chain silently and suddenly stood up and said, “I can’t do this, I’ll go home.” Then they said, “What happened?” Then I said, “Nothing, I just wanna go home.” and ran away. I was there for like over 1 hour. Then I went to the nearest hotel and took a cup of tea. I was laughing and smiling the whole time. So, I bought a mask to hide me smiling the whole time and walked for about 30 minutes instead of taking the bus. Then again after arriving RNAC, I went to another hotel for a cup of tea and at that time they called me thrice, once on WhatsApp, and two from different numbers and I blocked all of them.",

Before the accident he was a topper and a solid programmer ( i was kind of is mentor ), but now he feels completely disconnected from everything he used to know. It really stresses him out because people assume he’s still the “tech guy” or a coder, but inside he feels like he’s starting from zero. He’s even scared to go to college because he thinks he won’t be able to keep up. I tried to console him but didn't go as planned .

You can learn others if u want but 80% of the openings are these.||| Learning  upto 2 programming language is enough .|||Bro you don't realise (maybe) but you are ahead of the curve. Languages are just layman term for describing binaries - so mostly they don't matter unless you are enjoying them and not starving ofc  but, being golang developer I want to tell you why tf would you need try catch in golang when there is such a good error handling mechanism in it! For the god's sake never say that again  just kidding enjoy!|||I don’t think there is a right or wrong answer. The attitude to learn and tackle problem is really good in itself. But staying on topic, over 10 years ago, in university I was taught PHP by professors, my final year project was iPhone app using Objective-C. In my first job as junior I used C#, Objective-C, JS. After I was promoted to mid soon after and I had to learn TypeScript for Angular 2 project. Then I changed job and was asked to learn React for a front end project. Since then I only had to use C# mainly which got me senior role.  So, from junior to senior I “had to” go through many languages but I made choice to master C# and SQL and not focus too much on other languages. During sprint planning I would deliberately try to pick backend tasks. That decision got me a senior backend role.  Overall I have felt the most important thing was gaining valuable knowledge of good programming patterns and principles, solid, clean code, ability to finding bottlenecks in systems, designing reliable systems, etc. are most important things that are common across any language and can be carried over whatever that maybe used. Good luck.|||It’s about breadth as well. How well do you know the language?   Can you create solutions to problems using them? For their strengths (each language has it), are you using it for the right solutions?  I had a friend who was making a blog website in rust and a server in node. He was cuckoo and said he did it for the lols but it would have been a lot better if he used the proper language for their respective purposes.|||It is not bad to learn too many languages, but it is bad if you do not know the depth of how the language ecosystem executes programs.  You are where I am at, I did projects in python, internship at JavaScript, fulltime on Typescript, Gig on Python/ Rust.  If you know TS in web domain(backend frontend) Try to dive deeper into Node.js itself, easy way would be to create a desktop software or leetcode algoeithms if you are lazy for software.  It ia a good idea to learn a language that has low abstractions, like C. It will give you insights on all other languages you have learned, data structures and algorithms as well.  My suggestion is go with a desktop app. With a low level language and you will thank your future self. If you feel stuck and progress feels like a one year old could do it better, then you are at right track.|||Not always , but to the point you should know when to use which and what balancing both pros and cons. Good luck ＼(^^)／|||First language doesn't matter much as most end up picking ones in trend or C. But tespaxi you learn as you need, so it's good to learn multiple languages if you need them, but if you don't why bother? ... You might wanna explore... different story but not helpful in terms of usefulness as you can just rest, have fun or dive deeper with what you're working already(as more you work, you come up with more tricks to get things done and those tricks make your work easier and you a better programmer).|||Yo internship kasari payu, tyo bana ta bro.|||\"Jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one\" ahh moment",

I realized that whenever I spoke Hindi around some Indians, they treated me differently. One employer even started talking to me like I was some “inferior Indian” they could insult anytime. That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.  Growing up in Nepal, almost all TV channels were in Hindi. Indian serials and movies basically forced Hindi onto us. Now I’m choosing to learn Newari and other Nepali ethnic languages instead. I want to promote my own culture, not get mistaken as part of another country.  I don’t want foreigners thinking Nepal = India just because we speak Hindi in movies or daily life. We have our own languages, our own culture, our own identity.  Speaking English abroad and promoting our own languages at home feels like the right direction.",

They should be worrying about themselves.|||My opinion is that people should use whatever language they know that works to their advantage.

It depends on circumstance.|||I have lots of Indian friends too. We are ignorant about a lot of other countries and cultures too. You should educate them.

I agree.|||First thing I do is I ask them if they can speak English. It will hurt their little ego and they’ll switch immediately.|||You do you and I'll do me, I guess.    I spoke Hindi with a bunch of Bangladeshi tourists, because I don't understand Bangla, they don't understand Nepali, and they were more comfortable with Hindi than English.    I spoke Hindi with some Indian tourists because they were more comfortable with it than with English.    I continued to speak in English with an Indian visiting Nepal when I and a friend were interacting with him. The thing was, he switched code. I understood him and could have communicated well in Hindi with him, but my friend doesn't really understand Hindi, so I had to keep it in a language everyone understood, and I just told him I am not very good in Hindi.    I would happily speak Nepali in places like Darjeeling, where they speak Nepali, because I am most comfortable in it, and I know most people there would be more than comfortable in that. I assume that it is a comfort thing for them as well.  They're just more comfortable with Hindi than English, and I am accommodating, and fluent enough in Hindi, to extend the courtesy of speaking in their language.    I have come across Indians who look down on Nepal and Nepalis, and unfortunately, that attitude is more common among Indians than it should've been. It is not a pleasant experience, I admit. But, I refrain from putting all of them in a single box. I've met some wonderful Indians as well.   What I have to say is, we are individuals first, I, you, and anyone else, regardless of our nationality, or the languages we speak. Treat each individual on their merit, not their national identity. In fact, the shittiest person I've ever met is a fellow Nepali, and for obvious reasons—I live in Nepal.   The people who treated you bad were shitty people. The same attitude could very well be found in an Englishman, a Frenchman, or even a Nepali. That doesn't mean every Nepali, or Englishman, or Frenchman, is like that.    We are individuals first, in our lived experiences, not just a nationality, and in essence, expressions of existence, far greater than just a nationality. Treat people for who they are in that moment, not a label attached to them.    This is exactly the kind of subtle hate and/or prejudice I am against, whether it is based on lived experiences or influenced by rhetoric.   Use all the languages you know, as much as possible, I say. It is much better to open one's horizons than be insular. And no, I am not just a Nepali. My nationality is just one aspect of who I am, one which is more happenstance than chosen and curated with careful thought. So is yours, if you are actually willing to see it, along with anyone else's. |||I am in Dubai and I speak fluent hindi except for friends if someone asks I just say I understand but can’t speak.

Vanxan, hami haru Indian ko vasa sikxau, gore le ni Indian vanxa, I'll start to learn newari. Thanks OP.|||Language is a powerful tool. I’m here in the US and I speak Spanish with folks who speak Spanish and obviously when there is a language barrier people will banter by saying things that can feel personal. Even greetings come down to culture like cunado (sala) in Nepali.  Most of our generation I am 27 years old watches anime Korean series and picks up words the same way we grew up with Hindi serials. It’s not about speaking Hindi being inappropriate but about the mindset and stigma attached to it. While speaking Japanese Spanish Korean Chinese or French gives you brownie points Hindi often doesn’t and that’s a failure in how Indian people and Hindi have been framed.  I relate to your concern and I have seen firsthand what you’re saying where it can make someone feel inferior and I believe that comes from perception not the language itself.  I say use language in your favor when you can. Draw your boundaries when needed and if something feels insulting say it clearly in English and they usually won’t repeat it. This applies to all languages.  Cheers!|||100%, i live in Canada and I have faced these situations too much. I don’t speak hindi anymore. These people see me brown and come up to me speaking hindi.

If we're multilingual, use everything available to your advantage. If someone asks me if I speak Hindi, I say yes because I grew up in Nepal and a lot of Nepalis can understand Hindi.

You can speak Hindi and still set boundaries if they treat you like shit. I don't see why speaking any other language will make you inferior. I did my Bachelors in India and never had a problem putting people in their places in their own language. I think uneducated illiterate and entitled people are everywhere including India and Nepal, I have had similar experiences with different ethnic communities within Nepal. I actually have problems speaking to Nepali people in Australia as they'll cross every boundary and think I'm liable for them just because we're from the same country.. Its a regional issue.  I watched a interview of Sonam Wangchuk in Nepal and he speaks Nepali throughout the interview. I think as reasonable people we should use whatever language we want depending on the circumstances. Having Hindi in our language arsenal is honestly a superpower as we get access to soo much resources and forms of art that otherwise we wouldn't have been exposed to and as someone from Nepal where we already have a lack of such resources, I'd be sad if I hadn't known Hindi.  So, maybe lets practice putting people in their places if they behave rudely to us and not blame the language. I have many friends from India who I am very close with and many that I had to tell them to show their entitlement elsewhere. It can be the same with English very soon with sentiments of immigration shifting alot and will be with Nepali within Nepal as well. So yea.. lets just enrich our lives with our knowledge of the language.|||yeah ban bollywood they force hindi on us|||indians are coming into kathmandu in large number we should do something they all force hindi|||i feel good that i never talked in hindi with anyone here. Honestly, it was annoying when people used to come directly and started talking with me in Hindi just because i had indian features/ (chhetri ) and to make it worse my name is also kinda indian ( hate it) . But I never replied in Hindi and they just started talking to me in English after that. A lot of my co workers used to ask me can you not speak Hindi . I used to directly reply to them that I do know a little but I prefer not to because there’s no reason to and want to make my English speaking skills better.|||Bro, most Indians do not care about Nepal particularly in their day to day life. They are too busy with their own lives and the immediate world around them to specifically think anything about Nepal. India is a country of 1.3 billion people. And even in India, many people don't speak Hindi. Yeah, many in older generation are more racist, but they are racist to each other too. Many people fight over language in different Indian states, and discriminate with people of different states. But as I said, there are 1.3 billion people and a large majority will be as friendly to Nepali people. No, they don't think of Nepal as their little bro, but if asked, would actually hold some affinity towards Nepal in comparison to what they think of other nations.  Feel free to learn Hindi, feel free to forget, it's every one's personal choice. I honestly almost never need to learn it, but I like Nepali songs so much that I'm picking up on Nepali words now. (Kasari Bhanu, Bardali, Sarangi, Timi ra ma are among my favourite)  Lastly, this sub is quite Anti Indian, just saying,  generalizing India and Indians is ridiculous as the population is much more than most people can think of. And bad will always be highlighted more than good.|||It's not just Nepalis. North Indians act like this towards south Indians too. I know Hindi, but I would never speak it unless I was physically in north India. Talk to me in my own language, or in English is my rule.

( This usually happens in brampton area)|||I can understand this feeling. I’ve noticed something similar in myself. When an Indian person asks me for directions, I automatically respond in Hindi without really meaning to. Then the whole conversation continues in Hindi, and afterward I feel a bit uncomfortable, wishing I had replied in English instead.       But I also hesitate because I’m not sure if they would understand me clearly in English, and I genuinely want to help. It’s something I’m still figuring out.|||I had a Mexican friend who kind of looks like South Asian and he told me that he used to get misjudged as an Indian by them and he used to hate when Indians used to come to him and stsrt talking to him in hindi thinking he's indian and he would be there just looking at them confused ... 🙃🙃.. like wtf. .. they didn't even ask him if he was Indian or not .. just because he looked like South Indian they started talking to him in Hindi ..|||Yes same!

I openly say that I understand it but don’t speak it, and I’ve never been treated like garbage because of that. I’m guessing you’re a man, because Nepalese men constantly put themselves in an inferior position, always with the “bhai, bhai” nonsense. That alone tells people how to treat you. I’m a 22-year-old woman in Canada, and there are two other Nepalese girls where I work. We carry ourselves with confidence. Our Indian manager can’t talk down to us, and neither can any coworker. But the Nepalese guys? They’re always talked down to like kids. They’re 27 and 28 years old and still get called “sala Nepali.” That never happens to us and it’s not a coincidence. We have more filipino co workers than Indians but they always hangout with Indians and say sh like , “ chalo bhai daru pitey hai aj “ in worse hindi accent possible.  This has nothing to do with language. It’s about presence. It’s about how you carry yourself. When you look unsure, dress badly, and act small, people treat you that way. Respect isn’t begged for , it’s taken.|||Guys why so much hatred for India.. I'm unable to understand...saw three post of similar kind..we indians treat or consider Nepalis as our brothers..what has happened to Nepal...we don't have any issues rather connected through religion, culture and tourism too... it's perfectly fine to save ur indigenous culture and languages but there should be no hate ...|||I agree.

And Have deicided to tell everyone that I can understand Hindi(little little) but I don't know how to speak because of much grammatical and syntax differences between my mother tongue and hindi.

You’re not a “nice boyfriend”, you’re a walking doormat with Wi-Fi. The moment she said “home tuition” alarm bells should’ve rung, but no, timi ta “disturb nahos” bhanera uniharulai honeymoon suite diyau. Teacher le timro girlfriend ko “syllabus” cover gardai thiyo ani timi bahira “nice guy” badge polish gardai basyo.  You came home early and still had to play detective like some Bollywood hero, peeking through the window because your own room was locked from inside. Bro even Nepali serials don’t have this level of chutiya plot.  And the cherry on top? You threw the blankets and rugs instead of throwing hands. Blanket jalaunu parne thiyo, timi chai “winter aaucha, kasari sutne” bhanera Daraz ma fluffy white rug khojdai chau. Bro your girlfriend got piped on your bed and your biggest concern is staying warm?? Priority thik cha baba.  You didn’t just get cheated on, you got professionally scammed by a third-class tutor and a third-rate girlfriend. Block her, delete everything burn the mattress and never ever say “disturb nahos” to a girl again.  You’re not heartbroken, you’re brain-dead. Wake the fuck up king, your crown’s on fire and you’re still asking for new rugs. 😂😂😂|||Japa hari ram lai Maya jaal ma nabhula|||Bhina bhina k padhnu parxa go to jamal bajar teha pauxa babbal blankets|||7/10 rage bait.

            "body": "Namaste everyone,  I want to share an incident that happened to me in the last two weeks here in Germany.  My name is … Khadka, and I’ve been doing an Ausbildung at a Hofladen for the past 7 months. My chef treats me really well, like family.  Last week, I was at an Indian roadside café with my sister and some German friends, waiting for my chef to pick me up before visiting the Weihnachtsmarkt. We were waiting , suddenly two indian boys came to us and we had a short conversation . They were annoying so we started ignoring but they soon started making disrespectful comments like calling me MOMO and then mocking Nepal, our size, economy, and poverty. I didn’t respond with racism, though the conversation got heated.  Coincidentally, my chef was nearby, noticed something was wrong, and later asked if I was okay. I explained everything to him. He took it seriously and suggested legal action.  With the help of my chef’s lawyer, a legal letter was sent demanding an apology and €270 from the men. After a few days, they agreed to pay the money and apologized so the case would not go further.  Fun Fact : I and my sister literally eat MOMO after getting that 270 euro 😭😆  So reason of writing this post was just to sharing the possibility of what wrong can happened and how to handle this things.  Edit : For OC (https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204052999996390/permalink/2475725379495816/?mibextid=rS40aB7S9Ucbxw6v)",

            "body": "Got forced into an arranged marriage, husband is shyer than a scared kitten, and now we’re 8 months deep with zero conversations lmao.  So after my +2, my family started going full \"bihe gar, bihe gar\" mode. Every morning felt like a marriage proposal interview. I kept saying I wanted to study bachelor’s first, but nobody took me seriously. Typical Nepali parent combo attack.  Then one day, boom they tell me, “We found a good boy.” I hadn't even seen his face; they were like, “Ramro chhora ho.” Girl, I didn’t even know his name.  Fast-forward to the wedding day: Whole gaun dancing, kids running everywhere, DJ blasting Sani Nani. Everyone vibing except me, the bride, who’s just like “ what is happening.”  I finally saw my husband at mandap and yeah, he looked decent but BRO DIDN’T EVEN LOOK at me properly. I swear he stared at the floor more than my face.  Then suhagraat… I was in the room crying like an idiot because I was stressed and scared. But instead of comforting me, man walked in, looked shocked like he saw a ghost, and LEFT. NO WORDS. ZERO. ZILCH.  For the next few days, our communication level = Bluetooth off.  After that, he escaped to KTM faster than a last bench student during assembly. I thought maybe he’d text? Call? Smoke signal? ANYTHING? Nope. Silence.  Dashain time comes, he returns home. I tried walking near him; man literally walked behind us like we're bodyguards. Even then, no talking. I don’t think he even knew my name until his mom spilled it   And the chocolate incident… His sister gave me a packet, so I ate it (obviously). Later I found out it was for gifting the village kids. Bro looked at me like I ate their future   Months passed. Not a single conversation. I started avoiding him too because at this point it's just awkward both sides.  Then post-Dashain, he shows up at my maita to take me back. Whole family treating him like king jwai. He looked scared of the respect   My little sister tagged along with us, thank god, because otherwise we’d walk one hour in complete silence. My man STILL didn’t talk directly to me. He literally whispered to my sister, “Ask what didi wants to eat.” SIR??? HELLO??? I CAN HEAR YOU???  8 months married. 0 conversations. 0 eye contact. 0 progress.  We communicate through: • my sister • awkward glances • chowmein orders • pure telepathy failure  Anyway, idk what this relationship is but at this point we’re basically two NPCs living separately but married by system default 😭",

Timro love naparos|||Arrange marriage garxu vanne lai ta yo post le saato udayo ta|||I will post the DJ pov later.|||I saw post from the husband side too 💔🥀||| Husband’s POV:  I knew my parents were looking for a girl for me, but I didn’t think they’d actually find one. I thought I had at least 5–7 years to mentally prepare… apparently not.  One random Tuesday, Ama goes, “Babu, we found a girl for you.” I nearly dropped my phone. Girl? For ME? Why?  I saw one tiny photo of you for 0.3 seconds before my dad covered it like it was a government secret. I was like, “Wait— but— who—?” Too late. Wedding prep started.  Wedding Day  Everyone’s dancing, drinking, screaming, having the time of their lives. Meanwhile me = statue mode.  Then I saw you at the mandap.  My brain: “She’s… pretty.” Also my brain: “Don’t look. If you look she’ll know you exist.”  So yes, I stared at the floor like it owed me money. I was SO nervous I forgot how to blink.  Suhagraat  I walked into the room and saw you crying and my entire soul left my body.  I panicked so hard I thought I’d faint. My mind went: “What do I do?? Comfort??? Talk??? DIE???”  So I did the only thing my socially anxious caveman instincts allowed: I LEFT.  First Few Days  Every time I tried to say something, my throat said, “Haha no.” You looked as scared as I felt.  So… Bluetooth off.  Then I got sent to Kathmandu for work and honestly I was relieved because I had no idea how to function around you. I rehearsed texting you like 20 times but never sent anything. If silence was a sport, I was winning gold.  Dashain  I came home thinking, “Okay, this time I’ll talk.” Then I saw you.  Brain: buffering…  I wanted to walk next to you but I didn't want to be creepy or weird, so I walked behind. Like a bodyguard with performance issues.  Then the chocolate incident— I gave that packet to my sister to distribute to kids. When I saw you eating it I didn’t get mad— I got SCARED. Because I didn’t know if I should tell you or just pretend gifting chocolate to villagers was never my plan in life.  After Dashain  My parents forced me to go pick you up from your maita. I was SO nervous I practiced “Let’s go” in front of the mirror like 14 times.  Your family treated me like royalty and I had no idea how to respond except freeze.  Your little sister tagging along was the best thing ever because if it was just us two… That hour of walking would’ve sent me to the hospital.  I DID want to talk to you. Genuinely. But my voice refused to come out whenever I faced you directly.  That’s why I whispered through your sister. “Ask what didi wants to eat” = the bravest sentence I said that day.  Now  8 months married. I still haven’t had the courage to properly talk to you.  Not because I don’t like you— I actually really like you.  I’m just… Terrified. Awkward. Zero experience. And overwhelmed by the fact that I suddenly have a whole wife.  Every day I think: “Tomorrow, I’ll talk to her.” Then you walk into the room and my brain blue-screens.  So yes, we are two NPCs married by system auto-fill. But trust me— I’m trying.  My heart is ready. My mouth is not.|||Xya yesto lamo kasle padhxa ho|||Yeutai manxey le made up scenario post garira cha yo ta.

Not shy, you gutless sack of regrets; you’re a walking erectile failure, a spineless glitch in human evolution, ghosting her harder than your balls ghosted puberty. Wedding? Floor-fucking like it’s got more personality than your limp-dicked ass. Suhagraat? See real tears and rabbit out like the spineless quitter dodging alimony—hope that room haunts your wet dreams, you blue-balled bitch. Bolt to KTM, amnesia her name till Mommy wipes your ass with it, then creep back for Dashain tailing her like a stray dog humping shadows, reeking of coward cum. Chocolate meltdown? Over a snack? Christ, you’re dumber than your shriveled sack—it’s cocoa, not your last shred of manhood. And proxy-ordering chowmein through her sis? You whispering twat, that’s not marriage; that’s you auditioning for Lifetime’s “Pathetic Losers Who Deserve Blue Balls.” Grow a spine, a cock, and a clue, or crawl back to your mom’s womb—divorce her before she wakes up and realizes she’s chained to a human-shaped void.|||https://preview.redd.it/hy69ej2i7e6g1.jpeg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a84ef86b80b2ce29c450c17a9c31d2782145ccbf  Jeetu and Shruti from chup chup k|||this is the start of a wattpad story but …not dreamy scenerio..😬 girl i think u need to man up cos he aint|||I hope it’s not true because girl WTF..

Being a gentleman, Dai let her go with him in the presence of the ward chairperson and police.  That Dai married her with her consent, and they had even talked for a few months before the marriage. I wish she and her boyfriend had thrown such tantrums at her parents’ house before the marriage, if it was forced.|||haha dhanna masu pulau khana chai bhyaechau.|||I think the bride didn't have the money to marry her bf so she arranged|||Marriage is scary☹️|||inspired by gen z revolution fata fat no time waste|||A guy, a doctor, married one of his girlfriends to get Australian PR.

            "body": "Might be a bit dramatical but whatever happened today will live well within me for this lifetime.   TLDR:- Random 60 ish y/o uncle asked me for help of busfare to get to his wife cremation at Pashupati. After i helped him he hugged me tight and that was my first ever hug in 18 years of my life.   This morning i was running late to catch bus to college, but i was stopped by a 60 ish looking uncle. And i stopped even tho i was running late, he said \"babu ma timlai yeauta kura sunauxu.....\" i thought he was one of those 'parmeshwor' ka chela and was trying to brush it off but i'm glad i listened everything.  He said that his wife died by suicide and that she drank poison. Then he continues to say, that his phone is dead (it actually was) and has no bus fare to travel to Pashupati for cremation so he asked me to help him 50rs.   Midway through i thought it was just a story to ask for money but his phone was actually dead and he was really sobbing, he even told me to keep his phone in exchange of the money.  But i didn't have any cash at that moment and only exact bus fare i needed to get to college and return. So i went to a nearby shop, bought happydent of 10rs and paid 60 from online and asked for 50 back. Which i gave it to that uncle.  He was sitting by roadside crying, while all this happened. I got to him and he got up and hugged me really tight. I hugged him back. And that was my first ever actual hug in my whole life😭 i had bad morning prior but that really lifted my mood up. I left him on busstop Then he really thanked me and fetched me goodbye while still sobbing. Made my whole day.  I really hope he's doing all okay now and may his wife rest in peace.",

No one ever loves the person they think they love. All of us love the concept of that person we think we love as it exists in our minds, not how they actually are in reality, because you can only know the person as they seem to be to you in your mind, not the person they actually are. In fact, most of us (maybe all of us), don't even know who we actually are ourselves. What we think we are, is different from who we actually are. Add to that, we keep changing continuously.  So what we loved, never existed as a person. It was just a concept in our minds.    Edit:  The person is just a physical anchor to place what one loves in one's own mind. As you have attached that concept to him, and as you know he has broken up with you, there is a mismatch and a lag which hurts. You still see that person as the physical manifestation of that love. But since you also know he is not yours now, that causes distress. Once that person fades as the physical manifestation of that sense of love, and what you love, you will no longer love him, or more precisely, the concept of him.  Sometimes the opposite happens as well. You yourself change, and what you love changes as well. But that person remains the same. This causes one to stop loving the person, or feeling love for the person, they used to love.  It is not out there. It is in your mind. |||sorry to hear that sis, breakup pain is just suffocating  How long were you guys together for before parting ways?|||![gif](giphy|sKNkMbwrgUWvogAV0I)|||I think you loved him a lot and breakup made you shocked and not to hurt yourself your brain went numb and now as reality hits you feel broken     Its same as i felt though mero case ma it was not breakup but farak thiyo   Move on gara acknowledge past aaba ke nai garna sakkinxa ra if that love was never ment to happen|||But the brighter side is you got to explore more now and meet new people.|||Khucchung Vanna man laagyo sorry|||ok|||Now be ready to mingle|||Oops !!|||![gif](giphy|W5ZUxqXT1lmiysXsDE)",

There were so many questions on coordination compound and also, it did not even have much questions from thermodynamics. It just had like an MCQ and one question, it was like difference between adiabatic and isothermal process. But well oh well, the paper was good enough.

At the end of the day, my 12th-grade marks won’t matter if I don’t score well in the entrance exam. My performance in the 11th-grade entrance exam was also worse because of this. I scored a decent 3.96, but I still didn’t do well in the entrance exam.  Additionally, if I fully understand all the theory and concepts, but even after studying them, I still struggle with solving MCQs. It's been 4 months since I started studying for the 11th grade, yet even the old question papers,OLD IS GOLD feel tough, despite having studied the concepts. I’m not sure what to do next.Right now, I am revising everything daily, focusing on theory first, so that once I’m done with the theory, I can focus more on solving numericals.

            "body": "Namaste rNepal,  My name is Mahendra. I wanted to share an update about my father’s health and the situation my family is currently facing.  My father has been diagnosed with metastatic gallbladder cancer, which is a very aggressive form of cancer. Since the diagnosis, our days have been filled with hospital visits, tests, medicines and treatment plans. On 30 November, he completed another round of chemotherapy. He is fighting bravely, but the side effects and the emotional strain have been extremely difficult for him and for all of us.  we come from very lower middle class family but with a dream to make me engineer and a good human my dad put all his life and sacrificed everything. He worked as a security guard in india din vari ubhiyar kaam garnu vo , hamro sapna pura garna lai and  i still  wonder \"why us\" ? He never consumed alcohol,cigarette, tombakhu or anything that is said to cause cancer now when he is admitted at hospital the main head of the family and i have to lookafter all the expenses i understand why all it happen. the burden of money to manage for studies, run family and survive was really hard for us but he never show us. That dherai chintaa about managing money became the cause for the cancer ig , chintaa le ni cancer hudo raicha. My dad is now ,, he's a cancer patient god!! I was a guy learning and doing everything to pass exams nthg more than that and still use to feel sometime \"life kati garo cha yrr,, Yo sem  ma pass vaidiana and all,,  and suddenly life put me in a place where I had to become the pillar of the family. being student and not even earning it's being extremly hard for us.  I am doing everything possible  via writing, reaching out, asking for help — because I don't want to lose my father. He is still hopeful. He still smiles even on the hardest days.  We have already used all our savings and borrowed money to continue his treatment. The cost of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, scans, tests and medicines has become overwhelming for our family. With the help of kind people, we have managed to raise a little over NPR 3 Lakhs so far, which helped cover the initial cycles, but we still have many more ahead.  I am sharing this post to provide a clear and honest update about our situation. I am not asking anyone to do work on my behalf. Anyone who wishes to support us in any form may do so if they feel comfortable. Even reading this and keeping my father in your thoughts means a lot to us.

Cholangiocarcinoma aka gall bladder cancer. He was 3rd stage when we received the diagnosis. Fortunately, the treatments worked and he's in total remission. He's recovered and cancer free for 4th year running.   He had lesions best the duct, with initial spread to lymph nodes.   We got treatment at Nepal Cancer Research Hospital, Chemo and radiation. And surgery at Teaching Hospital.   I don't remember the exact chemo meds, the radiation was about 17 18 cycles and the surgery went decently well.   There is hope brother, the financial strain was absolutely tough. I don't know if you can it lucky or not but my old man was a civil servant and this was right during COVID-19. I was studying, so had free time and he also didn't have to go to work. Everyone was supportive. I guess we spent close to 15 20 lakhs over all, some of which were covered by insurance and some were donations collected by kins and friends.  So, don't lose hope man. And idk but I would like to suggest consulting Dr Sudip at NCHRC hattiban if you decide to continue here in Nepal since it worked in my case. And it's a specialized facility, and they have a lotta data and experience with this stuff. Also, state of the art equipment.|||I don’t know how you’ll take this advice, because most people only follow mainstream chemo treatment for cancer. But I’ve read many testimonies on X about treating cancer with protocol using ivermectin, fenbendazole and other medicines. Which in most cases treated completely 4th stage cancer after following through the medications for 6 months +. Just letting you know these aren’t that expensive medicines, may be available in Nepal as well if not they’re easily available in India. And can be taken parallel to the current treatment. Found this guy on X “Dr William Makis”. Just sharing what I came across, it’s upto you to make the judgement though. Do your own research. Best Wishes.|||Commenting for better reach and boost to this.. wishing for his speedy recovery 🙏|||Recently, my big sister passed away because of aml (acute myeloid leukemia).

I realized that whenever I spoke Hindi around some Indians, they treated me differently. One employer even started talking to me like I was some “inferior Indian” they could insult anytime. That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.  Growing up in Nepal, almost all TV channels were in Hindi. Indian serials and movies basically forced Hindi onto us. Now I’m choosing to learn Newari and other Nepali ethnic languages instead. I want to promote my own culture, not get mistaken as part of another country.  I don’t want foreigners thinking Nepal = India just because we speak Hindi in movies or daily life. We have our own languages, our own culture, our own identity.  Speaking English abroad and promoting our own languages at home feels like the right direction",

What really gets me is the fact them Indians start speaking in Hindi with fellow south Asians. I see that as them being arrogant and ignorant.|||I tell them I understand but don’t speak. Also most of my Indian colleagues are South Indian and they don’t understand Hindi either.|||Why’d we speak a language we don’t even know well? Just because we can understand some of it, doesn’t mean we have learnt it in the right way. We’ve learnt Nepali and English since childhood and those are the only languages we feel confident in.|||Bro, why did you even start speaking hindi ????   Your language is your weapon. Since hindi is not your identity, you have a disadvantage. They look down on you if you speak their language with them. That’s literally saying: you are my master, i will follow you.   You will only be a sidekick on someone else’s story.   You have more control and power over your own language. You can say anything in Nepali and no one can correct you cus you are the native speaker. You are fluent and can express yourself better. That gives you the leverage to take a stand for yourself.   I am surprised, that you used to speak hindi man. You compromised your language for their convenience. Ofcourse they will treat you like their follower.   But i am glad you realised your mistake.|||Agree completely. I never entertain anyone who assumes I speak Hindi and doesn't see a difference between our cultures and languages. I never willingly consume Indian media and always try to give Nepali content more of my attention. I think it's high time we did something about the rampant encroachment of not just Indian but also Western culture into our collective psyche.|||Lived in the states for 18 yrs, never responded in Hindi. In fact, respond them with English, which for most Nepalese, is better in terms pronunciation than theirs.|||I have true blooded Nepali family (I am also true blooded Nepali myself) and they say it’s the same thing. I say why wouldn’t you speak Hindi to communicate with these guys and they say it’s an identity thing. We are not Hindi, we are Nepali. it’s like a kinda stand on business kinda thing. “we are not just an offshoot of India we are better” kinda thing, and I get it lol|||Exactly.  Most Nepalis think it shows intelligence or something by speaking Hindi or broken hindi.  Speaking hindi as a Nepali is the best way to show that we are somehow part of India.   I have also seen firsthand that that some Indians will treat you shittier if you speak their language. Its not all indians, but there are too many.   Cmon people have some self respect. |||Well most Indians don't speak Hindi anyway. I live in Delhi and even I speak more English than Hindi. Anyway, like some guy here said language is just a medium of exchange. I doubt the people who are making you feel inferior will automatically stop doing so if you stop communicating in Hindi. You should search other remedies.|||I've faced the same at an apple care Tokyo. Seeing us the technician request another to guide us. One indian man arrived with loud tone \"Kya Problem hai Bhaiya ?\". I said I don't understand Hindi can we communicate in English ? He went back and the previous technician came to guide us again. The problem with my iPad remain unsolved though.  But if somebody (Normally senior citizens) asks for help in Hindi, I help them with my broken hindi.|||It’s been 10 years since I watched Indian movies or listened to hindi songs. I can’t even name a single post 2015 actor, singer or celebrity. I haven’t seen Indian content except for a few educational or academic contents and even that is rare.|||Agreed. Indian haru Nepal ma aauda ni I talk to them in English. I am kinda confused as to why do Indians talk in Hindi in Nepal. I mean aafai aafai kura garda ta bhayo but tourist thau haru, mandir haru ma Indian aayera Hindi ma questions sodhda chai ma English mai reply dinchu.|||wtf even talk in hindi|||I don’t really hang around Indians that much and whenever I do I just say I don’t understand Hindi at all. Which forces them to talk to me in English. Also whenever I mention I’m Hindu they’re like we have the same religion and all. I like to tell them that even tho we have the same religion our practices are different and I am not familiar with their practices and beliefs. I just try to separate myself and our country from them as much as I can, cause we’re not the same. I don’t like those who try to be like them in terms of everything. Like please have your own identity.|||I went to an Indian Restaurant here in Finland. I was talking to the owner he asked me where are you from? I told him I’m from Nepal. He then said Toh Phir Hindi Bolo Na Ek Hi toh bhasa hai. I told him do you speak Nepali cuz I don’t speak Hindi. So from that day I have stopped speaking in Hindi to Indians and other people I only speak in English.|||It's unfortunate you had that experience, but Hindi is the 3rd most spoken language in the world, right behind English and Mandarin.   To tell someone to stop speaking that language isn't going to fix the issue. You should be confident and talk to the people who make you feel this way that Hindi is not your native language and you can only converse in a limited way. Any person who insults you by considering you \"inferior\" is stupid and arrogant. You have to call them out on it.   Since you are in Canada, there are many people who speak French. And French is the 6th most spoken language in the world. If you can learn it and speak, that'd give you a boost in talking to more people. It doesn't always have to be English.   Language is just a medium to communicate. It doesn't belong to any particular nation or a group of people. Don't be afraid to speak out your thoughts.   In Nepal, if you can't speak English well, the people consider you illiterate. It doesn't matter how good you can speak Nepali or a native language.  It's the behaviour and expectations of people in language that's judged.|||this should be the way, mero bhutani sathi lai ni \"Hindi to ati hogi\" bhanchan everytime, i hate it.|||Bruh you need job application|||Yes, either speak Nepali or English, no other language|||I dont think hindi is the problem here,instead that emploer.|||We should tell that to Nepali wanna be Bollywood’s artists also.|||This but speaking in hindi for indian tourist, why do we do that?|||It always depends on personal experience.  But having to know more than 1 language is always good.|||Balla buddhi palyexa jasto kura aayo tw!!!|||yeah fk hindi only newari|||Sooooo true!! Can confirm (Australia). I just refuse to speak hindi. My blood boils when people i don't know approach me in domineering hindi (ajha sometime ta straight punjabi or gujrati) and i am like WTFFF!!!!! And i hate when people ask me which state i am from. I used to say no, i am from nepal. But i started straight up saying i am not indian instead of nepal. Cuz the more i said nepal as a answer to they \"which state are you from\" question, i found them interpreting it as something like nepal is a part of india🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ and if someone asks me 'Are you from india?' I just say 'No' and that's the end of my answer. 😆😆😆 it bugs people so much and unless people ask me 'where are you from' i just avoid that question after 'No'|||i don't know hindi https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalNP/comments/1pgcdh3/i_dont_know_%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%A6/     |||In Nepal I've never spoken Hindi, and I don't watch hindi movies or listen to hindi songs either. Only know old ones which I was forced to watch with my mom.|||[deleted]|||[removed]|||Absolutely agree! Lets start with leaderships in Nepal who give CNN and BBC interviews in Hindi for some godawful reason. Have been seeing this for decades now.|||I am in Canada as soon as I say I am Nepali, Indian people automatically start speaking in hindi like we are supposed to know the language. I always reply in English some are consistently speaking in hindi maybe because their english is not as good or just ignorant. But once you say \"what?\" like 5 times they usually stop. Had an amazing Indian co worker she respected me enough to never speak to me in hindi even tho she knew I could.|||I'm sorry you experience this, Nepal is beautiful and wonderful and you should be encouraged to speak Nepali or Hindi without racism.   I would report the people making inappropriate comments.|||Same thing as well i simply refuse to speak hindi and only talk English cause its better to practice English. Also i am amazed by the audacity of these indian who straight up assume i know hindi and straight up talk hindi without even asking do i know hindi like its a natural thing.|||knowing hindi gives you advantage as well|||Indian haru lai English aaye po English bolni😭😭😭 i would prefer talking in hindi instead of hearing their shit accents. I work with Pakistanis tho and it’s the same case for them too.|||I can speak almost Indian passing Hindi (PUBG lobbies lol) but I never speak Hindi with Indians in the US.|||Yes, please stop to speak Hindi.|||I just tell them that i am from northern nepal so I don’t understand hindi, i have been working there for 1.5 yrs they have no cluee about itt|||That's why i only Speak either Nepali or English. I just pretend like i don't understand Hindi whenever an Indian tries to yap in Hindi|||I NEVER speak Hindi and never will, I say I can understand but cannot speak Hindi so I reply in English. Don’t let these Indians think they can go around speaking Hindi to every South Asia, it’s time they learn to respect other South Asians.  Also I’m Mongolian so they think I’m Chinese or Filipino when they meet me and talk to me in English but when they find out I’m Nepali they start talking to me in Hindi out of nowhere and treat me VERY different. Hell with these Indians.|||If we look at the Fact,  Nepali language is derived from Hindi and Urdu. We use same devnagiri script. Whereas many local languages are marginalised.|||Whenever I’ve switched from English and then spoken to someone in Hindi, I’ve felt a commonness and even respect. Being tri-lingual is a skill, not a downgrade.   I go to small family owned grocery store, I greet them in Hindi and they say namastey, and my usual the liquor store guy asks me how I’ve been doing and gives me discount.   Language was invented by humans to make connections. Rather than saying dont speak a particular language, maybe saying something about how to develop relationships would have been better.|||I speak Hindi to my Nepali family for fun. but with exaggeration|||This post and the comments just reek of inferiority complex.|||Learning any language is good not speaking them in front of them is your choice.  If you don't want to speak in Hindi, that's fine, although Hindi and Nepali words are so much similar just the structure of sentences is what makes the difference between them(These similarities  made me understand the language more , listen to the song and even sing them as if I were an native speaker) .   If you show some love to the language outside of the valley will be even more meaningful as most of the language spoken out of the Valley is at a decreasing rate.  It will help save the culture and language, I would like you to focus on that.  Hey, just to be cleared I'm not trying to force you here. It's your choice at the end.|||bakchodi band 2 chicken plate momo laga or pyaaz rakh dio thode se",

My total estimated salary is around 40k, and I’m the only person earning in my family. My parents are old, they can’t work anymore, so everything falls on me household expenses, rent, college fees, food, utilities… literally everything.  We’re from a lowermiddle lass family, and we have no savings at all. I can’t even think about saving because the money is already finished before my salary even comes. Every month starts with stress, and every month ends with guilt, frustration, and the feeling that I’m failing no matter how hard I try.  I’m honestly so tired. Mentally, physically, emotionally.

If anyone has been in a similar situation, how did you manage? How do you keep going without burning out? I don’t want to lose hope, but right now I’m seriously depressed and exhausted from this life.  Any advice, even a few words, would really help.",

            "comments": "At 22 years, it is commendable with what you are doing. A big salute to you. I also had my struggles but did not have to support my family. At the moment, i would suggest you to keep doing your jobs and garnering your skills so you land up one job with a handsome pay. Good luck.|||dude you're just like me, but 10 years ago. i've been exactly where you are and it sucks ass. i had to maintain multiple jobs because none would pay on time, and i had to support my parents and two siblings. so when i say i know what you're going through, i mean it. and as much i appreciate people being nice here, no one (except for one) is trying to help you navigate this shituation.  the one thing that you need more of isn't money or opportunities, its time. **you need more time**. more time for proper sleep, more time to gather your thoughts, more time to pause and evaluate your current situation, more time to plan out the next few months. you're like a engine that's constantly running 24/7, and you haven't had the chance to rest for a single moment, and it sucks soooo much because as much as you want to stop, you just can't. its all on you, everything depends on you, and you have to keep moving, or else everything will fall apart. and this will only end one way, and its not good dude.  thats why you have to take your time back. you need at least 2 more hours of sleep (sleeping an hour early and waking up 30 minutes late). at least 1 hour of free time to plan your next steps. you weekends need to be for yourself, and yourself alone. whatever precious time you have, you keep it and don't let anyone or anything take it from you.   if you have college every morning, talk with the administration and ask them to let you check-in an hour late - explain your situation, tell them that you have no other option; this worked for me, and will work for you.  if you have small spare time where its not too long to start working but not too short to just sit around (like 25-40 minutes of downtime), just get to the next task/next job. baru duita day shifts ko bich ma kei downtime hunai nadeu. inform your office you'll arrive early and leave early. explain that you have a tight schedule and you don't want to waste your time. companies will try to make up some nonsense about proper timing and all that bullshit but don't let them bully you to submission. ask them to understand your situation, and make up shit like you also study and go to college everyday and do your assignments daily because you're a weak student, and normally don't get enough sleep because of that, so instead of just wasting time after college, you just come to work early - you know, make it sappy if that helps. but whatever you say, make sure that they let you leave early. take back your time.  if this helps you gather even 1-2 hours extra everyday, thats the time you can invest on yourself now. if you can get home by 5pm instead of 6:30pm, thats around 3 hours before your night shift starts. you can use that time to either plan your next move. work on your portfolio. add things to your showreels that you wish you could but weren't allowed to. talk with your parents about what you're going through and ask them to help you with planning for the future. like the other user said, actually start tracking all your expenses and see where all your money is going. excel is free in the browser, and you can search for \"excel free budget templates\". categorize all your expenses and see where the money is being wasted. do you smoke regularly? are your lunches expensive? is your electricity bill too high? not a single rupee goes untracked. you need every penny to be accounted for. if there's an unnecessary expense, cut it out completely. the more you can save, the easier it will be for you.  you can also request your night shift company to let you start early, and end early. sounds like it's a remote job, so your reasoning could be that you're already free by 6pm, and instead of waiting around, you'd like to start early when you're still feeling energized and not drained of energy by 3 in the morning. you can give your work report by 12 midnight and go to sleep 30 minutes early, even.  if you travel by bus or micros, take that time to complete errands that can be done via your phone. create a checklist for what you need to do before you can apply for better jobs. look for potential companies that have a good company culture (normally has better pay too). connect with past colleagues online just to say hi (this one might feel weird at first but its better to say hi how are you rather than hi do you have a job in your company). update your expense tracking sheet. look for templates and plugins that can help your portfolio be better than the rest.  spend every single free minute to get yourself on a better situation.  you're drowning every hour every day, but you're taking the first step towards pulling yourself out. it's going to be difficult the next few months and you may feel more drained than ever, but if you do all these for yourself, you'll be in a much better mental state in the next couple of months. here's to hoping that you update us in a few months that you got a job that pays as much as all three jobs combined 🤞  all the best. do yourself proud.|||On person told me, rather focusing making money from 2-3 small jobs. Be professional at single then! You can make more from one single job.  But right now I'm also in your situation searching for day jobs.|||I just want to add one more thing…  if anyone here knows about any freelance work, side gigs, or small online jobs, I’m more than willing to take them too. Anything that can help me earn a little extra and reduce some of this pressure would honestly mean a lot.|||Find something you can release your emotions, for me it's futsal or dota. Give 1 hour to yourself to go through and talk about it or write about. It will give you a different perspective on life. And yeah kudos to you. You are doing great. In future turn your 3 jobs to 1 and keep money consistent.|||The first thing that matters is mental peace, I know its easy to say but once you figure that out.  Everything will be same but you will be different  Try meditating, clearing your mind. Once you have a clear mind you can think.  The more you panic, the more it gets worse. Thinking about the future and trying to make life better is good but when you over think the same thing over and over, that thought is what making you demotivated not the situation. If you can’t change the situation, don’t over think it.  I know its hard, but don’t loose the hope.  Stay calm, plan and proceed and will be a matter of time you see the changes.  It is a process not an immediate action. At the end its you and I know someone who is handling everything as you said can do lot better in life. Don’t forget, Some people dream to be in your place. Be positive. You got this.|||I hear you can make more with pathao or similar ride services as a rider.|||Keep the hustle going. Peace 🙏|||i am not the sole earner    but similar situations   i feel you bro|||Try putting all your income and expenses into an Excel sheet. It really helps to see where your money goes. If you have any debts, create a small, steady repayment plan so they don’t keep snowballing.      Separate essential and non-essential expenses, even small adjustments can make a difference. And try to save at least a tiny amount each month. Even a symbolic sum gives a bit of control and stability.      Look at how much free time you have outside of work and try to set aside a small, consistent window to learn skills that are in demand. Little steps add up and can help you increase your income over time.      I’ve been in a similar situation myself, and I know how heavy it can feel. But it is possible to climb out of it slowly, with small steady actions. You’re already doing an incredible amount, don’t be too hard on yourself. You’re stronger than you think, and you’re not alone.|||You are a legend for doing that, god will bless you and open your path|||Good luck 👍 |||Is it just you and your parents ?

After that i used to work from 10-6 and do freelancing jobs after that. All that while living alone in ktm, and providing for my parents in different city. It was so hectic that I started improving my skills and later started doing just freelancing at the end of my bachelor. And after that I havent looked back at all. All of that pressure and stress to be better and do something on my own made me who I am right now. Now, with my single month salary I could easily live upto 2 years.

I will add if I remember any others later.  \\- Lightweight Inventory, CRM, ROI, Campaign, Finance tracking setup using google sheets/app scripts for my non-tech side hustle which can be used easily in real-time by multiple users. It features algorithm to suggest product prices, auto sorting, stock filters, auto sum and so on.  \\- PS5, Ubuntu, Android, Windows, IMDB data one tap cumulative sync/backup to a external drive using freefilesync and other tools which I run every 3 months. Retains changed files into seperate Versioned folder upto 3 years.  \\- Phone pictures one tap sync with deletions to google drive which then can directly mounted to windows/ubuntu as a drive and used for any uploads straight away.  \\- Acer laptop had kernel level issue on ubuntu with earphones input/output so reported it in launchpad and helped the devs to test out potential fix for months using custom kernels. At last a real fix was found and now it's launched as part of recent kernel update. Real proud of this one.  \\- Not sure this counts but I block every useless repetitive notifications for all apps on my phone unless it's a direct message. With this I get notifications only if someone wants to reach me directly. This helps with digital minimalism and to focus when needed. I allocate specific time each day to catch up on news and not do it constantly.|||I'm in grade 12, and I started learning Python and machine learning.   I'm trying, building but leaving incomplete.

That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.

In your case, it was beneficial to speak in English to avoid having your coworkers discriminate against you.  On some occasion, the ability to speak Hindi can be beneficial.  It depends on circumstance.|||I have lots of Indian friends too. We are ignorant about a lot of other countries and cultures too. You should educate them.

I agree.|||First thing I do is I ask them if they can speak English. It will hurt their little ego and they’ll switch immediately.|||You do you and I'll do me, I guess.    I spoke Hindi with a bunch of Bangladeshi tourists, because I don't understand Bangla, they don't understand Nepali, and they were more comfortable with Hindi than English.    I spoke Hindi with some Indian tourists because they were more comfortable with it than with English.    I continued to speak in English with an Indian visiting Nepal when I and a friend were interacting with him. The thing was, he switched code. I understood him and could have communicated well in Hindi with him, but my friend doesn't really understand Hindi, so I had to keep it in a language everyone understood, and I just told him I am not very good in Hindi.    I would happily speak Nepali in places like Darjeeling, where they speak Nepali, because I am most comfortable in it, and I know most people there would be more than comfortable in that. I assume that it is a comfort thing for them as well.  They're just more comfortable with Hindi than English, and I am accommodating, and fluent enough in Hindi, to extend the courtesy of speaking in their language.    I have come across Indians who look down on Nepal and Nepalis, and unfortunately, that attitude is more common among Indians than it should've been. It is not a pleasant experience, I admit. But, I refrain from putting all of them in a single box. I've met some wonderful Indians as well.   What I have to say is, we are individuals first, I, you, and anyone else, regardless of our nationality, or the languages we speak. Treat each individual on their merit, not their national identity. In fact, the shittiest person I've ever met is a fellow Nepali, and for obvious reasons—I live in Nepal.   The people who treated you bad were shitty people. The same attitude could very well be found in an Englishman, a Frenchman, or even a Nepali. That doesn't mean every Nepali, or Englishman, or Frenchman, is like that.    We are individuals first, in our lived experiences, not just a nationality, and in essence, expressions of existence, far greater than just a nationality. Treat people for who they are in that moment, not a label attached to them.    This is exactly the kind of subtle hate and/or prejudice I am against, whether it is based on lived experiences or influenced by rhetoric.   Use all the languages you know, as much as possible, I say. It is much better to open one's horizons than be insular. And no, I am not just a Nepali. My nationality is just one aspect of who I am, one which is more happenstance than chosen and curated with careful thought. So is yours, if you are actually willing to see it, along with anyone else's. |||I am in Dubai and I speak fluent hindi except for friends if someone asks I just say I understand but can’t speak.

Vanxan, hami haru Indian ko vasa sikxau, gore le ni Indian vanxa, I'll start to learn newari. Thanks OP.|||Language is a powerful tool. I’m here in the US and I speak Spanish with folks who speak Spanish and obviously when there is a language barrier people will banter by saying things that can feel personal. Even greetings come down to culture like cunado (sala) in Nepali.  Most of our generation I am 27 years old watches anime Korean series and picks up words the same way we grew up with Hindi serials. It’s not about speaking Hindi being inappropriate but about the mindset and stigma attached to it. While speaking Japanese Spanish Korean Chinese or French gives you brownie points Hindi often doesn’t and that’s a failure in how Indian people and Hindi have been framed.  I relate to your concern and I have seen firsthand what you’re saying where it can make someone feel inferior and I believe that comes from perception not the language itself.  I say use language in your favor when you can. Draw your boundaries when needed and if something feels insulting say it clearly in English and they usually won’t repeat it. This applies to all languages.  Cheers!|||100%, i live in Canada and I have faced these situations too much. I don’t speak hindi anymore. These people see me brown and come up to me speaking hindi.

You can speak Hindi and still set boundaries if they treat you like shit. I don't see why speaking any other language will make you inferior. I did my Bachelors in India and never had a problem putting people in their places in their own language. I think uneducated illiterate and entitled people are everywhere including India and Nepal, I have had similar experiences with different ethnic communities within Nepal. I actually have problems speaking to Nepali people in Australia as they'll cross every boundary and think I'm liable for them just because we're from the same country.. Its a regional issue.  I watched a interview of Sonam Wangchuk in Nepal and he speaks Nepali throughout the interview. I think as reasonable people we should use whatever language we want depending on the circumstances. Having Hindi in our language arsenal is honestly a superpower as we get access to soo much resources and forms of art that otherwise we wouldn't have been exposed to and as someone from Nepal where we already have a lack of such resources, I'd be sad if I hadn't known Hindi.  So, maybe lets practice putting people in their places if they behave rudely to us and not blame the language. I have many friends from India who I am very close with and many that I had to tell them to show their entitlement elsewhere. It can be the same with English very soon with sentiments of immigration shifting alot and will be with Nepali within Nepal as well. So yea.. lets just enrich our lives with our knowledge of the language.|||yeah ban bollywood they force hindi on us|||indians are coming into kathmandu in large number we should do something they all force hindi|||i feel good that i never talked in hindi with anyone here.

I used to directly reply to them that I do know a little but I prefer not to because there’s no reason to and want to make my English speaking skills better.|||Bro, most Indians do not care about Nepal particularly in their day to day life. They are too busy with their own lives and the immediate world around them to specifically think anything about Nepal. India is a country of 1.3 billion people. And even in India, many people don't speak Hindi. Yeah, many in older generation are more racist, but they are racist to each other too. Many people fight over language in different Indian states, and discriminate with people of different states. But as I said, there are 1.3 billion people and a large majority will be as friendly to Nepali people. No, they don't think of Nepal as their little bro, but if asked, would actually hold some affinity towards Nepal in comparison to what they think of other nations.  Feel free to learn Hindi, feel free to forget, it's every one's personal choice. I honestly almost never need to learn it, but I like Nepali songs so much that I'm picking up on Nepali words now. (Kasari Bhanu, Bardali, Sarangi, Timi ra ma are among my favourite)  Lastly, this sub is quite Anti Indian, just saying,  generalizing India and Indians is ridiculous as the population is much more than most people can think of. And bad will always be highlighted more than good.|||It's not just Nepalis. North Indians act like this towards south Indians too.

When an Indian person asks me for directions, I automatically respond in Hindi without really meaning to.

I openly say that I understand it but don’t speak it, and I’ve never been treated like garbage because of that. I’m guessing you’re a man, because Nepalese men constantly put themselves in an inferior position, always with the “bhai, bhai” nonsense. That alone tells people how to treat you. I’m a 22-year-old woman in Canada, and there are two other Nepalese girls where I work. We carry ourselves with confidence. Our Indian manager can’t talk down to us, and neither can any coworker. But the Nepalese guys? They’re always talked down to like kids. They’re 27 and 28 years old and still get called “sala Nepali.” That never happens to us and it’s not a coincidence. We have more filipino co workers than Indians but they always hangout with Indians and say sh like , “ chalo bhai daru pitey hai aj “ in worse hindi accent possible.  This has nothing to do with language. It’s about presence. It’s about how you carry yourself. When you look unsure, dress badly, and act small, people treat you that way. Respect isn’t begged for , it’s taken.|||Guys why so much hatred for India..

Room jada it was locked from the inside so I thought bahira bata noise aayera room lock gareko hola bhanera. Tei ni I got curious and went around the window to see what was going on.  My gf was on her my bed with her teacher cuddling inside the blankets and what not like wtfff bhaira ma ta. I couldn't believe my eyes I thought I was having a nightmare. I got really furious, told her to open the door and we had a huge fight I was really heartbroken. Riss ma aayera I threw the damn blankets, comforter, duvet, even the rug. Ghar bata sabai faldiye and told them to leave.  So can you guys please tell me where can I get some good rugs and comforters in Nepal? Its winter and I cant sleep without the blankets yk. Especially Im looking for a warm fluffy white/creamy type of rug tyo fur wala. Online shops testo kei cause im not from valley. Help guyss!!",

You are the biggest fucking cuck Nepal has ever produced, bar none.  You literally heard “ghar renovate bhairacha” and your smooth brain went: “Aww baby, aaile mero room ma aaija na, teacher lai ni bolau, ma ta class ma hunchu, disturb pani hudaina.” Bro you didn’t just hand over your room, you handed over your entire bed for their afternoon fuck-session like a 5-star hotel receptionist. You set the mood, locked the door from outside and paid the electricity bill while that randi was getting railed on your own pillow.  You’re not a “nice boyfriend”, you’re a walking doormat with Wi-Fi. The moment she said “home tuition” alarm bells should’ve rung, but no, timi ta “disturb nahos” bhanera uniharulai honeymoon suite diyau. Teacher le timro girlfriend ko “syllabus” cover gardai thiyo ani timi bahira “nice guy” badge polish gardai basyo.  You came home early and still had to play detective like some Bollywood hero, peeking through the window because your own room was locked from inside. Bro even Nepali serials don’t have this level of chutiya plot.  And the cherry on top? You threw the blankets and rugs instead of throwing hands. Blanket jalaunu parne thiyo, timi chai “winter aaucha, kasari sutne” bhanera Daraz ma fluffy white rug khojdai chau. Bro your girlfriend got piped on your bed and your biggest concern is staying warm?? Priority thik cha baba.  You didn’t just get cheated on, you got professionally scammed by a third-class tutor and a third-rate girlfriend. Block her, delete everything burn the mattress and never ever say “disturb nahos” to a girl again.  You’re not heartbroken, you’re brain-dead. Wake the fuck up king, your crown’s on fire and you’re still asking for new rugs. 😂😂😂|||Japa hari ram lai Maya jaal ma nabhula|||Bhina bhina k padhnu parxa go to jamal bajar teha pauxa babbal blankets|||7/10 rage bait.

            "body": "Namaste everyone,  I want to share an incident that happened to me in the last two weeks here in Germany.  My name is … Khadka, and I’ve been doing an Ausbildung at a Hofladen for the past 7 months. My chef treats me really well, like family.  Last week, I was at an Indian roadside café with my sister and some German friends, waiting for my chef to pick me up before visiting the Weihnachtsmarkt. We were waiting , suddenly two indian boys came to us and we had a short conversation . They were annoying so we started ignoring but they soon started making disrespectful comments like calling me MOMO and then mocking Nepal, our size, economy, and poverty. I didn’t respond with racism, though the conversation got heated.  Coincidentally, my chef was nearby, noticed something was wrong, and later asked if I was okay. I explained everything to him. He took it seriously and suggested legal action.  With the help of my chef’s lawyer, a legal letter was sent demanding an apology and €270 from the men. After a few days, they agreed to pay the money and apologized so the case would not go further.  Fun Fact : I and my sister literally eat MOMO after getting that 270 euro 😭😆  So reason of writing this post was just to sharing the possibility of what wrong can happened and how to handle this things.  Edit : For OC (https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204052999996390/permalink/2475725379495816/?mibextid=rS40aB7S9Ucbxw6v)",

Here are a few from my side:  1. Does RSP view kulman's party as a threat to their voter base as there seems to be a significant overlap between RSP and Kulman’s supporters. Are there any discussions or considerations about forming a coalition with them or other emerging political forces? 2. Sumana leaving brought a lot of negative light on RSP, her exit made it seem like the party was becoming more of a “Rabi supporters’ club.” Has her departure brought any internal changes within the party, or has everything remained largely the same? 3. If an opportunity arises  where you can form a coalition government together with one of the old parties are you willing to take it, for example if UML and RSP together have the numbers to form a government, would you take that opportunity? Or would the party prefer to stay in opposition rather than partner with any of the traditional major parties?

Any internal discussions going on to work with them?  I think a good percentage of people are confused and unsure about where RSP stands on many burning issues in Nepal which has pushed Nepal into instability time and again. I’m sure you know what I’m talking about. RSP seems to tip toe around those issues and avoid discussing it overtly.   Could we see RSP take a vocal stand on those issues and make their ideological stance clear before this election? Perhaps this would help RSP clarify its position to unsure but potential voters, and strengthen its presence in villages, small towns and far districts.|||Do you think the current FPTP voting system should be replaced by Instant-runoff / Alternative voting?

I get it Rabi ko party ho but when I/we voted to RSP, it wasn’t because of Rabi but rather the young people like Sumana, Toshima, Ganesh, Sobita who joined Rabi.   Swarnim Wagle isn’t the face of alternative politics. He went to media and started saying shit about Kulman when Kulman has just stayed silent about RSP-Kulman merger. What is that if not a media trial? He is just a sad Congress member who couldn’t get ticket due to bhauju so jumped ship to RSP. Why does he get more say in RSP ko internal matters than other young faces?  So my question again - why is RSP so Rabi centric? Why should we vote for RSP when the whole party philosophy revolves around Rabi? And when Rabi retires, there’s basically no one to lead because the party has been so focused on Rabi and doing media trial against other young leaders.|||What is RSP stance in privatizing Nepal Oil Corporation, Nepal Airlines, and other state owned companies?

For example, Pierre Pollierve despite my hatred for him I can agree that he trruly opposed the policies and was there for a change which is why respecting the mandate in previous elections he chose not to form a gov despite having an opportunity to come in power via alliance with NDP, and Qubec. Why did you not stick with the principles and chose an alliance with the two heads whom Nepalese hate?  Second question, what's your party ideology, is it left wing or right wing?

I have some critical questions. I would be more than happy if Rabi reads these as well.  1.Why aren't you popular? ..at least upto your actual work?  Why are you guys in the shade while there's only talk of Rabi , Gagan, prasai , balen , sumana in the town. Your name is only taken collectively as \"a raswopa neta\". What are your biggest works and achievements as a member of parliament and rsp central member?  2.Why 45 lakhs signature for Rabi but 8.2 lakhs only voter id? Why can't I say that rsp prioritized a personality cult over connecting to new voters. Why is this not a catastrophic failure? Why did you guys fail to pressurize gov and commission to enable diaspora voting and even voter id registration from abroad. Nid was enabled for a brief period of time only. How can you guys exercise democracy with that slow and buggy registration process and 25 lakhs eligible citizens still unregistered?  3.Why is RSP scared to run elections independently on their own?Any plans to help gagan thapa win again?  4.Why is RSP vulnerable to propaganda by gagan thapa IT cell and 12 bhai fake news?  5.Why is rsp's communication and convincing skills so poor ? Couldn't onboard prominent figures and even chase Sumana away, how will you guarantee this doesn't deter similar newcomers again? I know it's important but is it that only the loyalist shall survive in rsp?   6. How many seats is the bibeksheel party contributing to the rsp in the upcoming election? Any projections? Or is it just a symbol?  7.Why is RSP not popular among genz , heavy backslash to Rabi and rsp being labeled as the same old parties, it being too person centric? Why do genz and youngsters hate political parties? What has rsp done and doing to make rsp popular among youngsters? Why is it so lost?   8.Why is RSP activities limited to Kathmandu valley and Chitwan only? I saw rsp doing some program recently AGAIN in chitwan instead of some new place. By being such limited to two districts how are you gonna secure the majority of seats across the country? Why are you preventing RSP from becoming big? We had hopes and still have some. Who's deciding all these?   9. Who's the youths face in rsp ? And how are they representing us? Where?   10. Why does RSP lack someone who's clear about his stance like what Mahesh basnet is for uml? Who's the spokesperson and why is he/she operating in a clinical and limited periphery.   11. Rabi Lamichhane publicly in a speech told that he lost many seats in 2079 election because he wasted his time trying to onboard popular faces instead of fostering new leadership and win more seats, but you guys seem to entertain this notion of onboarding popular faces more , forgetting the fact that you yourself aren't there due to popularity background. Why? Why can't you do something on your own rather than over-depending upon kulman or balen? I mean if you can't onboard them why waste an excessive amount of energy for that? Why such a weak mindset?  RSP central committee representatives feels incomplete and still need to cater many audiences, why don't you onboard brilliant and sharpest minds rather than just someone based on popularity or old connections? |||What are the things that you've done for Nepal?|||RSP stands for Rabi Swatantra Party?|||Remindme! 1 day|||Whats the ideology of rsp|||Hello Ganesh Nepal should enforce proper marital laws, including legally recognized prenups.

            "body": "Got forced into an arranged marriage, husband is shyer than a scared kitten, and now we’re 8 months deep with zero conversations lmao.  So after my +2, my family started going full \"bihe gar, bihe gar\" mode. Every morning felt like a marriage proposal interview. I kept saying I wanted to study bachelor’s first, but nobody took me seriously. Typical Nepali parent combo attack.  Then one day, boom they tell me, “We found a good boy.” I hadn't even seen his face; they were like, “Ramro chhora ho.” Girl, I didn’t even know his name.  Fast-forward to the wedding day: Whole gaun dancing, kids running everywhere, DJ blasting Sani Nani. Everyone vibing except me, the bride, who’s just like “ what is happening.”  I finally saw my husband at mandap and yeah, he looked decent but BRO DIDN’T EVEN LOOK at me properly. I swear he stared at the floor more than my face.  Then suhagraat… I was in the room crying like an idiot because I was stressed and scared. But instead of comforting me, man walked in, looked shocked like he saw a ghost, and LEFT. NO WORDS. ZERO. ZILCH.  For the next few days, our communication level = Bluetooth off.  After that, he escaped to KTM faster than a last bench student during assembly. I thought maybe he’d text? Call? Smoke signal? ANYTHING? Nope. Silence.  Dashain time comes, he returns home. I tried walking near him; man literally walked behind us like we're bodyguards. Even then, no talking. I don’t think he even knew my name until his mom spilled it   And the chocolate incident… His sister gave me a packet, so I ate it (obviously). Later I found out it was for gifting the village kids. Bro looked at me like I ate their future   Months passed. Not a single conversation. I started avoiding him too because at this point it's just awkward both sides.  Then post-Dashain, he shows up at my maita to take me back. Whole family treating him like king jwai. He looked scared of the respect   My little sister tagged along with us, thank god, because otherwise we’d walk one hour in complete silence. My man STILL didn’t talk directly to me. He literally whispered to my sister, “Ask what didi wants to eat.” SIR??? HELLO??? I CAN HEAR YOU???  8 months married. 0 conversations. 0 eye contact. 0 progress.  We communicate through: • my sister • awkward glances • chowmein orders • pure telepathy failure  Anyway, idk what this relationship is but at this point we’re basically two NPCs living separately but married by system default 😭",

I thought I had at least 5–7 years to mentally prepare… apparently not.  One random Tuesday, Ama goes, “Babu, we found a girl for you.” I nearly dropped my phone. Girl? For ME? Why?  I saw one tiny photo of you for 0.3 seconds before my dad covered it like it was a government secret. I was like, “Wait— but— who—?” Too late. Wedding prep started.  Wedding Day  Everyone’s dancing, drinking, screaming, having the time of their lives. Meanwhile me = statue mode.  Then I saw you at the mandap.  My brain: “She’s… pretty.” Also my brain: “Don’t look. If you look she’ll know you exist.”  So yes, I stared at the floor like it owed me money. I was SO nervous I forgot how to blink.  Suhagraat  I walked into the room and saw you crying and my entire soul left my body.  I panicked so hard I thought I’d faint. My mind went: “What do I do?? Comfort??? Talk??? DIE???”  So I did the only thing my socially anxious caveman instincts allowed: I LEFT.  First Few Days  Every time I tried to say something, my throat said, “Haha no.” You looked as scared as I felt.  So… Bluetooth off.  Then I got sent to Kathmandu for work and honestly I was relieved because I had no idea how to function around you. I rehearsed texting you like 20 times but never sent anything. If silence was a sport, I was winning gold.  Dashain  I came home thinking, “Okay, this time I’ll talk.” Then I saw you.  Brain: buffering…  I wanted to walk next to you but I didn't want to be creepy or weird, so I walked behind. Like a bodyguard with performance issues.  Then the chocolate incident— I gave that packet to my sister to distribute to kids. When I saw you eating it I didn’t get mad— I got SCARED. Because I didn’t know if I should tell you or just pretend gifting chocolate to villagers was never my plan in life.  After Dashain  My parents forced me to go pick you up from your maita. I was SO nervous I practiced “Let’s go” in front of the mirror like 14 times.  Your family treated me like royalty and I had no idea how to respond except freeze.  Your little sister tagging along was the best thing ever because if it was just us two… That hour of walking would’ve sent me to the hospital.  I DID want to talk to you. Genuinely. But my voice refused to come out whenever I faced you directly.  That’s why I whispered through your sister. “Ask what didi wants to eat” = the bravest sentence I said that day.  Now  8 months married. I still haven’t had the courage to properly talk to you.  Not because I don’t like you— I actually really like you.  I’m just… Terrified. Awkward. Zero experience. And overwhelmed by the fact that I suddenly have a whole wife.  Every day I think: “Tomorrow, I’ll talk to her.” Then you walk into the room and my brain blue-screens.  So yes, we are two NPCs married by system auto-fill. But trust me— I’m trying.  My heart is ready. My mouth is not.|||Xya yesto lamo kasle padhxa ho|||Yeutai manxey le made up scenario post garira cha yo ta.

See real tears and rabbit out like the spineless quitter dodging alimony—hope that room haunts your wet dreams, you blue-balled bitch. Bolt to KTM, amnesia her name till Mommy wipes your ass with it, then creep back for Dashain tailing her like a stray dog humping shadows, reeking of coward cum. Chocolate meltdown? Over a snack? Christ, you’re dumber than your shriveled sack—it’s cocoa, not your last shred of manhood. And proxy-ordering chowmein through her sis?

The most niche movies/shortfilms that I've watched and probably only a few Nepali people have watched is probably **La Jeteé**, **Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take One** and **Meshes of the Afternoon**.  I'm only trying to name good ones here. These are probably not the most niche Shortfilms and movies out there that I've seen. But all 3 of them are incredible and I'd definitely recommend to everyone. Especially La Jeteé and Meshes of the Afternoon.   Also curious if anyone here has watched **In The Mood For Love** by Wong Kar Wait?|||I have watched the whole Ray filmography and also read his Feluda book, and this would be true even 10 years ago. So yeah you are not alone on this one at least. Edit: btw my answer would be some of the lesser known Vonnegut like Cat's Cradle or something, or maybe Antkind by Kaufman.

My father has been diagnosed with metastatic gallbladder cancer, which is a very aggressive form of cancer. Since the diagnosis, our days have been filled with hospital visits, tests, medicines and treatment plans. On 30 November, he completed another round of chemotherapy. He is fighting bravely, but the side effects and the emotional strain have been extremely difficult for him and for all of us.  we come from very lower middle class family but with a dream to make me engineer and a good human my dad put all his life and sacrificed everything. He worked as a security guard in india din vari ubhiyar kaam garnu vo , hamro sapna pura garna lai and  i still  wonder \"why us\" ? He never consumed alcohol,cigarette, tombakhu or anything that is said to cause cancer now when he is admitted at hospital the main head of the family and i have to lookafter all the expenses i understand why all it happen. the burden of money to manage for studies, run family and survive was really hard for us but he never show us. That dherai chintaa about managing money became the cause for the cancer ig , chintaa le ni cancer hudo raicha. My dad is now ,, he's a cancer patient god!! I was a guy learning and doing everything to pass exams nthg more than that and still use to feel sometime \"life kati garo cha yrr,, Yo sem  ma pass vaidiana and all,,  and suddenly life put me in a place where I had to become the pillar of the family. being student and not even earning it's being extremly hard for us.  I am doing everything possible  via writing, reaching out, asking for help — because I don't want to lose my father. He is still hopeful. He still smiles even on the hardest days.  We have already used all our savings and borrowed money to continue his treatment. The cost of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, scans, tests and medicines has become overwhelming for our family. With the help of kind people, we have managed to raise a little over NPR 3 Lakhs so far, which helped cover the initial cycles, but we still have many more ahead.  I am sharing this post to provide a clear and honest update about our situation. I am not asking anyone to do work on my behalf. Anyone who wishes to support us in any form may do so if they feel comfortable. Even reading this and keeping my father in your thoughts means a lot to us.

And surgery at Teaching Hospital.   I don't remember the exact chemo meds, the radiation was about 17 18 cycles and the surgery went decently well.   There is hope brother, the financial strain was absolutely tough. I don't know if you can it lucky or not but my old man was a civil servant and this was right during COVID-19. I was studying, so had free time and he also didn't have to go to work. Everyone was supportive. I guess we spent close to 15 20 lakhs over all, some of which were covered by insurance and some were donations collected by kins and friends.  So, don't lose hope man. And idk but I would like to suggest consulting Dr Sudip at NCHRC hattiban if you decide to continue here in Nepal since it worked in my case. And it's a specialized facility, and they have a lotta data and experience with this stuff. Also, state of the art equipment.|||I don’t know how you’ll take this advice, because most people only follow mainstream chemo treatment for cancer. But I’ve read many testimonies on X about treating cancer with protocol using ivermectin, fenbendazole and other medicines. Which in most cases treated completely 4th stage cancer after following through the medications for 6 months +. Just letting you know these aren’t that expensive medicines, may be available in Nepal as well if not they’re easily available in India. And can be taken parallel to the current treatment. Found this guy on X “Dr William Makis”. Just sharing what I came across, it’s upto you to make the judgement though. Do your own research.

Since hindi is not your identity, you have a disadvantage. They look down on you if you speak their language with them. That’s literally saying: you are my master, i will follow you.   You will only be a sidekick on someone else’s story.   You have more control and power over your own language. You can say anything in Nepali and no one can correct you cus you are the native speaker. You are fluent and can express yourself better. That gives you the leverage to take a stand for yourself.

But i am glad you realised your mistake.|||Agree completely. I never entertain anyone who assumes I speak Hindi and doesn't see a difference between our cultures and languages.

Its not all indians, but there are too many.   Cmon people have some self respect. |||Well most Indians don't speak Hindi anyway. I live in Delhi and even I speak more English than Hindi.

So from that day I have stopped speaking in Hindi to Indians and other people I only speak in English.|||It's unfortunate you had that experience, but Hindi is the 3rd most spoken language in the world, right behind English and Mandarin.   To tell someone to stop speaking that language isn't going to fix the issue. You should be confident and talk to the people who make you feel this way that Hindi is not your native language and you can only converse in a limited way. Any person who insults you by considering you \"inferior\" is stupid and arrogant. You have to call them out on it.   Since you are in Canada, there are many people who speak French. And French is the 6th most spoken language in the world. If you can learn it and speak, that'd give you a boost in talking to more people. It doesn't always have to be English.   Language is just a medium to communicate. It doesn't belong to any particular nation or a group of people. Don't be afraid to speak out your thoughts.

If you don't want to speak in Hindi, that's fine, although Hindi and Nepali words are so much similar just the structure of sentences is what makes the difference between them(These similarities  made me understand the language more , listen to the song and even sing them as if I were an native speaker) .   If you show some love to the language outside of the valley will be even more meaningful as most of the language spoken out of the Valley is at a decreasing rate.  It will help save the culture and language, I would like you to focus on that.  Hey, just to be cleared I'm not trying to force you here.

Awareness 2. Bans, stronger rules 3. Traffic police checks  What has worked and what will work is pricing. Get rid of rules that promote cartelling and let capitalism solve the issue.   If you had the choice to pay 20 rupees more but travel with slightly more comfort, and with a nice seat, maybe 30-40% of people would be willing to pay, which in result means more businesses willing to invest in public transport as they seek profit, more competition, better services. Those who offer neither good service nor good pricing then deserve go out of business.  This weird government backed cartelling with fixed artifical prices will never work.|||We should implement a metro-style system for local transport in Kathmandu. Currently many buses operate within the ring road but cannot travel beyond it due to narrow and congested lanes. Even when they do it only results in traffic jams.  What if we introduced autos in the valley that follow the same routes as local transport and carry 3–4 passengers per ride? Buses and vans could be restricted to the ring road and every bus stop along the ring road could have designated autos and rickshaws to drop passengers to their destinations at the same fare.  If implemented all the microbuses and hiaces could be replaced with standard buses which would likely cause less congestion than the current smaller vehicles.|||The metropolitan and the yatayat syndicate are the problems. There should be a limit on the number of passengers each vehicle can carry. For large buses, it should not be more than 110% of the number of seats. And for microbuses, it should not be more than 100% of the seating capacity. The limit rule should be enforced by the traffic police.   It's a systemic problem and requires a systemic solution.|||Nepal yatayat ma gundruk khade vanda namajale khadiyeko yaad ayo|||nonchalant khalasi dai|||Ajhai 3 Jana atne thau cha.|||Khalasi be like pachadi sarnus na tetro khali cha|||aghii pakhai ho ni..khalashi haru huncha micro ra yatayaat ko bhadaa karcha.

The land already belongs to a government body, in this case, TU, it made things easy.  But elsewhere in larger projects, main reason this is difficult is because of people. For example, the nagdhunga project was stalled for 6 months because of local demands of alternative water supply, compensation money, jobs for the locals, etc. Without this, it would have already been completed last year.  Now, significant amount of taxpayer money in infrastructure projects are spent in land acquisition. The only way for Nepal to develop fast is i. stop people needlessly stopping projects and either ii. significant land reform, or complete land price collapse and people to stop seeing land as investment.|||This was a dream for cricket fan like me!!

All family members except me were on the side of landladyl  yesto ta kati cha kati incidents  kathmandu ko educated peoples haru ko pani  my friends in school used to tell that their parents warned them to make friends with his own caste or with khas bahun kids only as the onther among us were lower caste. that was when we were in 9th grade!  the casteism and racism in ktm valley is so extremes that many of us grew up with teachings like  \"caste /ethnicity x sanga sangat nagar conspiratory, lohbi fataha huncha, fasauna sakcha talai\"  'caste/ethnicity y sanga sangat nagar violent/jhadagalu ,alcoholics hunchaa, kti haru characterless hoes huncha'  \"caste/ethnicity Z sanga sangat nagar dirty, chor, huncha, bachha haru kidnap garcha, kti haru rape garcha re'  the racism, casteism, xenophobia is so extreme even in valley u cant even imagine  Balen literally cashed this racist, xenophobia of ktm locals to win the mayor seat|||Idc caste in many cases but when it comes out to choosing partner I've never found someone that match my vibe from other caste.|||Lower caste le choyeko pani chaldaina tarw pani tanky banayo vane chalcha 😂 yo caste discrimination kasle nikaleko k ho bujhna paye hune|||You both are right. Our parents grew up in a time where extreme casteism was normal. They didn’t create it, but they were raised inside that system, taught to follow it, and warned about the consequences of not doing so. Education shapes the mind, and the education they received reinforced these beliefs regardless of religion, culture, or society. So they’re not entirely wrong, and we’re not entirely right either.  The real problem is that we often fail to understand the environment they grew up in and the fears they carried. Instead of trying to see their side, we sometimes blame them or play the victim because it’s the easier option. But change takes understanding from both generations—not just criticism. 🙏|||This will just go with this generation or maybe next or next but you just forget what they said and forget about the cast system as well and just focus on people's behavior and if nobody talks about it next generation is not even going to know such a thing and it will just go away. But if we keep saying we're all equal frequently children are going to think they are saying this because  we're all not equal. Indirectly they'll learn that cast is a big deal. that's my point of view. And forget my English as well ☺|||This is really heartbreaking. It’s painful when people who taught us about equality show a different side. Caste ideas came through shared history and influence from India, but we don’t have to carry them forward. Gen Z has a real chance to change this for our friendships, love, and human connection matter more than labels. What you shared with your friend is so real and nothing can take that away.|||Reasons like this is why I have decided to stop living in this country at all, caste difference bhanxan,  ximeki le naramro najar le herxan bhanxan, I'm tired of this.|||Depends on society, hami baun bhayeni, hamro gau ko aguwa haru chai singh (bishwokarma) ho, so they frequently come to our home khana khana, hamro aunty ko shraddhama pani aru lower cast ko manche haru bolayera involve garunu bhayeko thiyo.

At the moment, i would suggest you to keep doing your jobs and garnering your skills so you land up one job with a handsome pay. Good luck.|||dude you're just like me, but 10 years ago. i've been exactly where you are and it sucks ass. i had to maintain multiple jobs because none would pay on time, and i had to support my parents and two siblings. so when i say i know what you're going through, i mean it. and as much i appreciate people being nice here, no one (except for one) is trying to help you navigate this shituation.  the one thing that you need more of isn't money or opportunities, its time. **you need more time**. more time for proper sleep, more time to gather your thoughts, more time to pause and evaluate your current situation, more time to plan out the next few months. you're like a engine that's constantly running 24/7, and you haven't had the chance to rest for a single moment, and it sucks soooo much because as much as you want to stop, you just can't. its all on you, everything depends on you, and you have to keep moving, or else everything will fall apart. and this will only end one way, and its not good dude.  thats why you have to take your time back. you need at least 2 more hours of sleep (sleeping an hour early and waking up 30 minutes late). at least 1 hour of free time to plan your next steps. you weekends need to be for yourself, and yourself alone. whatever precious time you have, you keep it and don't let anyone or anything take it from you.   if you have college every morning, talk with the administration and ask them to let you check-in an hour late - explain your situation, tell them that you have no other option; this worked for me, and will work for you.  if you have small spare time where its not too long to start working but not too short to just sit around (like 25-40 minutes of downtime), just get to the next task/next job. baru duita day shifts ko bich ma kei downtime hunai nadeu. inform your office you'll arrive early and leave early. explain that you have a tight schedule and you don't want to waste your time. companies will try to make up some nonsense about proper timing and all that bullshit but don't let them bully you to submission. ask them to understand your situation, and make up shit like you also study and go to college everyday and do your assignments daily because you're a weak student, and normally don't get enough sleep because of that, so instead of just wasting time after college, you just come to work early - you know, make it sappy if that helps. but whatever you say, make sure that they let you leave early. take back your time.  if this helps you gather even 1-2 hours extra everyday, thats the time you can invest on yourself now. if you can get home by 5pm instead of 6:30pm, thats around 3 hours before your night shift starts. you can use that time to either plan your next move. work on your portfolio. add things to your showreels that you wish you could but weren't allowed to. talk with your parents about what you're going through and ask them to help you with planning for the future. like the other user said, actually start tracking all your expenses and see where all your money is going. excel is free in the browser, and you can search for \"excel free budget templates\". categorize all your expenses and see where the money is being wasted. do you smoke regularly? are your lunches expensive? is your electricity bill too high? not a single rupee goes untracked. you need every penny to be accounted for. if there's an unnecessary expense, cut it out completely. the more you can save, the easier it will be for you.  you can also request your night shift company to let you start early, and end early. sounds like it's a remote job, so your reasoning could be that you're already free by 6pm, and instead of waiting around, you'd like to start early when you're still feeling energized and not drained of energy by 3 in the morning. you can give your work report by 12 midnight and go to sleep 30 minutes early, even.  if you travel by bus or micros, take that time to complete errands that can be done via your phone. create a checklist for what you need to do before you can apply for better jobs. look for potential companies that have a good company culture (normally has better pay too). connect with past colleagues online just to say hi (this one might feel weird at first but its better to say hi how are you rather than hi do you have a job in your company). update your expense tracking sheet. look for templates and plugins that can help your portfolio be better than the rest.  spend every single free minute to get yourself on a better situation.  you're drowning every hour every day, but you're taking the first step towards pulling yourself out. it's going to be difficult the next few months and you may feel more drained than ever, but if you do all these for yourself, you'll be in a much better mental state in the next couple of months. here's to hoping that you update us in a few months that you got a job that pays as much as all three jobs combined 🤞  all the best. do yourself proud.|||On person told me, rather focusing making money from 2-3 small jobs.

Give 1 hour to yourself to go through and talk about it or write about. It will give you a different perspective on life. And yeah kudos to you. You are doing great.

Everything will be same but you will be different  Try meditating, clearing your mind. Once you have a clear mind you can think.  The more you panic, the more it gets worse. Thinking about the future and trying to make life better is good but when you over think the same thing over and over, that thought is what making you demotivated not the situation. If you can’t change the situation, don’t over think it.  I know its hard, but don’t loose the hope.  Stay calm, plan and proceed and will be a matter of time you see the changes.  It is a process not an immediate action. At the end its you and I know someone who is handling everything as you said can do lot better in life. Don’t forget, Some people dream to be in your place. Be positive. You got this.|||I hear you can make more with pathao or similar ride services as a rider.|||Keep the hustle going. Peace 🙏|||i am not the sole earner    but similar situations   i feel you bro|||Try putting all your income and expenses into an Excel sheet. It really helps to see where your money goes. If you have any debts, create a small, steady repayment plan so they don’t keep snowballing.      Separate essential and non-essential expenses, even small adjustments can make a difference. And try to save at least a tiny amount each month. Even a symbolic sum gives a bit of control and stability.      Look at how much free time you have outside of work and try to set aside a small, consistent window to learn skills that are in demand. Little steps add up and can help you increase your income over time.      I’ve been in a similar situation myself, and I know how heavy it can feel. But it is possible to climb out of it slowly, with small steady actions. You’re already doing an incredible amount, don’t be too hard on yourself. You’re stronger than you think, and you’re not alone.|||You are a legend for doing that, god will bless you and open your path|||Good luck 👍 |||Is it just you and your parents ?

For a single life that does not have to pay rent and stuff, 40-50k is more than enough in kathmandu. I know things are getting expensive but even when you spend 1k per day, you'll spend 30k tops. Anything remaining is saved.   Start by keeping track of each one of your purchase/expense, even 5rs, and at the end of the month mark expenses that you feel were useless. Try to reduce those for a start and make this a habit.   Also try to limit yourself to a maximum you can spend each day. This might not work everyday, and say you spend 3k on a weekend day out. Try to cover it up in the next few days and spend less.

Nepal is really unstable now, given the political conditions. I myself am now thinking for leaving the country. Wont recommend you to come here at all.|||I’m Chinese, and I understand the difficulties and pain you’re going through. But I strongly do not recommend that you return to Nepal directly, because you mentioned that your family’s income is low and you don’t have a clear or feasible plan for going back. That would be a very unwise choice.  I mean no offense, but if you eventually manage to stay in Australia and become a citizen, that could very well be the greatest contribution you make in your entire life,for yourself and for your family.  Let’s calmly think about your situation: your family doesn’t earn much, yet you went to Australia to work. Think about the support and expectations your family has for you, as well as the effort you’ve put in. If you choose to return now without even knowing what you would do for a living, and considering that with your current situation you might be able to obtain Australian residency, then giving that up and going back might be the biggest mistake you ever make.  I know your journey hasn’t been easy, and maybe it feels difficult to keep going, but think carefully about the situation you and your family—and even future generations—may face if you return. You will most likely regret it.  That’s all I have to say.|||Lets be realistic no ones doing well in this country.

It will gives you more hard times|||Hey brother, thanks for opening up and sharing all of this with us. What you’re going through is something many Nepali students in Australia and abroad can relate to — the pressure for PR, job uncertainty, and also the weight of family expectations back home. It’s a lot to deal with, mentally and emotionally.  One thing I want to say for sure: your worth is not measured only by PR or money. You’ve already shown courage by going here alone, studying, and working hard these four years. That itself is a big achievement.  About your dilemma — returning home vs. staying — there’s no right or wrong choice here. What matters is what gives you a future that feels meaningful and sustainable. If the job doesn’t feel right and the sponsorship comes with years of compromise, it’s okay to step back and rethink. And if doing something of your own in Nepal excites you more, that’s a real option too. Nepal needs young people with global perspective and courage to take risks.  Your parents will always want your happiness first. Yes, money matters — but your peace of mind matters too. Whatever decision you take, take it with confidence, not fear. And remember, success doesn’t have only one path.  Take your time, think calmly, and choose the life you truly want. You’re going to do great — whether that’s in Australia or back home. 💪🏼💛|||Life bhaneko struggle ho, australia hos ya nepal, struggle garnu nai xa bhane australia ma gara, nepal ko situation herda nepal ma struggle garere kei pauna wala chainau for now...|||Afu nai khus na bhaye k, but for your parents ma lai hatayerah ba, ma lai herah an do not return if you do not have a solid plan.|||A prime example of Hatti chiryo, Puchhar adkyo.

After plugging in the charger, the laptop didn’t respond at all for hours.  Assuming the charger was faulty, I took it to the Mudita service center. Later, they informed me that the **motherboard was damaged (“shot”)** and needed to be replaced, costing **about 60% of the laptop’s original price**. To make things worse, the laptop had just exceeded its 12 month warranty by around one month, so they refused to cover the repair under warranty.  It feels extremely strange and concerning that a motherboard or CPU would get damaged simply while charging normally. If there had been a high-voltage surge, then **all devices connected at the same time should have been affected**, including my colleagues’ laptops and chargers — but none of them faced any issue.  For a device to fail like this right after warranty expiry raises doubts about **product durability and quality assurance**. Very disappointed with this experience.",

            "body": "As an Computer Engineering/IT graduate in Nepal, there are various pathways.  Option A) You stay in Nepal  Option B) You move abroad   Let's discuss about Option A first.  There are two realistic pathways you could take if you stayed in Nepal.  - work at private  - work at government   I have tried working at private. But the amount of discrimination being done in private companies really blew me up. As someone who was also preparing for government jobs, I had noticed lots of underprivileged folks participating in government jobs exam(for computer engineer as well). I used to ponder what made them do this since this is not a very lucrative job compared to what a \"certain community\" person makes at private or \"certain community\" person grows at private job. But later realized that private companies are not interested to hire these \"underprivileged\" folks.   Lots of people might argue (although they know it is not true) private jobs hire on merit. No they do not do so in Nepal. It is completely based off connections. It does not matter your knowledge. It is about who you know 100%. I am not ignorant that this might be the case outside, but I swear to god everyday, esto garera USA ma jasto innovative companies cha tyo ta pakkai hudainthyo..   The reason for such favoritism is mainly because the work they do is so shit. Leaving few companies who developer softwares that Nepalese use on daily basis(Not ludo), other jobs are not very interesting to do either. It is the same low quality menial job with meagre pay.   The companies who have a business are handful already. Investor ko money burn garne jasto nepal ma kei hudaina as there are no investors. So you see these bitchy ass companies hiring full stack developer every day for the salary of an intern.     I could not really be bothered with working under someone and taking all nonsense blames for 30,000 per month on hand. With no future and no growth and dismissing my self esteem. My aviman is and was huge.   The second pathway is to work at government corporations. I looked at the salary of computer engineer at Nepal Army, Nijamati and it is decent. But the upwards mobility is just not there. What I mean by that is salary is not growing when you grow your experience. Aba ta government employee specially nijamati lai dekhne bittikai yo bhrastachari raicha bhanne lagcha. Kinaki bhrastachar nagari ta khana basnai napugne. Pradhan Sena Pati ko talab cha 67000. Social security benefits cha good and all but cash in hand ni aileko market rate anusar ta dinu paryo ni. 67000 ma kam garne pradhansenapati le ghus nakhaye k garera palne? lol.  I looked at corporations salary. And it seems that if you manage to get a handle at a corporation(Sansthans), you can make be sure to make average of 60-70 thousands per month even as a 6th level officer. At this point of my career, this seems fair enough. But it will not be enough after 5 years, if my increment is just 1 thousand per year.    A huge reform is required in government services. Government services (specially nijamati) are the core to how people feel about the government. If we cannot make it attractive and lucrative, it does not matter how rich we are saving on their salary.  Next option is moving abroad.  Aba ko market ma abroad ma PR paune/GC paune biswas ta chaina. Unless you do the jobs that Americans do not want to do (or foreigners) like teaching for 60k/year, nursing old people etc.  15 years bidesh ma basna jane. Kam garne and coming back to Nepal. It seems the most plausible way forward. Nepal ma ayepachi k garne bhanne hunasakcha however.  The countries in option to stay for so long are Japan, India. Do not want to surrender my passport to Dubai sheikh. Also middle east is terror and war prone so do not want to end up there.   Europe tira padna gaye matra ho. It seems bleak for immigrants nowadays. And I do not think they earn that much in Europe (for someone planning to return back to Nepal and not stay there). Teta nabasne bhayepachi social security ko teti matlab bhayena.   How about USA? USA seems fine and all. but I do not think getting a work permit after Masters degree is going to be easy. Or that you are going to make big bucks and save big bucks as an immigrant in this economy. Since PR/GC is not guaranteed, you are basically playing a zero sum game. The experience that you get in abroad and education bla bla is huge investment however.",

I took the same course purely out of passion, but I only landed better jobs because of my creativity,not because of a certificate. None of the companies I’ve worked with ever asked about my educational title; only some uncreative Nepali companies did, and they couldn’t even afford my salary.  My 6 years of experience have taught me a lot. I’ve worked with foreign clients, accepted low pay in the beginning just to learn more, and over time those skills paid off. I was even offered a position at a major tech company in Nepal, but I chose to join an AI company with a bigger vision and at double the salary.

I want to build a real career in IT so I can eventually work remotely or move abroad. I want something realistic that I can learn in about a year and turn into a stable, good-paying job.  Honestly, I’m not interested in freelancing or full-stack because (personally) it feels oversaturated and too creative (for each project) and portfolio-heavy, but I’m still open if I’m wrong. I don’t wanna sound picky, and desperate, like “I only want X, not Y.” Please don't get me wrong. I'm willing to learn and work. I’m flexible - I just want something that's worth my time and effort.

Coz, I don't wanna end up being homeless. Seriously, I am so sick of my current lifestyle, I wanna make a change and take some right action that will lead me to my goal. I literally don't care if it's hard or impossible, coz now it's a necessity.. I am ready to sacrifice my time. I wanna invest in myself (my skills).  So, please, I need your help to choose the right direction.  I’d really appreciate any honest suggestions, roadmaps, or personal stories from people who started in a similar place.  Thanks a lot.",

            "comments": "timle vaneko anusar networking best hola. ccna chai garnu paryo. paxi bistarai ccnp gare vayo|||f I were 23, broke, living in Nepal, and trying to start an IT career without a degree, I would choose one of three realistic paths: QA testing, IT support, or cybersecurity. QA is the easiest and fastest way to get a job because it’s not too saturated, Nepal hires many freshers, and you don’t need a portfolio or degree. IT support is the most stable long-term option because it’s beginner friendly, companies always need support staff, and it naturally leads to higher-paying roles like SysAdmin or Cloud Engineer. Cybersecurity is the most future-proof, global, and high-demand field, but it requires more effort in the first few months.  Things like frontend, full-stack, and freelancing are not the best starting point when you’re broke and need stability fast; they take longer and require portfolios or creativity. A simple one-year plan would look like this: for QA, learn manual testing first, then SQL/API testing, and later basic automation. For IT support, learn computer basics, networking, and ticketing tools, then move towards cloud platforms. For cybersecurity, start with networking and Linux, then learn security basics and practice SOC labs.  If you want something fast, choose QA. If you want something stable and practical, go for IT support. If you want long-term growth and international opportunities, choose cybersecurity. Any of these three can realistically change your life within a year if you stay focused|||You’re only 23, so you have time on your side. While I understand you want quick results, consider exploring online degree programs. Many are flexible and work-friendly. A degree can make a huge difference when applying for jobs abroad and competing for better positions - it might be worth the investment alongside building your skills. 🙂🙂|||If I were you, I’d start with IT support → networking → cloud. It’s cheap to learn, beginner-friendly, hires freshers in South Asia, and leads to real stable jobs. Once you get basic support skills, aim for CCNA, then AWS. It’s the most realistic path to a solid career without a degree.|||look for QA, devrel, dev advocate, project manager, sre/devops etc. what's the tech skill that u already know? |||Garo nai cha aile ko situation ma ta.

I think its a huge mistake personally. I know there are many people who have done great in their lives. but I feel like (in the context of Japan) its a huge mistake to move after +2 because the cultural and language barrier is so high that even people with masters degree are working in convenient stores and other low paying jobs that need no academics. after +2 you just are so young and confused that you don't even know what you want in life and what are your options. at least after Bachelor's I'd guess you get what you should expect from life in general. also after Bachelor's its far easier to apply and get approved as opposed to after +2. also Bachelor's is very cheap compared to bidesh. Leaving the country as a teenager and growing up throughout my early 20s in bides has had me plant a doubt of growth in me. i feel like i have wasted my potential in Japan. I did 2 years of language and 4 years of graphic design and am currently studying 3d designing (1st year) as soon as i complete my study i wanna try and leave this country for good.   but I can also give a reason why you should move. 1. exposure at a young age. you get to experience things for the first time which is a doorway to learn many things about yourself and everything else. you see things that you have never even imagined. different languages and different cultures are important to live outside the bubble and see the world a little differently   2. privacy. in Nepal we have zero privacy. you do get total privacy and you can enjoy your alone time in solitude. this also comes with loneliness so be prepared to live a lonely life for the most part. loneliness also comes with anxiety and depression so try to keep yourself busy and in a circle.   3. life lessons. you start earning and learn to budget your expenses. you realize earning is easy and how much your parents had to sacrifice for you to be where you are. you also start getting very confident because now you are king of your own decisions.  4. You understand where you and your country lacks and how you can improve it. In Nepal there are many areas where change is necessary and if you never see it from others POV you will never know that it needs fixing. for example, i never cooked while i was in Nepal because mom did it all the time. but after coming here i have learned to cook some good food and also learned communication skills because of my work. also you see what exactly is not good in nepal and get the idea how you can fix it. for example lines in hospitals and other businesses like ward offices and banks. this can easily be fixed with a simple token and display. also supermarket like bhat bhateni can be improved with better staff training for efficiency  5.You can finally buy the things you couldn't afford as a kid. and you can buy the gifts for your family without having to worry about money so much. the face they make when you hand them the gifts is just priceless.  6. quality of life increases because you learn to keep yourself healthy and hygienic all the time. wearing nice clothes and with better styles uplifts your life by folds.   7. BAD SIDE  : you might also start drinking and smoking very often leading to sickness in the future when you are in your 30s and 40s|||I think it's the personal choice.

            "body": "Hello everyone,  I never thought I’d be writing this again. I wish our situation had gotten better since my last post… but reality has been harsher than I ever imagined.  My father is battling Stage 3 Gall Bladder Cancer, and his treatment at RGCI, Delhi is ongoing. We somehow managed to complete 5 chemo cycles , by selling whatever little we had, taking loans, borrowing from friends and relatives, and emptying every bit of savings. But now, we are completely drained .. emotionally, mentally, and financially.  The doctors say the next few chemo cycles are critical . If we stop now, everything we’ve fought for so far might go in vain. But the treatment cost has now gone beyond ₹20 lakhs, and we have nothing left to continue.  My father is a simple, hardworking man a small farmer and shopkeeper from a middle-class family. He spent his entire life making sure we never felt our struggles,have some good education. Only now do I truly see how much he silently sacrificed for us. I’m still in college, trying to study, trying to stay strong, but watching him in pain and feeling helpless is tearing me apart. i feel cancer is the worst thing you can ever deal with .  I’ve seen my mother cry silently in the corner every night, and my sisters trying to smile despite knowing how close we are to losing everything. I keep telling them we’ll make it that I’ll find a way but right now, I don’t know how much longer we can hold on without help.  In my last post, so many kind souls came forward. I’m truly, deeply grateful — we managed to raise about ₹1.5 lakh, which helped us cover chemotherapy and hospital bills. Every rupee meant the world to us. 🙏  But the journey is far from over. We still need around ₹20 lakhs more to continue his treatment and give him a real chance at life.  If you’re reading this please, help us if you can. Even a small amount, even a share, even a prayer it all counts.   I’m not asking for sympathy; I’m asking for humanity.

That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.

I agree.|||First thing I do is I ask them if they can speak English. It will hurt their little ego and they’ll switch immediately.|||You do you and I'll do me, I guess.    I spoke Hindi with a bunch of Bangladeshi tourists, because I don't understand Bangla, they don't understand Nepali, and they were more comfortable with Hindi than English.    I spoke Hindi with some Indian tourists because they were more comfortable with it than with English.    I continued to speak in English with an Indian visiting Nepal when I and a friend were interacting with him. The thing was, he switched code. I understood him and could have communicated well in Hindi with him, but my friend doesn't really understand Hindi, so I had to keep it in a language everyone understood, and I just told him I am not very good in Hindi.    I would happily speak Nepali in places like Darjeeling, where they speak Nepali, because I am most comfortable in it, and I know most people there would be more than comfortable in that. I assume that it is a comfort thing for them as well.  They're just more comfortable with Hindi than English, and I am accommodating, and fluent enough in Hindi, to extend the courtesy of speaking in their language.    I have come across Indians who look down on Nepal and Nepalis, and unfortunately, that attitude is more common among Indians than it should've been. It is not a pleasant experience, I admit. But, I refrain from putting all of them in a single box. I've met some wonderful Indians as well.   What I have to say is, we are individuals first, I, you, and anyone else, regardless of our nationality, or the languages we speak. Treat each individual on their merit, not their national identity. In fact, the shittiest person I've ever met is a fellow Nepali, and for obvious reasons—I live in Nepal.   The people who treated you bad were shitty people. The same attitude could very well be found in an Englishman, a Frenchman, or even a Nepali. That doesn't mean every Nepali, or Englishman, or Frenchman, is like that.    We are individuals first, in our lived experiences, not just a nationality, and in essence, expressions of existence, far greater than just a nationality. Treat people for who they are in that moment, not a label attached to them.    This is exactly the kind of subtle hate and/or prejudice I am against, whether it is based on lived experiences or influenced by rhetoric.   Use all the languages you know, as much as possible, I say. It is much better to open one's horizons than be insular. And no, I am not just a Nepali. My nationality is just one aspect of who I am, one which is more happenstance than chosen and curated with careful thought. So is yours, if you are actually willing to see it, along with anyone else's. |||I am in Dubai and I speak fluent hindi except for friends if someone asks I just say I understand but can’t speak. I am from Nepal and I prefer English to communicate.|||Hmmmmm, you know why you are damn correct, gore haru le 'culture protect garnu parxa!' Vanxan, hami haru Indian ko vasa sikxau, gore le ni Indian vanxa, I'll start to learn newari. Thanks OP.|||Language is a powerful tool. I’m here in the US and I speak Spanish with folks who speak Spanish and obviously when there is a language barrier people will banter by saying things that can feel personal. Even greetings come down to culture like cunado (sala) in Nepali.  Most of our generation I am 27 years old watches anime Korean series and picks up words the same way we grew up with Hindi serials. It’s not about speaking Hindi being inappropriate but about the mindset and stigma attached to it. While speaking Japanese Spanish Korean Chinese or French gives you brownie points Hindi often doesn’t and that’s a failure in how Indian people and Hindi have been framed.  I relate to your concern and I have seen firsthand what you’re saying where it can make someone feel inferior and I believe that comes from perception not the language itself.  I say use language in your favor when you can. Draw your boundaries when needed and if something feels insulting say it clearly in English and they usually won’t repeat it.

If we're multilingual, use everything available to your advantage. If someone asks me if I speak Hindi, I say yes because I grew up in Nepal and a lot of Nepalis can understand Hindi. That honestly makes me sound better.

You need to speak a few languages to be able to travel. Or travel in a series/ it’s a travel agent term where they have interpreters/ cultural consultants etc.|||I don't think its a language issue but that particular problem treating you like shit issue. You can speak Hindi and still set boundaries if they treat you like shit. I don't see why speaking any other language will make you inferior. I did my Bachelors in India and never had a problem putting people in their places in their own language. I think uneducated illiterate and entitled people are everywhere including India and Nepal, I have had similar experiences with different ethnic communities within Nepal. I actually have problems speaking to Nepali people in Australia as they'll cross every boundary and think I'm liable for them just because we're from the same country.. Its a regional issue.  I watched a interview of Sonam Wangchuk in Nepal and he speaks Nepali throughout the interview. I think as reasonable people we should use whatever language we want depending on the circumstances. Having Hindi in our language arsenal is honestly a superpower as we get access to soo much resources and forms of art that otherwise we wouldn't have been exposed to and as someone from Nepal where we already have a lack of such resources, I'd be sad if I hadn't known Hindi.  So, maybe lets practice putting people in their places if they behave rudely to us and not blame the language. I have many friends from India who I am very close with and many that I had to tell them to show their entitlement elsewhere. It can be the same with English very soon with sentiments of immigration shifting alot and will be with Nepali within Nepal as well. So yea.. lets just enrich our lives with our knowledge of the language.|||yeah ban bollywood they force hindi on us|||indians are coming into kathmandu in large number we should do something they all force hindi|||i feel good that i never talked in hindi with anyone here. Honestly, it was annoying when people used to come directly and started talking with me in Hindi just because i had indian features/ (chhetri ) and to make it worse my name is also kinda indian ( hate it) . But I never replied in Hindi and they just started talking to me in English after that. A lot of my co workers used to ask me can you not speak Hindi . I used to directly reply to them that I do know a little but I prefer not to because there’s no reason to and want to make my English speaking skills better.|||Bro, most Indians do not care about Nepal particularly in their day to day life. They are too busy with their own lives and the immediate world around them to specifically think anything about Nepal. India is a country of 1.3 billion people. And even in India, many people don't speak Hindi. Yeah, many in older generation are more racist, but they are racist to each other too. Many people fight over language in different Indian states, and discriminate with people of different states. But as I said, there are 1.3 billion people and a large majority will be as friendly to Nepali people. No, they don't think of Nepal as their little bro, but if asked, would actually hold some affinity towards Nepal in comparison to what they think of other nations.  Feel free to learn Hindi, feel free to forget, it's every one's personal choice. I honestly almost never need to learn it, but I like Nepali songs so much that I'm picking up on Nepali words now. (Kasari Bhanu, Bardali, Sarangi, Timi ra ma are among my favourite)  Lastly, this sub is quite Anti Indian, just saying,  generalizing India and Indians is ridiculous as the population is much more than most people can think of. And bad will always be highlighted more than good.|||It's not just Nepalis. North Indians act like this towards south Indians too. I know Hindi, but I would never speak it unless I was physically in north India. Talk to me in my own language, or in English is my rule. I am not going out of my way to speak in your language for you.|||TBH We are inferiors in every aspect. I get that we have pride, but look at the situation of our country. since i faced alot of indians too they think we are super poor. I work in a corporate, so they don't talk to me differently but yeah if i am out and someone starts to talk to me in hindi, ill ask them to speak in english. ( This usually happens in brampton area)|||I can understand this feeling. I’ve noticed something similar in myself. When an Indian person asks me for directions, I automatically respond in Hindi without really meaning to. Then the whole conversation continues in Hindi, and afterward I feel a bit uncomfortable, wishing I had replied in English instead.       But I also hesitate because I’m not sure if they would understand me clearly in English, and I genuinely want to help. It’s something I’m still figuring out.|||I had a Mexican friend who kind of looks like South Asian and he told me that he used to get misjudged as an Indian by them and he used to hate when Indians used to come to him and stsrt talking to him in hindi thinking he's indian and he would be there just looking at them confused ... 🙃🙃.. like wtf. .. they didn't even ask him if he was Indian or not .. just because he looked like South Indian they started talking to him in Hindi ..|||Yes same!

I openly say that I understand it but don’t speak it, and I’ve never been treated like garbage because of that. I’m guessing you’re a man, because Nepalese men constantly put themselves in an inferior position, always with the “bhai, bhai” nonsense. That alone tells people how to treat you. I’m a 22-year-old woman in Canada, and there are two other Nepalese girls where I work. We carry ourselves with confidence. Our Indian manager can’t talk down to us, and neither can any coworker. But the Nepalese guys? They’re always talked down to like kids. They’re 27 and 28 years old and still get called “sala Nepali.” That never happens to us and it’s not a coincidence. We have more filipino co workers than Indians but they always hangout with Indians and say sh like , “ chalo bhai daru pitey hai aj “ in worse hindi accent possible.  This has nothing to do with language. It’s about presence. It’s about how you carry yourself. When you look unsure, dress badly, and act small, people treat you that way. Respect isn’t begged for , it’s taken.|||Guys why so much hatred for India.. I'm unable to understand...saw three post of similar kind..we indians treat or consider Nepalis as our brothers..what has happened to Nepal...we don't have any issues rather connected through religion, culture and tourism too... it's perfectly fine to save ur indigenous culture and languages but there should be no hate ...|||I agree. As a Bangladeshi growing up i also learned hindi. After coming aboard I realised whenever i spoke hindi with Indian they started behaving differently. Then I completely stopped talking in hindi and still continue to do so. I only speak hindi to my close Indian friend and no one else.   Also from my experiences I don’t consider people from punjab indian. They’re very different and welcoming people. I love them.

And Have deicided to tell everyone that I can understand Hindi(little little) but I don't know how to speak because of much grammatical and syntax differences between my mother tongue and hindi.

Bahrut stup - 2300 years old.   Buddha's story is  sculpted in this Stup. Mahamaya (Buddha's mother) is seen protected by Elephant. Another art shows her dreaming an elephant. There is also a story where buddha tamed Mad Elephant. So elephant holds importance in buddhism. You can google it.   As the time fly, scholars began their own narration and interpretation.  Mahavairocana tantra -7th/8th century. One of the foundational texts of esoteric buddhism. Here Ganesha appears as Vinayaka, often portrayed as an obstacle creating diety sub dued by the buddha's mantra. Yet once pacified. He becomes a protector.  Kanguyar - the tibetan buddhism canon, preserves several tantric texts where Ganapati is invoked. Toh 666, Toh 665 heart of mantra appears here.  Sadhanmala -a vast collection of tantric sadhanas compiled between 10th to 11th centuries include detailed rituals of Maha rakta Ganapati and other ganesha forms. These practice invoke Ganesha as a wealth bestowing and obstacle clearing diety.  In buddhism, the ganapati hridaya sutra also known as the arya maha ganapati hridaya dharani, is a sacred mantra given by shakyamuni buddha to his desciple Ananda.  Mostly Ganesha is seen in Tibetan and Vajryan with more than 4 hands.  All the buddhist countries as Japan, Thailand , indonesia (former), China see elephant head diety as buddhist god.  Ganesha images in China occur between 6th to 7th century.  Lets see where Ganesha appears in Brahmin religion (hindu).  Rigveda - 1464AD is the oldest surviving manuscripts (30 pages or folios of birch bark) submitted by Indian Governmet to UNESCO.  Ganesha does not appear in it.  And in later rigveda version also, Ganesha vagueley appears. In short, hindu Ganesha does not exist.  They may claim Veda is million years old, but we must stick with history not theories.  Ganesha Purana - 13 to 17 th century. It explains the story of Ganesha.  However , it seems the ganesha cult started form 9th/11th century.|||“Kaaaaa yesto Kura gareko hera,   Yo tah hamro Saan ani dharma ho ni ,  Hami ajhai every tourist destination ma religious sites banau parcha ,  Nepal and its natural beauty jawos Kholai khola .tyo ek dui Jana tourist naayera k huncha Hami Lai.”|||Desh tikekai India ra Indian tourists le ho ta saathi.

Most of the tourists that these places receive are mostly internal tourist, which is Nepalese, and majority of Indians, and buddhist. These places aren't attracting any secular tourists as such, plus just because they suddenly declared Nepal is a secular country, doesn't erase it's civilizational history, any western tourist when he thinks of Nepal, the things that comes in his mind are mountains, buddha, temples, monastries and stuffs, that's what they expect.  So, when there is already enough reason, Temples are automatically going to be built.  Plus, we have more and enough evidences that after building temples or statues in such places, the tourism has actually gone up.  So, it makes no sense why you are mad here.  Regarding the shoes, except the main area of Temple, it's wrong to just dictate to open shoes, that's something we all can raise voice.  Regarding Bhajan, that's definitely wrong, no one can just blast any Bhajan in such open place whenever they like it. And, this issue is also solvable.  It's sad that just because of these two issue of shoes and Bhajan, you went on to attack the existence of Mandir and statues themselves without actually understanding the overall context.|||I was there this summer, they never said to take off my shoes and there wasn't any bhajan and stuff.|||What’s the meaning behind this is Pokhara not Janakpur?|||keta keti haru jun thau pani romanticize garne lul.

You literally heard “ghar renovate bhairacha” and your smooth brain went: “Aww baby, aaile mero room ma aaija na, teacher lai ni bolau, ma ta class ma hunchu, disturb pani hudaina.” Bro you didn’t just hand over your room, you handed over your entire bed for their afternoon fuck-session like a 5-star hotel receptionist. You set the mood, locked the door from outside and paid the electricity bill while that randi was getting railed on your own pillow.  You’re not a “nice boyfriend”, you’re a walking doormat with Wi-Fi.

You came home early and still had to play detective like some Bollywood hero, peeking through the window because your own room was locked from inside. Bro even Nepali serials don’t have this level of chutiya plot.  And the cherry on top? You threw the blankets and rugs instead of throwing hands. Blanket jalaunu parne thiyo, timi chai “winter aaucha, kasari sutne” bhanera Daraz ma fluffy white rug khojdai chau. Bro your girlfriend got piped on your bed and your biggest concern is staying warm?? Priority thik cha baba.  You didn’t just get cheated on, you got professionally scammed by a third-class tutor and a third-rate girlfriend. Block her, delete everything burn the mattress and never ever say “disturb nahos” to a girl again.  You’re not heartbroken, you’re brain-dead.

Trendy: they're brainwashed, selfish, came for masubhat  Reality: UML has strong foundation and institutions in every sectors, from education to workers, farmers, employees, businesses.   These organizations/institutions although have bad reputations, have done some apprecianle deeds too. From volunteering, blood donations, scholarship schemes etc. For eg. UML's student union was the first one to reach to Kalapani and put Nepal's flag on the land.   What we're doing is just bashing them on the internet with mostly baseless accusations. (Mostly, not all). That's not how you defeat an established and strong organization.

I wanted to take a moment to share something from the heart, especially for the Gen Z community here. I’m not here to lecture, judge, or pretend that I “know better.” In fact, it’s the opposite—I’m here because I genuinely admire a lot about Gen Z, and I’d love to learn from you if you’re open to talking or sharing your perspectives.  What I really respect about your generation is the honesty. The courage to say things out loud that older generations kept buried. The way you call out what doesn’t feel right, whether it’s in society, culture, work, or even in yourselves. The world is changing fast, and you all seem to face it with a unique blend of humor, vulnerability, and resilience. And honestly, that’s inspiring.  I’m not perfect, and I don’t pretend to fully understand everything about today’s trends, language, mindset, or struggles. But I’m here with an open mind. If any Gen Z member is willing to talk—to enlighten me, challenge me, laugh with me, or even correct me—I’d sincerely appreciate it.  I’m reaching out with respect and humility. I’m here to listen, not impose. Thank you to anyone who takes a moment to respond. 🙏🏽|||yesto sanskar vaka le kasto desh banauxan hola?

I’m truly grateful. Recently during an interview, I shared my personal political standpoint. I mentioned that I do not personally recognize K.P. Oli as a leader whose ideology I align with. I say this not out of disrespect, but from a place of accountability and responsibility toward our nation. After the recent Gen Z protests, I believe many of us expected honest conversations, acknowledgment of public concerns, and accountability for the injustices that occurred under his administration where many lives were lost. When leadership is unable to take responsibility for such serious matters, it becomes difficult for me to support or follow their ideology. My intention is not to attack individuals, but to stand for truth, transparency, and a future where leaders are answerable to the people. I believe Nepal deserves leadership that listens, learns, and upholds justice for every citizen. Thank you once again to everyone who resonated with my thoughts. Let’s continue pushing for a better and more responsible political culture together.|||So many Incel chicks in comment, are we even safe?|||Nepal is literally full of chutiyas like these, logic fact kei chaina 😂 .

            "body": "Namaste everyone,  I want to share an incident that happened to me in the last two weeks here in Germany.  My name is … Khadka, and I’ve been doing an Ausbildung at a Hofladen for the past 7 months. My chef treats me really well, like family.  Last week, I was at an Indian roadside café with my sister and some German friends, waiting for my chef to pick me up before visiting the Weihnachtsmarkt. We were waiting , suddenly two indian boys came to us and we had a short conversation . They were annoying so we started ignoring but they soon started making disrespectful comments like calling me MOMO and then mocking Nepal, our size, economy, and poverty. I didn’t respond with racism, though the conversation got heated.  Coincidentally, my chef was nearby, noticed something was wrong, and later asked if I was okay. I explained everything to him. He took it seriously and suggested legal action.  With the help of my chef’s lawyer, a legal letter was sent demanding an apology and €270 from the men. After a few days, they agreed to pay the money and apologized so the case would not go further.  Fun Fact : I and my sister literally eat MOMO after getting that 270 euro 😭😆  So reason of writing this post was just to sharing the possibility of what wrong can happened and how to handle this things.  Edit : For OC (https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204052999996390/permalink/2475725379495816/?mibextid=rS40aB7S9Ucbxw6v)",

Here are a few from my side:  1. Does RSP view kulman's party as a threat to their voter base as there seems to be a significant overlap between RSP and Kulman’s supporters. Are there any discussions or considerations about forming a coalition with them or other emerging political forces? 2. Sumana leaving brought a lot of negative light on RSP, her exit made it seem like the party was becoming more of a “Rabi supporters’ club.” Has her departure brought any internal changes within the party, or has everything remained largely the same? 3. If an opportunity arises  where you can form a coalition government together with one of the old parties are you willing to take it, for example if UML and RSP together have the numbers to form a government, would you take that opportunity? Or would the party prefer to stay in opposition rather than partner with any of the traditional major parties?

In this context, what does RSP feels about new alternative forces that have emerged after the gen z Andolan? Do you see them as a threat since they too will be contesting for the same voter base? Any internal discussions going on to work with them?  I think a good percentage of people are confused and unsure about where RSP stands on many burning issues in Nepal which has pushed Nepal into instability time and again. I’m sure you know what I’m talking about. RSP seems to tip toe around those issues and avoid discussing it overtly.   Could we see RSP take a vocal stand on those issues and make their ideological stance clear before this election? Perhaps this would help RSP clarify its position to unsure but potential voters, and strengthen its presence in villages, small towns and far districts.|||Do you think the current FPTP voting system should be replaced by Instant-runoff / Alternative voting?

I get it Rabi ko party ho but when I/we voted to RSP, it wasn’t because of Rabi but rather the young people like Sumana, Toshima, Ganesh, Sobita who joined Rabi.   Swarnim Wagle isn’t the face of alternative politics. He went to media and started saying shit about Kulman when Kulman has just stayed silent about RSP-Kulman merger. What is that if not a media trial? He is just a sad Congress member who couldn’t get ticket due to bhauju so jumped ship to RSP. Why does he get more say in RSP ko internal matters than other young faces?  So my question again - why is RSP so Rabi centric? Why should we vote for RSP when the whole party philosophy revolves around Rabi? And when Rabi retires, there’s basically no one to lead because the party has been so focused on Rabi and doing media trial against other young leaders.|||What is RSP stance in privatizing Nepal Oil Corporation, Nepal Airlines, and other state owned companies?

Why not make Kulman Ghising as face of RSP and future PM.|||Why did you go in alliance with CPN-Maoist(formerly), if we look at politicians with big ambitions like Pierre Pollierrve(Canadian LoP currrently), the far-right of germany, the far right of France, all of them have chosen to not form an alliance with the one whom they claim they're fighting against. For example, Pierre Pollierve despite my hatred for him I can agree that he trruly opposed the policies and was there for a change which is why respecting the mandate in previous elections he chose not to form a gov despite having an opportunity to come in power via alliance with NDP, and Qubec. Why did you not stick with the principles and chose an alliance with the two heads whom Nepalese hate?  Second question, what's your party ideology, is it left wing or right wing? Based on following factors;Economics, Culture.  Third Question, the census data reveals that there's been 100% increase in the number of Christian population which clearly shows that our demographics is being destroyed, in the vietnam the missionaries have been converting the indegenous people to have a claim over the land, similar thing has happened with the Naga community of India, so its likely that Kiranti people are next, what will you do to stop this manipulative conversion, if you were in position of power?

I have some critical questions. I would be more than happy if Rabi reads these as well.  1.Why aren't you popular? ..at least upto your actual work?  Why are you guys in the shade while there's only talk of Rabi , Gagan, prasai , balen , sumana in the town. Your name is only taken collectively as \"a raswopa neta\". What are your biggest works and achievements as a member of parliament and rsp central member?  2.Why 45 lakhs signature for Rabi but 8.2 lakhs only voter id? Why can't I say that rsp prioritized a personality cult over connecting to new voters. Why is this not a catastrophic failure? Why did you guys fail to pressurize gov and commission to enable diaspora voting and even voter id registration from abroad. Nid was enabled for a brief period of time only. How can you guys exercise democracy with that slow and buggy registration process and 25 lakhs eligible citizens still unregistered?  3.Why is RSP scared to run elections independently on their own?Any plans to help gagan thapa win again?  4.Why is RSP vulnerable to propaganda by gagan thapa IT cell and 12 bhai fake news?  5.Why is rsp's communication and convincing skills so poor ? Couldn't onboard prominent figures and even chase Sumana away, how will you guarantee this doesn't deter similar newcomers again? I know it's important but is it that only the loyalist shall survive in rsp?   6. How many seats is the bibeksheel party contributing to the rsp in the upcoming election? Any projections? Or is it just a symbol?  7.Why is RSP not popular among genz , heavy backslash to Rabi and rsp being labeled as the same old parties, it being too person centric? Why do genz and youngsters hate political parties? What has rsp done and doing to make rsp popular among youngsters? Why is it so lost?   8.Why is RSP activities limited to Kathmandu valley and Chitwan only? I saw rsp doing some program recently AGAIN in chitwan instead of some new place. By being such limited to two districts how are you gonna secure the majority of seats across the country? Why are you preventing RSP from becoming big? We had hopes and still have some. Who's deciding all these?   9. Who's the youths face in rsp ? And how are they representing us? Where?   10. Why does RSP lack someone who's clear about his stance like what Mahesh basnet is for uml? Who's the spokesperson and why is he/she operating in a clinical and limited periphery.   11. Rabi Lamichhane publicly in a speech told that he lost many seats in 2079 election because he wasted his time trying to onboard popular faces instead of fostering new leadership and win more seats, but you guys seem to entertain this notion of onboarding popular faces more , forgetting the fact that you yourself aren't there due to popularity background. Why? Why can't you do something on your own rather than over-depending upon kulman or balen? I mean if you can't onboard them why waste an excessive amount of energy for that? Why such a weak mindset?  RSP central committee representatives feels incomplete and still need to cater many audiences, why don't you onboard brilliant and sharpest minds rather than just someone based on popularity or old connections? |||What are the things that you've done for Nepal?|||RSP stands for Rabi Swatantra Party?|||Remindme! 1 day|||Whats the ideology of rsp|||Hello Ganesh Nepal should enforce proper marital laws, including legally recognized prenups.

            "body": "I swear, the more I watch Miraj Dhungana’s actions after the Gen-Z protests, the more pissed off I get. This guy went from saying “I’m not the leader, this is a collective movement” to suddenly announcing a whole political party under the Garikhana Deu banner like it’s some kind of personal promotion. Do you even realize how ridiculous that looks? We were told this movement was leaderless, built on the frustration of an entire generation, and now the SAME person who said he wasn’t leading anything is stepping into politics like he’s been preparing the whole time. It feels like the movement’s energy was used as a ladder.  And don’t even get me started on the way he handled the October 9 protest confusion. When young people were panicking, waiting for clarity, ready to go to the streets again because the country is literally suffocating under corruption, what does he do? He steps back. He shrugs it off and says Gen-Z wasn’t involved. Bro, if you’re going to speak for the movement when it’s convenient, then show up when shit gets chaotic too. That’s literally what leadership is. Instead, he pops up when the cameras are rolling and disappears the moment things get risky. That kind of pick-and-choose activism makes me angry because that’s exactly the political behavior we protested against.  Then there’s the whole “our office was attacked” episode. He went public with it, made it sound serious, and then the police said there was no official complaint, and everything was calm when they arrived. What are we supposed to believe? Either be transparent or don’t dramatize it. People actually suffered during these protests. People bled. People DIED. And watching someone drag the movement into half-explained drama with zero clarity is honestly insulting.  What makes me the most furious is how he keeps talking like he represents the entire generation, giving big speeches about unity, direct elections, overseas voting, and political reform, while his actions keep zig-zagging all over the place. You don’t get to call yourself the voice of Gen-Z while making moves that look inconsistent, self-centered, and convenient. The Gen-Z protests weren’t a TikTok trend. They weren’t a branding opportunity. They were a desperate cry from a generation that’s tired of being silenced and robbed of a future.  Watching someone turn that into a messy political ambition is heartbreaking and infuriating. We didn’t risk our safety so one guy could walk around looking like a “youth politician.” We marched for real change. For accountability. For a country that doesn’t chew its future generation alive. And right now, Miraj feels like he’s drifting so far from the soul of that movement that it’s honestly painful.  If he actually wants to stand for Gen-Z, then he needs to stop playing this half-activist, half-politician game and show some damn consistency, clarity, and courage because right now, all I’m seeing is another person using the movement’s energy to put himself in the spotlight.  Anyone else feel like this? Because I’m seriously done pretending this is okay.    And here are the straight-up questions people genuinely have for him:  Who is funding your movement, your events, and now this new political party?  Why did you claim there was “no leader” during the protests but suddenly step into a political role afterward?  When exactly did you decide to form a party during the protests or after?  If you didn’t intend to be a leader, why are you acting like one now?  Why do you vanish or disengage whenever things get tense, unclear, or dangerous?  Why was the October 9 situation handled so confusingly by you?  Why talk about an attack on your office but file no clear, formal police complaint?  Who keeps you accountable? Who checks your decisions?  What gives you the right to speak on behalf of an entire generation?  Are you building a movement or building a personal political brand?",

Everrryyone has to be the top dog, main guy, leader. Nobody knows how to work in cooperation with others. Everyone thinks they have to be the saviour.   It would have been good if all these voices joined together. But no, sab lai main character bannu cha|||I think it was already clear he is nothing but opportunist, like we saw the shark difference between him and Sudan during the crucial period of protest, he was literally nowhere to be found when we actually needed him while Sudan and his team were literally in the streets, the only difference is Sudan is straightforward and doesn’t do sugarcoating meanwhile miraj is best at that just like our oldies neta|||Until now he has only proven to be an opportunist and nothing else.|||J hos alikati vaye nih kutai vetyo jatha le|||Bro's a walking fashion show and disappointment|||I've been hating on him since the day he went to durga prasai in order to make him take the lead of \"GenZ\" protest.

He's only at this stage cause of racism that pushed social workers like Sudan aside \"chinese, indian\" accusations ley.

So support those who want corruption free nation, not a certain generation|||here's my 2 cents(you can check my post history to determine the kind of person I am)  He's from a well-off family. He's been doing 'media' stuff like making videos and shit from a while ago but he hasn't been 'in the streets' as a kid and it shows. Call me backwards or whatever but if you never got into fights as a kid, or even as a teenager, you don't have that 'bite'. That's him. That softness combined with good looks and branding made him the perfect mascot for non-violent 'gen-z'. He's great as a model but as a ruthless and calculating leader that can lead hundreds of people to bring a certain outcome? Nope.. he's a weak kid inside. Aba ko political events le uslai daro banauna chai sakcha hai in that regard.  He got scared after the sep 8/9 incidents, fearing that his good life could get stripped away from him. He's someone with a lot to lose. His family and relatives probably held him back. Tespachi he probably came back to the front ali pachi with some kind of a plan. Aile chai I just think he's trying to do what he thinks and knows is right - play by the political system's rules. And since we all have severe trauma related to anything 'political party' related, we hate to see it.  Sudan is the opposite of miraj - he's been in the field, has scolded corrupt officials to their face since 2015, has had literal dirt and blood on him. But he's not an eloquent speaker like miraj, he's got 'a look' but the kind of person he has become, branding himself online is not sth he cares about. Whatever he is, is his brand.  In any case, we gotta be careful and discerning and support where needed and criticize where appropriate.

Intentions sahi hola but yinarle anarchy matra badauxan.|||Not a Zenzee and while I appreciate the revolution and all, they have slowly becoming Oli gang. What it demonstrates is the blood we have - thirsty for oneself, power, money, opportunity. I am particularly upset with Sudan Gurung who is hell bent at removing Home Minister and this guy called Miraj Dhungana. I will dismiss Miraj right off the bat because I don't see anything in his eyes and his face. He is a selfish person and anyone who is following him and all should think many times. Sudan Gurung - the guy is hell bent on removing home minister on such a stupid demand that he wants to arrest Oli and Lekhak. What the hell guys ? are you looking for rawanraj? we have laws and we want to enforce it fairly and strictly. Om Prakash is a lawyer and he is not trying to protect Oli or Lekhak - anyone thinks that is such a stupid Zenzee. Do you guys want to arrest someone just on a whim? without gathering sufficient proof? In western countries law enforcement officials spend years if not decades monitoring and gathering evidences against someone they think is culprit - they just don't  arrest someone and investigate - that wouldn't be rule of law. Om Prakash has that schooling. I don't care who Om Prakash is and all but he is definitely a capable guy and has proved it time and again - after all, he is chosen by PM.  Now, are you guys looking to change ministers and government leadership when we only have 4 months to go ? Its such a shame when every so called Zenzee goes to Singhadarbar and disturbs our government's actions. Just think if all the time they spend is meeting you guys.     Now listen to what Mahabir Pun said - please go to your constituencies and help new  political parties that align to your views win - why are you spending so much energies trying to meet the PM ? The Miraj Dhungana is such a scam guy - He is driven by his own ambition, I feel. I did like Sudan but he is also active childish and not a thing in near future.  Whatever everyone says and does listen and watch what Rachha Bam says and does. She is the one who walked out with Army Chief when he seemed to infer democracy was in danger. She is acting with passion and patience. I would recommend everyone to support behind Raswapa, Sagar Dhakal, Baburam, Kulman,  Sumana Shrestha. Sumana is the real deal.     Now if you believe in democracy and free and fair election, support Rabi. How can a person so beloved by people can be in jail without having an opportunity to go to people? is democracy is for the people and by the people?     I recommend please read. Watch what Swarmin Wagle said few days that Deuba was Zenzee, Oli was Zenzee and every popular leader was zenzee when they started politics. There has been tremendous progress but it was not enough. Just because you feel young and under 25 doesn't mean its your government and can do anything. Nope - no way until we have rule of law.     Now this government gotta focus on election and it has to happen. When I hear Miraj and Sudan that say it can't happen in current condition are not only naïve but foolish. They gotta go read what democracy is. Nothing happens without people's mandate which is vote.     And don't forget its not you guys who brought this change - it was a coincidence.  Someone else did on 24th so you really shouldn't overwhelmingly take any credit, especially Miraj who didn't even take part in the protest ! Hope it helps.|||Ani aaja bholi singa durbar bhitra baseka haru protocol follow garera aako hun ta ??|||miraj and party >>>>> yemale and other similar parties|||Yea the protest was headless/leaderless but we need people to lead you can't complain he gained from this protest of course he did and we want a capable leader to run office not military the argument that he was not in the protest is stupid this is exactly why we failed as national because we put fighters as leaders they can be leaders while fighting but in office we need people who lead office not mobs and arms   Not taking his side but this was a common argument against him and I disagree so this ... Btw I don't know why they want directly elected pm within 6 months like bring 2/3 majority and do what you want their ego will delay the election effectively pushing the country years backwards focus on NOTA and NRN voting rights and different policy and development plan for future|||All this shit is happening coz there was no leader during gen z protests. They did not achieve anything despite such massive movement except toppling Government.   Miraj Dhungana came into realization. An organised group is must to move forward. The most important thing a leader should have is a clean image and clear vision. The maturity he has shown not being political figure is admirable.   One of the good thing coming out of Gen Z movement is the youth having interest on politics and stepping forward to be incharge.  We should not discourage them, in the same time help them by giving healthy and constructive criticisms.|||आज उनीहरूले गरेको माग केपी र लेखक लाई सजाए को दायरा मा ल्याउनुपर्छ भन्ने विषयमा थियो। सायद त्यो माग राख्नु गलत भयो होला है।|||Yo sub pani flip bhaira hunxa harek bela.

So after my +2, my family started going full \"bihe gar, bihe gar\" mode. Every morning felt like a marriage proposal interview. I kept saying I wanted to study bachelor’s first, but nobody took me seriously. Typical Nepali parent combo attack.  Then one day, boom they tell me, “We found a good boy.” I hadn't even seen his face; they were like, “Ramro chhora ho.” Girl, I didn’t even know his name.  Fast-forward to the wedding day: Whole gaun dancing, kids running everywhere, DJ blasting Sani Nani. Everyone vibing except me, the bride, who’s just like “ what is happening.”  I finally saw my husband at mandap and yeah, he looked decent but BRO DIDN’T EVEN LOOK at me properly. I swear he stared at the floor more than my face.  Then suhagraat… I was in the room crying like an idiot because I was stressed and scared. But instead of comforting me, man walked in, looked shocked like he saw a ghost, and LEFT. NO WORDS. ZERO. ZILCH.  For the next few days, our communication level = Bluetooth off.  After that, he escaped to KTM faster than a last bench student during assembly. I thought maybe he’d text? Call? Smoke signal? ANYTHING? Nope. Silence.  Dashain time comes, he returns home. I tried walking near him; man literally walked behind us like we're bodyguards. Even then, no talking. I don’t think he even knew my name until his mom spilled it   And the chocolate incident… His sister gave me a packet, so I ate it (obviously). Later I found out it was for gifting the village kids. Bro looked at me like I ate their future   Months passed. Not a single conversation. I started avoiding him too because at this point it's just awkward both sides.  Then post-Dashain, he shows up at my maita to take me back. Whole family treating him like king jwai. He looked scared of the respect   My little sister tagged along with us, thank god, because otherwise we’d walk one hour in complete silence. My man STILL didn’t talk directly to me. He literally whispered to my sister, “Ask what didi wants to eat.” SIR??? HELLO??? I CAN HEAR YOU???  8 months married. 0 conversations. 0 eye contact. 0 progress.  We communicate through: • my sister • awkward glances • chowmein orders • pure telepathy failure  Anyway, idk what this relationship is but at this point we’re basically two NPCs living separately but married by system default 😭",

My brain: “She’s… pretty.” Also my brain: “Don’t look. If you look she’ll know you exist.”  So yes, I stared at the floor like it owed me money. I was SO nervous I forgot how to blink.  Suhagraat  I walked into the room and saw you crying and my entire soul left my body.  I panicked so hard I thought I’d faint. My mind went: “What do I do?? Comfort??? Talk??? DIE???”  So I did the only thing my socially anxious caveman instincts allowed: I LEFT.  First Few Days  Every time I tried to say something, my throat said, “Haha no.” You looked as scared as I felt.  So… Bluetooth off.  Then I got sent to Kathmandu for work and honestly I was relieved because I had no idea how to function around you. I rehearsed texting you like 20 times but never sent anything. If silence was a sport, I was winning gold.  Dashain  I came home thinking, “Okay, this time I’ll talk.” Then I saw you.  Brain: buffering…  I wanted to walk next to you but I didn't want to be creepy or weird, so I walked behind. Like a bodyguard with performance issues.  Then the chocolate incident— I gave that packet to my sister to distribute to kids. When I saw you eating it I didn’t get mad— I got SCARED. Because I didn’t know if I should tell you or just pretend gifting chocolate to villagers was never my plan in life.  After Dashain  My parents forced me to go pick you up from your maita. I was SO nervous I practiced “Let’s go” in front of the mirror like 14 times.  Your family treated me like royalty and I had no idea how to respond except freeze.  Your little sister tagging along was the best thing ever because if it was just us two… That hour of walking would’ve sent me to the hospital.  I DID want to talk to you. Genuinely. But my voice refused to come out whenever I faced you directly.  That’s why I whispered through your sister. “Ask what didi wants to eat” = the bravest sentence I said that day.  Now  8 months married. I still haven’t had the courage to properly talk to you.  Not because I don’t like you— I actually really like you.  I’m just… Terrified. Awkward. Zero experience. And overwhelmed by the fact that I suddenly have a whole wife.  Every day I think: “Tomorrow, I’ll talk to her.” Then you walk into the room and my brain blue-screens.  So yes, we are two NPCs married by system auto-fill. But trust me— I’m trying.  My heart is ready. My mouth is not.|||Xya yesto lamo kasle padhxa ho|||Yeutai manxey le made up scenario post garira cha yo ta.

Watch khan academy for general concepts. Use Perplexity AI or something like that for personal guidance. I got away with a 3.8+ GPA with only these resources.

For example: Use Fundamental Physics by Resnick and Halliday to understand the concepts in Physics, Thomas calculus for calculus, also most of the math is covered in BC Bajracharya's Basic of Mathematics.

NOC ko lagi matra ho. I can guarantee you: Nepal ma law padhera, +2 ma you can be a doctor in the US. Don't worry about that path.    Now, +2 ma business Ra Tesko paxi law, or vice versa. Again, it doesn't matter; a good argument is that you enjoy business, so you would've gotten something out of it, but sometimes life isn't linear.    If you want to study in the US, you need a bachelor's degree before a law degree(juris doctor or JD), so you can do your bachelor's in business. If you want to study in any other country, you could easily dual-major in business + law.    Don't worry!|||Bro same I'm studying law in grade 12 rn 11 ma huda ni law padhne bela ekdam josh thiyo but as time passed by I started hating it 12 ta omfg i can't imagine (Legal drafting/Civil and criminal law/Nepalese legal system) is gonna take my life too many things to note down.I think it's better to go abroad after+2 you can pursue law in another country rather than here. And genuinely law bata good source of income prapta garnu ko lagi you probably have to be in that field until you are old idk. Now I'm scared of 12 boards omg🙏🏿",
