Even US mai pani directly elected PM chaina (i.e. president are not selected by popular vote.)  One of the solution that I can think of is: Political parties coming forward with their PM candidate. Like India ma House ko election mai BJP afno PM candidate Modi vanera aucha and Congress Gandhi lai PM vanera election ma jancha.  We need PM candidates from parties and need to have their debate. Based on that we can decide kunn party lai vote dine. Eso huda jo PM huncha, uskai parliament ma pani majority huncha. This helps in passing policies.

However, certain criteria have to be met by election candidates. The Parliament should only focus on making laws, but not all the laws and have no power on budget.

Also, pm should have the power to do byelection on specific area if he/she is not happy with certain samsad, with certain criteria ofcourse like if samsad is blocking the deal for more than 5 months for unreasonable reasons. Also, career politicians should be discouraged by setting higher standard like needing 60% vote to win 3rd election, 70% vote in 4th election.|||We have similar views in this.

No other doctors with good records and academic merits were in the race because they didn't belong to Yemale and paid cores rupees to the Yemale party.

This started with wanting a better country, but there was no how or \"who\" would lead. That is also why the lootings and burnings happened, as there was no one to take responsibility. It was not a revolution but an unfortunate accident that the bad actors took advantage of ‚Äî most possibly by design.  If we don't want civil war in the upcoming days, there is no option but to invite all the major parties to the next election. But of course, with the condition that they overhaul themselves, and this should not just be words but permanent actions clearly visible before the election.  There are jholeys and there are bideshi gotis. We must recognise them and not fall for any propaganda. What we want here is a well-functioning democracy and a sovereign country. Johleys are a curse to a well-functioning country, whereas bideshi gotis are a danger to our sovereignty.  Bideshi goti: Parties and people who take pleasure in talking about destroying/burning the country and its properties. Parties and people who campaign about weakening the Nepal Army. Those who refrain from talking about border disputes.  Jholeys: They don't criticise their party and their leaders at all. Meanwhile, they come up with nasty and often fake allegations against other parties' leaders. They change skin colour often to parrot their leader's agenda or defend political equations.  My personal opinion:  \\* Nepal cannot have a directly elected executive if we want our country to remain sovereign.   \\* There is no option for a multi-party democracy.   \\* The country is for people of all ages and backgrounds. Corruption affected everyone, as well as the majority encouraged/participated.   \\* Nepalese society is a low-trust society. People lack civic sense and basic decency.   \\* The biggest overhaul is needed in education, more than in government.   \\* There are bideshi gotis everywhere in the country; they are here as NGOs/INGOs for hidden motives and self-interest. They prop up, encourage and bribe people indirectly and in varied ways to execute their doings.|||biggest positivity i saw after this revolution is more people specifically youths have taken interest in politics!

Since the house was in control of a third party and/or no party between being in control of Deuba and then the Police, all evidence found in that home is inadmissible in a functioning justice system.

            "body": "Nepal just had one of its biggest protests in years. People are angry, buildings burned, and the state is asking for photos and videos of anyone who vandalized.  So far, so normal: police investigate, media report, everyone looks for answers. Right?   But here‚Äôs the twist: Setopati reported that police briefed the Prime Minister that \"most of the arson was done by sukumbasi (homeless people) and escaped criminals.\"  And at the same time, the person acting as both Home Minister and Law Minister is the legal adviser of a mayor who has a record of cracking down on sukumbasi communities.  See the problem yet?  This narrative is dangerous, deliberate and fabricated and is scapegoating the most  oppressed. When you say \"the homeless did it\", you‚Äôre putting the most vulnerable people in the firing line. And it's deliberate and sadly, not surprising.   We can't ignore how racism, casteism, and bias shape who gets punished. Madheshi people, homeless people, oppressed caste groups, they‚Äôre the ones society already blames easily. Individual cases (‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§¶‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§¶‡§æ) in a collective protest becomes a weapon, because structural prejudice decides who gets singled out.   On top of that, concentrated power makes it worse. When the same circle of power holds the law, the police, and political influence, accountability collapses. When the mayor‚Äôs legal adviser is also Home and Law Minister, then the line between \"justice\" and \"political convenience\" is erased.  The parliament has already been dissolved. There's no means of check and balance remaining in the government. And on top of that, Nepali media, \"the fourth pillar of the state\", is echoing everything that power decides. Without any verification or authentication, they're publishing faces of protestors and calling them criminals, when journalistic ethics require that you censor identity of the accused in even the most heinous of crimes like rape and murder.   Things do not add up, so please ask: who profits from this story? Look closer.   Blaming individuals distracts from state failures. Blaming individuals hides the fact that protests were collective and political.  Shifting attention to the vulnerable protects those in power who killed 51 people, which is what is happening. Pls pay close attention. Demand better.",

If you‚Äôre truly ready, here‚Äôs what worked for me and what might work for you too.  Build a Weekly Calendar and Stick to It  Structure brings clarity. Here‚Äôs a sample routine that helped me stay grounded:  ‚Ä¢ 7:00 AM ‚Äì Wake up, meditate, do puja, hit the gym or go for a morning walk ‚Ä¢ 10:00 AM ‚Äì 2:00 PM ‚Äì Learn new skills (online courses, tutorials, practice) ‚Ä¢ 4:00 PM ‚Äì 7:00 PM ‚Äì Productive browsing, research, content creation ‚Ä¢ 7:00 PM ‚Äì 10:00 PM ‚Äì Help your parents, spend time with family   Customize this to fit your lifestyle‚Äîbut stay consistent. Discipline is the bridge between goals and results.  Discover Your Interests and Build Skills Around Them  ‚Ä¢ Make a list: What do you enjoy? What drains you? ‚Ä¢ Refine your interests and identify beginner-friendly skills that align with them ‚Ä¢ Start learning‚ÄîYouTube, Udemy, Coursera, anything that gets you moving  Create Your Portfolio and Start Networking  Once you‚Äôve built some basic skills:  ‚Ä¢ Create a portfolio showcasing small projects ‚Ä¢ Write a resume that reflects your growth and potential ‚Ä¢ Start sending emails, applying for internships, and connecting on LinkedIn ‚Ä¢ Even go offline offer help for free just to gain experience  Prepare for That One Opportunity  I believe this deeply: Everyone gets one life-changing opportunity.

The problem with us is, we have a very limited lens to see our country and it's variations. We think every one is well informed and educated like us - and they should behave as we think we should.

This \"masu-bhat\" ideology that our urban culture shares so conveniently is an ill method to dehumanise other group of people who unfortunately did not have the same privileage as you - on education, upbringing, social status and economical balance.  Our large part of mass is still poorly educated - especially on socio-economic issues and politics. This means on the ground level - it becomes extremely easy to manipulate people based on beliefs. Conservative ideology is still something one huge part of population follows- and the idea of change is extremely alienating to them. It's mass psychology.  My only hope is this change will bring a long term change on our thinking process.  Anyone who thinks our country is going to be developed in 6 months, just because they protested, are radical fools.  Democracy is not a perfect solution as it has many flaws.  These middleman will surely take the advantage and as I write are already planning on how to take those power back.

I recently lived in a Hacker House in Dubai and it was an amazing experience for focused collaboration, learning, and launching projects. I‚Äôm curious if something similar could work in Kathmandu.  What is a Hacker House?  * A short-term shared space for builders: founders, devs, designers, students, creators. * Focused on collaboration, project sprints, workshops, and community events (typically 4‚Äì8 weeks).  Why Kathmandu?   There‚Äôs a growing tech and student scene here, and I think a hacker house could help bring people together to build and share knowledge.  Questions for you all:  1. Do you think Kathmandu would benefit from a hacker house? 2. What features would matter most (workspace, internet, events, mentorship, hardware lab, etc.)? 3. Have you seen/experienced something like this elsewhere?     üëâ If enough people are curious, maybe we can even do a small meetup to discuss further.  Would love to hear your thoughts üôè",

            "body": "I am very interested in this but need to do it in cheap. My main concern is the limited functionality in the router settings for Vianet. I've heard its worse for Wordlink but still.  My main services for me and my family will be:  * Nextcould/FileCloud * Immich * Jellyfin * and all my personal projects * utilities like portainer, pihole etc.  I shall be using cloudflared to publish these.   My main issue is that, when I am in my home network and access a service via my domain, it still relays through cloudflare. This means I cannot enjoy full speed even in my own network while using custom domains.  this is easily fixed by pihole. Not just adblocking it also does have DNS server which can be setup to resolve specific domains to my local ips. But I cannot set the dns server to my pihole server in my router as the function doesnot exist. I cannot even host a dhcp server in my home server because i cannot turn off the dhcp server in my router. I can maybe understand not enabling port forwarding. Also no easy way to setup dynamic dns like duckdns. Not just this but just not being able to tinker too much with you router just feels limiting to me.  Enabling some of this features like port forwarding requires the SOHO package for vianet which is way too expensive and slower.  The only fix I am seeing is getting a good second router, completely turning off the wifi of the ISP router and use it like you would use a modem, just a intermediary. Still feels wasteful to not use a perfectly good router.  Am I alone in this? Do other people in Nepal also have/want cool homelab setups? How are you setting up yours? Good router recommendations? or recommendation in general?  Just wanted to know the selfhost situation in Nepal.  Edit: I am disappointed in myself and my research skills. Turns out the admin login of the vianet CDATA router is not really a secret at all. After logging in from there, I can access everything I need. Wish me luck.",

If Im on my home wifi I can directly access with my lan ip when outside I connect to vpn.|||Tailscale + your domain¬†|||In Cloudflare Zero Trust, you can define traffic policies that either **include only specific IPs or domains** to be routed through Cloudflare, or **exclude certain IPs or domains** while routing everything else. This makes it flexible for both selective tunneling and full-tunnel setups.  In practice, we use this approach in remote workplaces: when a user is on-site, local DNS and private IPs resolve normally; when they connect via VPN, the same resources are accessible from anywhere.  If needed, a full tutorial on self-hosting with Cloudflare and different configuration patterns, i can help you with that.|||Truenas for home and tailscale for other networks?|||Senior Software Engineer here. Home labbing have been the best and most joyful hobby for me.  This is probably be a long write but you might find some value here and dont have to go through the same hassel I went through.  You can Skip the next two paragraph if you are only interested on my homelab setup.  I always had some interest in linux ever since my school days. Our computers on labs at school used to be locked with some kind of software and to combat that and play game me and my friend installed Puppy Linux on the computer. It worked like charm. Then I got into dual booting on my dad's computer. Once I even managed to format all his personal data in a process of dual booting. Then I understood the importance of learning through fkin up and backups simultaneously.    Fast forward I pursued Software Engineering and learn through first hand experience on all the process of sofware development and deployment. Leapfrog was a right place to build that initial experience. Sometimes later I got bored of Software Engineering and switched to DevOps instead, i love working with the servers and Internet. Before that I realized that servers are just someone else computer and I could replicate the whole Internet just on my room!!! plus I have some basic knowledge on Networking and Security from this (altho useless) BHons degree from Islington college. This was the starting of my home labing journey.   First thing first, I found it inconvient to run a laptop as a linux server cuz I has huge power footprint and the heat and noise was unbearable to me. So I decided to go with something small like a dell mini PC. Scouting through Hamrobazar and FaceBook marketplace I scored this i57th 16GB RAM 1TB HDD refurbished dell mini pc for just 12k. Next thing was choosing a distro, altho I am frequent follower of /r/selfhosted where people mostly go with a solution thats already designed for being a media server, I decided to go barebones and use Ubuntu. Being experienced with Docker from my Software Engeenering job, i decided to use Docker for everything and It worked like a charm!!!! Docker compose for everything, so easy.   Once Debian and Docker started to become booring for me, I decided to go with Proxmox and I never thought i could ever love anything more than Docker but Proxmox is a freaking gem. I use LXC containers and sometimes VMs depending on the need. Even if I need Docker, i just have a single lxc with Docker installed and Portainer if I am lazy.   The services that I mostly use are Arr suit for media download and management. Jellyfin as a media server for movies, tv and musics. (no transcoading all direct streams if you use jellyfin media server instead of web browser), audiobookself, adguard home with unbound as DNS resolver, booklore (books management and reading), gitea (project hosting), vaultwarden (bitwarden server), commafeed (I read news and blogs from RSS), opengist (github gist alternative), glance (dashboard for all my services),pterodactyl (to host minecraft and CS2 server), pocketid (auth proxy with only passkeys support), suwayomi (manga reading and downloading - web version for tachiyomi) and manyyy more   On the networking part (this has been most hassle), first I bought a cheap domain for 2$ and use Cloudflare for the dns management. Cloudflare offers tunnels that can proxy your internal servers to the Internet so going with was no brainer. Whilst it workrs wonderfully, something that bugged me was not having direct connection to my server. going with cloudlfare tunnels means loosing the bandwidth and latency and risk of being banned for streaming media content. For private vpn connection Tailscale is a nobrainer too imo. Plus you can set a dns server that redirects your domain to servers internally so it works seamlessly.    My setup was, cloudlfare tunnel on the docker container, then route catchall *.domain.com to my reverse-proxy server. With cloudlfare as your dns interface you get free HTTPS certs so that was a big bonus. On my internal LAN, i use adguard home as my DNS server which does the same catch all route to my reverse-proxy server. I went with NPM reverse-proxy because it has a user-friendly GUI and you can generate HTTPS certificate with Cloudlflare, so all my internal traffic are encrypted.   This all works well but not having a direct connection still bugged me. Vianet keeps you on CGNAT and with no public ip you are totally locked out. But to my surprise they do give you WAN IPV6. It was easy as setting the IPV6 of my proxy server as a AAA record on Cloudflare dashboard. Since Docker is little weird with IPv6 this was one reason to move to ProxMox.   Next issue was DHCP server. If i kept my secondary MI router as a router then the main router would not deligate IPV6 to my LAN on secondary router so I had no choice but to keep my secondary router on bridge mode. I even tried with installing OpenWrt on my secondary router but again I could not configure it to work with IPv6. due to frequent power cuts and restarts of the main router my lan IP would change and that completely messed up my reverse-proxy to my servers. This is where I am at currently, I have decided to keep all my services behind a private lan that runs behind openSense (it is also running in one of the proxmox vm). This way I am in control of the networking for my proxmox vms.    I used to manually install services with docker compose and use proxmox scripts. But I wanted to practice some DevOps so I deviced to go with Terraform for Infa, Ansible for Config management, GitTea for hosting and tracking, Jenkins for CICD. All I have to do is change some configs, push that to my git upstream and it will auto deploy on its own.|||You're not alone.I bought a dell wyze mini pc, i5 6th gen , 8gigs of ddr4 and measly 250gigs ssd. Used to run proxmox but running ubuntu server now. I have jellyfin running with smb and qbittorrent-nox, actual budgeting, matrix server with synapse which I use with schidli chat or element x, sometimes a minecraft server forwarded with play dot gg, tailscale and immich. Most of them run on docker.  I bought a cheap domain name from ovhcloud, where I used to run my vps before. Figured running your own server might be cheaper and my entire setup is like 20k. I also have a decent inverter with Solar setup for my office room. I have nginx proxy manager with ovh dns challenge so that I can use ssl and proper domain names. Since my router is limited I cannot access a lot of things outside network properly so I use tailscale with advertised subnets such that all my traffic goes through my server and I don't have to change my app settings when outside network. Planning on upgrading RAM and NVME slowly, with CCTV and some home monitoring in the future. And yes, please help me find a good ISP that allows router tweaking too.",

However, if your family can‚Äôt do without you contributing financially then may be taking the job is also a good start.  However, if your family can manage, join a course - not just for the degree but to really understand the field in depth that you choose; build a set of skill - in the real world your skill set is going to be more valuable than your degree.

Now I am planning to upgrade to Legion 5, and these two are on my radar. but reading Reddit posts, I have found that Legions are also facing motherboard issues, especially 13th and 14th gen i7 HXs. and am leaning towards Ryzen 7 7735HS, but it is said that Ryzen is far weaker compared to the i7.   The difference between these is screen size, resolution, processor, and SSD capacity.  Heard Ryzen is less prone to motherboard issues, but I have stumbled on some posts about Ryzen motherboard failures, too.  Looked into  Predator Neo 16, too, but I just don't trust them to be reliable, as I saw one brought in to be repaired within a week of purchase.     And I am confused whether to get Ryzen or i7. I don't want to claim warranty again, as it was a really bothersome and annoying process.     Are there any brands you recommend which has a nice track record? Or are there any issues you have faced with these laptops?  And which one do you recommend?     I plan on using my laptop for machine learning, video editing, and gaming, in that order.",

Good luck.   - Your Voter from Kathmandu 7    edit: (Please upvote this for more visibility)",

How they still haven't resigned as the party chief of their parties. All 3 of them.  It is one of the reasons why the democratic system hasn't worked well.  In working democracies, election and public mandate means something so they have to resign as party president/leader. Because they have the ultimate responsibility and accountability of the failure of the party.   For example after Prachanda lost the election (lost in the sense that he lost seats) 2nd time, if he was principled to the idea of democracy he should have resigned.  Because communism/maoism (his parties ideology) isn't limited to what Prachanda thinks. Party>Party leader, in working democracies.  And looking at all this, all the party members should be held liable (in a political sense) to what happened to the party and ultimately the country.   It's just a facade of democracy at this point. If they don't have a shame showing their faces to the public.|||The audacity of this evil to smile ü§¢ü§Æ|||arent they being taken to court??? mudda haleko haina oli lai? tesko lagi ta aunei parne ta ho court ma idk abt this dude|||Kina koi prosecute nabhako etro proof ta cha ta tinharle bhrastachar garekai ho bhanera|||xya yaar kasari yesto garna sakeko case garna mildaina yeslai?|||Aaye xa ta Randi feri|||Kasari xodne|||He shouldn't be in next election  Election system should be changed then  the new faces will be there  and at least we can expect development|||Yo muji neta haru bachey sab bacha and police marnu pryo|||Aaba yesli chai kasale kutxa sher bdr deuba jasto ??

So i don't have the desperation of people who have been videotaped.  A proper revolution would siege power within the night of 9th, and force the army to jail them politicians while everyone was afraid, that was the time, it was still fine on 10th but after that nothing was gonna happen, because the fear in everyone had started to decrease. Coups work on fears.  But alas, even if one of the 69420 groups had tried this, noone was united so the army would probably call the bluff anyway.  harka was probably more knowledgeable than the status queen you guys praise so much if we take that into consideration. If all of you mfs had rallied behind him, he could probably jail the politicians at 9th. He knew how power vacuums and fears work. He was actually building stuff instead of just destroying illegal construction. He came, he went to the army headquarters.  The more time it goes, the more will the power of 'GenZ' decrease. At this point, IDK if the discord server of hami nepal (sus funding like 'students for a free tibet', sorry our northern neighbor won't ignore even if you bury your head in the sand) can mobilize just as much people as the old parties, I have left the server. Probably not, so zoomers are less powerful than the combined power of parties. The equalizer is the army with guns, you loose their support and it's doomed.  You just let a power vacuum for the foreigners to take advantage of, to everyone whoever took part, you are brave, you have the balls, I respect you, fix this and you'll be loved through history, if foreigners fuck us up, be ready to take all the blame. I have a hard time believing the police administration that doesn't train at all can be so good at headshoting kids.  Call me Jholey as much as you want, I don't care, because to me you are no different from the Jholeys of old parties, I question your God and you try to mob me up in the comments. my family hasn't voted in about a decade, my family is less \"Jholey\" than majority of you, and the most corruption done by my family is getting some of the \"wasted\" writing papers of government colleges for free as a gift so that I can study.|||Honestly. This is crap. They should be rotting in jail.   Also to add, even if we don‚Äôt want a monarch to lead. A country with a monarch is stronger. Even if they don‚Äôt lead and have separate politics - like England. Imagine king mahendra or birendra right now. But no, they were removed so this corruption could take place.   Also another thought, why have all our kings had very very short lives. King birendra was only 55! And lineage behind him the same.   Also, the idea of people saying ‚Äúbaby king‚Äù to gyanendras grandson is bad! He isn‚Äôt baby king. The rightful heir is Girwani. Look at her side, away from media, working for under privileged Nepali haru. Idk man makes me sad.

After the failed 2035/36 then India plotted more and 2046 protest happened, king surrendered and gave power to the parties. These same Congress and UML failed miserably bc of their incompetent.

He just write on FB and then finish just one way communication. And there is RONB jasle chai khali Balen lai feature garcha and just show usko ramro part so it's that favouritism.

Also what happens if he wins election he managed? Would everyone trust he won fair election?   I think what did is best for him and country. If people choose him, he will be pm if not he wont. It‚Äôs simple.|||Disclaimer: I am not a Balen supporter or cultist.  This post is conflicting for me. But, the post is characterizing the man based on:  1. What the man didn‚Äôt do or didn‚Äôt say. 2. What people expected him to do.  The man himself has said enough in his posts.   It‚Äôs what, he DIDN‚ÄôT do that impresses me the most about him. Saying ‚ÄúNo‚Äù is harder than saying ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, when everyone wanted him to say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.  (Think about this.)  He put out only a couple of posts, which I think served as guide posts during the revolution.   1. He was the first widely known public figure (that I know) who defined who Gen Z was and gave his support to the protest. 2. When the tempo rose, he clarified that Gen Z should lead, he accepted Sushila even when all of his cultists were going crazy about making him the interim PM.  Removing himself from the picture, brought focus back on the revolution and the task ahead, rather than turn the confusion situation, even more confusing with a popularity contest as a side gig.   There is a lot of things to think about and I think in time we can all make sense of it all.   That‚Äôs my two paisa about him.|||Leading KTM municipality vs leading the nation are totally different. The followers of Balen urging and rushing him to lead 'right now' and come out by 2PM are the same people who will criticize him within one year if he were to be them PM someday. They don't have patience and want to see changes immediately.  Personally, I would like to see him running in the upcoming election as deputy/vice roles first and not immediate PM role...assuming how parties will be formed and if there are any good lead independent candidate who will run with him. He's one of those few worthy to be PM but this is not his peak yet. He just became a mayor like 3 years ago and he still has a lot to show to the general public. If and when he wins to the election, it will be his peak and he has high chances of being a two term PM...assuming two term limit will be in place hopefully. Time will tell.|||GenZ aren't immune to celeb worship culture.|||Hami Nepal has already stated it was part of a plan and they want balen for 5 years.

Yes it is definitely an opportunistic behaviour by balen. But how is this behaviour wrong and how is taking over PM position now and securing interim govt now and not taking part in politics for next 5 years do any good to the country.    He is practicing patience to achieve the goal he desires and what people actually wants from a young leader like him. Look throughout the history of world politics, paitence has always been the key factor to shape the world politics.|||Having trusted by many even me,In the moment of national threat, he could do nothing. That‚Äôs the reason I doubt him.  i think he is not completely responsible for being the Prime Minister. Sure, he is a great person. He‚Äôs doing such a great thing in the valley, but being a Prime Minister is very responsible post, his way up talking to seniors, saying I will put fire to SinghaDurbar, I will bury everyone if you‚Äôre in tudinkhel, getting carried away by emotions, being Prime Minister means you should not be carried away by any emotions and none of the factors should affect your judgment which you believe to be true and is lawful, Hopefully he will make such changes and we can finally see him in the top, as much as I want him to be the Prime Minister I do think he is inexperienced and immature in this field,|||We are so far behind that criticizing political leader sounds like a hater.

For the past decade, the corrupted 3 have been playing nothing but tato aloo with us so its natural to be sticking nail to current situation. Give it some time and our voices will get echoed.|||If there‚Äôs one thing old political leaders never learned, it was how to handle criticism. The moment anyone spoke up, they tried to shut it down and let‚Äôs not even start on the behavior of their hardcore supporters(jholey as we call them).  Even leaders like Balen need to address this with their own supporters, as do all the new representatives entering the upcoming elections. They must say publicly that they welcome criticism, will reflect on it, and use it as a tool for improvement. Leaders should make it clear to their base: don‚Äôt bully or silence people for simply asking questions or raising concerns. Do not perform character assassination against someone just for criticizing. After all, in a democracy, freedom of speech is our right.  At the same time, we the general public also carry responsibility. We need to recognize the difference between constructive criticism and defamation. What we must not do is fall for propaganda, spread rumors, or engage in baseless character assassination.  And if we realize that our criticism or questioning was wrong, we should have the courage to apologize in the same way we raised the question. After all, apologizing will never make you small. It‚Äôs just a simple five letter word: ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù A word that can and should be spoken from both sides.|||Just because you‚Äôre against the system, doesn‚Äôt make you Balen-Supporters. Balen has no experience. Balen should wait and gain some experience. Criticism is a backbone of democracy and one must welcome it.|||EXACTLY. They lack this ability to critically analyse any action of any leader. Like no one is perfect and no one is a good. Let's be honest. Let's criticize people for their actions. People should be held accountable for their actions. Most importantly, leaders who run our nation. If we don't point out their wrongdoings, will they ever stop? Nepalese have such a bheda mindset, istg. Let's be more aware and let's know how to discern leaders and their actions.   By criticizing these leaders, we aren't hating on them. We're trying to bring awareness so that they won't repeat the same thing again and can do things better for the country.|||They need to be aware party KO jhole become jhole because they were andabhakt of party leader ( just like they are blind follower of balen rn)|||Balen le andolan orchestrate gareko bhanera uslai arop cha dherai thau bata.

Even here in this sub, people have called me jhole lol just because I questioned him.  I am a Balen supporter. I supported him and did my part by sharing about his campaign on social media and making everyone aware about it. And I was super happy when he won, I still am. But I‚Äôve been criticizing him on various points that I find valid. The top one is communication.  During the election, he constantly criticized Bidya Sundar (the previous mayor) for not communicating publicly. He even said that once he became mayor, he wouldn‚Äôt be like that and would stay in constant touch. He proposed starting a ‚ÄòMayor with the Public‚Äô TV program and even set aside a budget for it, but nothing has happened. He hasn‚Äôt given a single interview.  And then come his jhole supporters who always argue with the same line: ‚ÄòPailai kei chaieko ho.‚Äô With that logic, we should never question anyone. Just look at how Balen has become now, he just posts one-sided, no-context Facebook statuses and nothing else.|||Balen is a hypocrite in my opinion, like he encouraged the protest and even promised to provide a safe and secure environment for the protest but when things turned south he vanished like horn from a donkeys head|||Finally someone spoke about this, belun has literally become a god complex among some people out there, which is kinda concerning, the only time he speaks is to not let his adhabhatka interfere in every other stuff out there.

Moreover, Sagar Dhakal‚Äôs brother has been working actively to eradicate the dictatorship of these political parties. Maybe your parents are bootlicking those rotten political parties, so you only see what Balen has never done and will never do.

One word from him has many consequences in such a movement. He is very clever and very wise; unlike Harka Sampang, though I like Harka as a person.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**¬†The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**¬†If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**¬†If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**¬†If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

This has been ongoing for more than two decades. Behind the few visible figures, there are countless others who have either assisted them or benefitted through their association‚Äîranging from major brands in Nepal to traders. For example, Sher Bahadur Deuba‚Äôs son and his sanitary pad importing company stand as an illustration.  They have institutionalized corruption by appointing foreign ambassadors based on party loyalty and financial gains, extending even to the transfer of bureaucrats to preferred locations in exchange for bribes and other undue benefits. The problem is not limited to the political system alone; bureaucrats, too, require checks and balances. A mechanism must be established to regulate the power of bureaucrats over politicians. Since bureaucrats are permanent stakeholders, their influence is even greater. One effective way to mitigate this is to appoint domain experts as ministers‚Äîfor instance, a professional civil engineer as a minister cannot be misled about the cost estimates of a construction project.  There remains much to be done. Moreover, these political parties will attempt to form alliances before elections, bringing forward the same candidates and restoring the same exploitative system. Therefore, the first and most meaningful reform must be a change in the electoral process, with the inclusion of a ‚ÄúNOTA‚Äù (None of the Above) option.  Further accountability can be ensured by eliminating political appointments to certain positions. At present, even temporary (karar) appointments are made based on party affiliation rather than merit. As a result, even highly qualified experts are compelled to seek political approval. The recent appointments of Vice-Chancellors at B.P. Koirala Institute in Dharan and Gangalal Hospital are prime examples.  In addition to these issues, several other structural flaws persist.

People watched her speech where she said stuff like, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?‚Äù  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still don‚Äôt have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we don‚Äôt have the right connections.  We don‚Äôt get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, it‚Äôs still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? That‚Äôs probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  We‚Äôre out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor people‚Äôs kids not boil?  On top of that, there‚Äôs already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent. Because this have  been suppressed for so long, and now the mindset is like ‚Äî ‚ÄúIf we can‚Äôt reach anywhere through the system, then we might as well destroy it.‚Äù  And even if some third party tries to trigger people, the truth is, it was already there deep down in their subconscious. This is just it coming out.

            "body": "Let me point out the things that happened in sequence  1. Sept 8 initially started as peaceful protest with no political agenda and it was going smooth until they decided to storm the parliament. 2. Majority of people on the parliament gate were jholey of prachanda i have few visual proof of people who were there linked to prachanda  3. The police decided to fire shots injuring many and killing 17 people which was intentional as well as, they wanted to trigger a mass violence in the country ( so basically the police was a part of the whole scheme as well ) 4. Nepali people are sentimental and we all had our blood boiling because of the killings on innocent kids and it broke a country wide massive violence which is exactly what they wanted ( prachanda and rabi) 5. Sept 9 hell broke loose on nepal we managed to overthrow the government but did you think why none of the maoist party politicians were attacked or where were they even hiding? Not a single clue meanwhile politicians of yemale and congress were specifically targeted ( not talking about houses burning but the politicians being dragged out)  I couldn‚Äôt care less about yemale or congress they can rot in hell but something big was being plotted from the beginning. 6. Notice how prachanda posted in support with gen z and has been silent and underground ever since? Not js him, the whole bunch of politicians of their party are gone 7.Why police were their puppets as well? Cause the police who injured hundreds and killed kids completely gave up on sept 9 they didn‚Äôt even try as if they wanted a nationwide violence. Fine  they didn‚Äôt come out to control the protest but did  they resign from their jobs that day ? NO ,so why was the prison not secured ? Cause their MAIN AGENDA WAS : TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE NATIONWIDE PROTEST AND FREE RABI FROM PRISON AND THE DOWNFALL OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT.  8. RABI has now come up with a letter that was issued for his release BUT if the letter was issued officially why wasn‚Äôt he the only person out of prison? Why free heinous criminals by destroying the prison? CAUSE IT DISTRACTED  THE PEOPLE from him . If you follow the timeline after he got out the prison news of other prisoner escaping from different jails came along .  9. The situation started getting worse after then , we GEN Z weren‚Äôt out till night but as you know people kept destroying things looting everything they found , who were they? They weren‚Äôt US they were JHOLEY of prachanda and rabi 10. Now rabi is acting like a messiah and people are buying it . He legit shook hands with people that we were protesting against , to get the grihamantri seat back then . HE AIN‚Äôt NO SAINT  11. How can a man who says he is devoted to a country enjoy their time being praised by his JHOLEY‚Äôs while such criminals escaped because of him? All i have to say is If he is genuine why not surrender yourself to the police and proceed legally cause the people jasle uslai allegedly fasako ho tni haru power ma chaina so it should be quite easy right? We all know his history with prachanda as well  lets not turn a blind eye to that . So in conclusion The GEN Z protest has been massively exploited by prachanda and rabi for their own cause . Obviously prachanda won‚Äôt be on the front lines this time but he is the one pulling the strings and Rabi is the one dancing and selling the act to people. WAKE UP LADS  FYI I don‚Äôt support any political party i was so happy at first seeing the government crumble but now i think we didn‚Äôt see the bigger picture being plotted .",

As a Tunisian, I don't want you to do the same mistakes we did on 2011, for context we too overthrew our corrupt government, we celebrated we sheered and it was a beautiful revolution led by the youth.  But,  We did not have a clear path moving forward, we allowed the revolution to be stolen with new corrupt faces, and now we are in a new stagnating period.  To keep this short, do not let your revolution be hijacked by opportunists, be smart, there will be hard times coming, support each other protect each other, don't fall for false promises and quick gains, countries will try to intervene with softpower, be careful from that, but also be pragmatic, not everything will work 100%, but never give up on your dreams.  And I wish you the best of luck.",

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**¬†The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**¬†If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**¬†If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**¬†If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Army should not interfere in internal problems|||‡§Ü‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡•Ä‡§≤‡•á ‡§ï‡§§‡§ø ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ó‡§∞‡•ç‡§õ‡§®‡•ç ‡§®‡§æ‡§ó‡§∞‡§ø‡§ï‡§≤‡§æ‡§à? ‡§ú‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ ‡•®/‡•® ‡§ù‡§æ‡§™‡§°, ‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§π‡•Ä ‡§†‡§æ‡§â‡§Å‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ã‡§≤‡§®‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§ñ‡§ü‡§ø‡§è‡§ï‡§æ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§≠‡§è ‡§¨‡•á‡§π‡•ã‡§∏ ‡§®‡§π‡•Å‡§®‡•ç‡§ú‡•á‡§≤ ‡§ï‡•Å‡§ü‡•ç‡§®‡•á ‡§•‡§ø‡§è ‡•§|||asti belai ma aayera yo radaban harlai yesari handeko bhaye singhadurbar jaldainathyo|||Obviously Nepal is not a democracy.

            "body": "I‚Äôm from Sri Lanka. I lived through our 2022 Aragalaya. People around the world respected us because we fought the system without destroying our own country.  At Galle Face, we protested for 124 days straight. Over 100,000 people joined at times. But here‚Äôs what made it different:  We camped peacefully on Galle Face Green. There were kitchens feeding thousands, medical centers to help anyone sick or injured, book libraries, free internet, and even coffee corners. We built a community, not chaos.  We sang songs, danced, made art, and watch movies ‚Äî yet we never destroyed property. Some critics complained we were ‚Äútoo playful,‚Äù but that didn‚Äôt stop us from being fair, disciplined, and organized.  When we finally entered the President‚Äôs House, we didn‚Äôt loot. Not a single priceless portrait worth millions was stolen. Not a single fire was set. People laughed, swam, sang ‚Äî but respected the place because it belonged to the people.  Even when ministers‚Äô thugs attacked us, the world saw who was violent and who wasn‚Äôt. That moral high ground is what gave us victory.   Now, I look at Nepal and I see motorbikes burned, parliament on fire, leaders‚Äô houses torched. Brothers, ask yourselves: is that really a fight for justice‚Äîor are you burning your own tax money, your own people‚Äôs livelihoods?  Because here‚Äôs the bitter truth:  The cost of every destroyed building, every burned vehicle, will come back to you in higher taxes, worse inflation, more suffering.  If you destroy what belongs to the people, the world will stop listening to your message and only see the flames.  Today you may cheer, but tomorrow you‚Äôll be paying for the very damage you caused.   Please think back. Don‚Äôt let your anger blind you. Sri Lanka proved you can bring down corrupt leaders without burning your country. Hold on to your moral strength. Don‚Äôt make your children pay for your rage.  From one struggling nation to another: don‚Äôt turn your fight for freedom into self-destruction.",

Kulman managed thousands of employee with great vision.|||In my opinion until the person is bharosemand and capable we should not go for age .|||Nepal currently lacks a functioning Prime Minister and only has an acting President, which makes the country politically fragile. Gen Z tried contacting Balen Shah but could not reach him, and Kul Man Ghising has agreed only to serve as an advisor. Former Chief Justice Sushila Karki has agreed to act as a representative if supported by the youth.    Under Nepal‚Äôs Constitution, elections must be held within six months if a stable government cannot be formed. This makes Karki a practical interim choice to uphold constitutional order and prepare the nation for new elections. Trusting her and maintaining peace will help ensure a smooth transition toward electing a desired President or Prime Minister in the coming months.|||She is the perfect candidate.

Their deep rooted ideology will prevail, which is useless.|||Interim government should urgently focus on rebuilding and restorations of not only infrastructures but the whole system. The books of laws should be mended and only a reliable person with extremely convincing profile should be able to do it.   As she has experience in political affairs and law, she is best to be used as an advisor in the team and maybe also for a temporary power. She knows the know-hows, dos and donts in the positions of power, rest of them are just crude and need more experience than just trust of people.   How we can structure the team for rebuiliding (Not the roles I want to assign them but something they are good at) : 1)Strategy:  Sushila Karki (transparent and healthy law reforms)  2) Management of resources and team work : Balen Shah (strict ways of management according to laws set)  3) Rebuilding infrastructures: Harka Sampang (known for his SHRAM DAAM, exactly what we need now)  4) Sagar Dhakal: A crude young politician, needs refinement: He must empower youths in rebuilding along with Harka Sampang (I haven't seen any achievements he has done till now, but couragious and influential enough for youths)   Best option for prime minister   if we go for experience: Sushila Karki  Together with Kulman and Balen for advisory. Harka and Mahabir for direct involvement in restorations. Sagar Dhakal flexible in advisory and reformation (But doubt due to links with RSP) .   And Rabi Lamichhane: Not tolerable in any government level. His image has fallen and we don't trust him. He needs to prove himself rather than just talk.

Make the president declare her lawful member of parliament through Proportionate Representation System, 3. Declare her the interim prime minister, 4. The president on her cabinet's recommendation dissolves the house of Representatives, 5. Her cabinet carries forward the corruption investigation and reconstruction. 6. The elections will be declared immediately. 7. The new parliament decides the constitutional amendments. (directly elected prime minister etc. and others ) 8. Then, the prime ministerial election happens. 9. She resigns as the interim prime minister. 10. New prime minister and the cabinet are sworn in. 11. The current president resigns. 12.

I am not exempt from any of the guilt either, I supported this movement and accept what transpired should have been avoided, no matter how difficult.

From what I understand, the protests were originally supposed to be peaceful but that all changed when the police shot non-violent protestors. At that point, the protestors wanted vengeance, and chaos ensued. No one thought the police would shoot at protestors, so the situation understandably turned chaotic.  I was rooting for the protestors and I felt so cathartic watching them:  - beat the shit out of deuba and his wife  - drag the finance minister out onto the streets in his underwear  - burn the politicians' houses and reveal stacks and stacks of money   But then things went too far when someone decided to:  - burn public government buildings (e.g. central bank, singha durbar, parliament, supreme Court). People complain that the politicians waste their tax money, and yet they go and destroy public buildings, which will take years (and taxpayers' money) to rebuild.  - burn hotels and resorts (e.g. Hilton). There were innocent people there including tourists.  - release criminals from prisons. This is the most egregious and low IQ move I've ever seen like what on earth were they thinking? Now there are armed criminals and opportunists roaming the streets, robbing banks and businesses.  - use discord chat to decide who the \"leader\" of the Gen Z protestors is lol. Discord. The glorified online chatroom where anyone can join and spam propaganda, and sow discord (pun not intended). I joined the server to see what they were doing and... It's exactly what I expected -- trolling, spamming, rage-baiting, everyone talking all at once but nobody listening, etc. What a mess. Why was there no moderation? Why weren't there bots that detected and prevented spam messages? People are deciding on an interim PM as if they're choosing the best answer on a multiple choice question on an exam lmao.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**¬†The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**¬†If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**¬†If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**¬†If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||What kind of bullshit post is this? Do you think revolution is easy?

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**¬†The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**¬†If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**¬†If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**¬†If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Put him back to jail¬†|||All members of Ghanti are Conspirators. All should be tried for treason and jailed.

But unfortunately for him, the public is educated. 100 years ago and this guy would have started the Sampang regime üòÇ|||Anyone who actively seeks power does so because they want to be seen and heard. That drive inevitably brings with it shades of narcissism and opportunism. So rather than fixating on intentions, it makes more sense to judge politicians by their results. On that front, Harka has proven he can deliver. His rough almost mobster-like style may be off-putting to some but in a city like Dharan which is home to hotheaded Kirati / Hill Janajati majority that kind of toughness isn‚Äôt just useful, it‚Äôs necessary.  That said, he is neither qualified nor capable enough to be considered an ‚Äòideal‚Äô Prime Minister. Nonetheless, when compared to Rabi Lamichhane Harka represents a comparatively more credible alternative. Personally not a fan of either.|||Tei ta Mayor ko pani layak xaina veda janta lai pm chaiyo re|||Dherai yo jaat ko haru furkirako cha muji haru K hi pachi k huncha kei tha chaina gu bhareko muji haru ko|||Guys Primeminister is not joke role.

If a person has done good work, both of them will be appreciated hands down. You have to look at the picture from both sides. Secondly, please ask your senior citizens or elders from a different generation. They have seen history and faced the consequences. The real issue is bringing change in the constitution, i.e., a representative should not be above a certain age and should be allowed to seek votes only for one term. Take that in writing from the concerned representative, live, and show it to the world clearly. Also, please do not discriminate by saying someone is from the ‚ÄúStone Age,‚Äù as such remarks can hurt the sentiments of people who are not from cities.|||Yes, I don't know what to.

But the constitution needs to be amended.|||I have been saying and posting about this since yesterday, there was perfectly constitutional way to handle this, sushila karki could have been made the incharge of a power anti-corruption body, and interim- PM could have been chosen from inside the parliament. There are others in the parliament outside of the 3 parties, why wasnt a single MP considered for this, the only mandate the PM would have is that of a holding an election. Why put shushila karki???just because some youtuber with a law degree suggested it and we had a discord poll was no reason to derail from the constitution. This cost of this derailment could be so heavy on us. Frankly speaking I think this happened because Balen didn't want it to happen. He feared and didn't take the leadership because if he can't deliver, his popularity will nose dive, and he feared if a sitting MP even outside of the 3 party were elected interim PM the very fact that they saved this train-wreck of a nation would mean that that interim PMs popularity would rise and would seriously challenge his chances in the next election. Thus what to do???? Elect an old ex judge , she  wouldn't be a challenge to the messiah BALEN in the next election. Who cares about the constitution. Fuck the constitution.|||It is Jover.

Do you think Kathmandu would benefit from a hacker house? 2. What features would matter most (workspace, internet, events, mentorship, hardware lab, etc.)? 3.

Gen z never planned to burn or destroy public property and jails. I believe this happened due to the presence of other opportunistic groups.

Because of this, even their own people are now suffering from security issues like the release of 1200 prisoners due to prison breaks.

            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada‚Äôs classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.¬†  We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking‚Äìmuch to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in¬† Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate -¬†the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala‚Äôs approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.¬†  Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn‚Äôt mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‚Äòhelp‚Äô. One time, she even said airily, ‚ÄúI wash my own dishes, you know.‚Äù She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala‚Äìa beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth‚Äìlingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don‚Äôt intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‚Äònepo babies‚Äô who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).¬†  Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It‚Äôs a troubling idea to think that despite what‚Äôs happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

She was funded by her corrupt father.||| Damn I strictly feel its true|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn‚Äôt some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake ‚Äúbeauty with brains‚Äù narrative. Do you guys remember Niti‚Äôs big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let‚Äôs not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala‚Äôs prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it‚Äôs her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let‚Äôs be real- Sisan wasn‚Äôt perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they‚Äôd known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn‚Äôt even exist. This just proves it- they weren‚Äôt just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can‚Äôt just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala‚Äôs career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav‚Äôs narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What‚Äôs the lesson we can learn from here ?

Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don‚Äôt even make sense to begin with. Don‚Äôt know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don‚Äôt even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It‚Äôs so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It‚Äôs astounding what the world has come to and it‚Äôs deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can‚Äôt be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn‚Äôt she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It‚Äôs better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has.

Its not easy to get in there and even if you do its one of the expensive schools there. Talking about her Nepal bachelor‚Äôs days, my friends studied with her in KU in nepal in b. arch, and so many said she cheated on exams (A LOT) just to pass. later she worked for the nepal government and came to US for conferences and presentations ü§°. now she has started her master‚Äôs at UT austin, funded by corrupted money. she removed her instagram posts about her prior foreign visits and her recent UT Austin orientation day, and even deactivated her linkedin account.  Now she‚Äôs posting on instagram and facebook, after the new PM was appointed, congratulating her and thanking the president grand dad for this revolution. it‚Äôs crazy how these unethical people still have the audacity to do all this.  (Source: from college friends and family members, and as those of us who are directly impacted by this revolution in nepal, we are not going to stay quiet against corruption and the unethical hypocrisy going on for a long time)|||Everyone hates power till you offer some|||What was her gpa?|||So many politicians sold country for MBBS and BDS seats for their children. Example Ram chandra poudel's daughter  Madhav nepal daughter  Sharad singh Bhandari arranging BDS seats for his brother daughter.. These are few examples and seats goes on.  These are things we are fighting for.|||I trust every words you said.I felt this to my gut when you shared about the teamwork thing and how she treated her peers more like servant and less like an actual teammate. These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!! And the way she's silent when the country is bleeding says alottt too!!!!!!  And about the Nepal's government scholarship for harvard,this is not true, she is telling an entire different story about harvard scholarsip & how she paid fees there. She said she got 30% scholarship at harvard and the remaining 70% is paid through her brand endorsements money as she is brand ambassador to few company. We didnt buy that story, she tried hardest to sell it though and still fools people with this shitty madeup script about harvard's 30% scholarship & 70% funding through brand endorsement's money lmao. And lately she's being questioned on 50,000USD she got during miss world competition after winning \"beauty with the purpose\" title. Her ex exposed & questioned her in a very shady way and because of him we all knew this new layer of truth and i highly doubt it went on harvard's funding rather than for actual purpose|||https://youtu.be/XcEC2q4CotY  Sastu Mutu is a song made for her.|||But guys, the 50000 dollars which apparently Shrinkhala and Anuska got, why didnt we know about it earlier?

Even if they have the intention and will to do so (like many of us want), they do not know how to run a country. I see them as ineffective in running even a municipality (maybe that was because of politics and in-cooperation from party elected ward heads). The thing is they have a lot more to learn and they will, with time.       This situation would not have happened if there were transfer of power to youth in timely manner. Now the rising youth leaders do not have experience because these corrupt politicians did not allow that.      What we need is a system where corruption should now be absolutely dreaded, seeing how corrupt politicians had to run away for thier life. They have to realize that people will not just punish the corrupt polticians, they will also punish whoever was responsible to prevent that.       There now needs to be a collaborative development with young leaders like Balen and experienced people like Sushila.

I truly want Sushila Karki to be prime minister, but according to our constitution it's not possible. And if we ditch our constitution our country is open for invasion from other countries. So, what's the best option it's BALEN. I know that he won't be able to run for prime minister for the next election but it is a risk we have to take. It's already proven that our protest was the result of different politicians 'parties'involvement. So, let's play it safe and try to choose the best result for us. Already many Indian politicians are saying that they are ready to deploy an army if needed. It's not goodwill but an invasion. So it's best we know what we do for the country.  But if it's possible for her to be prime minister without disturbing our constitution then I'm all for it. I also want a good leader who will work for the development of the country.   Indian is already eyeing the district like Lipilekh and Limpadhura. If we take too long to make a responsible decision, they are favourites to win the case.   The country is already in chaos. So we must do our best to calm it down. We protested against corruption and got unexpected results. We are not ready for it. And we don't have time to think about it and make a decision. But, we must make a decision and make it work, isn't it all there is to it ?    It's not that I don't support \"Sushila Karki\" . She has my full support. But if it is disturbing our core rules set by our constitution. I just thought it isn't right. So it's my request all my fellow citizens ( not just gen-z ) to make a right decision.   But my final warning is that if we defy our current constitution ourselves. It will not be a suprise other countries take advantage of it. So we shall make a decision ourselves and take the best route possible. But you've my support to make her ( Sushila Karki) intrim prime minister. It is the best result seeing her experience on political field.   It might have been a bit long for the attention span of gen-z but i just want to say that, neither the constitution nor the national rules be any shorter üòä.

Personally I have next to no clue who Sumana is, and normally I'd think that makes her a good candidate because there's nothing but positive vibes so far. I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both.

She is the one who has been abroad for so long and has so many foreign connections and relations that even if she  doesn't want interference, there will be far more foreign interference with her as a leader.  We can not deny that .   3. Sumana did absolutely nothing as a health minister apart from stunts. Ministers are supposed to amend laws and execute them. could have done so much more .   4.

BTW, Gen Z doesn‚Äôt just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didn‚Äôt exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who weren‚Äôt even present for the protests claim we don‚Äôt know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldn‚Äôt even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, ‚ÄòWe have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server you‚Äôre all listening to is just for public discussion‚Äô. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal. Now that it‚Äôs been confirmed everywhere and with Balen posting that the Gen Z‚Äôs choice former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Sushila Karki is the right choice for interim prime minister of Nepal, we look forward to what comes next.|||https://new-nepal-voting.vercel.app/  Vote here or suggest names I can add|||For interim formation CJ Sushila Karki would be the perfect choice.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Why not sagar Dhakal?|||Yesss|||Just promote it in your social media handle|||K bhairacha yarr discord ma pm choose bhairacha|||Ahile non political manxe thik huncha...her or Dr ‡§∏‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Å‡§ï Ruit.

If all the cabinet ministers are in army barrack then why the meeting is being conducted inside the barrack?  3. Why is there delay in dissolving parliament?  4. There is no common voice among Gen Z. It is starting to already fracture into different sub groups.   5. Sudden rise in anti- Gen Z sentiment in various online platform.  Democracy is your hands guys, protect it at any cost. Be organized and move forward cautiously.|||is it just me or lipsync seems a little off?|||Jatha deuba yawn handai xa|||![gif](giphy|1lk1IcVgqPLkA)|||what‚Äôs happening|||Jasley k vaney ni, kata kata paxi regret hunxa jasto lagirako xa man ma|||Boost|||[deleted]|||Damn mad respect.|||Boost|||boost|||But people are saying she is India‚Äôs puppet!

Yet, instead of standing with him, Gen Z is choosing Sushila Karki, who has no political stability or proven leadership of her own.  This is shameful. If we really want change, why sideline someone like Rabi who has shown courage, and hand the interim government to someone with no accountability in politics?  As for Balen, the question about why he isn‚Äôt responding is simple: if he responds, the interim government would have to be formed by him right now, as most support him. But he doesn‚Äôt want to take the interim role because he plans to get elected in six months‚Äô official government elections.

They will play big roles in the coming days|||I believe Sagar Dhakal has the vision, insight, and capability to truly serve the nation.  But too often, we mistake leadership for fame. In this election, let‚Äôs make one thing clear: we‚Äôre not choosing a celebrity , we‚Äôre choosing a public servant. We put politicians on pedestals, treat them like idols, and forget they‚Äôre meant to serve the people, not bask in admiration. That kind of blind loyalty is dangerous. It inflates egos, distorts priorities, and shifts the focus from the country to the individual.  Real leadership isn‚Äôt about charisma, party labels, or personality cults. It‚Äôs about what leaders actually do and how they strengthen communities, protect rights, and build a better future. That‚Äôs the standard that matters.  Holding leaders accountable isn‚Äôt disloyal; it‚Äôs democracy. We should celebrate when they get it right, and we should challenge them when they don‚Äôt.  That means asking harder questions, doing our own research, and refusing to follow blindly. Every leader should be held to the same measure: What are you doing for the people, and what are you building for the future?  The power has never rested with them alone. It rests with us, and it always will.|||Finally someone said it . Yes please he should stand in six months and win|||Sagar actually knows what he is going to do . I am gonna be his jholey for coming election.|||Well I do believe that now whoever comes in power knows the consequences if they do something for their personal gain .But it's not a easy task to develop a nation.All the citizens should work for it too.This generation has more sacrifices to make for the upcoming generations to have a better future.|||Hope he becomes the \"Oxford ma padheko PM\" that he dreamed.|||He makes a great point. It is time to take this opportunity and ensure no other nepali have to get back to the street  just to demand a fair county. I wish Sagar all the best.

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen.

One for the 165 candidates who are elected directly (first-past-the-post), other for the party. The votes that party gets determine the remaining 110 members via proportional representation.  so aba either we need new political parties to replace the existing ones by Falgun 21, or we have to vote for the same parties again. This is more complicated because Nepal is not just Kathmandu. The political players which we have termed jholey will be active outside Kathmandu.   So if we need the change in constitution, we have to be more careful. The mandates of the movement are more at risk now than before.",

Anyone who can obtain vote of confidence  Now here is the point, everyone but Prachand has resigned and the party who has most seat in the parliament is Moist and before dissolving the parliament he will become the Prime Minister if president is dissolving the parliament.

If it was against corruption then the protest should have stopped after government stepping down. But what happened after that - people are destroying and burning their country‚Äôs asset, their parliament, airports and banks etc - this is not the way it should have gone down if this was about corruption only.

That doesn‚Äôt mean he is wrong always but sometimes yes! It is not just Indian media it is international media but most of them are correcting themselves now which is good. Although his comments are still wrong in many ways. Social media ban was a ignition for this protest because corruption is going on from a longtime. But people should think what‚Äôs next? Youth leaders are going to step up and take positions to govern? Do they have that kind of unity? And do you think don‚Äôt they turn into corrupt due to powers? Great initiative by youth but think about what‚Äôs next¬†|||All of us Indians know this. What are you saying?|||I don't know what are you talking about. Most coverage of Indian media is overtly positive.   This is because our love towards Nepal is same as our hate towards that Chinese puppet Oli.   If you see any doubt in our media or people, it is because we have a slight doubt if CIA or ISI will start using Nepal as a ground to disturb India.   Nepal can be a smaller country, but they are much more older nation state than us with full of brilliant souls and whatever Nepalis choose for their country, we respect that from core.  But never think this Rathee fellow has any love towards you guys. He's just putting gun over your shoulder to attack India. He is not even an Indian citizen.

I doubt anyone here believes that our Nepali brothers were protesting to assert their right to doomscroll.  People don't go to extremes in protesting against social media.  And govts don't ban all social media apps, just because the companies didn't \"register with them\". they do it, because they see the narrative has gone against them, and they desperately want to gain back the control.|||This guy ain‚Äôt even an Indian citizen|||[https://youtu.be/CXEMBDjnoWU?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/CXEMBDjnoWU?feature=shared) watch this|||This guy has some personal beef with modi and his party .

Even we don't entertain them. Each passing day their credibility is decreasing in India. 3. Dhruv rathi is also shit. Even his credibility is decreasing each passing day. One hypocrisy at a time. 4. From the bottom of our hearts we hope things calm down there and change for the better for the people of Nepal. I am sure if Nepal wants, the govt in India would love to help however possible (No strings attached) not unlike the hand we gave to srilanka in their time of need Because we understand what it is like to go through a state of political unrest.

You don't need any validation from germany ka kukkur.|||Guys, I assume everyone here has someone in their family with some political ties. I too have. But that doesn't mean I have direct ties with them. JHOLEY and BHEDA is a noun that defines people who blindly believe in a person or a political party.      Talking about myself, I am already 36, a father and I am thinking of raising my family here in Nepal. I was totally against going abroad as a student when there was trend to do so. But the political system was never stable here. However, This current GenZ revolution happened against corruption. We indeed got a good progress against these corrupt leaders. But things turned out to be different and here is my roller coaster of emotions. Please let me know if you can relate to this.  Day 0: Social Media Ban - Mixed feelings. Hopeful that social medias will proceed further with registration.  Day 1: GenZ revolution and killing - Lots of anger. Disappointment and discontent.  Day 2: Revolution, excited and happy till 4 PM, until we destroyed the party system. Once the public started destroying Singha Durbar, I came to realize what I had done. I started a fire that I can't extinguish.  Day 3: Realization of the revolution being hijacked. We were just against corruption, regime change was not our motto. The revolution gradually turned into a COLOR REVOLUTION.  Day 4: Worried about who will lead the country. Started mentally supporting Balen/Rabi or any young leader. Furious, since the army asked GenZ to come up with a leader. Finally Hami Nepal, some guys funded by Deep state along with Sanduk Ruit and Swarnim Wagle came into light. They started talking about regime change and Constitution change. They said they directly want to select Zelensky as their prime minister.   Day 5: Much more disappointed as some kids who are aiming to go abroad for future study is electing prime minister through Discord. Sushila Karki elected as PM. Which is some sort of relief. I feared a autocrat.  Day 6 - Day 7: China is yet to acknowledge PM Sushila Karki. China is suspecting foul play as KP Oli had been to SCO and all of this happened just after that.      Now I am very much in distress. I feel that, Nepal is Ukraine. Balen is the new Zelensky and China is the new Russia. I dont want to think negatively but the situation ahead seems to be very dark and we will have to take steps cautiously. There are a lot of hatred here and Social medias are fueling it. None of the GenZ were born during the writing of the constitution. There were lots of revolution that was endured by current revolution Maoist Revolution, Madesh Revolution etc. But now it seems everything has gone to waste and there is no constitution here in the country. Is this PTSD?|||Nepal, you are dealing with dangerous, insecure, violent crybullies who don't care about reasons and motives because they'll just come up with fake news and use that is their motive.

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4. Retirement age and term limits: This is a must, we need a clear retirement age for the public positions just like other jobs.     These sort of things are fundamental of any country, without getting the fundamentals right we cannot expect our country to do better. We have a chance to make things better, lets take this chance.|||also i think! what lessons can be learned from Bangladesh last year?|||Garni nai ho vani presidency system lyauni.

Just wanted to express supreme respect to you from Ukraine.   You're really cool!   We had protests in 2014.   We made lot of mistakes after succeded in throwing down Yanukovich in 2014.

Now we get kidnapping peoples on streets by police and conscripted forcely to war or you can get out for $10k until kidnapped next time.

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

We're basically a puppet state without the benefits.|||bjp it cell moment|||You‚Äôre proving why your country ranks lowest in IQ whole world is watching your country is in global news and people are only curious about the chaos there That‚Äôs the only reason you‚Äôre getting any attention|||No wonder, thats why r/Nepal started to stink|||Yes, it may be design from there.

AKA the daughter of a corrupt leader, the Chief Development Officer of Kathmandu, Nepal, Chhabi Rijal, who ordered gunfire in a peaceful protest that took place in Nepal on the 8th of September. The protest that took place against a corrupt government resulted in the loss of 20 individuals, some of whom were minors present in school uniforms, and hundreds were injured.   This is what we got for speaking against a government that has leeched off of taxpayers' money. We request an immediate dismissal of Sweta Rijal's candidacy at your esteemed institution. We, as Nepali people, condemn the actions of her immediate family and believe that her degree, funded by her very disliked father, will be of NO USE to our country. Hope you take the necessary action.   Thank you.|||ma US ma baschhu, bhete bhane yei jiudai gaddinchu myajhyakne lai!|||If someone accidentally unalives this cdo, I'll personally donate 2 lakh npr for legal support.

A shift to a fully directly elected system for every seat would ensure greater accountability and public representation. 2. **Establish a Directly Elected Executive Head:**¬†Instead of the parliament choosing the Prime Minister, the call is for a directly elected President or Prime Minister with full executive powers. This would provide a stable government for a fixed term, preventing the \"share-the-power\" politics that have led to instability.|||Also follow what's in constitution, according to constitution of Nepal, people outside of Nepal should be able to vote through embassy, but in reality we can't.|||No regegnation, country out|||So y'all are asking for resignation after kids dead in their school uniform.

It‚Äôs tragic, because they also have families back home and face the same struggles as the rest of us. They should be victims of this system too, yet they show little compassion or critical thought about what‚Äôs happening around them. Why are there protests in the first place? I refuse to believe they're blind to people's frustration and the direction the country is heading.  I still remember when we joined a protest 14‚Äì15 years ago. The police confronted us aggressively, and as kids we were too confused to react. Fortunately, we just stood there processing and visibly confused, and they left ‚Äî but I still shudder to think, *what if our reaction had been different?* Today‚Äôs young protestors are in the same position, pure in their intentions, simply voicing frustration without wanting harm.  And honestly, credit must go to these protestors. They know exactly what they are standing for, unlike us back then who needed adults to organise us. I don‚Äôt see how demonstrations could be any more peaceful than they already are ‚Äî especially when the very leaders being protested against have blood on their hands from before this generation was even born.|||Yo bhatey haru kahi gayera sitcha holani|||randi baan machikne haru|||I mean this tracks, they only like when you're corrupt|||Its not andolan anymore its war|||We want death or at lease exile of KP Oli and other taukes.|||Randi haruko photo, name, address patta lagau.|||khate haru mug haru padne bela ma padenan aile mug ko mug ko chak sugera manche lai dukha dinxan. timi mug haru le esto dukha dekhnu paros jatha haru. maa gali pani dina sakdina timi haru ko aama ko galti haina timi haru jasta janmie. aama lai k thaaa. tara kailei bhalo nahos timi haru jasta ko. timi haru marna pani na paos bachna pani na paos.|||shamelss dogs of government|||Machikne radi harlai lakhetdai marnaparne|||Thuiyaa police vanauda haruuu|||you radiko ban harulai agolauno man xa|||ma sanga pani ganhune bhaye, kassam mardinthe radieekko ban|||Mathi bata aako order re ????

Natra garo xa.|||The wise people doubt, the foolish are always certain.|||Generations don't matter, bheda janata is always bheda janata|||Balen will be the greatest political heartbreak for an average Nepali.|||Nepali education never taught critical thinking. Most people don't know the perspectives of one event and they believe only what is potrayed.  Being influenced by balen this much is dangerous for the democracy if these people do not understand what blind support can create. I think balen doesn't belong to that category so we are not screwed till now but we may never know.|||Say it louder for the people in the back!   Balen wasn't there when the movement needed him the most.|||Balen is narendra modi of nepal|||Ok, I don‚Äôt follow Balens politics a lot but if he had said he wants to be interim PM, would you have not criticized he was being opportunist?  Also what happens if he wins election he managed? Would everyone trust he won fair election?   I think what did is best for him and country. If people choose him, he will be pm if not he wont. It‚Äôs simple.|||Disclaimer: I am not a Balen supporter or cultist.  This post is conflicting for me. But, the post is characterizing the man based on:  1. What the man didn‚Äôt do or didn‚Äôt say. 2. What people expected him to do.  The man himself has said enough in his posts.   It‚Äôs what, he DIDN‚ÄôT do that impresses me the most about him. Saying ‚ÄúNo‚Äù is harder than saying ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, when everyone wanted him to say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.  (Think about this.)  He put out only a couple of posts, which I think served as guide posts during the revolution.   1. He was the first widely known public figure (that I know) who defined who Gen Z was and gave his support to the protest. 2. When the tempo rose, he clarified that Gen Z should lead, he accepted Sushila even when all of his cultists were going crazy about making him the interim PM.  Removing himself from the picture, brought focus back on the revolution and the task ahead, rather than turn the confusion situation, even more confusing with a popularity contest as a side gig.   There is a lot of things to think about and I think in time we can all make sense of it all.   That‚Äôs my two paisa about him.|||Leading KTM municipality vs leading the nation are totally different. The followers of Balen urging and rushing him to lead 'right now' and come out by 2PM are the same people who will criticize him within one year if he were to be them PM someday. They don't have patience and want to see changes immediately.  Personally, I would like to see him running in the upcoming election as deputy/vice roles first and not immediate PM role...assuming how parties will be formed and if there are any good lead independent candidate who will run with him. He's one of those few worthy to be PM but this is not his peak yet. He just became a mayor like 3 years ago and he still has a lot to show to the general public. If and when he wins to the election, it will be his peak and he has high chances of being a two term PM...assuming two term limit will be in place hopefully. Time will tell.|||GenZ aren't immune to celeb worship culture.|||Hami Nepal has already stated it was part of a plan and they want balen for 5 years. So did they fight for the nation or for the balen is the real question? Why are they biased for balen only and not for other groups of good people?|||About your 2nd picture.  Yes it is definitely an opportunistic behaviour by balen. But how is this behaviour wrong and how is taking over PM position now and securing interim govt now and not taking part in politics for next 5 years do any good to the country.    He is practicing patience to achieve the goal he desires and what people actually wants from a young leader like him. Look throughout the history of world politics, paitence has always been the key factor to shape the world politics.|||Having trusted by many even me,In the moment of national threat, he could do nothing. That‚Äôs the reason I doubt him.  i think he is not completely responsible for being the Prime Minister. Sure, he is a great person. He‚Äôs doing such a great thing in the valley, but being a Prime Minister is very responsible post, his way up talking to seniors, saying I will put fire to SinghaDurbar, I will bury everyone if you‚Äôre in tudinkhel, getting carried away by emotions, being Prime Minister means you should not be carried away by any emotions and none of the factors should affect your judgment which you believe to be true and is lawful, Hopefully he will make such changes and we can finally see him in the top, as much as I want him to be the Prime Minister I do think he is inexperienced and immature in this field,|||We are so far behind that criticizing political leader sounds like a hater. We are not even to the point where we could say ‚ÄúThis person is bad/clueless , country isn‚Äôt safe with them‚Äù. For the past decade, the corrupted 3 have been playing nothing but tato aloo with us so its natural to be sticking nail to current situation. Give it some time and our voices will get echoed.|||If there‚Äôs one thing old political leaders never learned, it was how to handle criticism. The moment anyone spoke up, they tried to shut it down and let‚Äôs not even start on the behavior of their hardcore supporters(jholey as we call them).  Even leaders like Balen need to address this with their own supporters, as do all the new representatives entering the upcoming elections. They must say publicly that they welcome criticism, will reflect on it, and use it as a tool for improvement. Leaders should make it clear to their base: don‚Äôt bully or silence people for simply asking questions or raising concerns. Do not perform character assassination against someone just for criticizing. After all, in a democracy, freedom of speech is our right.  At the same time, we the general public also carry responsibility. We need to recognize the difference between constructive criticism and defamation. What we must not do is fall for propaganda, spread rumors, or engage in baseless character assassination.  And if we realize that our criticism or questioning was wrong, we should have the courage to apologize in the same way we raised the question. After all, apologizing will never make you small. It‚Äôs just a simple five letter word: ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù A word that can and should be spoken from both sides.|||Just because you‚Äôre against the system, doesn‚Äôt make you Balen-Supporters. Balen has no experience. Balen should wait and gain some experience. Criticism is a backbone of democracy and one must welcome it.|||EXACTLY. They lack this ability to critically analyse any action of any leader. Like no one is perfect and no one is a good. Let's be honest. Let's criticize people for their actions. People should be held accountable for their actions. Most importantly, leaders who run our nation. If we don't point out their wrongdoings, will they ever stop? Nepalese have such a bheda mindset, istg. Let's be more aware and let's know how to discern leaders and their actions.   By criticizing these leaders, we aren't hating on them. We're trying to bring awareness so that they won't repeat the same thing again and can do things better for the country.|||They need to be aware party KO jhole become jhole because they were andabhakt of party leader ( just like they are blind follower of balen rn)|||Balen le andolan orchestrate gareko bhanera uslai arop cha dherai thau bata.

I see people thanking Balen for this movement and saying he was the reason this movement happened and succeeded and all after Sushila Karki became interim PM, and this made me very sad for actual people who started the movement and also faced the consequences and this was even more big realization for me for how blind youth and supporters these days are and this concerns me even more for future|||Tbh he‚Äôs not fitted for PM cause look at him he have no quality of a good leader specially thinking about diplomacy, even small things makes him anguish ani overconfident cause our country is small ani not teti powerful pani people need to fact check yetikai hype ma balen balen vnnerw huni kei hunnw , a single person cant change country ko face nai, a leader should be someone who equally can tackle every obstacle in a subtle way yetikai sano kura ma ni raged huni country lai ni risk ma leraunxa kya , i am not saying he‚Äôs not a good leader he indeed is terw just not fitted for PM.

This is what I‚Äôve been saying for some time. Like the post says, I‚Äôve also been labeled as a party ko jhole and what not. Even here in this sub, people have called me jhole lol just because I questioned him.  I am a Balen supporter. I supported him and did my part by sharing about his campaign on social media and making everyone aware about it. And I was super happy when he won, I still am. But I‚Äôve been criticizing him on various points that I find valid. The top one is communication.  During the election, he constantly criticized Bidya Sundar (the previous mayor) for not communicating publicly. He even said that once he became mayor, he wouldn‚Äôt be like that and would stay in constant touch. He proposed starting a ‚ÄòMayor with the Public‚Äô TV program and even set aside a budget for it, but nothing has happened. He hasn‚Äôt given a single interview.  And then come his jhole supporters who always argue with the same line: ‚ÄòPailai kei chaieko ho.‚Äô With that logic, we should never question anyone. Just look at how Balen has become now, he just posts one-sided, no-context Facebook statuses and nothing else.|||Balen is a hypocrite in my opinion, like he encouraged the protest and even promised to provide a safe and secure environment for the protest but when things turned south he vanished like horn from a donkeys head|||Finally someone spoke about this, belun has literally become a god complex among some people out there, which is kinda concerning, the only time he speaks is to not let his adhabhatka interfere in every other stuff out there.

He is still better than most of the people there. Whatever he does, he has never done anything wrong. Stop pretending to be so-called critics for useless reasons.

Moreover, Sagar Dhakal‚Äôs brother has been working actively to eradicate the dictatorship of these political parties. Maybe your parents are bootlicking those rotten political parties, so you only see what Balen has never done and will never do. Just because he supported the movement does not mean he said he wants to become prime minister. You must understand that he posts only a few things because his words are weapons. One word from him has many consequences in such a movement. He is very clever and very wise; unlike Harka Sampang, though I like Harka as a person.

It runs on power. Until you understand this, you‚Äôll not understand the situation. And those who understand this controls the narrative. Our country is so at the bottom of the barrel, we don‚Äôt need much of foreign resources to be infiltrated, mind-bended. Sudan stance, I don‚Äôt know his clear motives of against or with the country. But I‚Äôm sure even he does not know he‚Äôs a small puppet planted/invested long ago. Usually foreign powers will not directly direct its agenda, especially for the country at the bottom of the barrel they do not have the time to do so. You just give them small aid, support for us, for them simple investment, which they just got good return this time, especially now east is rising its economy. You just need to nudge them, give them support they will do their good vs evil thing which any human will do. Think about it, nobody was going forward with stance like him to take on some kind of leader role, because we do not have that power (support) and as human we fear unknown.  You might think I‚Äôm thinking too much of this. Well, I can‚Äôt argue you, because I do not know for sure, but this is my stance and most probable thing I saw.",

Your country has been too kind to me whenever I visit.

Never bothered to give up to the boiling pace of life.   What the Genz achieved is a lesson to the whole world. An outstanding solidarity display. The revolution as your history will always call it has got its results. I know all is not done you need reforms you need an accountable government. But ask yourself aren't you going overboard now? Literally the whole government has given in and the most possible situation is the army going to take over. Please keep the situation such that the army or any other entity doesn't get the excuse to deny people of their right to rule themselves. This is not  new,  when a revolution with a purpose overshoots give the power mongerers an opportunity to come forward and exploit that. A mob when acting like this is too dangerous.

Also Nepalese Army IS asking somebody to represent the Gen-Z activists. So yeah, they are pretty much in front of it. I am wondering what they will ask from the new government. I am worried it will be about going abroad. To study and not care about the situation at the moment. I hope we get swift government who can clear corruption and restore some order.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**¬†The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**¬†If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**¬†If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**¬†If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

This has been ongoing for more than two decades. Behind the few visible figures, there are countless others who have either assisted them or benefitted through their association‚Äîranging from major brands in Nepal to traders. For example, Sher Bahadur Deuba‚Äôs son and his sanitary pad importing company stand as an illustration.  They have institutionalized corruption by appointing foreign ambassadors based on party loyalty and financial gains, extending even to the transfer of bureaucrats to preferred locations in exchange for bribes and other undue benefits. The problem is not limited to the political system alone; bureaucrats, too, require checks and balances. A mechanism must be established to regulate the power of bureaucrats over politicians. Since bureaucrats are permanent stakeholders, their influence is even greater. One effective way to mitigate this is to appoint domain experts as ministers‚Äîfor instance, a professional civil engineer as a minister cannot be misled about the cost estimates of a construction project.  There remains much to be done. Moreover, these political parties will attempt to form alliances before elections, bringing forward the same candidates and restoring the same exploitative system. Therefore, the first and most meaningful reform must be a change in the electoral process, with the inclusion of a ‚ÄúNOTA‚Äù (None of the Above) option.  Further accountability can be ensured by eliminating political appointments to certain positions. At present, even temporary (karar) appointments are made based on party affiliation rather than merit. As a result, even highly qualified experts are compelled to seek political approval. The recent appointments of Vice-Chancellors at B.P. Koirala Institute in Dharan and Gangalal Hospital are prime examples.  In addition to these issues, several other structural flaws persist.

People watched her speech where she said stuff like, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?‚Äù  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still don‚Äôt have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we don‚Äôt have the right connections.  We don‚Äôt get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, it‚Äôs still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? That‚Äôs probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  We‚Äôre out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor people‚Äôs kids not boil?  On top of that, there‚Äôs already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent.

That drive inevitably brings with it shades of narcissism and opportunism. So rather than fixating on intentions, it makes more sense to judge politicians by their results. On that front, Harka has proven he can deliver. His rough almost mobster-like style may be off-putting to some but in a city like Dharan which is home to hotheaded Kirati / Hill Janajati majority that kind of toughness isn‚Äôt just useful, it‚Äôs necessary.  That said, he is neither qualified nor capable enough to be considered an ‚Äòideal‚Äô Prime Minister.

Secondly, please ask your senior citizens or elders from a different generation. They have seen history and faced the consequences. The real issue is bringing change in the constitution, i.e., a representative should not be above a certain age and should be allowed to seek votes only for one term. Take that in writing from the concerned representative, live, and show it to the world clearly. Also, please do not discriminate by saying someone is from the ‚ÄúStone Age,‚Äù as such remarks can hurt the sentiments of people who are not from cities.|||Yes, I don't know what to.

            "body": "What comes next? The only reason Nepal isn't going through a complete currency de-valuation and a bank run is because of the rupee peg. We need to tread water carefully. (**Bank run**¬†is a situation where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a bank simultaneously, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or financial stability. This can lead to liquidity problems for the bank, as it may not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands. Bank runs can create a cycle of panic, potentially leading to the bank's failure.)  The real pain starts after the protests have calmed. Economic crash is certain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh both went through it. Stock market/real estate crash, inflation and what not.  Whoever takes charge next, likely Balen, will need to address the pointless 'Greater Nepal' rhetoric and become a moderate on this issue. Thanks to Trump, India-China relationship is stable for the first time in ages. The only way Nepal has a future is pledge allegiance to both neighbour's.  Bangladesh under Yunus has been a pain in the ass for India. Nepal cannot make the same mistake. Any wrong steps and a free floating Nepali rupee against the dollar would go from 140 now to 25,000 like similar countries in our GDP range. Probably worse since our economy is in much worse shape. ($1 = Lao Kip 21,631.66 LAK)  Nepal needs one stable leader for the next 40 yrs. No interim gov paving way for elections bullshit. Forget the democracy experiment.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.¬†¬† Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.¬†¬† Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||How credible is this info?|||Use bitchat for conversation.

If he gets an interim pm he probably won't hold a proper election for more than a year and will call every Nepali to rebuild all the buildings that got destroyed. He is the worst and most unprofessional option for the interim government. He is a power-hungry person. Don't forget how he won and became mayor. If he actually loves the country he would step out and urge the people to pressure the president into dissolving parliament. He has no qualifications to be a mayor and he is thinking about taking the pm. If he becomes the interim pm or any minister we know we have failed and  His so-called supporters I bet they don't know what an interim PM is, and their work is just like Harkey himself   Anyone supporting him on social media and protesting for him might be paid by him.

            "comments": "We are living in a moment where anger is boiling over. People are tired of corruption, censorship, and being silenced. Many of us are ready to take to the streets on Sept 8. But before we move forward, we must stop and think carefully.  History has shown us what happens when we rush in without preparation. In Bangladesh last year, in Sri Lanka not long ago, ordinary people gave their lives while corrupt leaders fled the country with protection and comfort. Their deaths were forgotten within weeks, while the guilty walked free. If we are not careful, Nepal risks becoming the next chapter in that same tragic story.  That is why this movement must be different. We cannot afford to be reckless. We must protect our people, keep our voices peaceful, and make sure the world is watching every step so that accountability cannot be erased.  Here is what we need to do before Sept 8:  * Get international human rights groups, UN observers, and peace monitors involved beforehand so there are eyes on the ground. * Publish clear and peaceful agendas so nobody can label us as rioters or mobs. * Document everything with photos, videos, and testimonies. Every arrest and every injury must be recorded and shared. * Avoid following local leaders who are affiliated with political parties. Big parties will try to infiltrate, hijack, and twist this movement for their own gain. * Know who is truly standing beside you. Trust matters because infiltrators can turn peaceful protests into chaos.  This movement is about dignity, rights, and accountability. It is not about violence. It is not about revenge. If we lose focus, if we let anger replace strategy, then we risk repeating the same cycle where the powerful walk free and ordinary people pay with their lives.  Nepal deserves better. The world must see us not as mobs, but as citizens united for freedom and justice. If we do this right, our voices will be impossible to silence. If we do this wrong, we risk being forgotten like so many before us.  Stay safe. Stay peaceful. Stay smart.",

She is the daughter of Chabi Rijal, a communist leader and Chief District Officer in Nepal, who recently ordered a shoot-on-sight against youth peacefully protesting corruption in Nepal. His orders have killed over 18 innocent people, injured more than 100 students, and more deaths are expected. This is pure fascism and a gross misuse of power. Young people in a peaceful protest were shot dead, which is totally unacceptable. While our brothers and sisters die in Nepal, Sweta Rijal has no right to study in the US with money from corruption. Her entire funding is from the money from corruption. The US, as a democratic country and a voice for the UN, stands for freedom and justice. Allowing her to stay contradicts everything the US represents. We are struggling to fight this battle in Nepal, and she must be held accountable. I urge you to investigate her visa and take necessary action to send her back to Nepal. Regards, Concerned Citizen from Nepal",

Many of us here are also frustrated by the opportunist media and some jerks. We do have misunderstandings and conflicts between but they should have been side lined at this critical moment. Even the people who are getting inspired and speaking in favour of your protest are getting back lash (and recently a person has been charged under the law by the police)because this protest turned violent but ik that wasn't intended. We can argue about the pros and cons but the fact that you stood up against the system is a big achievement and inspiration. I wish you great luck guys and hope you find a better system than the one you fought against and draw a milestone for us. Although I would say you have had a great loss of infrastructure which could have been avoided if the protest was properly managed.|||Abiskar Raut for POTUS  #RAUT2028|||Good speaker, I hope we learn a lot from him.|||Aja samma malai ni yo manchey(sudan gurung) ley miraj dhungana ley start gareko protest  lai hijack garera, sabai cerdit liyo vanney socheko thiye.

Why can't we try to support eachother instead of blaming each other??   And No body knows. Since those politicians where chased. They have little chance to establish again.  And the hotel was belonging of politicians son. So, they could have made fake protestor's to do it, to claim insurance?  Why are indian and nepalese are fighting here about this matter?? This isn't time for fighting.   And about destroying properties, there are theories that the protest were hijacked by other political parties. Like wise, about governments offices, they wanted to destroy the proofs of corruptions. And public building and properties was collateral damages for those fake protesters to look it real.

I think you've never seen what corruption can cause, or you pretend not to!  I'm from Brazil, and I'll give you an example of what corruption can do to a society.    Here, I saw young people being shot in favelas just for supporting opposition politicians, yes, ordinary people being killed for supporting the other side.  People were and are arrested, tortured, and killed on the unjust orders of corrupt politicians and judges.  The media, also corrupt, manipulates public opinion with false narratives or half-truths, always favoring the state, especially abroad. This has caused enormous polarization in the country, in addition to promoting many unjust laws.  My country is overrun by crime, and there are criminal factions that control entire regions (with the explicit support of the state), and you run a risk when you go out at night, you know? You can be robbed and killed at any moment, and nothing will be done to the criminal.  Education is also of extremely low quality, which has caused an absurd cultural and moral degradation among my people, who today lack even the capacity to think critically.  Salary increases for politicians without social approval are frequent here, and nothing happens. Search the amount of benefits they receive here.  We recently had a scandal involving millions of retirees being stolen against their will by banks and public agencies. What was the government's solution? To create more taxes to pay without punishing those who stole, and to try to inhibit investigations by using public funds to buy off those who would investigate. Search for \"INSS Scandal\".  The current president (rejected by the majority) has actively provoked other countries, especially the US, to create an open conflict between the two countries, precisely to use this as an excuse to remain in power while putting the lives of millions of people at risk.    Anyway, I could spend all day here giving examples of the harm corruption has caused in the society I live in. I recommend imagining how many future geniuses, entrepreneurs, inventors, and exemplary people for humanity could exist here, but won't, thanks to the corruption of some.  Imagine how prosperous societies would be if there weren't corrupt representatives making absurd and selfish decisions to benefit themselves and control others.    I understand that violence blinds people, and it's unpleasant to see someone in this situation, but we need to understand that in today's societies, we have two sides, one side that wants to live and enjoy life peacefully, and the other that wants to use your life to live like gods.   So, what would you prefer?    The people of Nepal are absolutely right to act as they are, and their politicians need to see what true justice is. They acted wrongly, harming thousands of people, and now they need to be punished, something that would never happen without the use of violence.   The corrupt state would never punish itself, and military forces serve and exist precisely to defend the state and its interests, meaning they would never be punished fairly, and even if they have surrendered, the disaster has already been caused, this surrender is just a way for them to try to avoid punishment, however, sooner or later, they will stab society in the back, and guess what, if society doesn't act, nothing will happen to them and their crimes!  Soon my country will go through something similar, and you will be able to see that it is not about revenge, it is about justice, something that unfortunately is disappearing in societies.  There's no point in trying to appear morally superior, evil people exist and will continue to commit atrocities, and if there are no violent reactions against them, everything will only get worse.|||Ajai kutnu partyo mardeko bhaye huntyo.

I am just a sincere, hardworking youth who remained silent because too many opinions create a ruckus. That's what I believed till September 8. When I went to the protest, it was all fine until they started firing. When you're in the battleground, all moralities go out the window. Yet, I did not throw a single stone at anyone and I am proud of that. I remained with the group who were peacefully protesting infront of the army van, I helped people with water to wash their face, tried picking up litters. The main point is I tried being a responsible person. But the moment I saw people being carried to the hospital with their blood spattering the streets, I fucking lost it. In retaliation, my protests became more louder. I came home late at night, tried my best to repost as many information I could. At one point, I felt like people should burn down the entire ministry down, all these nepo-babies should be brought to the streets to teach their parents how it feels to kill someone's child. I was furious, the word being an understatement. But seeing this people getting mob justice was what I never wanted.

You say their work has benefited generations ‚Äúlike me‚Äù but what about the millions still without quality education, clean water, jobs, or justice? If that legacy was truly built for the people, then why does inequality keep growing? Why is access to opportunity still limited to a select few families like yours?  No one is attacking your elders for their hard work but using that work to claim political or social superiority today is exactly the kind of dynastic thinking that holds progress back. Legacies don‚Äôt entitle children to power. Competence, accountability, and public trust do.  You‚Äôre not being attacked, you‚Äôre being questioned. And if your only answer is to call others ‚Äúsmall-minded‚Äù and ‚Äúungrateful,‚Äù then maybe you‚Äôre not as prepared to face criticism as you think. Respect is earned in every generation, not inherited like land or a business.  The days of hiding behind the achievements of the past are over.

            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada‚Äôs classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.¬†  We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking‚Äìmuch to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in¬† Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate -¬†the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala‚Äôs approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.¬†  Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn‚Äôt mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‚Äòhelp‚Äô. One time, she even said airily, ‚ÄúI wash my own dishes, you know.‚Äù She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala‚Äìa beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth‚Äìlingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don‚Äôt intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‚Äònepo babies‚Äô who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).¬†  Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It‚Äôs a troubling idea to think that despite what‚Äôs happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

She was funded by her corrupt father.||| Damn I strictly feel its true|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn‚Äôt some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake ‚Äúbeauty with brains‚Äù narrative. Do you guys remember Niti‚Äôs big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let‚Äôs not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala‚Äôs prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it‚Äôs her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let‚Äôs be real- Sisan wasn‚Äôt perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they‚Äôd known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn‚Äôt even exist. This just proves it- they weren‚Äôt just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can‚Äôt just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala‚Äôs career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav‚Äôs narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What‚Äôs the lesson we can learn from here ?

Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don‚Äôt even make sense to begin with. Don‚Äôt know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don‚Äôt even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It‚Äôs so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It‚Äôs astounding what the world has come to and it‚Äôs deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can‚Äôt be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn‚Äôt she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It‚Äôs better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has.

It also touches on the contrast between her image and reality, as well as some concerns about nepotism and entitlement.|||there was a podcast recently, shrinkhala & 3 other women sittng down to talk with, his name may be anil shah.  Shrinkhala said harvard was funded by $ she had saved up from influencer income she had made post miss nepal.that's what she said.  Podcast frm less than 2 wks ago.|||Honestly wanted to hear this from someone at Harvard. In Nepal we already had similar rumors of her student life here 5 year s back but they were ignored.   I have no hate for her. But if she was really someone she portrays herself to be then she would have used her platform to condemn the 19 students murder after day 1 of protest when we all were scared and angry about what‚Äôs gonna happen next.

Its not easy to get in there and even if you do its one of the expensive schools there. Talking about her Nepal bachelor‚Äôs days, my friends studied with her in KU in nepal in b. arch, and so many said she cheated on exams (A LOT) just to pass. later she worked for the nepal government and came to US for conferences and presentations ü§°. now she has started her master‚Äôs at UT austin, funded by corrupted money. she removed her instagram posts about her prior foreign visits and her recent UT Austin orientation day, and even deactivated her linkedin account.  Now she‚Äôs posting on instagram and facebook, after the new PM was appointed, congratulating her and thanking the president grand dad for this revolution. it‚Äôs crazy how these unethical people still have the audacity to do all this.  (Source: from college friends and family members, and as those of us who are directly impacted by this revolution in nepal, we are not going to stay quiet against corruption and the unethical hypocrisy going on for a long time)|||Everyone hates power till you offer some|||What was her gpa?|||So many politicians sold country for MBBS and BDS seats for their children. Example Ram chandra poudel's daughter  Madhav nepal daughter  Sharad singh Bhandari arranging BDS seats for his brother daughter.. These are few examples and seats goes on.  These are things we are fighting for.|||I trust every words you said.I felt this to my gut when you shared about the teamwork thing and how she treated her peers more like servant and less like an actual teammate. These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!! And the way she's silent when the country is bleeding says alottt too!!!!!!  And about the Nepal's government scholarship for harvard,this is not true, she is telling an entire different story about harvard scholarsip & how she paid fees there. She said she got 30% scholarship at harvard and the remaining 70% is paid through her brand endorsements money as she is brand ambassador to few company. We didnt buy that story, she tried hardest to sell it though and still fools people with this shitty madeup script about harvard's 30% scholarship & 70% funding through brand endorsement's money lmao. And lately she's being questioned on 50,000USD she got during miss world competition after winning \"beauty with the purpose\" title. Her ex exposed & questioned her in a very shady way and because of him we all knew this new layer of truth and i highly doubt it went on harvard's funding rather than for actual purpose|||https://youtu.be/XcEC2q4CotY  Sastu Mutu is a song made for her.|||But guys, the 50000 dollars which apparently Shrinkhala and Anuska got, why didnt we know about it earlier? Didnt Dabur Miss Nepal know? Was the money given to them in their personal account or was it provided through Dabur Miss Nepal? This needs to be investigated imo.|||Honestly, I am tired of reddit Nepal talking about Shrinkhala at this point. Sabb le yei vanthio kyare..... How is she able to be relevant so much. Her being idealistic nice person image gone, perception of her being smart gone, her relationship with memeable Sisan Baniya gone, Nepali boys whose beauty standard is \"goori hunu  paryo\" simping for her as she got married gone... If you actually visit work of her company Gaatha, your impression of her teams there will also be gone.|||My mom generation dont even know the name shrinkhala|||>Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking  Sounds like a good thing if the justice was carried out right and the accused was found guilty beyond all reasonable doubts.|||So I assume your story is true. I also studied in the states and I know how expensive it can get.   So how did she funded her education considering Harvard which is an ivy league school is extremely costly and on top of that, her lifestyle itself is on the high end. So..  In that case, even you since you studied in Harvard. How did you fund your education?  Just curious.

I have heard that a lot of exams are predetermined by the ruling caste. This corruption is so bad that even well-educated people are falsely given a bad grade. While the latter is given a high passing grade. This type of discrimination is not only evil but can takes one's life. HK student commit suicide because of academic pressure.

I always wondered if she was true to her image.   At the end of the day she got into Harvard. I think her winning Ms Nepal helped; also her access to many social works would have helped with her application. But still getting into Harvard is not a small feat- so she must have some intellectual capacity to get picked by the best educational institutions in the world.|||Haha.

Where else in the world are citizens asked what their main problems are and what they want from the government?

And in the media, they try to appear close to the people, to be there for them, to advance the country by investing in infrastructure or new hospitals, etc. But no, a large part of your taxes ends up with the rulers themselves.

Even if they have the intention and will to do so (like many of us want), they do not know how to run a country.

The thing is they have a lot more to learn and they will, with time.       This situation would not have happened if there were transfer of power to youth in timely manner. Now the rising youth leaders do not have experience because these corrupt politicians did not allow that.      What we need is a system where corruption should now be absolutely dreaded, seeing how corrupt politicians had to run away for thier life. They have to realize that people will not just punish the corrupt polticians, they will also punish whoever was responsible to prevent that.       There now needs to be a collaborative development with young leaders like Balen and experienced people like Sushila.

I truly want Sushila Karki to be prime minister, but according to our constitution it's not possible. And if we ditch our constitution our country is open for invasion from other countries. So, what's the best option it's BALEN. I know that he won't be able to run for prime minister for the next election but it is a risk we have to take. It's already proven that our protest was the result of different politicians 'parties'involvement. So, let's play it safe and try to choose the best result for us. Already many Indian politicians are saying that they are ready to deploy an army if needed. It's not goodwill but an invasion. So it's best we know what we do for the country.  But if it's possible for her to be prime minister without disturbing our constitution then I'm all for it. I also want a good leader who will work for the development of the country.   Indian is already eyeing the district like Lipilekh and Limpadhura. If we take too long to make a responsible decision, they are favourites to win the case.   The country is already in chaos. So we must do our best to calm it down. We protested against corruption and got unexpected results. We are not ready for it. And we don't have time to think about it and make a decision. But, we must make a decision and make it work, isn't it all there is to it ?    It's not that I don't support \"Sushila Karki\" . She has my full support. But if it is disturbing our core rules set by our constitution. I just thought it isn't right. So it's my request all my fellow citizens ( not just gen-z ) to make a right decision.   But my final warning is that if we defy our current constitution ourselves. It will not be a suprise other countries take advantage of it. So we shall make a decision ourselves and take the best route possible. But you've my support to make her ( Sushila Karki) intrim prime minister. It is the best result seeing her experience on political field.   It might have been a bit long for the attention span of gen-z but i just want to say that, neither the constitution nor the national rules be any shorter üòä.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.¬†¬† Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.¬†¬† Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||Jaha Bhetyo tehi thok saley madarchod lai...|||Aaos na india ma ni nepali xan birsyo kya|||Bro timro yo pic use garey haii Tiktok ma vid halchu|||kun desh jala teta bebasta garnu parxa|||yo machikne lai samatna paryo jasari bhaye ni yellai bachne kunai adhikar xaina|||Bhagey ra canada nai ja la, canada ma nee xodnu hudaina.

This way we will have clean central government in which no one can capture state function and minimize corruption.¬†   Since we don't have any functioning people in power, either let lower house to vote for temporary governor and magistrate. No minister, let bureaucracy handle them under strict scrutiny of Governor and Magistrate.¬†   Then start a fresh election, 1 President, 7 Governors, 1 Premier, 7 Magistrates, Lower House or Province Parliament member, then from each Province send 10 representative in Upper House/Federal Parliament 3 voted by Lower House/Province Parliament, 5 directly elected in Upper House and 2 votes each from Province Governor and Province Magistrate. Let the bill for Upper House be registered by directly elected member of Upper House. Upper house will vote for foreign minister, ambassadors and diplomats.   For now, either make Mayor and Deputy Mayor of each capital of Province to be interim Governor and Magistrate to bring law and order in state-province security and function.

Personally I have next to no clue who Sumana is, and normally I'd think that makes her a good candidate because there's nothing but positive vibes so far. I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both.

She is the one who has been abroad for so long and has so many foreign connections and relations that even if she  doesn't want interference, there will be far more foreign interference with her as a leader.  We can not deny that .   3. Sumana did absolutely nothing as a health minister apart from stunts. Ministers are supposed to amend laws and execute them. could have done so much more .   4.

BTW, Gen Z doesn‚Äôt just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didn‚Äôt exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who weren‚Äôt even present for the protests claim we don‚Äôt know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldn‚Äôt even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, ‚ÄòWe have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server you‚Äôre all listening to is just for public discussion‚Äô. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal.

So I believe it‚Äôs high time we look ahead and bring the same energy we did to the protests to ensure that we see the change we want to see happen and bring in leaders we believe in. Easier said than done but accountability starts from us now. Let‚Äôs not settle for less than what we envision Nepal to be.|||Who are you telling this?

They are hot blooded. They can do anything with teen minds.  Look at your genZ, destroying their own land...  GenZ is a popular word on the internet.  Now whenever you talk about GenZ people will remember this amount of brutalism and rage against their own land own assets.|||**What next? thoughts from a fellow Gen Z**    The motherland burns, my heart aches, my mind ponders, is all hope lost? My soul hurts to see violence, arson, anarchy, and the loot and burning of our national properties. We, Gen-Z, seem to have won, yet feel lost. Hope feels lost. Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? I‚Äôve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we can‚Äôt let our nation fail.** We can‚Äôt let our nation burn. We can‚Äôt let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**¬†    **1) We lay down our weapons.**¬†  We came in peace, we protested in peace, and we‚Äôve always wanted peace. We shall end this in peace. Be it known that anybody inciting violence isn‚Äôt part of our movement.¬†    **2) We extend love.**¬†  Love towards our brothers and sisters, love towards our nation, love towards our neighbours, our society, and the opposing side. The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.¬†    **3) We wear white.**¬†  White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that we‚Äôve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.¬†    **4) We have hope.**¬†  Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.¬†    Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.¬†    Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.¬†    Sincerely,¬†  Pantji, a Gen-Z¬†|||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger.

When the rich don't know the limits of expoliting the poor these are the consequences. Every freaking nepali politician only gave a fancy speech but never worked towards development of the country. The crowd going crazy is the result of fustration building towards government and the younger generations seeing nothing for them in nepal.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Why not sagar Dhakal?|||Yesss|||Just promote it in your social media handle|||K bhairacha yarr discord ma pm choose bhairacha|||Ahile non political manxe thik huncha...her or Dr ‡§∏‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Å‡§ï Ruit.

If the reserved dollar currency üí≤ runs out in the central bank and have condition like srilanka then there will be revolution. If the India closes it's border for 6 months will work too. As long as there is enough to eat and drink there will be no system changing revolution.||| I love this trend! You know they watch these videos. Keep em coming.

But in the name of trends and in a greater sense of 'doing something to stop corruption' you are promoting hatred, cyber bullying and a society with no rule of law. Why dragged every son daughter relatives who may or may not have control over their father's action and attacking them in a social platform while you yourself are anonymous. If you really wanted a change you would protest in the street or vote for the right person in the street. But you are taking the easy and dangerous way out to harass someone while you yourself are hiding behind your anonymous account. I don't know what more dangerous \"an ignorant Nepali\" or \"a woke Nepali\".|||This is better than Rajtantra, it‚Äôs not a big deal .",

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen.

The damage cannot be measured only in money, but also in the irreplaceable cultural and historical value that has been destroyed.  I feel deeply saddened by this loss.

The votes that party gets determine the remaining 110 members via proportional representation.  so aba either we need new political parties to replace the existing ones by Falgun 21, or we have to vote for the same parties again. This is more complicated because Nepal is not just Kathmandu. The political players which we have termed jholey will be active outside Kathmandu.

Nepal can be a smaller country, but they are much more older nation state than us with full of brilliant souls and whatever Nepalis choose for their country, we respect that from core.

You don't need any validation from germany ka kukkur.|||Guys, I assume everyone here has someone in their family with some political ties. I too have. But that doesn't mean I have direct ties with them. JHOLEY and BHEDA is a noun that defines people who blindly believe in a person or a political party.      Talking about myself, I am already 36, a father and I am thinking of raising my family here in Nepal. I was totally against going abroad as a student when there was trend to do so. But the political system was never stable here. However, This current GenZ revolution happened against corruption. We indeed got a good progress against these corrupt leaders. But things turned out to be different and here is my roller coaster of emotions. Please let me know if you can relate to this.  Day 0: Social Media Ban - Mixed feelings. Hopeful that social medias will proceed further with registration.  Day 1: GenZ revolution and killing - Lots of anger. Disappointment and discontent.  Day 2: Revolution, excited and happy till 4 PM, until we destroyed the party system. Once the public started destroying Singha Durbar, I came to realize what I had done. I started a fire that I can't extinguish.  Day 3: Realization of the revolution being hijacked. We were just against corruption, regime change was not our motto. The revolution gradually turned into a COLOR REVOLUTION.  Day 4: Worried about who will lead the country. Started mentally supporting Balen/Rabi or any young leader. Furious, since the army asked GenZ to come up with a leader. Finally Hami Nepal, some guys funded by Deep state along with Sanduk Ruit and Swarnim Wagle came into light. They started talking about regime change and Constitution change. They said they directly want to select Zelensky as their prime minister.   Day 5: Much more disappointed as some kids who are aiming to go abroad for future study is electing prime minister through Discord. Sushila Karki elected as PM. Which is some sort of relief. I feared a autocrat.  Day 6 - Day 7: China is yet to acknowledge PM Sushila Karki. China is suspecting foul play as KP Oli had been to SCO and all of this happened just after that.      Now I am very much in distress. I feel that, Nepal is Ukraine. Balen is the new Zelensky and China is the new Russia. I dont want to think negatively but the situation ahead seems to be very dark and we will have to take steps cautiously. There are a lot of hatred here and Social medias are fueling it. None of the GenZ were born during the writing of the constitution. There were lots of revolution that was endured by current revolution Maoist Revolution, Madesh Revolution etc. But now it seems everything has gone to waste and there is no constitution here in the country. Is this PTSD?|||Nepal, you are dealing with dangerous, insecure, violent crybullies who don't care about reasons and motives because they'll just come up with fake news and use that is their motive.

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4. Retirement age and term limits: This is a must, we need a clear retirement age for the public positions just like other jobs.     These sort of things are fundamental of any country, without getting the fundamentals right we cannot expect our country to do better. We have a chance to make things better, lets take this chance.|||also i think! what lessons can be learned from Bangladesh last year?|||Garni nai ho vani presidency system lyauni.

Just wanted to express supreme respect to you from Ukraine.   You're really cool!   We had protests in 2014.   We made lot of mistakes after succeded in throwing down Yanukovich in 2014.

Now we get kidnapping peoples on streets by police and conscripted forcely to war or you can get out for $10k until kidnapped next time.

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

AKA the daughter of a corrupt leader, the Chief Development Officer of Kathmandu, Nepal, Chhabi Rijal, who ordered gunfire in a peaceful protest that took place in Nepal on the 8th of September. The protest that took place against a corrupt government resulted in the loss of 20 individuals, some of whom were minors present in school uniforms, and hundreds were injured.   This is what we got for speaking against a government that has leeched off of taxpayers' money. We request an immediate dismissal of Sweta Rijal's candidacy at your esteemed institution. We, as Nepali people, condemn the actions of her immediate family and believe that her degree, funded by her very disliked father, will be of NO USE to our country. Hope you take the necessary action.

A shift to a fully directly elected system for every seat would ensure greater accountability and public representation. 2. **Establish a Directly Elected Executive Head:**¬†Instead of the parliament choosing the Prime Minister, the call is for a directly elected President or Prime Minister with full executive powers. This would provide a stable government for a fixed term, preventing the \"share-the-power\" politics that have led to instability.|||Also follow what's in constitution, according to constitution of Nepal, people outside of Nepal should be able to vote through embassy, but in reality we can't.|||No regegnation, country out|||So y'all are asking for resignation after kids dead in their school uniform.

It‚Äôs tragic, because they also have families back home and face the same struggles as the rest of us. They should be victims of this system too, yet they show little compassion or critical thought about what‚Äôs happening around them. Why are there protests in the first place? I refuse to believe they're blind to people's frustration and the direction the country is heading.  I still remember when we joined a protest 14‚Äì15 years ago. The police confronted us aggressively, and as kids we were too confused to react. Fortunately, we just stood there processing and visibly confused, and they left ‚Äî but I still shudder to think, *what if our reaction had been different?* Today‚Äôs young protestors are in the same position, pure in their intentions, simply voicing frustration without wanting harm.  And honestly, credit must go to these protestors. They know exactly what they are standing for, unlike us back then who needed adults to organise us. I don‚Äôt see how demonstrations could be any more peaceful than they already are ‚Äî especially when the very leaders being protested against have blood on their hands from before this generation was even born.|||Yo bhatey haru kahi gayera sitcha holani|||randi baan machikne haru|||I mean this tracks, they only like when you're corrupt|||Its not andolan anymore its war|||We want death or at lease exile of KP Oli and other taukes.|||Randi haruko photo, name, address patta lagau.|||khate haru mug haru padne bela ma padenan aile mug ko mug ko chak sugera manche lai dukha dinxan. timi mug haru le esto dukha dekhnu paros jatha haru. maa gali pani dina sakdina timi haru ko aama ko galti haina timi haru jasta janmie. aama lai k thaaa. tara kailei bhalo nahos timi haru jasta ko. timi haru marna pani na paos bachna pani na paos.|||shamelss dogs of government|||Machikne radi harlai lakhetdai marnaparne|||Thuiyaa police vanauda haruuu|||you radiko ban harulai agolauno man xa|||ma sanga pani ganhune bhaye, kassam mardinthe radieekko ban|||Mathi bata aako order re ????

It‚Äôs simple.|||Disclaimer: I am not a Balen supporter or cultist.  This post is conflicting for me. But, the post is characterizing the man based on:  1. What the man didn‚Äôt do or didn‚Äôt say. 2. What people expected him to do.  The man himself has said enough in his posts.   It‚Äôs what, he DIDN‚ÄôT do that impresses me the most about him. Saying ‚ÄúNo‚Äù is harder than saying ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, when everyone wanted him to say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.  (Think about this.)  He put out only a couple of posts, which I think served as guide posts during the revolution.   1. He was the first widely known public figure (that I know) who defined who Gen Z was and gave his support to the protest. 2. When the tempo rose, he clarified that Gen Z should lead, he accepted Sushila even when all of his cultists were going crazy about making him the interim PM.  Removing himself from the picture, brought focus back on the revolution and the task ahead, rather than turn the confusion situation, even more confusing with a popularity contest as a side gig.   There is a lot of things to think about and I think in time we can all make sense of it all.   That‚Äôs my two paisa about him.|||Leading KTM municipality vs leading the nation are totally different. The followers of Balen urging and rushing him to lead 'right now' and come out by 2PM are the same people who will criticize him within one year if he were to be them PM someday. They don't have patience and want to see changes immediately.  Personally, I would like to see him running in the upcoming election as deputy/vice roles first and not immediate PM role...assuming how parties will be formed and if there are any good lead independent candidate who will run with him. He's one of those few worthy to be PM but this is not his peak yet. He just became a mayor like 3 years ago and he still has a lot to show to the general public. If and when he wins to the election, it will be his peak and he has high chances of being a two term PM...assuming two term limit will be in place hopefully. Time will tell.|||GenZ aren't immune to celeb worship culture.|||Hami Nepal has already stated it was part of a plan and they want balen for 5 years. So did they fight for the nation or for the balen is the real question? Why are they biased for balen only and not for other groups of good people?|||About your 2nd picture.  Yes it is definitely an opportunistic behaviour by balen. But how is this behaviour wrong and how is taking over PM position now and securing interim govt now and not taking part in politics for next 5 years do any good to the country.    He is practicing patience to achieve the goal he desires and what people actually wants from a young leader like him. Look throughout the history of world politics, paitence has always been the key factor to shape the world politics.|||Having trusted by many even me,In the moment of national threat, he could do nothing. That‚Äôs the reason I doubt him.  i think he is not completely responsible for being the Prime Minister. Sure, he is a great person. He‚Äôs doing such a great thing in the valley, but being a Prime Minister is very responsible post, his way up talking to seniors, saying I will put fire to SinghaDurbar, I will bury everyone if you‚Äôre in tudinkhel, getting carried away by emotions, being Prime Minister means you should not be carried away by any emotions and none of the factors should affect your judgment which you believe to be true and is lawful, Hopefully he will make such changes and we can finally see him in the top, as much as I want him to be the Prime Minister I do think he is inexperienced and immature in this field,|||We are so far behind that criticizing political leader sounds like a hater. We are not even to the point where we could say ‚ÄúThis person is bad/clueless , country isn‚Äôt safe with them‚Äù. For the past decade, the corrupted 3 have been playing nothing but tato aloo with us so its natural to be sticking nail to current situation. Give it some time and our voices will get echoed.|||If there‚Äôs one thing old political leaders never learned, it was how to handle criticism. The moment anyone spoke up, they tried to shut it down and let‚Äôs not even start on the behavior of their hardcore supporters(jholey as we call them).  Even leaders like Balen need to address this with their own supporters, as do all the new representatives entering the upcoming elections. They must say publicly that they welcome criticism, will reflect on it, and use it as a tool for improvement. Leaders should make it clear to their base: don‚Äôt bully or silence people for simply asking questions or raising concerns. Do not perform character assassination against someone just for criticizing. After all, in a democracy, freedom of speech is our right.  At the same time, we the general public also carry responsibility. We need to recognize the difference between constructive criticism and defamation. What we must not do is fall for propaganda, spread rumors, or engage in baseless character assassination.  And if we realize that our criticism or questioning was wrong, we should have the courage to apologize in the same way we raised the question. After all, apologizing will never make you small. It‚Äôs just a simple five letter word: ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù A word that can and should be spoken from both sides.|||Just because you‚Äôre against the system, doesn‚Äôt make you Balen-Supporters. Balen has no experience. Balen should wait and gain some experience. Criticism is a backbone of democracy and one must welcome it.|||EXACTLY. They lack this ability to critically analyse any action of any leader. Like no one is perfect and no one is a good. Let's be honest. Let's criticize people for their actions. People should be held accountable for their actions. Most importantly, leaders who run our nation. If we don't point out their wrongdoings, will they ever stop? Nepalese have such a bheda mindset, istg. Let's be more aware and let's know how to discern leaders and their actions.   By criticizing these leaders, we aren't hating on them. We're trying to bring awareness so that they won't repeat the same thing again and can do things better for the country.|||They need to be aware party KO jhole become jhole because they were andabhakt of party leader ( just like they are blind follower of balen rn)|||Balen le andolan orchestrate gareko bhanera uslai arop cha dherai thau bata.

I see people thanking Balen for this movement and saying he was the reason this movement happened and succeeded and all after Sushila Karki became interim PM, and this made me very sad for actual people who started the movement and also faced the consequences and this was even more big realization for me for how blind youth and supporters these days are and this concerns me even more for future|||Tbh he‚Äôs not fitted for PM cause look at him he have no quality of a good leader specially thinking about diplomacy, even small things makes him anguish ani overconfident cause our country is small ani not teti powerful pani people need to fact check yetikai hype ma balen balen vnnerw huni kei hunnw , a single person cant change country ko face nai, a leader should be someone who equally can tackle every obstacle in a subtle way yetikai sano kura ma ni raged huni country lai ni risk ma leraunxa kya , i am not saying he‚Äôs not a good leader he indeed is terw just not fitted for PM.

This is what I‚Äôve been saying for some time. Like the post says, I‚Äôve also been labeled as a party ko jhole and what not. Even here in this sub, people have called me jhole lol just because I questioned him.  I am a Balen supporter. I supported him and did my part by sharing about his campaign on social media and making everyone aware about it. And I was super happy when he won, I still am. But I‚Äôve been criticizing him on various points that I find valid. The top one is communication.  During the election, he constantly criticized Bidya Sundar (the previous mayor) for not communicating publicly. He even said that once he became mayor, he wouldn‚Äôt be like that and would stay in constant touch. He proposed starting a ‚ÄòMayor with the Public‚Äô TV program and even set aside a budget for it, but nothing has happened. He hasn‚Äôt given a single interview.  And then come his jhole supporters who always argue with the same line: ‚ÄòPailai kei chaieko ho.‚Äô With that logic, we should never question anyone. Just look at how Balen has become now, he just posts one-sided, no-context Facebook statuses and nothing else.|||Balen is a hypocrite in my opinion, like he encouraged the protest and even promised to provide a safe and secure environment for the protest but when things turned south he vanished like horn from a donkeys head|||Finally someone spoke about this, belun has literally become a god complex among some people out there, which is kinda concerning, the only time he speaks is to not let his adhabhatka interfere in every other stuff out there.

He is still better than most of the people there. Whatever he does, he has never done anything wrong. Stop pretending to be so-called critics for useless reasons. What is your academic background, and what makes you think that way? Have you ever felt the difference between past and present Kathmandu? I have a friend from the core area of Kathmandu, do you know what his opinion about Balen Shah is? No!  Even Harka Sampang is a very good person. Moreover, Sagar Dhakal‚Äôs brother has been working actively to eradicate the dictatorship of these political parties. Maybe your parents are bootlicking those rotten political parties, so you only see what Balen has never done and will never do. Just because he supported the movement does not mean he said he wants to become prime minister. You must understand that he posts only a few things because his words are weapons. One word from him has many consequences in such a movement. He is very clever and very wise; unlike Harka Sampang, though I like Harka as a person.

Please keep the situation such that the army or any other entity doesn't get the excuse to deny people of their right to rule themselves. This is not  new,  when a revolution with a purpose overshoots give the power mongerers an opportunity to come forward and exploit that. A mob when acting like this is too dangerous.

I did raise that concern since everyone was fighting, in the chat because no one was ready to listen, just shout, that there are thousands of people who were involved, even if someone did get elected in that very server, what's to say others who were not there will follow. I left after that, have not joined it today. I see representatives of GenZ already doing interviews elsewhere so what is the point here. Also I refrain myself of any opinions since I have absolutely zero knowledge on any politician or their views or visions or nothing, but was just there to see who got elected and what was the conclusion.|||Mujii ‚ÄúGen z movement ‚Äú itself fundamentally wrong xa, monarchy maan paraune pani gen z xan uniharu ko kura sunnupardaina?

They couldnt select a group of representatives to talk to the army for over 12 hours.  There was also no verification process on who was talking.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**¬†The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**¬†If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**¬†If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**¬†If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

This has been ongoing for more than two decades. Behind the few visible figures, there are countless others who have either assisted them or benefitted through their association‚Äîranging from major brands in Nepal to traders. For example, Sher Bahadur Deuba‚Äôs son and his sanitary pad importing company stand as an illustration.  They have institutionalized corruption by appointing foreign ambassadors based on party loyalty and financial gains, extending even to the transfer of bureaucrats to preferred locations in exchange for bribes and other undue benefits. The problem is not limited to the political system alone; bureaucrats, too, require checks and balances. A mechanism must be established to regulate the power of bureaucrats over politicians. Since bureaucrats are permanent stakeholders, their influence is even greater. One effective way to mitigate this is to appoint domain experts as ministers‚Äîfor instance, a professional civil engineer as a minister cannot be misled about the cost estimates of a construction project.  There remains much to be done. Moreover, these political parties will attempt to form alliances before elections, bringing forward the same candidates and restoring the same exploitative system. Therefore, the first and most meaningful reform must be a change in the electoral process, with the inclusion of a ‚ÄúNOTA‚Äù (None of the Above) option.  Further accountability can be ensured by eliminating political appointments to certain positions. At present, even temporary (karar) appointments are made based on party affiliation rather than merit. As a result, even highly qualified experts are compelled to seek political approval. The recent appointments of Vice-Chancellors at B.P. Koirala Institute in Dharan and Gangalal Hospital are prime examples.  In addition to these issues, several other structural flaws persist. What we urgently require is a comprehensive systemic reform|||Gen Z laid them in the grave, and now they're shoveling the dirt themselves.|||# How to make Gen Z movement bullet proof ?

People watched her speech where she said stuff like, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?‚Äù  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still don‚Äôt have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we don‚Äôt have the right connections.  We don‚Äôt get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, it‚Äôs still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? That‚Äôs probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  We‚Äôre out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor people‚Äôs kids not boil?  On top of that, there‚Äôs already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent. Because this have  been suppressed for so long, and now the mindset is like ‚Äî ‚ÄúIf we can‚Äôt reach anywhere through the system, then we might as well destroy it.‚Äù  And even if some third party tries to trigger people, the truth is, it was already there deep down in their subconscious. This is just it coming out. Right now it feels new, but honestly, it was bound to happen sooner or later.|||No Shit Sherlock (You guys got  manipulated into doing the wrong thing) üòî|||Sherey ko choro lai dhulai diye ki nai ?|||Each Hilton hotel employees 400+ Nepalese nationals üòÇ what about the people that lost their jobs?|||https://preview.redd.it/muoumzxh6eof1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63da78ae8b2a74c1f669dc95f01e062ff9e299b0|||https://preview.redd.it/rjynwvrk6eof1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04a5f8cbe1243c2dfca73c29dea57aa5425243bf|||We could‚Äôve turned this into Hospital but Nope|||This is an absolutely great work revolution.|||Aur Karo money money wali gand masti|||if you make a good system and government now that‚Äòs important!

That drive inevitably brings with it shades of narcissism and opportunism. So rather than fixating on intentions, it makes more sense to judge politicians by their results.

His rough almost mobster-like style may be off-putting to some but in a city like Dharan which is home to hotheaded Kirati / Hill Janajati majority that kind of toughness isn‚Äôt just useful, it‚Äôs necessary.  That said, he is neither qualified nor capable enough to be considered an ‚Äòideal‚Äô Prime Minister.

If a person has done good work, both of them will be appreciated hands down. You have to look at the picture from both sides. Secondly, please ask your senior citizens or elders from a different generation. They have seen history and faced the consequences. The real issue is bringing change in the constitution, i.e., a representative should not be above a certain age and should be allowed to seek votes only for one term. Take that in writing from the concerned representative, live, and show it to the world clearly. Also, please do not discriminate by saying someone is from the ‚ÄúStone Age,‚Äù as such remarks can hurt the sentiments of people who are not from cities.|||Yes, I don't know what to.

(**Bank run**¬†is a situation where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a bank simultaneously, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or financial stability. This can lead to liquidity problems for the bank, as it may not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands. Bank runs can create a cycle of panic, potentially leading to the bank's failure.)  The real pain starts after the protests have calmed. Economic crash is certain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh both went through it. Stock market/real estate crash, inflation and what not.  Whoever takes charge next, likely Balen, will need to address the pointless 'Greater Nepal' rhetoric and become a moderate on this issue. Thanks to Trump, India-China relationship is stable for the first time in ages. The only way Nepal has a future is pledge allegiance to both neighbour's.  Bangladesh under Yunus has been a pain in the ass for India. Nepal cannot make the same mistake. Any wrong steps and a free floating Nepali rupee against the dollar would go from 140 now to 25,000 like similar countries in our GDP range. Probably worse since our economy is in much worse shape.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.¬†¬† Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.¬†¬† Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||How credible is this info?|||Use bitchat for conversation.

            "comments": "We are living in a moment where anger is boiling over. People are tired of corruption, censorship, and being silenced. Many of us are ready to take to the streets on Sept 8. But before we move forward, we must stop and think carefully.  History has shown us what happens when we rush in without preparation. In Bangladesh last year, in Sri Lanka not long ago, ordinary people gave their lives while corrupt leaders fled the country with protection and comfort. Their deaths were forgotten within weeks, while the guilty walked free. If we are not careful, Nepal risks becoming the next chapter in that same tragic story.  That is why this movement must be different. We cannot afford to be reckless. We must protect our people, keep our voices peaceful, and make sure the world is watching every step so that accountability cannot be erased.  Here is what we need to do before Sept 8:  * Get international human rights groups, UN observers, and peace monitors involved beforehand so there are eyes on the ground. * Publish clear and peaceful agendas so nobody can label us as rioters or mobs. * Document everything with photos, videos, and testimonies. Every arrest and every injury must be recorded and shared. * Avoid following local leaders who are affiliated with political parties. Big parties will try to infiltrate, hijack, and twist this movement for their own gain. * Know who is truly standing beside you. Trust matters because infiltrators can turn peaceful protests into chaos.  This movement is about dignity, rights, and accountability. It is not about violence. It is not about revenge. If we lose focus, if we let anger replace strategy, then we risk repeating the same cycle where the powerful walk free and ordinary people pay with their lives.  Nepal deserves better. The world must see us not as mobs, but as citizens united for freedom and justice. If we do this right, our voices will be impossible to silence. If we do this wrong, we risk being forgotten like so many before us.  Stay safe. Stay peaceful. Stay smart.",

She is the daughter of Chabi Rijal, a communist leader and Chief District Officer in Nepal, who recently ordered a shoot-on-sight against youth peacefully protesting corruption in Nepal. His orders have killed over 18 innocent people, injured more than 100 students, and more deaths are expected. This is pure fascism and a gross misuse of power. Young people in a peaceful protest were shot dead, which is totally unacceptable. While our brothers and sisters die in Nepal, Sweta Rijal has no right to study in the US with money from corruption. Her entire funding is from the money from corruption. The US, as a democratic country and a voice for the UN, stands for freedom and justice. Allowing her to stay contradicts everything the US represents. We are struggling to fight this battle in Nepal, and she must be held accountable. I urge you to investigate her visa and take necessary action to send her back to Nepal. Regards, Concerned Citizen from Nepal",

Many of us here are also frustrated by the opportunist media and some jerks. We do have misunderstandings and conflicts between but they should have been side lined at this critical moment. Even the people who are getting inspired and speaking in favour of your protest are getting back lash (and recently a person has been charged under the law by the police)because this protest turned violent but ik that wasn't intended. We can argue about the pros and cons but the fact that you stood up against the system is a big achievement and inspiration. I wish you great luck guys and hope you find a better system than the one you fought against and draw a milestone for us.

This isn't time for fighting.   And about destroying properties, there are theories that the protest were hijacked by other political parties.

I think you've never seen what corruption can cause, or you pretend not to!  I'm from Brazil, and I'll give you an example of what corruption can do to a society.    Here, I saw young people being shot in favelas just for supporting opposition politicians, yes, ordinary people being killed for supporting the other side.  People were and are arrested, tortured, and killed on the unjust orders of corrupt politicians and judges.  The media, also corrupt, manipulates public opinion with false narratives or half-truths, always favoring the state, especially abroad. This has caused enormous polarization in the country, in addition to promoting many unjust laws.  My country is overrun by crime, and there are criminal factions that control entire regions (with the explicit support of the state), and you run a risk when you go out at night, you know? You can be robbed and killed at any moment, and nothing will be done to the criminal.  Education is also of extremely low quality, which has caused an absurd cultural and moral degradation among my people, who today lack even the capacity to think critically.  Salary increases for politicians without social approval are frequent here, and nothing happens. Search the amount of benefits they receive here.  We recently had a scandal involving millions of retirees being stolen against their will by banks and public agencies. What was the government's solution? To create more taxes to pay without punishing those who stole, and to try to inhibit investigations by using public funds to buy off those who would investigate. Search for \"INSS Scandal\".  The current president (rejected by the majority) has actively provoked other countries, especially the US, to create an open conflict between the two countries, precisely to use this as an excuse to remain in power while putting the lives of millions of people at risk.    Anyway, I could spend all day here giving examples of the harm corruption has caused in the society I live in. I recommend imagining how many future geniuses, entrepreneurs, inventors, and exemplary people for humanity could exist here, but won't, thanks to the corruption of some.  Imagine how prosperous societies would be if there weren't corrupt representatives making absurd and selfish decisions to benefit themselves and control others.    I understand that violence blinds people, and it's unpleasant to see someone in this situation, but we need to understand that in today's societies, we have two sides, one side that wants to live and enjoy life peacefully, and the other that wants to use your life to live like gods.   So, what would you prefer?    The people of Nepal are absolutely right to act as they are, and their politicians need to see what true justice is. They acted wrongly, harming thousands of people, and now they need to be punished, something that would never happen without the use of violence.   The corrupt state would never punish itself, and military forces serve and exist precisely to defend the state and its interests, meaning they would never be punished fairly, and even if they have surrendered, the disaster has already been caused, this surrender is just a way for them to try to avoid punishment, however, sooner or later, they will stab society in the back, and guess what, if society doesn't act, nothing will happen to them and their crimes!  Soon my country will go through something similar, and you will be able to see that it is not about revenge, it is about justice, something that unfortunately is disappearing in societies.  There's no point in trying to appear morally superior, evil people exist and will continue to commit atrocities, and if there are no violent reactions against them, everything will only get worse.|||Ajai kutnu partyo mardeko bhaye huntyo.

I am just a sincere, hardworking youth who remained silent because too many opinions create a ruckus. That's what I believed till September 8. When I went to the protest, it was all fine until they started firing. When you're in the battleground, all moralities go out the window. Yet, I did not throw a single stone at anyone and I am proud of that. I remained with the group who were peacefully protesting infront of the army van, I helped people with water to wash their face, tried picking up litters. The main point is I tried being a responsible person. But the moment I saw people being carried to the hospital with their blood spattering the streets, I fucking lost it. In retaliation, my protests became more louder. I came home late at night, tried my best to repost as many information I could. At one point, I felt like people should burn down the entire ministry down, all these nepo-babies should be brought to the streets to teach their parents how it feels to kill someone's child. I was furious, the word being an understatement. But seeing this people getting mob justice was what I never wanted. They don't deserve the least of anyone's sympathies, but we still have humanity in our hearts. That's what differs us from them.¬† I'm trying my best to control the narrative of why the protests happened, so that the opportunistic Indians, Chinese and the entire West may not take undue advantage of us.

            "heading": "The Shrinkhala Khatiwada I knew at Harvard",
            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada‚Äôs classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.¬†  We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking‚Äìmuch to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in¬† Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate -¬†the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala‚Äôs approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.¬†  Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn‚Äôt mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‚Äòhelp‚Äô. One time, she even said airily, ‚ÄúI wash my own dishes, you know.‚Äù She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala‚Äìa beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth‚Äìlingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don‚Äôt intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‚Äònepo babies‚Äô who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).¬†  Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It‚Äôs a troubling idea to think that despite what‚Äôs happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

It wasn‚Äôt some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake ‚Äúbeauty with brains‚Äù narrative. Do you guys remember Niti‚Äôs big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let‚Äôs not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala‚Äôs prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it‚Äôs her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let‚Äôs be real- Sisan wasn‚Äôt perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they‚Äôd known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn‚Äôt even exist. This just proves it- they weren‚Äôt just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can‚Äôt just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala‚Äôs career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav‚Äôs narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What‚Äôs the lesson we can learn from here ?  Karma is real af & money can‚Äôt give you lifelong happiness, night Redditors|||Guys zenisha khai, esko bachelorette party garne. Zenisha didi tah gayab chin tah|||I  never cared for her but hated her when she said ‚Äò we were not well off I had to share room with my house help ‚Äò and tried to relate to poor people like bro fuck off .|||Thanks for sharing. Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don‚Äôt even make sense to begin with. Don‚Äôt know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don‚Äôt even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It‚Äôs so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It‚Äôs astounding what the world has come to and it‚Äôs deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can‚Äôt be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn‚Äôt she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It‚Äôs better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has. It‚Äôs disheartening!|||What do you expect from a pageant queen? Testo well educated manche vayera beauty contest ma gako cha, priorities priorities|||She is a gold digger.

I would assume that she was in her best behavior since she was not in Nepal and probably wanted to portray the best of her image.  My moment of disdain for her came about when her father one of the members of the parliament who were on monthly housing allowance along with the monthly pay. The beinfit is probably meant for the MPs who had to move temprorarily to the capital or who didn't have their own residence. Iirc, they had to manually opt in to get that added housing allowance. When the news published, her father's reaction was something along the line of \"I didn't know, I was getting it. I am happy to return it.\"  Question for her, how come you dont know the source of wealth and your parent's ethics? I mean I know the answer, I just want to hear her say it.  https://preview.redd.it/z06jr4rj13pf1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8a20b685f7aae22f53a82b2ee284b7d2c72672f  [https://www.cijnepal.org/accommodation-allowance-for-landlord-lawmakers](https://www.cijnepal.org/accommodation-allowance-for-landlord-lawmakers)|||Correct my if I‚Äôm wrong guys, but shrinkhala father was health minister covid time, I heard tyo time ma vaccine ma ra health sector ma eka dum corruption bhaykeo thiyo.

Every move, every word, every connection seems like part of a bigger calculation. While most people get dragged through the mud on social media, she somehow stays a step ahead. Of all platforms, she was clever enough to pull the LinkedIn card first. That‚Äôs not by accident, it‚Äôs calculation. She knows the bashing on Tiktok or Instagram doesn‚Äôt matter as long as her professional side stays spotless, especially where she might work with people internationally who will never know the side of her life in Nepal that‚Äôs been exposed and torn apart ever since the truth came out.  It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs playing this endless game of Ludo, always climbing the ladder, polishing her image as she goes. But at the same time, you can‚Äôt help but feel she‚Äôs only ever a roll away from hitting 98 and sliding right back down the snake.|||Anyone consider that the follower she has on insta are bots or bought followers.. coz it should go down significantly if it weren't such.|||Can we revisit these nepo babies now, or soon?

It highlights how Shrinkhala, despite her public image and privileges, was not as collaborative or hardworking in academic settings as she appeared to be. It also touches on the contrast between her image and reality, as well as some concerns about nepotism and entitlement.|||there was a podcast recently, shrinkhala & 3 other women sittng down to talk with, his name may be anil shah.

Its not easy to get in there and even if you do its one of the expensive schools there.

These are things we are fighting for.|||I trust every words you said.I felt this to my gut when you shared about the teamwork thing and how she treated her peers more like servant and less like an actual teammate. These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!! And the way she's silent when the country is bleeding says alottt too!!!!!!  And about the Nepal's government scholarship for harvard,this is not true, she is telling an entire different story about harvard scholarsip & how she paid fees there. She said she got 30% scholarship at harvard and the remaining 70% is paid through her brand endorsements money as she is brand ambassador to few company. We didnt buy that story, she tried hardest to sell it though and still fools people with this shitty madeup script about harvard's 30% scholarship & 70% funding through brand endorsement's money lmao. And lately she's being questioned on 50,000USD she got during miss world competition after winning \"beauty with the purpose\" title. Her ex exposed & questioned her in a very shady way and because of him we all knew this new layer of truth and i highly doubt it went on harvard's funding rather than for actual purpose|||https://youtu.be/XcEC2q4CotY  Sastu Mutu is a song made for her.|||But guys, the 50000 dollars which apparently Shrinkhala and Anuska got, why didnt we know about it earlier?

I mean gross national happiness instead of gross national product. I believe every single country on this planet should take Bhutan as a role model a little bit more. Where else in the world are citizens asked what their main problems are and what they want from the government? And later, citizens are asked how satisfied they were with the government's performance. I know it's a bit naive of me to make such a suggestion from afar, as a sheltered European who is not really familiar with the form of government in Nepal.

The most expensive clothes, the biggest cars, houses, and palaces. Flying to New York for dinner in a private jet, or to Monaco for F1, or around the globe in a yacht as long as a soccer field. And in the media, they try to appear close to the people, to be there for them, to advance the country by investing in infrastructure or new hospitals, etc. But no, a large part of your taxes ends up with the rulers themselves.

This is literally just her side of the story. Anyone can sit behind a keyboard, write a long emotional post, and instantly turn public opinion against someone. That doesn‚Äôt make it the full truth.  We‚Äôve seen this before ‚Äî remember the Sandeep Lamichhane case? A girl accused him, media and public went wild, and people treated him as guilty before trial. Later, so many loopholes came out. It‚Äôs the same pattern here ‚Äî society naturally sides with the girl because we have an inbuilt bias that says ‚Äúthe girl must be the victim.‚Äù But is that always true? No.  Let‚Äôs also not ignore that sometimes girls do play emotional games. They ghost, they manipulate, they test how much a guy will ‚Äúchase‚Äù them ‚Äî and when he does, suddenly it becomes ‚Äústalking.‚Äù Where‚Äôs the line? Maybe she had past relationships, maybe she‚Äôs not telling the full story about her own actions that led to this fallout. Why should we blindly believe only her narrative and not even question what really happened?  And now people are targeting not just him, but also his family. That‚Äôs disgusting. Whatever the issue is between two individuals, why should parents, brothers, or sisters be dragged into it? People forget that when you destroy someone online, you destroy their whole family‚Äôs dignity too.  Everyone‚Äôs commenting with sympathy for her and anger towards him. But let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî most of that is just because she‚Äôs a girl and he‚Äôs a guy. If the genders were reversed, would people still believe the story this blindly? I doubt it.  Look, if he‚Äôs actually guilty of harassment, the law should punish him. No question about that. But until then, it‚Äôs not fair to publicly assassinate someone‚Äôs character based on one-sided claims. Social media is not a courtroom, and we shouldn‚Äôt let feelings override facts.|||:D|||https://www.facebook.com/share/1JV5hYfP6t/?mibextid=wwXIfr  don‚Äôt bully her. Only message her.

Leadership isn‚Äôt about hype, popularity, or being young and ‚Äúgreen.‚Äù It‚Äôs about surviving the chaos, making tough decisions, and knowing where the landmines are.

Even if they have the intention and will to do so (like many of us want), they do not know how to run a country. I see them as ineffective in running even a municipality (maybe that was because of politics and in-cooperation from party elected ward heads). The thing is they have a lot more to learn and they will, with time.       This situation would not have happened if there were transfer of power to youth in timely manner. Now the rising youth leaders do not have experience because these corrupt politicians did not allow that.      What we need is a system where corruption should now be absolutely dreaded, seeing how corrupt politicians had to run away for thier life. They have to realize that people will not just punish the corrupt polticians, they will also punish whoever was responsible to prevent that.       There now needs to be a collaborative development with young leaders like Balen and experienced people like Sushila.

I truly want Sushila Karki to be prime minister, but according to our constitution it's not possible. And if we ditch our constitution our country is open for invasion from other countries. So, what's the best option it's BALEN. I know that he won't be able to run for prime minister for the next election but it is a risk we have to take. It's already proven that our protest was the result of different politicians 'parties'involvement. So, let's play it safe and try to choose the best result for us. Already many Indian politicians are saying that they are ready to deploy an army if needed. It's not goodwill but an invasion. So it's best we know what we do for the country.  But if it's possible for her to be prime minister without disturbing our constitution then I'm all for it. I also want a good leader who will work for the development of the country.   Indian is already eyeing the district like Lipilekh and Limpadhura. If we take too long to make a responsible decision, they are favourites to win the case.   The country is already in chaos. So we must do our best to calm it down. We protested against corruption and got unexpected results. We are not ready for it. And we don't have time to think about it and make a decision. But, we must make a decision and make it work, isn't it all there is to it ?    It's not that I don't support \"Sushila Karki\" . She has my full support. But if it is disturbing our core rules set by our constitution. I just thought it isn't right. So it's my request all my fellow citizens ( not just gen-z ) to make a right decision.   But my final warning is that if we defy our current constitution ourselves. It will not be a suprise other countries take advantage of it. So we shall make a decision ourselves and take the best route possible. But you've my support to make her ( Sushila Karki) intrim prime minister. It is the best result seeing her experience on political field.   It might have been a bit long for the attention span of gen-z but i just want to say that, neither the constitution nor the national rules be any shorter üòä.

            "body": "Today, at Ratnapark overbridge, I met a beggar who changed the way I look at life.  He was sitting quietly, ignored by hundreds of people rushing past. His clothes were torn, his hands trembling his eyes tired. Something inside me made me stop. I gave him a packet of food and a bottle of water. He looked at me for a moment, and then his eyes filled with tears.  He whispered, ‚ÄúDai malai ta manchhe jasto ko bhav nai diyeko dherai din bhayo\" (Brother, it‚Äôs been so long since anyone treated me like a human)  I didn‚Äôt know what to say. That one sentence hit me harder than anything in my life. We complain about traffic, money, stress, politics but here was a man who just wanted to feel human again.  When I left, my hands were empty, but my heart was heavy. That day I realized poverty is not only about money. The biggest poverty is being unseen, unloved, and forgotten.  Ratnapark overbridge will never look the same to me again. Today, that beggar gave me more than I gave him. He gave me a reminder: be kind, because sometimes even a small smile can save someone‚Äôs broken soul.",

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.¬†¬† Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.¬†¬† Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||Jaha Bhetyo tehi thok saley madarchod lai...|||Aaos na india ma ni nepali xan birsyo kya|||Bro timro yo pic use garey haii Tiktok ma vid halchu|||kun desh jala teta bebasta garnu parxa|||yo machikne lai samatna paryo jasari bhaye ni yellai bachne kunai adhikar xaina|||Bhagey ra canada nai ja la, canada ma nee xodnu hudaina.

I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both.

She is the one who has been abroad for so long and has so many foreign connections and relations that even if she  doesn't want interference, there will be far more foreign interference with her as a leader.

BTW, Gen Z doesn‚Äôt just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didn‚Äôt exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who weren‚Äôt even present for the protests claim we don‚Äôt know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldn‚Äôt even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, ‚ÄòWe have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server you‚Äôre all listening to is just for public discussion‚Äô. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal. Now that it‚Äôs been confirmed everywhere and with Balen posting that the Gen Z‚Äôs choice former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Sushila Karki is the right choice for interim prime minister of Nepal, we look forward to what comes next.|||https://new-nepal-voting.vercel.app/  Vote here or suggest names I can add|||For interim formation CJ Sushila Karki would be the perfect choice.

Even when we look at history of the world, majority of peaceful protest start peaceful and end violently. No entity in power ever gives it up easily.  Change was what we asked for and change is what we are getting.

Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? I‚Äôve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we can‚Äôt let our nation fail.** We can‚Äôt let our nation burn. We can‚Äôt let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**¬†    **1) We lay down our weapons.**¬†  We came in peace, we protested in peace, and we‚Äôve always wanted peace.

The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.¬†    **3) We wear white.**¬†  White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that we‚Äôve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.¬†    **4) We have hope.**¬†  Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.¬†    Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.¬†    Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.¬†    Sincerely,¬†  Pantji, a Gen-Z¬†|||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us.

The president on her cabinet's recommendation dissolves the house of Representatives, 5. Her cabinet carries forward the corruption investigation and reconstruction. 6. The elections will be declared immediately. 7. The new parliament decides the constitutional amendments. (directly elected prime minister etc. and others ) 8.

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen.

One for the 165 candidates who are elected directly (first-past-the-post), other for the party. The votes that party gets determine the remaining 110 members via proportional representation.  so aba either we need new political parties to replace the existing ones by Falgun 21, or we have to vote for the same parties again. This is more complicated because Nepal is not just Kathmandu. The political players which we have termed jholey will be active outside Kathmandu.   So if we need the change in constitution, we have to be more careful. The mandates of the movement are more at risk now than before.",
