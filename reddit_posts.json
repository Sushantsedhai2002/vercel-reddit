Such changes takes ages and generations. Look at the current US, Europe and other top civilized countries...they are no different either.   While they all are no different, at least the karyakarta of these 'NEW' forces had the audacity of breaking out of the chains of Major political parties and confront them, which was almost IMPOSSIBLE before the era of Ujjwal Thapa/Balen.   2.

With all due respect to Sumana, she's a much needed breath of fresh air in Nepali politics, I have to disagree with her on one major thing.  She says Rabi needs to step down as RSP leader because she thinks that the best interest of the party and that's what people/youths want. That's where I think she's misunderstood and wrong.  From genZ upto the aged ones, most of them want Rabi in the leadership. That's why he got the highest number of votes among all leaders in the last election.  What I think is that Sumana saw many youth social media activists, who doesn't know politics and are misinformed and those who doesn't represent the overall youths of Nepal at all, they made video saying \"we don't want Rabi\", \"he's same old, corrupt\" which led to Sumana thinking Rabi isn't wanted by current youths and she need to get out of that party to be the voice of the youths.|||Balen ko party ma ‚Äú dudh le nuhayeka‚Äù manxe aaun subhakamana xa meroüòÇ, but sad thing balen le party hakna sakdaina and i guarantee he won‚Äôt be pm|||Good going on",

He has good PR team, and come out as chad, tara reality, nothing big as metropolitan project was successful. Bidhya sundar shakya was bad not denying it. but Balendra shah has achieved nothing than creating just polarization.  I would say Keshav sthapit was better mayor, corrupted for sure, talked shit,  but there were metropolitan level projects, was able to remove lots of house to create maitighar, was able to plan corridors, was able to expand roads networks. He was simply a better mayor. and was able to use all the budget of kathmandu budget.  I had high hopes for balen, specially with the transportation, but there has been nothing.",

We‚Äôre focusing on **efficiency**, **security**, and **user-centric designs**‚Äîsomething the government often lacks. * **Challenging the status quo**: Instead of waiting for change, we‚Äôre creating it ourselves. Maybe, just maybe, the **government will adopt** some of these open-source solutions down the road. * **Empowering the Nepali tech community** by creating projects that can be used for the public good‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs for elections, civic engagement, or improving government services. * **Fighting corruption with transparency**: Our goal is to build software that can **serve the people**, not just be controlled by a few. Every line of code you contribute brings us one step closer to a more accountable system.  You‚Äôll be making an impact **now and for the future**, not just on a personal level, but on the national scale!  # üõ†Ô∏è Get Involved:  Join our  **Discord server** : [https://discord.gg/GQGFKDAQ9b](https://discord.gg/GQGFKDAQ9b)   and Check out our **Github Repos**: [https://github.com/orgs/osnepal/repositories](https://github.com/orgs/osnepal/repositories)  and dive into open tasks. If you‚Äôre not sure where to start, drop a message in the server or DM me, and We‚Äôll guide you.  Together, we can build something truly impactful‚Äîlet‚Äôs start with the tech that the **government should‚Äôve built**! üí™  Looking forward to your contributions!",

You aren't using consistent fonts too. Also try to use a color palette and stick to it for some time. Tei ho main chai.|||1. Make the book the focal point, find some mockups, Take better photos, maybe remove the bg and better position the book    2. Don't block the text with arrow, idk why you did that to begin with.   3. The title on the right side is off putting, Make sure both title and thumbnail work on their own.   4. The hard white inner shadow on the text with the red and the bright laptop screen makes it too noisy, The viewer wont know where to focus.   cont. 1 and 4, You could better position the book and blur the background with the book in the middle with 1-4 words clean font and styling.

Every organ of government is politically captured. Courts, police are all deeply infiltrated. We can't trust them. They will try to stall corruption investigation and after 6 months torch findings of investigation committee.   Our courts will fail us, so I urge everyone to submit evidence of crimes against humanity on Gen Z protestors. This has been done successfully before against Duterte.   The International Criminal Court (ICC) can be invoked in situations where a country's own justice system is unable or unwilling to investigate and prosecute serious crimes. Here‚Äôs how this works:  # 1. Complementarity Principle  * The ICC operates on the principle of¬†**complementarity**, meaning it can only intervene when national courts are unable or unwilling to genuinely carry out investigations or prosecutions. If a country‚Äôs judicial system is compromised (e.g., due to corruption, political interference, or lack of independence), this principle may allow for ICC involvement.  # 2. Types of Situations  * The ICC can be invoked for serious crimes such as:    * **Genocide**    * **War Crimes**    * **Crimes Against Humanity** * If these crimes are occurring and the national system is failing to address them, the ICC may have jurisdiction.  # 3. Filing a Communication  * Individuals or organizations can file a communication with the ICC, detailing the situation and providing evidence of the crimes committed. This communication should emphasize the failure of the national justice system to act.  # 4. Preliminary Examination  * Upon receiving the communication, the ICC Prosecutor will conduct a preliminary examination to assess whether the situation warrants an investigation. This includes evaluating:    * The gravity of the alleged crimes    * The willingness and ability of the national authorities to investigate  # 5. Referral by States or the UN  * A state party to the Rome Statute or the United Nations Security Council can also refer a situation to the ICC. This can be a powerful way to invoke the ICC's jurisdiction, especially if the national system is failing.  A normal individual can file a complaint with the International Criminal Court (ICC), but there are specific procedures and requirements to follow. Here‚Äôs how an individual can file a case:  # Steps to File a Complaint with the ICC  # 1. Understand the Jurisdiction  * Ensure that the situation falls under the ICC's jurisdiction, which includes crimes such as genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. The ICC can only prosecute individuals for crimes committed in countries that are party to the Rome Statute or referred by the United Nations Security Council.  # 2. Gather Evidence  * Collect all relevant evidence that supports your claim. This may include:    * Witness statements    * Documents    * Photographs or videos    * Any other material that can substantiate the allegations  # 3. Prepare a Communication  * Draft a communication to the ICC. This should include:    * A clear description of the alleged crimes    * The individuals or groups responsible    * The context of the situation    * Any evidence you have gathered  # 4. Submit the Communication  * Send your communication to the ICC Office of the Prosecutor. This can typically be done via email or postal mail. The contact details can be found on the ICC's official website.  # 5. Await Preliminary Examination  * After submission, the ICC Prosecutor will conduct a preliminary examination to determine if there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation. This process can take time, and the Prosecutor may reach out for additional information.  # 6. Follow Up  * You may follow up on the status of your communication, but be aware that the ICC may not provide detailed updates due to confidentiality and legal protocols.     # 1. **Definition of Crimes Against Humanity**  * **Crimes against humanity**¬†are defined under international law, particularly in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC). They include acts such as murder, extermination, and other inhumane acts committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population.  # 2. Responsibility of Officials  * In cases where government officials, such as a Prime Minister or Home Minister, give orders that lead to unlawful killings, they can be held accountable. This includes:    * **Direct Orders**: If an official directly orders the police to shoot to kill, they can be personally liable.    * **Complicity**: Other officials, including members of the cabinet, may also be held accountable if they were aware of the order and did not act to prevent it.  # 3. Collective Responsibility  * If the entire cabinet was present during the meeting and did not oppose the order, they could potentially share responsibility. However, legal accountability often depends on the specific roles and actions of each individual.  # Who Can Be Arrested?  # 1. Prime Minister  * The Prime Minister can be arrested if there is sufficient evidence that they issued the order and that it constitutes a crime against humanity.  # 2. Home Minister  * The Home Minister, if involved in the order or its execution, can also be arrested.  # 3. Cabinet Members  * Other cabinet members may be arrested if they had knowledge of the order and failed to act against it. Their level of involvement and responsibility would be assessed based on the evidence.  # 4. Police Officers  * Officers who carried out the order to shoot to kill could also face charges, especially if they acted unlawfully.|||üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ|||Wasn't this answer for, why you left Sisan Baniya?|||![gif](giphy|ALtzQ6CHfC7vO5nRz7)|||You don't need to be sorry|||LMAO üòÇ|||couldn't control my laugh!!!|||This hit so hard :D|||Acting Award ‡§â‡§®‡§≤‡§æ‡§à ‡§ú‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§õ‡•§ Manipulator /‡§ö‡§æ‡§≤‡§¨‡§æ‡§ú One more __>>> Money.....money.....money......üí∞|||![gif](giphy|lYXhWufNZEaQg)|||Tax  tirena  tetro paisa ko|||I can vouch  For lips  (vs to brother of sister)|||wtf  and that expression (etrai xa)  hahahahahah fuck man|||Dear brother, real account bata aaunus",

They are opportunists who hid when it mattered and only came out when the fight was over.  During the Gen-Z protest, when young people were literally putting themselves on the line, these two were silent. They didn‚Äôt risk anything. They didn‚Äôt stand with the people. They were invisible. And yet, the moment it ended, they suddenly began giving interviews, calling themselves ‚ÄúGen-Z leaders‚Äù and ‚Äúrepresentatives.‚Äù That‚Äôs not just dishonest,  it‚Äôs disgraceful.  Now compare them to **Ashika Tamang**. She isn‚Äôt even Gen-Z, yet she showed up, stood strong, and helped when the movement needed voices the most. She had the courage that so-called Gen-Z ‚Äúleaders‚Äù lacked. Think about that, someone outside our generation had more backbone than the people pretending to speak for it.  That‚Äôs the difference between real courage and cheap opportunism. Ashika Tamang earned respect. Miraj Dhungana and Rabi Kiran Hamal earned nothing but shame.  History will not remember them as leaders, only as cowards who tried to hijack a movement they never had the guts to join.  Gen-Z doesn‚Äôt need parasites like them. We already proved who the real leaders are, the ones who were in the streets when it counted.",

Then the Indian businessmen can take that NPR to NRB and get back INR or USD. If you are doing business with someone who does not accept NPR at all, you can go to NRB yourself and ask them to convert your NPR to USD.  NRB has the dollars from exports, remittance and tourism. As long as it doesn't run out, it can keep the peg stable, i.e. keep the market saturated with practically infinite demand and supply at the fixed rate that it has set. NRB could choose another peg if it wanted. All it has to do is either buy back the NPR more aggressively if it wants to increase the price of NPR or not buy NPR for a while and let it slide as much as it wants. And NRB can choose to not peg at all. But that's only a good idea for big, strong and stable economies. Even countries like India, China and Brazil have their central banks interfere in the market to maintain a certain value or range. But their currency has higher demand, so they only need to interfere once in a while. Our currency has no demand internationally, so NRB has to constantly trade the currency to maintain the peg.|||It's not India pedding Nepali Rupee to Indian Rupee, it's Nepal's Rastra Bank pegging Nepali rupee to Indian rupee. And Nepal is using its USD reserve and other Foreign Currency Reserves to maintain that balance.  Read this: [https://www.nrb.org.np/contents/uploads/2019/12/Economic\\_Review\\_Occasional\\_Paper-No\\_13Probability\\_of\\_Adjustments.pdf](https://www.nrb.org.np/contents/uploads/2019/12/Economic_Review_Occasional_Paper-No_13Probability_of_Adjustments.pdf)  Go to page 2, 3rd paragraph:      >In April 13, 1960 the Nepalese Government adopted the policy of unlimited convertibility of Nepalese Currency (NC) to IC in Nepal.1 The pegged exchange rate between Nepal and India has existed for over forty years  And please help stop this misinformation/propaganda|||Its 100% true.|||That's very true if it wasn't a locked currency we would have been doomed.|||Nepal Rastra Bank is the one that decided to peg the Nepali Rupee to the Indian Rupee. but for the peg to work smoothly, India has to agree to exchange Nepali currency and maintain open trade/banking links.|||Remindme! 1Day|||Pegging? Damnn i have a dirty mind|||It's 50:50. India isn't losing anything by letting Nepal pegging it's currency. All they have to do is let their currency go around freely. They are also benefiting from it.   It makes Nepal their one of the biggest trade partner.  This indian pretending to be nepali is a dkhead.  Nepal isn't living in favour. Many Nepalese are in India, they are working their ass off, they are contributing to their economy. Many students are studying their, again they are paying them, working there so its a mutual.   Most of the things are imported in Nepal from India, due to geology of Nepal. Again they are earning shit load of money from it. Almost everything is mutual.  I don't want to be hating on india. But if giving jobs and all those things to another country makes father of one, then indias mother must have been fked by the whole world, they are everywhere literally in the world. Ik 1-2% Indians are good people so i will stop here.|||![gif](giphy|wGhYz3FHaRJgk)|||It really depends. Sooner or later someone is going to take advantage. Check what George Soros did when UK pegged it‚Äôs currency. I am surprised no one has done it.|||1) NPR pegged to indian rupee   2) $18bn+ in foreign reserves    3) remittance  these are the reson why we havent ended up like poor african country|||Bullshit. Vietnam currency, Indonesian currency Ra south Korean win is proper example against pegging.|||[removed]",

Every politicians are coming back like it was never happened ani haami ? Haami pani kei na kei !!|||What happened to the Deuba family wasn‚Äôt just unfair‚Äîit was an orchestrated humiliation carried out in the most cowardly way possible. Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not ‚Äúrevolution,‚Äù it‚Äôs not ‚Äújustice,‚Äù and it sure as hell isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe voice of the people.‚Äù It‚Äôs mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn‚Äôt make you brave‚Äîit makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that‚Äîsurrounded by a wave of so-called ‚Äúyouths‚Äù who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let‚Äôs not sugarcoat it‚Äîthe so-called Gen Z ‚Äúwarriors‚Äù hiding in the mob weren‚Äôt heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country‚Äôs social fabric. He still can‚Äôt step foot in certain countries because he‚Äôs internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he‚Äôs propped up as a ‚Äúleader.‚Äù  Let‚Äôs be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn‚Äôt an accident‚Äîit was a setup. While Deuba‚Äôs family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don‚Äôt get it twisted‚Äîthose sharpshooters in the crowd weren‚Äôt just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres‚Äîformer insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let‚Äôs stop pretending this was ‚Äúthe people rising up.‚Äù It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist‚Äîthe one who drowned this nation in blood‚Äîwalks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don‚Äôt for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn‚Äôt that Deuba suffered humiliation‚Äîthe real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn‚Äôt a flower; he‚Äôs a weed choking the soil of Nepal‚Äôs democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too na√Øve to realize they‚Äôre being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||Prachanda and Baburam are India's puppet.

            "body": "The country is burning, and Shrinkhala uploaded a 34 minute PR reel. I just finished watching 11 minutes of the 34 long video Shrinkhala Khatiwada uploaded to ‚Äúexplain her silence‚Äù and I had to stop, not because I was bored, but because it was painful to watch someone so out of touch, so self-absorbed, and so deep into their own victim complex that they‚Äôve become completely blind to reality. I‚Äôm making this post and hoping people don‚Äôt fall for the carefully packaged sob story. First off is the immediate red flag that there is zero acknowledgment of her privilege. She talks about having a simple life, and claims her parents worked hard for her and her brother. That they had a house with 3 bedrooms, didn‚Äôt have to pay rent, had a good upbringing and she still thinks that counts as simple. And that‚Äôs the only privilege she‚Äôs ever had. That alone shows how detached she is from what ‚Äúaverage‚Äù really means in Nepal. She never even briefly reflects on the fact that her father is a powerful politician, and instead, she makes it sound like she built her life from scratch. It‚Äôs baffling.  She genuinely believes her name shouldn‚Äôt have been dragged into any of the national discourse and says that people were using her name just to get content and she literally says something along the lines of, if people got attention that way, ‚Äúso be it.‚Äù That‚Äôs her takeaway. The entire nation is in shambles, people are angry, protesting, waking up to decades of injustice and she still can't look beyond her own image. It's almost unbelievable how someone can watch a country crumble and somehow make it all about themselves. She positions herself as the one being targeted ‚Äúfor no reason‚Äù and says she wanted to fight back but was too overwhelmed by people turning against her. Again, not a word about why people might be justifiably critical, just a one-sided narrative of being attacked unfairly.  She says TikTok posts were changing the narrative of her entire life. But does she stop for a second to reflect on why people are questioning her? No. Instead, she keeps doubling down on this idea that she‚Äôs misunderstood, and that her critics are just trying to take her down for no reason. There is no realization that being the daughter of a well-known and allegedly corrupt politician is a reason why people hold you accountable especially when you‚Äôve benefitted from that influence. That‚Äôs not defamation. That‚Äôs public scrutiny. Then comes the part where she calls herself ‚Äúself-made.‚Äù And at that point, I had to pause and ask how? You‚Äôre born into a powerful and connected family. You have access to platforms, resources, and networks that most Nepalis can‚Äôt even dream of. And yet here you are, trying to claim some underdog story? She goes on to brag about her accomplishments, how she‚Äôs made so much money, and how people apparently can‚Äôt handle the fact that someone as young as her is so successful. As if that‚Äôs why people are questioning her. No, Shrinkhala, people aren‚Äôt criticizing you because you‚Äôre young and successful. They‚Äôre angry because you‚Äôre trying to rewrite your origin story while skipping over the very privileges that made your success possible.  She even says she never felt the need to justify herself to anyone before because ‚Äúsatya ko saath cha.‚Äù That‚Äôs when I realized how deep her delusion runs. She genuinely believes she‚Äôs standing on moral high ground, and yet her video is filled with nothing but self-praise, image management, and emotional manipulation. She talks about being ‚Äúsatya‚Äù while ignoring every contradiction, every unfulfilled promise, and every instance where she stayed silent when it mattered. Then she says if she doesn‚Äôt defend herself, then ‚Äúthe rest of the world will write her narrative.‚Äù Again, it‚Äôs about her. Not the truth, not justice, not accountability, not the people, but her narrative. The country is collapsing under the weight of corruption, and her priority is that her public image might be misunderstood. She even says her future generations will suffer if she doesn‚Äôt clear her image like that‚Äôs the greatest injustice here. Not the looted resources, not the betrayed citizens, but her family name. She thanks those who ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt unfollow her‚Äù and those who supported her privately. That‚Äôs her criteria for support which is social media metrics. Then she starts talking about her life story, narrates her autobiography, and once again, takes the opportunity to list her accomplishments and how she was a topper, won design competitions, etc. But does she ever stop to think about why she got those platforms? Does she reflect on how being a politician‚Äôs daughter might have given her access others don‚Äôt have? Of course not. Instead, she paints herself as someone with a ‚Äúsmall-town mindset‚Äù while talking about winning designer competitions. How many small-town Nepalis get to do that? There‚Äôs such a massive contradiction in her story, and she doesn‚Äôt even seem to see it.  She even says ‚Äúma maa nai kei kami thiyo hola‚Äù and tries to sound reflective, but it‚Äôs just another way to victimize herself. As if people criticizing her now are just reinforcing her lifelong feeling of being ‚Äúnot enough.‚Äù Then she addresses people who accuse her of not following through on the promises and ideals she expressed during Miss Nepal. And honestly, that criticism is completely valid. If you stood on a national stage making tall claims about development and change, then yes, people will hold you accountable. That‚Äôs not trolling. That‚Äôs responsibility. And finally, the most absurd part that she says she never had any power. How? You were Miss Nepal and are one of the most followed influencers in the country, daughter of a powerful political figure, a Harvard graduate. And you don‚Äôt have power? Then who does? If you truly believe you never had any power to make a difference, then what was the point of all the public positioning, speeches, and social impact projects? That‚Äôs not humility. That‚Äôs denial.  She tries to play down her travel experiences too. Says that before Miss Nepal, she had only been to India, and that‚Äôs ‚Äúnot an achievement,‚Äù and that her Hong Kong trip immediately after the pageant was the only international travel till then. Then she brings up her UK trip, saying it was funded by youth, and she didn‚Äôt really get to enjoy it because she was only there for work, so apparently, that doesn‚Äôt count as privilege either. Every step of the way, she undermines and downplays her privilege, refuses to acknowledge her advantages, and continues to position herself as a victim. And all of this? Is just the first 11 minutes. I honestly couldn‚Äôt keep watching. It became clear very quickly that this wasn‚Äôt a sincere explanation. It was a 34 minute long PR video just to clear her image, filled with narcissistic reflections, gaslighting, and image control disguised as vulnerability. I really hope people don‚Äôt fall for victimized narrative. Please don‚Äôt.",

Like cleaning garbage on the street or starting a free tuition for street children. We should make heroes of those ordinary people. We should also start questioning our perception of beauty. Why is Shrinkhala Khadka considered *anything*? Is she physically appealing or sexually affable or glamorous? Why should she have *any* followers, to begin with? Then we should start questioning the perception of our 'beauty standard'. Why should only fair skinned, better looking people get millions of followers. It's not going to be easy but we should always question. If we play the same pop culture game and dig deep into how propaganda and algo can be manipulated then we can perhaps start asking questions like the way you have did.   It's not easy because it's a biased platform where heritage money and incumbent power are in bed with the forces of propaganda (e.g. Insta algorithm). Its a hard battle to win.

Like I can‚Äôt even fathom the level of self-victimisation that she is doing. 72 people lost their life in this demonstration and somehow you want to make it about yourself!! Look at the videos from Pashupatinath the eyes of the parents and the pain you can see. Like how the fuck did you make this whole movement about yourself! Pathetic and Diabolical..|||[deleted]|||Request to OP: I have not watched the Excel Kanda at all and i don't plan to. But I would watch or hear your complete breakdown of the whole video even if its 1 hour longer.   Great breakdown. My reasoning to not watch her sob story is the same as yours (at least i believe its similar). I find it repulsive because it seems to have zero validity to the pedestal she was on. From some brief clips, she went to Harvard? How is that simple, humble or average? Internship of her own studies in Spain?? Good for her. Impressive. But addressing all the accomplishments on what is supposed to be her response? I dont get it.|||I watched the video too and disagree. Whatever she is, she is not a criminal. There are way worse people than her in Nepal. In my view, arson who damaged the private and public properties are way worse than her and legally criminals. Similarly, there are better faces of nepo babies - the OG nepo baby, the ex-king.  I am saddened that there is no empathy. Literally, her house was burned down by an angry mob. Have some empathy.  Nepal has systematic corruption at every level. Everyone has either given or taken bribes.  There are minimal financial opportunities within Nepal. It makes financially more sense for an honest person to seek employment abroad. By destroying businesses and targeting the elites, the country will witness even less investment. It needs money to create investments for more jobs. Ironic thing was people who protested showed their own corruption by looting private companies - which again legally is a crime.   If I can have empathy for arsons and thieves who destroyed and looted public and private properties, have some empathy for another Nepali who was threatened and attacked viciously online just for being more successful than most people.|||If you guys really think she got what she deserved - having her old parents house. And her husband‚Äôs business burned. And her image destroyed like this.  If you think this is justice you guys are cruel as f.

You took the words out of my mouth. Watching few mins of the video made me realise how out of touch, self- victimised and narcissism runs so deep. Not once did she mention about the victims and what the families of the martyrs had to go through, it was all her image.

She won many competitions in school , always an A student , won beauty pageant because she deserved it . Not because she was some politicians daughter. The majority of the people didn‚Äôt even know who her father is . It‚Äôs easy to blame her , easy to hate her now , but that‚Äôs the sad part of brainwashed social media freaks who are on their phones 24-7 . Her point was that she never lived a luxurious life until she was Miss Nepal , because that‚Äôs the truth . Weren‚Äôt people blaming her for living off tax payers money ? That‚Äôs why she is defending it with proof . When the whole nation attacks you , questions your integrity it‚Äôs natural to be defensive . I‚Äôm not against you or her , I am just saying she is not going to say 100% of what you all wanna hear . She is human , she gave her reason as to the reason why didn‚Äôt speak up as she was targeted with so much hate and rape threats. And the privilege you‚Äôre talking about , would have probably agreed with you if you were talking about Jayvir guy. ¬†But why aren‚Äôt people targeting him as well . Most of the nepokids or so called elite people don‚Äôt even know a world outside of Kathmandu , can‚Äôt speak fluent Nepali . People connected with Shrinkhala from the beginning because she spoke like one of us , was grounded . And this whole point of not acknowledging her privilege . What part of privilege she used to win Miss Nepal ? Anybody can participate in the pageant - regardless of who your parents are . It‚Äôs easy to pinpoint others, especially a public figure , especially a woman public figure , and you know it‚Äôs so easy to spread negativity. And at this time when the whole comment section is flown with negative comments about her , you expect her to say all the Right words , sentences - who are you all ? Can you all focus on how better you can be as human beings instead of being so wild in this game ? Haven‚Äôt you never made a mistake in your life ? What good are you getting in being so critical of another public figure and expecting her to say all the right things that belongs to your narrative. Nobody is perfect . Time will always reveal the truth . Stop spreading negative. If people wanna like her support her , let them . If you don‚Äôt , just stop spreading hate - it only drains you man¬†|||I don't quite know what Gen Z's problem is with Shrinkhala.. we ourselves loved her, we voted for her, we spent our money to send her to international platforms, we cheered for her success. And then she did succeed. She made millions as a result through brands, sponsorships, youtube, etc. If anything she is a smart business woman who capitalized her fame into actual money. Then she got married to the son of Kantipur. She goes on expensive foreign trips with him. She is the daughter-in-law of the most influential media company.  What is really our problem with her? What do we want from her? Are we jealous she became rich and famous? Are we mad at her because both her parents are CPN UML politicians? Are we mad at her for marrying with a rich guy? Are we mad at her because she carried around an expensive label bag? Are we mad at her because she did not single handedly end corruption like she said she wanted to 10 years back in a fucking beauty pageant? What do you want Shrinkhala to tell the world? Yes she is privileged? Yes she married into a well-off family? Yes she went to Harvard?   What is it really? We need to be really clear about these conversations first before dragging someone down.|||Enough has been said about this girl.

They will come back and try to do everything possible to regain their power.   Instead of being discouraged by their appearance we can get ourselves involved in more and more constructive dialogue and create a scenario where they will not be back again from the next election. Engage in political debate. Spread words. More intellectual discuss will help create a \"vibe\" when they will find hard to regain power. We can never demand so and so person or party should not participate in election or use their constitutional rights. So them trying to resurface and whitewash their image is normal.

Yet, even after all this time, I still carry deep respect and pride for the land I came from. But watching this horrific video of a mob savagely beating an elderly man and his wife left me utterly speechless. Regardless of what the couple may have been involved in or accused of, nothing justifies such cruelty.  I thought Nepali men were the descendants of the brave Gurkhas‚Äîwarriors respected and admired worldwide for their courage and honor. Instead, I saw a man sucker punch a woman who wasn‚Äôt even facing him. That wasn‚Äôt bravery‚Äîit was pure cowardice. And the chaos that followed‚Äîhundreds of people raiding and looting their home under the excuse of ‚Äújustice‚Äù‚Äîwasn‚Äôt justice at all. That mob was just as corrupt and criminally responsible as the very people they claimed to oppose. They were not upholding the law; they were exploiting the breakdown of law and order to terrorize and humiliate helpless individuals.  But this rot doesn‚Äôt stop with the mob. The government, too, is guilty. Innocent children were killed during the protests, yet there has been no true accountability. Those in power‚Äîthe Prime Minister, the Home Minister, and the security forces‚Äîbear responsibility for those heinous crimes. They were entrusted with protecting the people, but instead, they used their authority to spill the blood of innocents.  So when I look at this situation, I see two sides of the same coin: mobs acting as judge, jury, and executioner in the streets, and leaders hiding behind power while allowing or even enabling violence against their own citizens. Both are forms of terrorism, both have destroyed public trust, and both have crippled the very soul of Nepal.  And if this mob truly represents the next generation‚Äîif this is the standard of ‚Äújustice‚Äù that today‚Äôs youth believe in‚Äîthen Nepal‚Äôs future is not just uncertain, it is in grave danger. Because a society that celebrates cowardice, looting, and lawlessness, while a government escapes accountability for killing its own children, is a society heading toward doom.|||you guys wanted monarchy?????????|||Sorry to say but OP have a very stu*id understanding of how andolan and its aftermath unfolds.

Similarly, reports and videos from Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda's' house indicated the presence of significant unexplained cash. The key question isn't the exact amount, but how sitting public officials could legally possess such large sums of foreign currency. This demands an immediate and independent investigation into the source of these funds.

Okay, I get that the police had given up. However, the police are now back in power.  Why has no one even talked about arresting them?  Forget the corruption charges; just finding the money alone in their homes should have been enough to jail them.  Why has it not happened?  And why are we being misled?

But if these fuckers don't come into action within this week, we have to start the protests again.  Please let me know what you think.  \\[Edit\\]  Look, guys, say what you want, maybe the numbers are off, but everyone knows these fuckers are guilty. The real question is: why are we still pretending otherwise?  Calling me a capper doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Nepal‚Äôs leaders sit on wealth no ordinary citizen could ever justify. Since when did speaking the truth become the thing people attack? Oh, right, since forever.  What matters now is not nitpicking figures, but demanding accountability.

Congratulations on your successes. I hope your life continues to be very rich in experiences and opportunity.|||This kind of post rubs me the wrong way a bit because it feels like you‚Äôre trying to position yourself as ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù or ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than the people who went abroad. The reality is that both paths, either staying in Nepal or going abroad, have their own pros and cons, and people choose based on circumstances that are often very different from yours.  You mention being financially independent, investing early, and balancing work with studies. That‚Äôs impressive, but it‚Äôs also a privilege many don‚Äôt have. Plenty of sons and daughters in Nepal are grinding just to pay off family debts or keep their households afloat. For them, going abroad isn‚Äôt about ‚Äúhype‚Äù but it‚Äôs about survival, opportunity, or helping their families. Even the ability to invest in NEPSE in the first place points to a cleaner starting slate than what a lot of others face.  And while you thrived staying in Nepal, not everyone has that option. Families who send their kids abroad are often taking huge risks and sacrifices, sometimes from already fragile financial situations. Even if someone goes abroad and struggles at first, starting from zero (or even from debt) can eventually set them up for long-term security that wouldn‚Äôt be possible back home.  So yes, it‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre making it work in Nepal, but framing it in a way that hints at looking down on people who go abroad ignores the complexity of their decisions and struggles.|||Simple answer for you it is not same for every one.|||I knew a guy like you who didn't go abroad when he was 22.

Few lakhs is not a big problem for me so I always have that assurance that I can take care of my family if needed. I am also less worried about kids, as they will have better opportunity for everything. Government supports health and education, and only fooding and clothing them is what I have to worry about. They also have opportunity to grow in a better society free from caste and religion based nonsense so they can actually focus on things that matter. Its much easier for them to travel anywhere in the world because the passport is much stronger. So overall I can take care of my parents and give a better start to my kids, which makes me content.

Even if it's just about money, I have friends who have amassed more in 5 years working here in US as a software engineer than we'd have in Nepal whole life - more than enough to comfortably retire back home.  I have friends who moved solely because they were fed up with the beurocracy of everything in Nepal - from government offices to family events.  I have friends whose primary factor was to lead a life distant from the toxicity of their family.  I have seen people pursue hobbies far beyond what Nepal could offer.   I have seen people move just to give their children better education.  There are a host of reasons. And you could debate each one individually, but it's all subjective anyway. For many including myself, it's a mix of reasons. While I know people who don't have it easy and working tirelessly as you said, I don't know anyone who'd prefer to move back unless they were forced to.|||I emigrated 25 years ago. 10 years of that was hardcore pain.

Bidesh is worth your skill and knowledge so absolutely  unique experience for everyone.|||I didn't have a choice but to stay in Nepal. My family wasn't in the financial position to send me abroad. I didn't ponder in remorse, but told myself- if I have to stay here, let's try. I had a good career, I was happy even though I didn't get paid a lot of pay. I managed my finances, got two degrees, and lived a modest life. I climbed the ladder swiftly, but then hit a peak.   I anticipated rapid economic regression in Nepal, so I decided to leave the country. I am pursuing my third degree, in a subject that I absolutely love in the US. It's barely been a year, and I have seen such a pivotal shift in my perspective, and I always ask myself, \"What if I had been able to expose myself to this standard of education and community?\"    Nepal is great, if you want an easy-paced life but there's so much more out here, a lot more.

In Nepal, survival and a better future are manageable if your family is financially stable and owns a house in Kathmandu. Living here then allows you to pursue anything. But for those from outside the valley without a steady family income, it becomes very difficult.

I left Nepal when I was way past my teenage years. Even though I am not as happy or rather don't have peaceful mind as I would hope for, my decision to leave Nepal was a good call! I should have left Nepal a few years before I eventually did.   Going abroad is definitely good and I suggest everyone to do so once in their life time; however, how long to stay is up for debate. I would rather emphasize on THE purpose. I left Nepal because I couldn't stand to live in Nepal. I am poorer than the most of my old friends who stayed in Nepal. Spiritually and mentally, I am as fucked up as before, which was something I thought I would get over by moving abroad.       However, I have a hope and \"I can do\" mentality. I HIGHLY appreciate the way I think these days mixed with whatever I had learned back in Nepal and the new things in this new environment. I wouldn't give this away for any price! (well a few million dollars might do the trick :D )      Thing is, we tend to have this bias that the things that are familiar to us and we identify with always seem better and superior to others. One should come out of it to see how things actually are. Hence, staying abroad is a must! It provides options and more importantly new perspectives on everything!|||Oh my god, so much hate here. ‚Äú not everyone is like you ‚Äú , ‚Äú you are lucky ‚Äú  What a bunch of bullshit. I am happy for you and i have a lot of friends in nepal earning as much as me ( i am in Australia rn ). You are doing great   Meanwhile i have hardly any savings. Life abroad is tough, the standard of living in western countries ( Australia included ) is on a decline. If you already have a house in Nepal, you are better off back home.  If i could work in nepal and earn half of what i earn now, my life will still be more luxurious in Nepal.   The only challenge is, one has to be highly skilled. I don‚Äôt think i am skilled enough to secure the same kinda role back home but when i am , i will definitely return.  Most Nepalese here do degrading stuff for work. ü§¢ü§Æ. The only reason people want to go abroad is that they are not skilled enough and are willing to do anything for money.   Nepal doesn‚Äôt have a problem with brain drain, cus people with brains are not the ones going abroad to clean toilets, cus they don‚Äôt have to.  The smart ones are able to survive in Nepal.  I am lucky that i come from a well off family and didn‚Äôt have do low level work for money, but i am  as dumb as them for sure.

This narrative that communism brings misery to all and maybe inequality is the 'natural' way of things. While I don't support yemale, maobadi -- they are as neoliberal or more than congress-- using this to attack on the communism as ideology is also unfair. Just like you can not judge Gen Z for some hijacking their protest, you can also not judge communism because imperialist forces are also hijacking any attempt of a communist state. There are also several nuances -- of course USSR - say a *proper* implementation gave rise to famine (holodomar) and a lot of bloodshed, it also improved the lives of regular peasants. I was reading the accounts of the family who moved from absolute shanks to one bedroom apartments. Plus, there can be a lot of concessions and modifications -¬† like China for example moved it's modality to state sponsored capitalism -- of course it's a surveillance state and state is overarching (one child policy) but the improvement in standard of living and progress in society (healthcare and education) is out there. And also to blame famine and bloodshed in communism is also seeing reality with only one tainted lenses -- potato famine in Ireland, Churchill's starvation of Bengalis).

It's embarrassing all of this has been addressed 150 years ago and everyone is divided with cold war misinformation which is now mainstream knowledge.   https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/   Or summary video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEA_7HpLG8c   By this, I don't mean you should be subservient to your fake communist party, who doesn't even introduce basic theory to the curriculum. I wonder why..... They embraced neoliberalism which is inherently anti communist and brings misfortune. They are not interested in worker empowerment. The choice of taking the path of socialism vs capitalism is like not choosing brands of chocolate, but it's like a choice between monarchy and modernity. They are not on the same plane. Capitalism was revolutionary compared to feudalism at the time, but everyone's material conditions around the world today are deteriorating real fast because of profit > people and many are coming to the same conclusion either by learning or economic desperation. This is why fascism is on the rise to \"bring back order\" to a failed system riddled with core contradictions that cannot be reconciled.   Freedom under capitalism is freedom for capital owners, it doesn't work if everyone has a basic level of economic security by virtue of access to means of production.   I also know capitalist bad actors preemptively try to delegitimize and mock the idea. They did the same with slavery, and with monarchies, and now with capitalism. In reality, the path is clear, you just have to keep learning, keep organizing and keep pushing through.|||What an stupid framing? Nepal is truly blessed with low iq goodness.|||I'm a pro capitalist myself, but here's my take on why this is the case in Nepal (copied from another post of mine):  You see the problem with rich in the context of Nepal (and any underdeveloped nation) is that being filthy rich out of nowhere is almost always impossible. This is because in an underdeveloped economy, there isn't much consumer needs that you can solve which creates more value which makes you rich. The economy and society isn't sophisticated enough.  So, most of the rich people you see are mostly old money folks who were close to the monarchy, who got rich from the new political system, and that compounded with them owning land in the most important parts of the country.  Now, a select few being able to magically earn more (due to the land value appreciation) sitting idle while rest of the country has to work hard to earn some fraction of that is unfair, irrational, and unsustainable from a system design perspective.  This is contrary to what happens in a developed nation like America, where anyone can go and establish a billion dollar business by figuring out an emerging need and solving for it in the mesh of that sophisticated and good spending society.|||The earlier people in their 20s realize that communism doesn‚Äôt actually exist, the better. Many think calling themselves communist is cool, philosophical, and a stand for equality, but the truth is that communism has only ever lived in theories, never in real practice. Every so-called communist state eventually turned authoritarian or adapted to markets, and today the entire world has moved toward mixed economies‚Äîa balance of capitalism for growth and socialism for welfare. What sounds ideal in books is far from reality, and understanding this early saves a lot of misplaced idealism.|||The only true communist you speak of is china who has successfully implemented its concept( although there is still corruption they neutralise it instantly if found guilty unlike our country)Rest country who has adopted it has just formulated it in surface to show illusions in the eye of dumbass public like us in nepal.

Yes become rich i dont mind but if you buy crores of property even though you have just stepped into financial field itself is a red flag. Nobody can generate that much profit in mere 1- 2 years. So yeah become rich but in legit manner which will probably take you 10- 12 years minimum not like these fuckers maoist amale congress who just comes into parliament and boom 10 ropanies 12 ropanies of land bought 5 crores vehicle bought son and daughter in foreign universities admitted where even the business man of that country has to work their ass off to pay the cost.

I'm against Communism - as I believe Socialism could be a potential solution.

Communist ideology looks good in theory but nature itself is capitalist, even ants collect their food before rain, and whoever will work hard will collect more.

With all due respect to Sumana, she's a much needed breath of fresh air in Nepali politics, I have to disagree with her on one major thing.  She says Rabi needs to step down as RSP leader because she thinks that the best interest of the party and that's what people/youths want. That's where I think she's misunderstood and wrong.  From genZ upto the aged ones, most of them want Rabi in the leadership. That's why he got the highest number of votes among all leaders in the last election.  What I think is that Sumana saw many youth social media activists, who doesn't know politics and are misinformed and those who doesn't represent the overall youths of Nepal at all, they made video saying \"we don't want Rabi\", \"he's same old, corrupt\" which led to Sumana thinking Rabi isn't wanted by current youths and she need to get out of that party to be the voice of the youths.|||Balen ko party ma ‚Äú dudh le nuhayeka‚Äù manxe aaun subhakamana xa meroüòÇ, but sad thing balen le party hakna sakdaina and i guarantee he won‚Äôt be pm|||Good going on",

The post was originally made by some guy who happens to be an editor at RONB. His perspective was that we could appoint Sushila Karki as the Prime Minister of Nepal in the same way Khilraj Regmi was appointed in 2061. He was sure that it‚Äôs still possible without compromising the constitution‚Äîwhich I seriously doubt.  I commented that it was the Interim Constitution that allowed such provisions, but our 2072 Constitution clearly states that it‚Äôs not possible. I suggested that there might be other ways to achieve something similar. My friend, who happens to be blindly faithful toward RONB, texted me and lashed out: How can you say such things? How do you even have this kind of knowledge? Who taught you to talk like this? You don‚Äôt know shit, and you don‚Äôt know better than the editor of RONB.  At that very moment, I was angry, but I still tried to make her listen to the audio text I sent, where I explained some alternatives. She wasn‚Äôt ready to listen or even consider another perspective. I mean, the audacity of that bitch‚Äîshe blocked me without even hearing my point of view. Who does that?  And the most annoying part is that she unblocked me exactly on the day Sushila Karki became PM, just to share the RONB post with me, of course, and texted ‚Äúbhedaa‚Äù along with some other shit‚Äîthen blocked me again. Like, what the actual fuck? Does she even realize it wasn‚Äôt the ‚ÄúKhilraj way‚Äù that Sushila became PM?  I don‚Äôt usually do this, but she really crossed the line here.",

It was not a revolution but an unfortunate accident that the bad actors took advantage of ‚Äî most possibly by design.

There are jholeys and there are bideshi gotis. We must recognise them and not fall for any propaganda. What we want here is a well-functioning democracy and a sovereign country. Johleys are a curse to a well-functioning country, whereas bideshi gotis are a danger to our sovereignty.  Bideshi goti: Parties and people who take pleasure in talking about destroying/burning the country and its properties. Parties and people who campaign about weakening the Nepal Army. Those who refrain from talking about border disputes.  Jholeys: They don't criticise their party and their leaders at all. Meanwhile, they come up with nasty and often fake allegations against other parties' leaders. They change skin colour often to parrot their leader's agenda or defend political equations.  My personal opinion:  \\* Nepal cannot have a directly elected executive if we want our country to remain sovereign.   \\* There is no option for a multi-party democracy.   \\* The country is for people of all ages and backgrounds. Corruption affected everyone, as well as the majority encouraged/participated.   \\* Nepalese society is a low-trust society. People lack civic sense and basic decency.   \\* The biggest overhaul is needed in education, more than in government.   \\* There are bideshi gotis everywhere in the country; they are here as NGOs/INGOs for hidden motives and self-interest.

They should be responsible for keeping the Cabinet of Ministers accountable, appointing heads to Government bodies, and parliamentary investigations. They should also be seated in the parliament by their political values i.e. Left, right, center accordingly.  The Lower House of Representatives is fine as it is.

As far as I know in the current system yes you are absolutely right...if anyone else is the PM the other/opposing party samsads will not let them work properly but isn't this the exact problem we want to solve? We want the samsads who are going to think about the country so that when a PM brings forth a plan/bill they all mutually decide whether it will benefit the nation and if they(our chosen leaders who we elected because we know they have the development of nation at the core of their heart and first in their priority) reject it then it was not for the good of the nation the PM will have to either convince/explain them how it is good for the nation or the PM will have to see that the proposal was not in the best interest of the nation. IMAGINE. A parliament made up of leaders who only want the best for the nation and think of the wise decision they'll make and pace of the development.  Your second point made me think a lot I had never really thought about it in that matter so you opened a new perspective I thank you for that. Yes it would be a problem if anyone/everyone would start to stand for PM and your logic is very realistic and I can not think of a way to tackle it. Thinking more about it; maybe and please correct me if there's any problem with this process too- only the samsads will be able to stand for PM BUT the voting will be done by the people. Since the samsads are the ones people chose it is rare that they(the people) want someone else for PM if there was a candidate like then he would have definitely stood for samsad. This way there won't be random people contesting for PM and even among the samsads few should stand for PM(assuming the samsads we elected are wise and all don't fight for PM.) this should also prevent the PM going all dictator they rest of the parliament members should keep the PM in check. it should not divide the nation too much but of course where there is democracy there will be some division.  I sincerely don't like the idea of voting the parties again simply because we know that they are corrupt...we can not really trust even the new ones because that is how they've seen their predecessor exploit that is what they want and that is what they will do...and we know about the pressure they will receive from the party...we just cannot trust them we cannot again go back to that.  I fully realise what I am saying is optimistic... I'm assuming that we will find good leaders... people will vote for them and that they will not turn corrupt once they are in power BUT I am hopeful...I want to believe that our country is slowly getting literate and aware...and that they will understand the need for better leaders. I hope the events of the recent protest have helped open many eyes...I hope they see that this government killed children while they were protesting peacefully...not shooting in their legs to control them but shooting in their heads murdering them. I hope they realise the heads need to change.   I don't usually post...i haven't posted anything in any of the social media platforms in like 4-5 years But the recent protest and discussions that have followed have made me want to talk as I see that many people(not you obviously )trying to act like this protest was nothing and that everything was alright and some saying this change is even worse. Seeing all the new ministers I think we are headed towards a better future. AND one important thing I think we should start letting people know that now is the time they abandon the parties...many innocent brains are in these parties because there was no alternatives if this word gets around I believe we can actually do something in the future election.

I recently lived in a Hacker House in Dubai and it was an amazing experience for focused collaboration, learning, and launching projects. I‚Äôm curious if something similar could work in Kathmandu.  What is a Hacker House?  * A short-term shared space for builders: founders, devs, designers, students, creators. * Focused on collaboration, project sprints, workshops, and community events (typically 4‚Äì8 weeks).  Why Kathmandu?   There‚Äôs a growing tech and student scene here, and I think a hacker house could help bring people together to build and share knowledge.  Questions for you all:  1. Do you think Kathmandu would benefit from a hacker house? 2. What features would matter most (workspace, internet, events, mentorship, hardware lab, etc.)? 3. Have you seen/experienced something like this elsewhere?     üëâ If enough people are curious, maybe we can even do a small meetup to discuss further.  Would love to hear your thoughts üôè",

Using mainly just the 17% of the land (Terai) to feed the entire population is a problem in making.   Yes, I know we also farm in hills but it was an expression. Westerners use all that fancy technologies such as combines and auto-harvesters while majority of Nepalese hilly areas still rely on bulls and cows or not even those at all.   Could we make a small compact motor that a farmer dai can sling on his back and carry all the way up to a terrace, unload it and start farming and tilling the soil with it?   Could we make drones that will help spray fertilize the top hard to rich areas so the farmers don't have to go up and down the elevations constantly?   Another technology we desperately need is imo nationalizing 3D printers. I am very inspired by the Big Hero 6 movie where every household has a 3D printer and they can print their own solutions rather than having to go to the store constantly. Make community run 3D printers (like a library, a public property for an entire community) a common sight in Nepal rather than just a strange novelty technology.

But building a company quickly showed me a bigger picture. A founder isn‚Äôt just a coder you‚Äôre a communicator, a coordinator, a salesperson, a project manager. Investors, clients, and teammates don‚Äôt care only about elegant code; they care whether you can explain a product in clear English, align a team, and keep promises.  Here‚Äôs the mindset shift that hit me hard: \t‚Ä¢\tTechnical intelligence builds the product. You need the skills to create something real. \t‚Ä¢\tEmotional intelligence sells it. You need the skills to talk to customers, handle conflict, and inspire a team. \t‚Ä¢\tEffort multiplies both. No matter how smart you are, the person who keeps showing up and doing the hard, uncomfortable work will outpace you.  Whenever you avoid the call, the pitch, or the awkward conversation because it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot your thing,‚Äù that‚Äôs a signal your emotional intelligence needs reps just as much as your coding skills do.  If you want to build a great tech startup, you can‚Äôt pick one side. You need to build and you need to sell. Period.",

On the USB‚Äôs root, create a file sources\\\\ei.cfg (plain text). Put this content in it:      [EditionID]     Professional          [Channel]     Retail          [VL]     0  5. **When installing windows, it offers an option to select disk partition** where windows should be installed. Delete all paritions (except data disk in step 2), so that all space is unallocated. Select this unallocated partition as installation target.  6. **(Optional) If stuck on screen \"Oops, you' ve lost internet connection\".** On this screen or on country selection screen:  >Open cmd with Shift + F10 and type `OOBE\\BYPASSNRO.`  >Your computer will restart and now you will have the \"I don't have Internet\" option.  7. **After windows installation, permanently activate Windows 11 and Microsoft Office 365:(https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts)**  >a. Open PowerShell as administrator and enter: `irm` [`https://get.activated.win`](https://get.activated.win) `| iex`  >b. Select `[1] HWID` \\- for windows activation. Follow activation steps.  >c. Select `[2] Ohook` \\- for Office download and activation. Then Press `[3] Download Office` \\- and follow hearts on the website to download Office 365. After installation, press `[1] Install Ohook Office Activation`.  8. **Debloat Windows 11 and set optimal configurations: (https://github.com/Raphire/Win11Debloat)**  >a. Open PowerShell as administrator and enter: `& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm \"https://debloat.raphi.re/\")))`  >b.

Follow further steps onto your consideration. I click \"yes\" to 90% of proposed changes.  9. **Configure Windows Defender for optimal security:**  >a. Download `ConfigureDefender.exe` from [https://github.com/AndyFul/ConfigureDefender](https://github.com/AndyFul/ConfigureDefender)  >b. Launch ConfigureDefender and press `HIGH`.  >c. Close the app and you can now remove it.  10. **Install UniGetUI and reinstall all the apps**  11. **(Optional) Install some other cool apps:**  >a. Unchecky - when installing apps auto de-selects bloatware install options.  >b. Revo Uninstaller - when removing apps cleanups all residuals like registry keys and temp files.  >c. 7-Zip - file archiver  >d. VLC - media player (or more advanced: MPC-BE)  >e. qBittorrent - torrent client  >f. SumatraPDF - lightweight file reader  >g. Notepad++ - advanced text editor  >h.

Step 3 will only cost you some extra time and patience though.|||I have a I3 4th gen laptop It has 8gm ram and ssd also I replaced battery and installed atlas os based on windows I tried linux,chrome os but altlas os worked great on it and now I use to watch series and I can watch series for multiple hours on It So Ig you need to upgrade ram,ssd and install linux or customized windows os|||this is a good laptop. instead of just making it run youtube you can make it powerful.      get a good and fast at least 256gb ssd don't go for chinese one. 128gb is okay but you'll always have to look at space.    for ram 4gb is too low. as per my knowledge your laptop supports  ddr4 upto 2666mhz and 32gb limit.    so you can get two 8gb ram and make it 16. one 8gb stick costs about 3k or 4k. you can look hamrobazar.    clean the fan and put cpu thermal paste.       then you'll realize how fast your laptop really is.|||just install linux and disable av1 codec on youtube. it wont cost anything. linux mint will be perfect for it.  if you want to make upgrades, then add another ram and a sata ssd.  tyo battery ko side ma chahi hard drive ho. tesko screw haru nikalera naya ssd rakhne ho. natra dvd hatayera ssd rakhna milcha with a caddy.  https://www.daraz.com.np/products/universal-second-hdd-caddy-95mm-sata-slim-hard-drive-for-laptop-cd-dvd-optical-drive-bay-optibay-adapter-for-laptop-i128312049.html|||I can see two SATA ports right here and  you can see big empty space right there and which is used for cd drive igf and if it has cd drive then get a hdd caddy, install ssd in the current place of hdd with OS then put hdd in caddy then takeout cd drive and put the caddy in the place of cd drive.  i used to rock 128gb ssd with windows 10 and store other files in HDD. Just get caddy and ssd , install windows 10 if thats fine with you then store stuff in HDD.

Make sure Linux goes on the SSD and set it as the first boot option in BIOS. Use GRUB as the bootloader, and I‚Äôd recommend Ubuntu or Linux Mint since they‚Äôre very beginner friendly. Don‚Äôt stress about Linux, it‚Äôs pretty easy to get used to, and honestly, once you do, you might not even go back to Window. You can find multiple tutorials on YouTube for Linux installation. Search for \" How to dual boot Windows and (your preferred linux distro)\". You can remove Windows once you are comfortable with Linux, if you want.  3. If you can spend a bit more, upgrade the RAM. Use two sticks of the same size to take advantage of dual channel.  With this setup, you‚Äôll have a solid dual-boot laptop running both Linux and Windows. Believe me, it will won't be just a work around but a solid laptop.|||upgrade to ssd + add maybe 8GB ram on another slot  and run one of these:   1.

However, if your family can manage, join a course - not just for the degree but to really understand the field in depth that you choose; build a set of skill - in the real world your skill set is going to be more valuable than your degree.

            "body": "Context: Back in 2023, I jumped into this \"SEO\" thing for my startup because I thought, ‚Äúhey, this can‚Äôt be that hard.‚Äù I just have to write some good blogs, add a few \"targeted keywords\" in the content, send emails to few prospect for \"link building\" and then BOOM Google will show my site in the first page.  Nope. Not even close.  I spent months publishing content (more than 20+ articles) I thought they were amazing. But when I checked Google? Page 10. Page 12. Basically invisible. And every time I tried to ask ‚Äúwhy isn‚Äôt this ranking?‚Äù most answer I got from SEO gurus was mostly the same two words:  ‚ÄúYour Content is good, but SEO TAKES TIME\"  And then, of course, the golden advice: ‚ÄúJust build quality backlinks.‚Äù  Okay‚Ä¶ but what does that actually mean?  How many backlinks do I need?  \"SEO TAKES TIME\" okay, but exactly how long specifically for my target \"keyword\" I want to rank for?  And getting backlinks from what kind of sites is good enough to be considered as \"high quality backlinks\" purely for my targeted keyword?  And how the hell do I guest post without spamming ‚Äúkeyword + write for us‚Äù into Google and begging random sites for guest posts?  That‚Äôs when it hit me: what if there was a tool that didn‚Äôt just say ‚Äúbuild quality backlinks,‚Äù but literally broke it down for you? Like Google saying  ‚ÄúTo rank for this keyword, you‚Äôll need around 42 backlinks from DA 28-32 sites, you site MUST LOAD under 2.5 seconds, have 3 supporting articles, and ~4 months of consistency. Oh, and here‚Äôs the exact strategy to actually get those backlinks without generic guest posting BS.‚Äù  So‚Ä¶ I built it.  It‚Äôs called Pikera SEO (https://pikeraai.com). It‚Äôs a tool where you type in your target keyword (for example: ‚Äúbest AI tools in 2025‚Äù), and it tells you:  How many backlinks you‚Äôll realistically need  What domain authority range those backlinks should come from  How long it‚Äôll probably take to rank  What technical fixes you need to make  And most importantly ‚Üí the strategy to actually hit those requirements  I‚Äôm not saying this magically gets you to Page 1 overnight (SEO is still work). But at least now you can start with clarity instead of guesswork with Pikera SEO.  Right now, Pikera SEO is in early access, and we‚Äôre running a waitlist here: https://pikeraai.com/waitlist.  If you‚Äôre a founder, marketer, or just someone tired of SEO ‚Äúit depends‚Äù answers, I think you‚Äôll find it useful.  But I‚Äôd also love your feedback: if you were using a tool like this, what‚Äôs the #1 thing you‚Äôd want it to tell you about your keyword? Because I‚Äôm still improving it, and honestly, hearing from people in communities like this is way more valuable than any \"SEO guru‚Äôs\" advice.  That‚Äôs it. Just wanted to share my journey, my frustration, and what I built out of necessity.  If anyone‚Äôs been through the same SEO pain, I‚Äôd love to hear your story too.",

Tbh it really bothered me that she (and her PR team) thought that we‚Äôre dumb enough to believe those excel sheets. Maybe what she said is true, but she could have showed the actual proof.  In her place, all of us would feel terrible. But to say things like leaving instagram account as it is so that it can be a testament to hate while not acknowledging her silence on a platform with a million followers over deaths of youth is crazy. Becoming an influencer means you are sometimes answerable to questions & accusations, it‚Äôs not just about making your feed aesthetic & scoring brand deals. People turned her into an influencer, so ofc she will have to be answerable sometimes. I wonder what she thought? Yea it‚Äôs not easy, but it‚Äôs part of all that fame & money.  To see that she was so concerned about setting her narrative & defending her image while not even feeling sorry for those who died, were injured & whose families are now forever incomplete is baffling.   Her narrative has been set forever now. Clearly, not to everyone, but to lots of us. Someone said that she‚Äôs only sad now because she lost followers, and that pretty much sums up how I see her now.|||Tesko bhanda ta Anmol KC ko acting ramro yarr|||More the explanation more the lie.|||Aafule khaneko khaldo ma aafai parnu vaneko ehi ho :D|||Yeah couldn't agree more.

Honestly asking. Why did the Nepo Kids trend include her? I have read somewhere that people hate her now because she said she will fight against corruption when she is the daughter of Binod Khatiwoda so that made her a hypocrite. Was Binod Khatiwada known to be corrupt? Please dont tell me that every politician is corrupt. I am asking if there has been any concerns raised regarding Binod Khatiwada like he owning multiple buildings, cars etc when he is only a politician.    If no one really knows that her dad is corrupt, her defensiveness makes sense to me. I too would be devastated if my image was destroyed for no apparent reason.   Again.. I am saying this because I honestly don't know about Binod Khatiwada.|||K garos ta garna chai, yeti sab vaisakdaa, yeti sab accusations huda, euta manche le aafno clarification ta dihalxha ni yr.

I wanted to see pictures of that 'rescue' operation. Having some free time, I did some internet digging and found a facebook page of Nepal Army posted on October 2023. It exactly matches the news portals and tiktok user's claim, plus Shrinkhala‚Äôs story(it's on her story highlights). Yes, Summit air use gareko vlog cha, but my guess is ktm to dolpa jana lai use gareko ho, not return to ktm.   Picture: collage of the picture on fb page of Nepal army, then Shrinkhala‚Äôs group of 9 people who went to Shey Phoksundo. Luga haru milcha, anuhar ni milcha. You can see that it's the same group.   This really shows how much power is misused in Nepal and the recent nepo-kids trend was helpful to shed light on this. I am also against all the opportunists who posted against their exes to gain relevancy during vulnerable times. Aba chahi we should think twice before blindly following social media figures.",

Which could have happened just after the laughs they had or they were lighting up the mood.   We become too judgemental too quickly. And because the nepo kid trend went on, this incident invovling her was brought to light.

See how Ram Chandrey has said he wont sign on any executive order except for election.|||Guys If you plan to protest at least organise better this time, we must avoid infiltration and have strict measures to document participants who share the actual intents and purpose of coming together, function like they do in war. This is a war against the old organised crime bosses who have governed our country to absolute insanity through their political games. We must play in equal footing through organised planned unity against these corrupt systems. We must protect ourselves, specially to avoid any more life to become casualties of chaos that certainly will follow these protests.|||‚öñÔ∏è|||lets do it|||motive clear hunu paryo, leader hunu paryo, peacful protest hunu nai paryo aaba jyan gumauna sakidaina|||Guys we should speak up haii aaba chai chadna hunna yarr let's do it again|||Commenting for reach!|||Yeah yeah you deserve to eat shit",

Topper hoina one semester ko project ma aru ko kaam present garera winner bhaeko ho. Always knew she is faking being an intellectual but this is diabolical. Everyone needs to watch this! She emphasized she is a topper at Miss Nepal or Miss World platform. Unbelievably embarrassing!  Her entire family sees nothing wrong with recalculating board exam.

She really is not as intellectually gifted as she portrays herself to be. She seems to surrounds herself with people who are actually intelligent (and hence pass off their work as her own) and her family is well connected and powerful enough to give her things she could never earn by merit. OR 2. Her family is CORRUPT enough for certain people to have a personal vendetta against her and deliberately tried to ensure her results are tempered with.

How they still haven't resigned as the party chief of their parties. All 3 of them.  It is one of the reasons why the democratic system hasn't worked well.  In working democracies, election and public mandate means something so they have to resign as party president/leader. Because they have the ultimate responsibility and accountability of the failure of the party.   For example after Prachanda lost the election (lost in the sense that he lost seats) 2nd time, if he was principled to the idea of democracy he should have resigned.  Because communism/maoism (his parties ideology) isn't limited to what Prachanda thinks. Party>Party leader, in working democracies.  And looking at all this, all the party members should be held liable (in a political sense) to what happened to the party and ultimately the country.   It's just a facade of democracy at this point.

            "body": "Mahesh Basnet the absolute piece of shit, is bringing the child-murdering psychopath and failed autocrat K.P. Oli into my village, probably to host him in his home \"under his protection\", in Suryabinayak-7, Gundu, Bhaktapur. This here now is not just politics at this point, this is an insult to everyone who lives here. I feel ashamed, but more than that, I am boiling with anger. How can I stay silent while my own ground is being used to glorify these criminals?  I will not just swallow it. This is my home, my people, and I refuse to let Mahesh Basnet walk around unchecked, parading his power. That is why I am speaking out now, to tear the mask off Basnet and show everyone the filth he hides behind. We will revolt against him, louder and harder than ever, because he is more dangerous than many of the other goons we curse in whispers..  While one must be careful not to hold family members responsible for the actions of another, the active support this dogshit-Basnet receives from his son, a law student, raises questions of complicity, especially in light of dogshitman-Basnet's increasingly volatile public behavior and serious allegations against him.  **Corruption and Unexplained Wealth**  Recently, while insulting the martyrs of our nation's protests, Mahesh Basnet had the audacity to claim he was clean and challenged anyone to investigate him. This is an empty challenge. His wealth is obviously not in his name and kasle garne yesko investigation. This is a man who has never held a real job outside of being a party karyakarta or a minister of industry in recent times, yet he owns multiple houses. His son, also without a job, travels internationally, stays in luxury hotels, and flaunts a lifestyle far beyond their legitimate means.  Here in Gundu, his influence is everywhere. He allegedly owns the \"Yoyo\" Banquet, the \"Yoyo\" Zipline (famously visited by Prachanda), and a \"Yoyo\" Resort currently under construction. Where did the money for these massive establishments come from?? We all know the answer, even if we can't prove it . This is why a thorough, independent investigation into his assets is long overdue.  [Some of Mahesh Basnet's son's foreign travel with taxpayers money.](https://preview.redd.it/fhumen39mqpf1.jpg?width=3171&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d989806f81112829eabfeeb7bb71323fb598c6bd)  https://preview.redd.it/2idrjmhnmqpf1.png?width=1357&format=png&auto=webp&s=e19d2338012fc2cab3c296cabfc4bd17498048d1  https://preview.redd.it/v8yfebydnqpf1.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d5b95ffd59ede1665dbcbde9d62a05e26e23ad6  [Yoyo Resort in Construction process, just few 100 meter below  yoyo zipline.](https://preview.redd.it/w7ynwh9aqqpf1.jpg?width=686&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2088fd7ef085aafa3cf392745d88ba3755bb1c18)  **Why the People of Gundu Are Silent**  Friends from outside often ask, \"Why don't you just throw him out?\" It's not that simple. Gundu is a close-knit community, which becomes a curse in situations like this. To stand against a powerful man supported by a network of loyalists means becoming an outcast.  Need something from the ward office? The staff are in his pocket, infact some of the emplyoee are his close relatives and the oda karyalay ko chief is friends with him and calls for his \"blessing\" for any matter.    Driving down the street? The local police might stop you for no reason just for inconvinienc-ing you. His network of beneficiaries, people who got government jobs thanks to his influence, will turn their backs on you. Local shops may refuse to sell you goods. His army of goons, made up of the village's own jobless youth, patrol the streets and will not hesitate to harass or assault you.  Just days ago, a young man from our village was caught livestreaming a protest against Basnet. He was  branded a \"traitor to the village,\" and ostracized. Even my parents were talking about the guy like how people talk about Naruto in his village lol. Fucking hell.  That is why I cannot protest openly. I do not want to become a martyr for a cause that will be crushed before it even begins because no one here will stand with me. The youth who should be fighting for change are mostly party loyalists.  **Conclusion**  The silence from Gundu is not consent; it is a product of a carefully constructed system of fear and dependency. As a resident who feels unable to protest safely, I am using this platform as my voice. The hosting of K.P. Oli by Mahesh Basnet is not merely a political gathering; it is a demonstration of impunity. It is a signal that individuals facing serious allegations of corruption and violent crime can continue to operate in the highest echelons of power. This is not a local issue, it is a national concern that demands attention and action from all who believe in justice, accountability, and the rule of law. These clowns need to be behind the bar.  https://preview.redd.it/4eccc725xqpf1.jpg?width=574&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8bb0a56948c40fc1347e36ec4385c13120c66af6  https://preview.redd.it/0mspnu0gxqpf1.jpg?width=1670&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a5cd841240e66a776f10978672455f189c61581  [Prachanda doing zipline in Yoyo Zipline owned by Mahesh basnet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpp0MzgQB3U)  [Calling genz terrorist](https://www.facebook.com/MaMaheshBasnet/videos/2664565070548857)  [Basnet's Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MaMaheshBasnet/)  [Rape Allegation](https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/rape-foeticide-complaint-lodged-against-mahesh-basnet)  [Kidnapping allegation](https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/police-refuse-to-register-fir-against-ex-minister-basnet-ex-igp-khanal-ruling-party-lawmaker-shrestha-for-the-alleged-abduction-of-opposition-lawmaker)  [Publicity stunt at reinventing police station](https://www.facebook.com/reel/1455707989093360) (The guy in teal shirt is the police chief here and yet everyone has to bow down to Dogshit man, shows the power dynamic in this place)",

Obviously so many people will try to attack and vandalize KP's residency and our town will get caught in the crossfire. It's gonna be very very dangerous for anyone living there.  I dunno if people of the community can organize a protest against that because even if you support CPN-UML this is a very bad move. It's not about political leaning anymore it's about the security of the community despite political leaning. I am trying to educate and make people aware about this to as many people I know as much as possible.

So i don't have the desperation of people who have been videotaped.  A proper revolution would siege power within the night of 9th, and force the army to jail them politicians while everyone was afraid, that was the time, it was still fine on 10th but after that nothing was gonna happen, because the fear in everyone had started to decrease. Coups work on fears.  But alas, even if one of the 69420 groups had tried this, noone was united so the army would probably call the bluff anyway.  harka was probably more knowledgeable than the status queen you guys praise so much if we take that into consideration. If all of you mfs had rallied behind him, he could probably jail the politicians at 9th. He knew how power vacuums and fears work. He was actually building stuff instead of just destroying illegal construction. He came, he went to the army headquarters.  The more time it goes, the more will the power of 'GenZ' decrease. At this point, IDK if the discord server of hami nepal (sus funding like 'students for a free tibet', sorry our northern neighbor won't ignore even if you bury your head in the sand) can mobilize just as much people as the old parties, I have left the server. Probably not, so zoomers are less powerful than the combined power of parties. The equalizer is the army with guns, you loose their support and it's doomed.  You just let a power vacuum for the foreigners to take advantage of, to everyone whoever took part, you are brave, you have the balls, I respect you, fix this and you'll be loved through history, if foreigners fuck us up, be ready to take all the blame. I have a hard time believing the police administration that doesn't train at all can be so good at headshoting kids.  Call me Jholey as much as you want, I don't care, because to me you are no different from the Jholeys of old parties, I question your God and you try to mob me up in the comments. my family hasn't voted in about a decade, my family is less \"Jholey\" than majority of you, and the most corruption done by my family is getting some of the \"wasted\" writing papers of government colleges for free as a gift so that I can study.|||Honestly. This is crap. They should be rotting in jail.   Also to add, even if we don‚Äôt want a monarch to lead. A country with a monarch is stronger. Even if they don‚Äôt lead and have separate politics - like England. Imagine king mahendra or birendra right now. But no, they were removed so this corruption could take place.   Also another thought, why have all our kings had very very short lives. King birendra was only 55! And lineage behind him the same.   Also, the idea of people saying ‚Äúbaby king‚Äù to gyanendras grandson is bad! He isn‚Äôt baby king. The rightful heir is Girwani.

Then define what you are stressed, failure, perfectionist etc then decide what you want to be among the various things that you are.   Then act accordingly.   E.G.: You are reader.

You don't need any validation from germany ka kukkur.|||Guys, I assume everyone here has someone in their family with some political ties. I too have. But that doesn't mean I have direct ties with them. JHOLEY and BHEDA is a noun that defines people who blindly believe in a person or a political party.      Talking about myself, I am already 36, a father and I am thinking of raising my family here in Nepal. I was totally against going abroad as a student when there was trend to do so. But the political system was never stable here. However, This current GenZ revolution happened against corruption. We indeed got a good progress against these corrupt leaders. But things turned out to be different and here is my roller coaster of emotions. Please let me know if you can relate to this.  Day 0: Social Media Ban - Mixed feelings. Hopeful that social medias will proceed further with registration.  Day 1: GenZ revolution and killing - Lots of anger. Disappointment and discontent.  Day 2: Revolution, excited and happy till 4 PM, until we destroyed the party system. Once the public started destroying Singha Durbar, I came to realize what I had done. I started a fire that I can't extinguish.  Day 3: Realization of the revolution being hijacked. We were just against corruption, regime change was not our motto. The revolution gradually turned into a COLOR REVOLUTION.  Day 4: Worried about who will lead the country. Started mentally supporting Balen/Rabi or any young leader. Furious, since the army asked GenZ to come up with a leader. Finally Hami Nepal, some guys funded by Deep state along with Sanduk Ruit and Swarnim Wagle came into light. They started talking about regime change and Constitution change. They said they directly want to select Zelensky as their prime minister.   Day 5: Much more disappointed as some kids who are aiming to go abroad for future study is electing prime minister through Discord. Sushila Karki elected as PM. Which is some sort of relief. I feared a autocrat.  Day 6 - Day 7: China is yet to acknowledge PM Sushila Karki. China is suspecting foul play as KP Oli had been to SCO and all of this happened just after that.      Now I am very much in distress. I feel that, Nepal is Ukraine. Balen is the new Zelensky and China is the new Russia. I dont want to think negatively but the situation ahead seems to be very dark and we will have to take steps cautiously. There are a lot of hatred here and Social medias are fueling it. None of the GenZ were born during the writing of the constitution. There were lots of revolution that was endured by current revolution Maoist Revolution, Madesh Revolution etc. But now it seems everything has gone to waste and there is no constitution here in the country. Is this PTSD?|||Its not true narrative this is all funded by cia|||Nepal, you are dealing with dangerous, insecure, violent crybullies who don't care about reasons and motives because they'll just come up with fake news and use that is their motive.

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not ‚Äúrevolution,‚Äù it‚Äôs not ‚Äújustice,‚Äù and it sure as hell isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe voice of the people.‚Äù It‚Äôs mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn‚Äôt make you brave‚Äîit makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that‚Äîsurrounded by a wave of so-called ‚Äúyouths‚Äù who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let‚Äôs not sugarcoat it‚Äîthe so-called Gen Z ‚Äúwarriors‚Äù hiding in the mob weren‚Äôt heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country‚Äôs social fabric. He still can‚Äôt step foot in certain countries because he‚Äôs internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he‚Äôs propped up as a ‚Äúleader.‚Äù  Let‚Äôs be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn‚Äôt an accident‚Äîit was a setup. While Deuba‚Äôs family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don‚Äôt get it twisted‚Äîthose sharpshooters in the crowd weren‚Äôt just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres‚Äîformer insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let‚Äôs stop pretending this was ‚Äúthe people rising up.‚Äù It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist‚Äîthe one who drowned this nation in blood‚Äîwalks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don‚Äôt for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn‚Äôt that Deuba suffered humiliation‚Äîthe real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn‚Äôt a flower; he‚Äôs a weed choking the soil of Nepal‚Äôs democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too na√Øve to realize they‚Äôre being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||CIA & India Agents involved in chaos!

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4. Retirement age and term limits: This is a must, we need a clear retirement age for the public positions just like other jobs.     These sort of things are fundamental of any country, without getting the fundamentals right we cannot expect our country to do better. We have a chance to make things better, lets take this chance.|||also i think! what lessons can be learned from Bangladesh last year?|||Garni nai ho vani presidency system lyauni.

Just wanted to express supreme respect to you from Ukraine.   You're really cool!   We had protests in 2014.   We made lot of mistakes after succeded in throwing down Yanukovich in 2014.

Now we get kidnapping peoples on streets by police and conscripted forcely to war or you can get out for $10k until kidnapped next time. People get beaten and sometimes murdered in basements by military guys supported by police.

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

Balen wasn't there when the movement needed him the most.|||Balen is narendra modi of nepal|||Ok, I don‚Äôt follow Balens politics a lot but if he had said he wants to be interim PM, would you have not criticized he was being opportunist?  Also what happens if he wins election he managed? Would everyone trust he won fair election?   I think what did is best for him and country. If people choose him, he will be pm if not he wont. It‚Äôs simple.|||Disclaimer: I am not a Balen supporter or cultist.  This post is conflicting for me. But, the post is characterizing the man based on:  1. What the man didn‚Äôt do or didn‚Äôt say. 2. What people expected him to do.  The man himself has said enough in his posts.   It‚Äôs what, he DIDN‚ÄôT do that impresses me the most about him. Saying ‚ÄúNo‚Äù is harder than saying ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, when everyone wanted him to say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.  (Think about this.)  He put out only a couple of posts, which I think served as guide posts during the revolution.   1. He was the first widely known public figure (that I know) who defined who Gen Z was and gave his support to the protest. 2. When the tempo rose, he clarified that Gen Z should lead, he accepted Sushila even when all of his cultists were going crazy about making him the interim PM.  Removing himself from the picture, brought focus back on the revolution and the task ahead, rather than turn the confusion situation, even more confusing with a popularity contest as a side gig.   There is a lot of things to think about and I think in time we can all make sense of it all.   That‚Äôs my two paisa about him.|||Leading KTM municipality vs leading the nation are totally different. The followers of Balen urging and rushing him to lead 'right now' and come out by 2PM are the same people who will criticize him within one year if he were to be them PM someday. They don't have patience and want to see changes immediately.  Personally, I would like to see him running in the upcoming election as deputy/vice roles first and not immediate PM role...assuming how parties will be formed and if there are any good lead independent candidate who will run with him. He's one of those few worthy to be PM but this is not his peak yet. He just became a mayor like 3 years ago and he still has a lot to show to the general public. If and when he wins to the election, it will be his peak and he has high chances of being a two term PM...assuming two term limit will be in place hopefully. Time will tell.|||GenZ aren't immune to celeb worship culture.|||Hami Nepal has already stated it was part of a plan and they want balen for 5 years. So did they fight for the nation or for the balen is the real question? Why are they biased for balen only and not for other groups of good people?|||About your 2nd picture.  Yes it is definitely an opportunistic behaviour by balen. But how is this behaviour wrong and how is taking over PM position now and securing interim govt now and not taking part in politics for next 5 years do any good to the country.    He is practicing patience to achieve the goal he desires and what people actually wants from a young leader like him. Look throughout the history of world politics, paitence has always been the key factor to shape the world politics.|||Having trusted by many even me,In the moment of national threat, he could do nothing. That‚Äôs the reason I doubt him.  i think he is not completely responsible for being the Prime Minister. Sure, he is a great person. He‚Äôs doing such a great thing in the valley, but being a Prime Minister is very responsible post, his way up talking to seniors, saying I will put fire to SinghaDurbar, I will bury everyone if you‚Äôre in tudinkhel, getting carried away by emotions, being Prime Minister means you should not be carried away by any emotions and none of the factors should affect your judgment which you believe to be true and is lawful, Hopefully he will make such changes and we can finally see him in the top, as much as I want him to be the Prime Minister I do think he is inexperienced and immature in this field,|||We are so far behind that criticizing political leader sounds like a hater. We are not even to the point where we could say ‚ÄúThis person is bad/clueless , country isn‚Äôt safe with them‚Äù. For the past decade, the corrupted 3 have been playing nothing but tato aloo with us so its natural to be sticking nail to current situation. Give it some time and our voices will get echoed.|||If there‚Äôs one thing old political leaders never learned, it was how to handle criticism. The moment anyone spoke up, they tried to shut it down and let‚Äôs not even start on the behavior of their hardcore supporters(jholey as we call them).  Even leaders like Balen need to address this with their own supporters, as do all the new representatives entering the upcoming elections. They must say publicly that they welcome criticism, will reflect on it, and use it as a tool for improvement. Leaders should make it clear to their base: don‚Äôt bully or silence people for simply asking questions or raising concerns. Do not perform character assassination against someone just for criticizing. After all, in a democracy, freedom of speech is our right.  At the same time, we the general public also carry responsibility. We need to recognize the difference between constructive criticism and defamation. What we must not do is fall for propaganda, spread rumors, or engage in baseless character assassination.  And if we realize that our criticism or questioning was wrong, we should have the courage to apologize in the same way we raised the question. After all, apologizing will never make you small. It‚Äôs just a simple five letter word: ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù A word that can and should be spoken from both sides.|||Just because you‚Äôre against the system, doesn‚Äôt make you Balen-Supporters. Balen has no experience. Balen should wait and gain some experience. Criticism is a backbone of democracy and one must welcome it.|||EXACTLY. They lack this ability to critically analyse any action of any leader. Like no one is perfect and no one is a good. Let's be honest. Let's criticize people for their actions. People should be held accountable for their actions. Most importantly, leaders who run our nation. If we don't point out their wrongdoings, will they ever stop? Nepalese have such a bheda mindset, istg. Let's be more aware and let's know how to discern leaders and their actions.   By criticizing these leaders, we aren't hating on them. We're trying to bring awareness so that they won't repeat the same thing again and can do things better for the country.|||They need to be aware party KO jhole become jhole because they were andabhakt of party leader ( just like they are blind follower of balen rn)|||I think holding politicians accountable is crucial. I hope people realize we don‚Äôt need ¬†more devotees and followers. We need critical, educated thinkers. Support the good work, appreciate your favorite leader but don‚Äôt forget to question often.

I see people thanking Balen for this movement and saying he was the reason this movement happened and succeeded and all after Sushila Karki became interim PM, and this made me very sad for actual people who started the movement and also faced the consequences and this was even more big realization for me for how blind youth and supporters these days are and this concerns me even more for future|||This. This is what I‚Äôve been saying for some time. Like the post says, I‚Äôve also been labeled as a party ko jhole and what not. Even here in this sub, people have called me jhole lol just because I questioned him.  I am a Balen supporter. I supported him and did my part by sharing about his campaign on social media and making everyone aware about it. And I was super happy when he won, I still am. But I‚Äôve been criticizing him on various points that I find valid. The top one is communication.  During the election, he constantly criticized Bidya Sundar (the previous mayor) for not communicating publicly. He even said that once he became mayor, he wouldn‚Äôt be like that and would stay in constant touch. He proposed starting a ‚ÄòMayor with the Public‚Äô TV program and even set aside a budget for it, but nothing has happened. He hasn‚Äôt given a single interview.  And then come his jhole supporters who always argue with the same line: ‚ÄòPailai kei chaieko ho.‚Äô With that logic, we should never question anyone. Just look at how Balen has become now, he just posts one-sided, no-context Facebook statuses and nothing else.|||Balen is a hypocrite in my opinion, like he encouraged the protest and even promised to provide a safe and secure environment for the protest but when things turned south he vanished like horn from a donkeys head|||Finally someone spoke about this, belun has literally become a god complex among some people out there, which is kinda concerning, the only time he speaks is to not let his adhabhatka interfere in every other stuff out there.

He is still better than most of the people there. Whatever he does, he has never done anything wrong. Stop pretending to be so-called critics for useless reasons. What is your academic background, and what makes you think that way? Have you ever felt the difference between past and present Kathmandu? I have a friend from the core area of Kathmandu, do you know what his opinion about Balen Shah is? No!  Even Harka Sampang is a very good person. Moreover, Sagar Dhakal‚Äôs brother has been working actively to eradicate the dictatorship of these political parties. Maybe your parents are bootlicking those rotten political parties, so you only see what Balen has never done and will never do. Just because he supported the movement does not mean he said he wants to become prime minister. You must understand that he posts only a few things because his words are weapons. One word from him has many consequences in such a movement. He is very clever and very wise; unlike Harka Sampang, though I like Harka as a person.

This is not  new,  when a revolution with a purpose overshoots give the power mongerers an opportunity to come forward and exploit that. A mob when acting like this is too dangerous.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**¬†The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**¬†If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**¬†If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**¬†If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

This has been ongoing for more than two decades. Behind the few visible figures, there are countless others who have either assisted them or benefitted through their association‚Äîranging from major brands in Nepal to traders. For example, Sher Bahadur Deuba‚Äôs son and his sanitary pad importing company stand as an illustration.  They have institutionalized corruption by appointing foreign ambassadors based on party loyalty and financial gains, extending even to the transfer of bureaucrats to preferred locations in exchange for bribes and other undue benefits. The problem is not limited to the political system alone; bureaucrats, too, require checks and balances. A mechanism must be established to regulate the power of bureaucrats over politicians. Since bureaucrats are permanent stakeholders, their influence is even greater. One effective way to mitigate this is to appoint domain experts as ministers‚Äîfor instance, a professional civil engineer as a minister cannot be misled about the cost estimates of a construction project.  There remains much to be done. Moreover, these political parties will attempt to form alliances before elections, bringing forward the same candidates and restoring the same exploitative system. Therefore, the first and most meaningful reform must be a change in the electoral process, with the inclusion of a ‚ÄúNOTA‚Äù (None of the Above) option.  Further accountability can be ensured by eliminating political appointments to certain positions. At present, even temporary (karar) appointments are made based on party affiliation rather than merit. As a result, even highly qualified experts are compelled to seek political approval. The recent appointments of Vice-Chancellors at B.P. Koirala Institute in Dharan and Gangalal Hospital are prime examples.  In addition to these issues, several other structural flaws persist.

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not ‚Äúrevolution,‚Äù it‚Äôs not ‚Äújustice,‚Äù and it sure as hell isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe voice of the people.‚Äù It‚Äôs mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn‚Äôt make you brave‚Äîit makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that‚Äîsurrounded by a wave of so-called ‚Äúyouths‚Äù who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let‚Äôs not sugarcoat it‚Äîthe so-called Gen Z ‚Äúwarriors‚Äù hiding in the mob weren‚Äôt heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country‚Äôs social fabric. He still can‚Äôt step foot in certain countries because he‚Äôs internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he‚Äôs propped up as a ‚Äúleader.‚Äù  Let‚Äôs be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn‚Äôt an accident‚Äîit was a setup. While Deuba‚Äôs family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don‚Äôt get it twisted‚Äîthose sharpshooters in the crowd weren‚Äôt just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres‚Äîformer insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let‚Äôs stop pretending this was ‚Äúthe people rising up.‚Äù It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist‚Äîthe one who drowned this nation in blood‚Äîwalks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don‚Äôt for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn‚Äôt that Deuba suffered humiliation‚Äîthe real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn‚Äôt a flower; he‚Äôs a weed choking the soil of Nepal‚Äôs democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too na√Øve to realize they‚Äôre being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||Prachanda and Baburam are India's puppet.

We have to investigate that, if we find anything, it will be so important for further, for choosing the leaders) But instead of drowning in sadness, we need to channel this pain into solutions.  This is the time to seek the truth, like who let Rabi out, and who is really behind the chaos. And this is also the time to seriously research those stepping forward to lead, people like Sushila Karki and others.

People watched her speech where she said stuff like, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?‚Äù  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still don‚Äôt have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we don‚Äôt have the right connections.  We don‚Äôt get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, it‚Äôs still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? That‚Äôs probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  We‚Äôre out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor people‚Äôs kids not boil?  On top of that, there‚Äôs already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent. Because this have  been suppressed for so long, and now the mindset is like ‚Äî ‚ÄúIf we can‚Äôt reach anywhere through the system, then we might as well destroy it.‚Äù  And even if some third party tries to trigger people, the truth is, it was already there deep down in their subconscious.

That drive inevitably brings with it shades of narcissism and opportunism. So rather than fixating on intentions, it makes more sense to judge politicians by their results.

His rough almost mobster-like style may be off-putting to some but in a city like Dharan which is home to hotheaded Kirati / Hill Janajati majority that kind of toughness isn‚Äôt just useful, it‚Äôs necessary.  That said, he is neither qualified nor capable enough to be considered an ‚Äòideal‚Äô Prime Minister. Nonetheless, when compared to Rabi Lamichhane Harka represents a comparatively more credible alternative. Personally not a fan of either.|||Tei ta Mayor ko pani layak xaina veda janta lai pm chaiyo re|||Dherai yo jaat ko haru furkirako cha muji haru K hi pachi k huncha kei tha chaina gu bhareko muji haru ko|||Guys Primeminister is not joke role.

If a person has done good work, both of them will be appreciated hands down. You have to look at the picture from both sides. Secondly, please ask your senior citizens or elders from a different generation. They have seen history and faced the consequences. The real issue is bringing change in the constitution, i.e., a representative should not be above a certain age and should be allowed to seek votes only for one term. Take that in writing from the concerned representative, live, and show it to the world clearly. Also, please do not discriminate by saying someone is from the ‚ÄúStone Age,‚Äù as such remarks can hurt the sentiments of people who are not from cities.|||Yes, I don't know what to.

            "body": "What comes next? The only reason Nepal isn't going through a complete currency de-valuation and a bank run is because of the rupee peg. We need to tread water carefully. (**Bank run**¬†is a situation where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a bank simultaneously, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or financial stability. This can lead to liquidity problems for the bank, as it may not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands. Bank runs can create a cycle of panic, potentially leading to the bank's failure.)  The real pain starts after the protests have calmed. Economic crash is certain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh both went through it. Stock market/real estate crash, inflation and what not.  Whoever takes charge next, likely Balen, will need to address the pointless 'Greater Nepal' rhetoric and become a moderate on this issue. Thanks to Trump, India-China relationship is stable for the first time in ages. The only way Nepal has a future is pledge allegiance to both neighbour's.  Bangladesh under Yunus has been a pain in the ass for India. Nepal cannot make the same mistake. Any wrong steps and a free floating Nepali rupee against the dollar would go from 140 now to 25,000 like similar countries in our GDP range. Probably worse since our economy is in much worse shape. ($1 = Lao Kip 21,631.66 LAK)  Nepal needs one stable leader for the next 40 yrs. No interim gov paving way for elections bullshit. Forget the democracy experiment. It does not work in poor, illiterate countries.",

She is the daughter of Chabi Rijal, a communist leader and Chief District Officer in Nepal, who recently ordered a shoot-on-sight against youth peacefully protesting corruption in Nepal. His orders have killed over 18 innocent people, injured more than 100 students, and more deaths are expected. This is pure fascism and a gross misuse of power. Young people in a peaceful protest were shot dead, which is totally unacceptable. While our brothers and sisters die in Nepal, Sweta Rijal has no right to study in the US with money from corruption. Her entire funding is from the money from corruption. The US, as a democratic country and a voice for the UN, stands for freedom and justice. Allowing her to stay contradicts everything the US represents. We are struggling to fight this battle in Nepal, and she must be held accountable. I urge you to investigate her visa and take necessary action to send her back to Nepal. Regards, Concerned Citizen from Nepal",

I am just a sincere, hardworking youth who remained silent because too many opinions create a ruckus. That's what I believed till September 8. When I went to the protest, it was all fine until they started firing. When you're in the battleground, all moralities go out the window. Yet, I did not throw a single stone at anyone and I am proud of that. I remained with the group who were peacefully protesting infront of the army van, I helped people with water to wash their face, tried picking up litters. The main point is I tried being a responsible person. But the moment I saw people being carried to the hospital with their blood spattering the streets, I fucking lost it. In retaliation, my protests became more louder. I came home late at night, tried my best to repost as many information I could. At one point, I felt like people should burn down the entire ministry down, all these nepo-babies should be brought to the streets to teach their parents how it feels to kill someone's child. I was furious, the word being an understatement. But seeing this people getting mob justice was what I never wanted.

            "heading": "The Shrinkhala Khatiwada I knew at Harvard",
            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada‚Äôs classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.¬†  We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking‚Äìmuch to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in¬† Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate -¬†the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala‚Äôs approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.¬†  Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn‚Äôt mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‚Äòhelp‚Äô. One time, she even said airily, ‚ÄúI wash my own dishes, you know.‚Äù She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala‚Äìa beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth‚Äìlingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don‚Äôt intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‚Äònepo babies‚Äô who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).¬†  Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It‚Äôs a troubling idea to think that despite what‚Äôs happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

And a few after she became miss nepal... I can somewhat vouch for the \"I'm busy with this and that... Can you help me with this\" part...

I never liked her naak ma singan adke jasto boli.. And always felt she has a cunning personality that clings over you until she can no more use you for her advantage..  Sisan literally dodged a  bullet.. all thanks to her greed though..|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn‚Äôt some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake ‚Äúbeauty with brains‚Äù narrative. Do you guys remember Niti‚Äôs big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let‚Äôs not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala‚Äôs prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it‚Äôs her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let‚Äôs be real- Sisan wasn‚Äôt perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they‚Äôd known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn‚Äôt even exist. This just proves it- they weren‚Äôt just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can‚Äôt just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala‚Äôs career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav‚Äôs narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What‚Äôs the lesson we can learn from here ?

Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don‚Äôt even make sense to begin with. Don‚Äôt know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don‚Äôt even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It‚Äôs so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It‚Äôs astounding what the world has come to and it‚Äôs deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can‚Äôt be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn‚Äôt she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It‚Äôs better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has. It‚Äôs disheartening!|||I‚Äôve realized just how cunning and calculative she really is. Nothing feels natural with her. Every move, every word, every connection seems like part of a bigger calculation. While most people get dragged through the mud on social media, she somehow stays a step ahead. Of all platforms, she was clever enough to pull the LinkedIn card first. That‚Äôs not by accident, it‚Äôs calculation. She knows the bashing on Tiktok or Instagram doesn‚Äôt matter as long as her professional side stays spotless, especially where she might work with people internationally who will never know the side of her life in Nepal that‚Äôs been exposed and torn apart ever since the truth came out.  It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs playing this endless game of Ludo, always climbing the ladder, polishing her image as she goes. But at the same time, you can‚Äôt help but feel she‚Äôs only ever a roll away from hitting 98 and sliding right back down the snake.|||Correct my if I‚Äôm wrong guys, but shrinkhala father was health minister covid time, I heard tyo time ma vaccine ma ra health sector ma eka dum corruption bhaykeo thiyo.

These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised.

And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field.

Miss World organization saw through her, so didn't let her go to the final round. There is no substance in her words and it  sounds exactly like a politician speech.

So how did she funded her education considering Harvard which is an ivy league school is extremely costly and on top of that, her lifestyle itself is on the high end. So..  In that case, even you since you studied in Harvard. How did you fund your education?  Just curious. A reply will be great since there are hundred of replies.|||Remember that education in Nepal is based on how well you do...based on your caste. I have heard that a lot of exams are predetermined by the ruling caste. This corruption is so bad that even well-educated people are falsely given a bad grade.

Does somebody have that?|||Thanks for sharing your raw and real experience, thoughts and opinion. This is valuable for those of us who were shocked and skeptical about her success right from the day she got into limelight. I watched her view on Youtube yesterday and couldn't get past a minute of that video, she is clearly playing victim and trying to play the game.  Nope! she doesn't deserve any chance at all.  The students that I know personally who went to Harvard, MIT and many other prestigious institutions had grit, determination, belief in hard-work, may be little bit of luck but most of all they had \"humility\". They NEVER used their \"Harvard degree\" or Ivy league label to show off. It's those who want to fame and fake pride that put up social media posts to show off their diplomas. Honestly, it was very very clear even before she went to Harvard that she was on the wrong side of fame game.  For the longest time I thought it was a generational difference, since there are many other Harvard students who have publicized themselves in several Youtube videos and they are all Gen Z, and as a Gen Y (Millennial) observing this trend seemed justifiable.  However, Shrinkhala was building a house of cards and the fact that she had the audacity to publicize and put Sambhav Sirohiya in the limelight using Harvard freebies was just laughable a few years ago.  Like you pointed out, the fact that she still has 900K followers is troubling for sure but let's hope those are just her fake followers (some % are bought/in-organic followers, some her closest elite allies like \"Other Miss Nepals/ Businessmen/political affiliates etc. and some her enemies) as they say, **keep your friends close and enemies closer.**|||keep exposing|||Why it is always about shrinkhala, I am never going to vote her for her being at Harvard! Propoganda,?|||Am I the only one who cant believe that she got 3 crore just from collaborating with brands. Like I get it that she had 1M followers but she wasn't really like an influencer. How could she claim that she is the most influential person in Nepal. If she actually got 3 crore then maybe I should also be an influencer.|||I would have asked for proof instead of baseless allegations, but with the level of vocabulary you chose I guess excludes the question.|||First of all, there was no government scholarship. She lied to you guys so she could appear smart. She has now publicly claimed that she paid her tuition with her influencer income. But we all know where the money came from.|||Why isn‚Äôt anyone asking her this - how much taxes did you pay in 3 crore income? Income at this level is taxed at 39% in Nepal. Don't try to fool us - the taxes are supposed to be paid by you, not by the brands as you claimed. I want to see your tax returns. You claimed to be honest and talked about corporations evading taxes several times in your interviews. Can you show us that you paid income taxes for the money you claimed you earned as an influencer?|||People beware of believing everything you read on Reddit.

The internet is dangerous and anyone can sit behind a screen make up stories and try to drag someone down just for attention. if you are really who you claim to be and if what you re saying about her is real then u need to show somethin that make sense. we need actual proof that you're a real person and that your story is true. and to be clear i 'am not asking for private or sensitive information i 'am asking for verifiable proof that doesn't expose personal data. post something that proves you are real AND U ACTUALLY KNEW HER not just a vouge words from behind an anonymous screen's.  you could show a public Harvard profile or alumni directory link with your name on it or simple photo of a Harvard ID or an official enrollment or graduation letter. without something like that, this is just baseless gossip. the internet is full of people who spread lies to ruin others, and that's exactly why nobody should take your words seriously without real evidence. if you truly care about the truth you'd stand behind your claims publicly. otherwise, what you're saying is just another reminder of how dangerous and misleading the internet can be when people use it to spread rumors without accountability.|||Give us some proof OP.

I think her winning Ms Nepal helped; also her access to many social works would have helped with her application. But still getting into Harvard is not a small feat- so she must have some intellectual capacity to get picked by the best educational institutions in the world.|||All I can say here is that who ever wrote this has poor English and I am doubtful he/she/they attended Harvard.|||Your views on her seem completely emotion-based, lacking any factual concreteness. They exude your bitterness towards her. I think you envy her followers ( which you have mentioned a lot) and her beauty, its common for ugly people to have this jealousy. Her prowess is enough to get admitted into Harvard and she also has a private architecture company. You creating a burner account to throw dirt at her shows your pettiness as well.|||So she was just like an ordinary college student like all of us, so what if she wasn‚Äôt a studious/intellectual kid, still she was an opportunist, many of us are & maybe that turned out in her favour. And there is nothing wrong with this. She was a title holder that‚Äôs why she could be getting benefited after that. Plus, getting into Harvard is not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea no matter how much money one wishes to spend. Frankly speaking, linking her Harvard degree with nepotism& corruption is making ordinary people like us into more likely believing her part of the story. Targeting her is only gonna make her more famous, still 900k+ followers believe her part. She is getting sympathy from people as people are still forgetting about the real agenda and getting jealous about her getting into Harvard.|||i mean knowing she did try to contribute to nepal rest of the thing was from the breakup scandal right , i don't know about the beauty though everyon is beautiful you try to find it !!!the system will surely benefit her , but a lot of people are unaware of transparecy can't connect the dot in larger scale if she can do great things with her face that has been blessed and for the achievement sh won once title ie miss nepal, she should do great things for the nation in upcoming years and time and hope she get equal value from the scandals!! and serve !!!|||[deleted]|||Still Beautiful though",

Even if they have the intention and will to do so (like many of us want), they do not know how to run a country.

The thing is they have a lot more to learn and they will, with time.       This situation would not have happened if there were transfer of power to youth in timely manner. Now the rising youth leaders do not have experience because these corrupt politicians did not allow that.      What we need is a system where corruption should now be absolutely dreaded, seeing how corrupt politicians had to run away for thier life. They have to realize that people will not just punish the corrupt polticians, they will also punish whoever was responsible to prevent that.       There now needs to be a collaborative development with young leaders like Balen and experienced people like Sushila.

I truly want Sushila Karki to be prime minister, but according to our constitution it's not possible. And if we ditch our constitution our country is open for invasion from other countries. So, what's the best option it's BALEN. I know that he won't be able to run for prime minister for the next election but it is a risk we have to take. It's already proven that our protest was the result of different politicians 'parties'involvement. So, let's play it safe and try to choose the best result for us. Already many Indian politicians are saying that they are ready to deploy an army if needed. It's not goodwill but an invasion. So it's best we know what we do for the country.  But if it's possible for her to be prime minister without disturbing our constitution then I'm all for it. I also want a good leader who will work for the development of the country.   Indian is already eyeing the district like Lipilekh and Limpadhura. If we take too long to make a responsible decision, they are favourites to win the case.   The country is already in chaos. So we must do our best to calm it down. We protested against corruption and got unexpected results. We are not ready for it. And we don't have time to think about it and make a decision. But, we must make a decision and make it work, isn't it all there is to it ?    It's not that I don't support \"Sushila Karki\" . She has my full support. But if it is disturbing our core rules set by our constitution. I just thought it isn't right. So it's my request all my fellow citizens ( not just gen-z ) to make a right decision.   But my final warning is that if we defy our current constitution ourselves. It will not be a suprise other countries take advantage of it. So we shall make a decision ourselves and take the best route possible. But you've my support to make her ( Sushila Karki) intrim prime minister. It is the best result seeing her experience on political field.   It might have been a bit long for the attention span of gen-z but i just want to say that, neither the constitution nor the national rules be any shorter üòä.

Personally I have next to no clue who Sumana is, and normally I'd think that makes her a good candidate because there's nothing but positive vibes so far. I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both.

She is the one who has been abroad for so long and has so many foreign connections and relations that even if she  doesn't want interference, there will be far more foreign interference with her as a leader.  We can not deny that .   3. Sumana did absolutely nothing as a health minister apart from stunts. Ministers are supposed to amend laws and execute them. could have done so much more .   4.

BTW, Gen Z doesn‚Äôt just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didn‚Äôt exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who weren‚Äôt even present for the protests claim we don‚Äôt know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldn‚Äôt even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, ‚ÄòWe have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server you‚Äôre all listening to is just for public discussion‚Äô. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal.

They are hot blooded. They can do anything with teen minds.  Look at your genZ, destroying their own land...  GenZ is a popular word on the internet.  Now whenever you talk about GenZ people will remember this amount of brutalism and rage against their own land own assets.|||**What next? thoughts from a fellow Gen Z**    The motherland burns, my heart aches, my mind ponders, is all hope lost? My soul hurts to see violence, arson, anarchy, and the loot and burning of our national properties. We, Gen-Z, seem to have won, yet feel lost. Hope feels lost. Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? I‚Äôve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we can‚Äôt let our nation fail.** We can‚Äôt let our nation burn. We can‚Äôt let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**¬†    **1) We lay down our weapons.**¬†  We came in peace, we protested in peace, and we‚Äôve always wanted peace. We shall end this in peace. Be it known that anybody inciting violence isn‚Äôt part of our movement.¬†    **2) We extend love.**¬†  Love towards our brothers and sisters, love towards our nation, love towards our neighbours, our society, and the opposing side. The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.¬†    **3) We wear white.**¬†  White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that we‚Äôve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.¬†    **4) We have hope.**¬†  Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.¬†    Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.¬†    Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.¬†    Sincerely,¬†  Pantji, a Gen-Z¬†|||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger.

The crowd going crazy is the result of fustration building towards government and the younger generations seeing nothing for them in nepal.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Why not sagar Dhakal?|||Yesss|||Just promote it in your social media handle|||K bhairacha yarr discord ma pm choose bhairacha|||Ahile non political manxe thik huncha...her or Dr ‡§∏‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Å‡§ï Ruit.

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen.

I beg that we don't dilute the blood spent in the last 48 years to any conspiracy.  ‡§ú‡•á ‡§≠‡§Ø‡•ã, ‡§ó‡§≤‡§§ ‡§≠‡§Ø‡•ã ‡•§ ‡§π‡§æ‡§Æ‡•Ä‡§≤‡•á ‡§π‡§ø‡§ú‡•ã‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ò‡§ü‡§®‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§¨‡§æ‡§ü ‡§Ü‡§Æ ‡§®‡•á‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§®‡§æ‡§ó‡§∞‡§ø‡§ï‡§ï‡•ã ‡§Æ‡§®‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§ø‡§§‡§ø ‡§≠‡•Å‡§ú‡•ç‡§Ø‡•å‡§Ç, ‡§π‡§æ‡§Æ‡•Ä‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§ù‡•à ‡§™‡§®‡§ø ‡§∏‡•Å‡§ù‡§¨‡•Å‡§ù ‡§õ‡•à‡§® ‡§≠‡§®‡•á‡§∞ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡§æ‡§£‡§ø‡§§ ‡§ó‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡•å‡•§  ‡§§‡§∞ ‡§Ö‡§¨ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§ó‡§∞‡•ç‡§®‡•á ‡§≠‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡•á ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∂‡•ç‡§® ‡§Æ‡§π‡§§‡•ç‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§£ ‡§õ - ‡§Ö‡§¨ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§õ‡§≤‡§´‡§≤ ‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∏‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§π‡•Å‡§®‡•Å ‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§õ ‡§ú‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•ã ‡§≤‡§æ‡§ó‡•ç‡§õ‡•§  We need law and order to end this chaos otherwise opportunists will prevail.

One for the 165 candidates who are elected directly (first-past-the-post), other for the party. The votes that party gets determine the remaining 110 members via proportional representation.  so aba either we need new political parties to replace the existing ones by Falgun 21, or we have to vote for the same parties again. This is more complicated because Nepal is not just Kathmandu. The political players which we have termed jholey will be active outside Kathmandu.

But that doesn't mean I have direct ties with them. JHOLEY and BHEDA is a noun that defines people who blindly believe in a person or a political party.      Talking about myself, I am already 36, a father and I am thinking of raising my family here in Nepal. I was totally against going abroad as a student when there was trend to do so. But the political system was never stable here. However, This current GenZ revolution happened against corruption. We indeed got a good progress against these corrupt leaders. But things turned out to be different and here is my roller coaster of emotions. Please let me know if you can relate to this.  Day 0: Social Media Ban - Mixed feelings. Hopeful that social medias will proceed further with registration.  Day 1: GenZ revolution and killing - Lots of anger. Disappointment and discontent.  Day 2: Revolution, excited and happy till 4 PM, until we destroyed the party system. Once the public started destroying Singha Durbar, I came to realize what I had done. I started a fire that I can't extinguish.  Day 3: Realization of the revolution being hijacked. We were just against corruption, regime change was not our motto. The revolution gradually turned into a COLOR REVOLUTION.  Day 4: Worried about who will lead the country. Started mentally supporting Balen/Rabi or any young leader. Furious, since the army asked GenZ to come up with a leader. Finally Hami Nepal, some guys funded by Deep state along with Sanduk Ruit and Swarnim Wagle came into light. They started talking about regime change and Constitution change. They said they directly want to select Zelensky as their prime minister.   Day 5: Much more disappointed as some kids who are aiming to go abroad for future study is electing prime minister through Discord. Sushila Karki elected as PM. Which is some sort of relief. I feared a autocrat.  Day 6 - Day 7: China is yet to acknowledge PM Sushila Karki. China is suspecting foul play as KP Oli had been to SCO and all of this happened just after that.      Now I am very much in distress. I feel that, Nepal is Ukraine. Balen is the new Zelensky and China is the new Russia. I dont want to think negatively but the situation ahead seems to be very dark and we will have to take steps cautiously. There are a lot of hatred here and Social medias are fueling it. None of the GenZ were born during the writing of the constitution. There were lots of revolution that was endured by current revolution Maoist Revolution, Madesh Revolution etc. But now it seems everything has gone to waste and there is no constitution here in the country. Is this PTSD?|||Its not true narrative this is all funded by cia|||Nepal, you are dealing with dangerous, insecure, violent crybullies who don't care about reasons and motives because they'll just come up with fake news and use that is their motive.

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not ‚Äúrevolution,‚Äù it‚Äôs not ‚Äújustice,‚Äù and it sure as hell isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe voice of the people.‚Äù It‚Äôs mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn‚Äôt make you brave‚Äîit makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that‚Äîsurrounded by a wave of so-called ‚Äúyouths‚Äù who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let‚Äôs not sugarcoat it‚Äîthe so-called Gen Z ‚Äúwarriors‚Äù hiding in the mob weren‚Äôt heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country‚Äôs social fabric. He still can‚Äôt step foot in certain countries because he‚Äôs internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he‚Äôs propped up as a ‚Äúleader.‚Äù  Let‚Äôs be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn‚Äôt an accident‚Äîit was a setup. While Deuba‚Äôs family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don‚Äôt get it twisted‚Äîthose sharpshooters in the crowd weren‚Äôt just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres‚Äîformer insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let‚Äôs stop pretending this was ‚Äúthe people rising up.‚Äù It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist‚Äîthe one who drowned this nation in blood‚Äîwalks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don‚Äôt for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn‚Äôt that Deuba suffered humiliation‚Äîthe real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn‚Äôt a flower; he‚Äôs a weed choking the soil of Nepal‚Äôs democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too na√Øve to realize they‚Äôre being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||CIA & India Agents involved in chaos!

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4. Retirement age and term limits: This is a must, we need a clear retirement age for the public positions just like other jobs.     These sort of things are fundamental of any country, without getting the fundamentals right we cannot expect our country to do better. We have a chance to make things better, lets take this chance.|||also i think! what lessons can be learned from Bangladesh last year?|||Garni nai ho vani presidency system lyauni.

Just wanted to express supreme respect to you from Ukraine.   You're really cool!   We had protests in 2014.   We made lot of mistakes after succeded in throwing down Yanukovich in 2014. War with Russia after that happened that helped corrupted politicians a lot. After five years people were tricked and during war elected complete scammers after watching \"servant of nation\" series with current president in main role.   Now we get kidnapping peoples on streets by police and conscripted forcely to war or you can get out for $10k until kidnapped next time. People get beaten and sometimes murdered in basements by military guys supported by police.   Escaping from country costs minimum $10k, but sometimes 20 and more just for crossing border without guarantees of success.   Or some peoples are going \\~100km through wild forests to escape country hunted by border guards with drones. Some succeed, some die.

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

They belittled the Bangladesh protests similarly and painted it as Muslims vs Hindus in Bangladesh. They paint a high opinion of the fugitive Shaik Hasina but curse Nobel laureate Mohammed Yunus. Indian media is the judge, jury and executioner of all the happenings in Nepal, Bangladesh, Srilanka and Pakistan. According to them, India is Ramarajya but others were Raavan rajya. India has become a dead democracy in the past decade. We have no jobs, extremely costly education and no health. We are just scrapping by but nothing to show as the media paints cooked up Indian GDP.

A shift to a fully directly elected system for every seat would ensure greater accountability and public representation. 2. **Establish a Directly Elected Executive Head:**¬†Instead of the parliament choosing the Prime Minister, the call is for a directly elected President or Prime Minister with full executive powers. This would provide a stable government for a fixed term, preventing the \"share-the-power\" politics that have led to instability.|||Also follow what's in constitution, according to constitution of Nepal, people outside of Nepal should be able to vote through embassy, but in reality we can't.|||No regegnation, country out|||So y'all are asking for resignation after kids dead in their school uniform.

It‚Äôs tragic, because they also have families back home and face the same struggles as the rest of us. They should be victims of this system too, yet they show little compassion or critical thought about what‚Äôs happening around them. Why are there protests in the first place? I refuse to believe they're blind to people's frustration and the direction the country is heading.  I still remember when we joined a protest 14‚Äì15 years ago. The police confronted us aggressively, and as kids we were too confused to react. Fortunately, we just stood there processing and visibly confused, and they left ‚Äî but I still shudder to think, *what if our reaction had been different?* Today‚Äôs young protestors are in the same position, pure in their intentions, simply voicing frustration without wanting harm.  And honestly, credit must go to these protestors. They know exactly what they are standing for, unlike us back then who needed adults to organise us. I don‚Äôt see how demonstrations could be any more peaceful than they already are ‚Äî especially when the very leaders being protested against have blood on their hands from before this generation was even born.|||Yo bhatey haru kahi gayera sitcha holani|||randi baan machikne haru|||I mean this tracks, they only like when you're corrupt|||Its not andolan anymore its war|||We want death or at lease exile of KP Oli and other taukes.|||Randi haruko photo, name, address patta lagau.|||shamelss dogs of government|||Machikne radi harlai lakhetdai marnaparne|||Thuiyaa police vanauda haruuu|||you radiko ban harulai agolauno man xa|||ma sanga pani ganhune bhaye, kassam mardinthe radieekko ban|||Mathi bata aako order re ????

It‚Äôs simple.|||Disclaimer: I am not a Balen supporter or cultist.  This post is conflicting for me. But, the post is characterizing the man based on:  1. What the man didn‚Äôt do or didn‚Äôt say. 2. What people expected him to do.  The man himself has said enough in his posts.   It‚Äôs what, he DIDN‚ÄôT do that impresses me the most about him. Saying ‚ÄúNo‚Äù is harder than saying ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, when everyone wanted him to say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.  (Think about this.)  He put out only a couple of posts, which I think served as guide posts during the revolution.   1. He was the first widely known public figure (that I know) who defined who Gen Z was and gave his support to the protest. 2. When the tempo rose, he clarified that Gen Z should lead, he accepted Sushila even when all of his cultists were going crazy about making him the interim PM.  Removing himself from the picture, brought focus back on the revolution and the task ahead, rather than turn the confusion situation, even more confusing with a popularity contest as a side gig.   There is a lot of things to think about and I think in time we can all make sense of it all.   That‚Äôs my two paisa about him.|||Leading KTM municipality vs leading the nation are totally different. The followers of Balen urging and rushing him to lead 'right now' and come out by 2PM are the same people who will criticize him within one year if he were to be them PM someday. They don't have patience and want to see changes immediately.  Personally, I would like to see him running in the upcoming election as deputy/vice roles first and not immediate PM role...assuming how parties will be formed and if there are any good lead independent candidate who will run with him. He's one of those few worthy to be PM but this is not his peak yet. He just became a mayor like 3 years ago and he still has a lot to show to the general public. If and when he wins to the election, it will be his peak and he has high chances of being a two term PM...assuming two term limit will be in place hopefully. Time will tell.|||GenZ aren't immune to celeb worship culture.|||Hami Nepal has already stated it was part of a plan and they want balen for 5 years.

Yes it is definitely an opportunistic behaviour by balen. But how is this behaviour wrong and how is taking over PM position now and securing interim govt now and not taking part in politics for next 5 years do any good to the country.    He is practicing patience to achieve the goal he desires and what people actually wants from a young leader like him. Look throughout the history of world politics, paitence has always been the key factor to shape the world politics.|||Having trusted by many even me,In the moment of national threat, he could do nothing.

He‚Äôs doing such a great thing in the valley, but being a Prime Minister is very responsible post, his way up talking to seniors, saying I will put fire to SinghaDurbar, I will bury everyone if you‚Äôre in tudinkhel, getting carried away by emotions, being Prime Minister means you should not be carried away by any emotions and none of the factors should affect your judgment which you believe to be true and is lawful, Hopefully he will make such changes and we can finally see him in the top, as much as I want him to be the Prime Minister I do think he is inexperienced and immature in this field,|||We are so far behind that criticizing political leader sounds like a hater.

For the past decade, the corrupted 3 have been playing nothing but tato aloo with us so its natural to be sticking nail to current situation. Give it some time and our voices will get echoed.|||If there‚Äôs one thing old political leaders never learned, it was how to handle criticism. The moment anyone spoke up, they tried to shut it down and let‚Äôs not even start on the behavior of their hardcore supporters(jholey as we call them).  Even leaders like Balen need to address this with their own supporters, as do all the new representatives entering the upcoming elections. They must say publicly that they welcome criticism, will reflect on it, and use it as a tool for improvement. Leaders should make it clear to their base: don‚Äôt bully or silence people for simply asking questions or raising concerns. Do not perform character assassination against someone just for criticizing. After all, in a democracy, freedom of speech is our right.  At the same time, we the general public also carry responsibility. We need to recognize the difference between constructive criticism and defamation. What we must not do is fall for propaganda, spread rumors, or engage in baseless character assassination.  And if we realize that our criticism or questioning was wrong, we should have the courage to apologize in the same way we raised the question. After all, apologizing will never make you small. It‚Äôs just a simple five letter word: ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù A word that can and should be spoken from both sides.|||Just because you‚Äôre against the system, doesn‚Äôt make you Balen-Supporters. Balen has no experience. Balen should wait and gain some experience. Criticism is a backbone of democracy and one must welcome it.|||EXACTLY. They lack this ability to critically analyse any action of any leader. Like no one is perfect and no one is a good. Let's be honest. Let's criticize people for their actions. People should be held accountable for their actions. Most importantly, leaders who run our nation. If we don't point out their wrongdoings, will they ever stop? Nepalese have such a bheda mindset, istg. Let's be more aware and let's know how to discern leaders and their actions.   By criticizing these leaders, we aren't hating on them. We're trying to bring awareness so that they won't repeat the same thing again and can do things better for the country.|||They need to be aware party KO jhole become jhole because they were andabhakt of party leader ( just like they are blind follower of balen rn)|||I think holding politicians accountable is crucial.

I see people thanking Balen for this movement and saying he was the reason this movement happened and succeeded and all after Sushila Karki became interim PM, and this made me very sad for actual people who started the movement and also faced the consequences and this was even more big realization for me for how blind youth and supporters these days are and this concerns me even more for future|||This. This is what I‚Äôve been saying for some time. Like the post says, I‚Äôve also been labeled as a party ko jhole and what not. Even here in this sub, people have called me jhole lol just because I questioned him.  I am a Balen supporter. I supported him and did my part by sharing about his campaign on social media and making everyone aware about it. And I was super happy when he won, I still am. But I‚Äôve been criticizing him on various points that I find valid. The top one is communication.  During the election, he constantly criticized Bidya Sundar (the previous mayor) for not communicating publicly. He even said that once he became mayor, he wouldn‚Äôt be like that and would stay in constant touch. He proposed starting a ‚ÄòMayor with the Public‚Äô TV program and even set aside a budget for it, but nothing has happened. He hasn‚Äôt given a single interview.  And then come his jhole supporters who always argue with the same line: ‚ÄòPailai kei chaieko ho.‚Äô With that logic, we should never question anyone. Just look at how Balen has become now, he just posts one-sided, no-context Facebook statuses and nothing else.|||Balen is a hypocrite in my opinion, like he encouraged the protest and even promised to provide a safe and secure environment for the protest but when things turned south he vanished like horn from a donkeys head|||Finally someone spoke about this, belun has literally become a god complex among some people out there, which is kinda concerning, the only time he speaks is to not let his adhabhatka interfere in every other stuff out there.

Moreover, Sagar Dhakal‚Äôs brother has been working actively to eradicate the dictatorship of these political parties. Maybe your parents are bootlicking those rotten political parties, so you only see what Balen has never done and will never do. Just because he supported the movement does not mean he said he wants to become prime minister. You must understand that he posts only a few things because his words are weapons. One word from him has many consequences in such a movement. He is very clever and very wise; unlike Harka Sampang, though I like Harka as a person.

It runs on power. Until you understand this, you‚Äôll not understand the situation. And those who understand this controls the narrative. Our country is so at the bottom of the barrel, we don‚Äôt need much of foreign resources to be infiltrated, mind-bended. Sudan stance, I don‚Äôt know his clear motives of against or with the country. But I‚Äôm sure even he does not know he‚Äôs a small puppet planted/invested long ago. Usually foreign powers will not directly direct its agenda, especially for the country at the bottom of the barrel they do not have the time to do so. You just give them small aid, support for us, for them simple investment, which they just got good return this time, especially now east is rising its economy. You just need to nudge them, give them support they will do their good vs evil thing which any human will do. Think about it, nobody was going forward with stance like him to take on some kind of leader role, because we do not have that power (support) and as human we fear unknown.  You might think I‚Äôm thinking too much of this. Well, I can‚Äôt argue you, because I do not know for sure, but this is my stance and most probable thing I saw.",

Your country has been too kind to me whenever I visit.

The revolution as your history will always call it has got its results. I know all is not done you need reforms you need an accountable government. But ask yourself aren't you going overboard now? Literally the whole government has given in and the most possible situation is the army going to take over. Please keep the situation such that the army or any other entity doesn't get the excuse to deny people of their right to rule themselves. This is not  new,  when a revolution with a purpose overshoots give the power mongerers an opportunity to come forward and exploit that. A mob when acting like this is too dangerous.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**¬†The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**¬†If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**¬†If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**¬†If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

This has been ongoing for more than two decades. Behind the few visible figures, there are countless others who have either assisted them or benefitted through their association‚Äîranging from major brands in Nepal to traders. For example, Sher Bahadur Deuba‚Äôs son and his sanitary pad importing company stand as an illustration.  They have institutionalized corruption by appointing foreign ambassadors based on party loyalty and financial gains, extending even to the transfer of bureaucrats to preferred locations in exchange for bribes and other undue benefits. The problem is not limited to the political system alone; bureaucrats, too, require checks and balances. A mechanism must be established to regulate the power of bureaucrats over politicians. Since bureaucrats are permanent stakeholders, their influence is even greater. One effective way to mitigate this is to appoint domain experts as ministers‚Äîfor instance, a professional civil engineer as a minister cannot be misled about the cost estimates of a construction project.  There remains much to be done. Moreover, these political parties will attempt to form alliances before elections, bringing forward the same candidates and restoring the same exploitative system. Therefore, the first and most meaningful reform must be a change in the electoral process, with the inclusion of a ‚ÄúNOTA‚Äù (None of the Above) option.  Further accountability can be ensured by eliminating political appointments to certain positions. At present, even temporary (karar) appointments are made based on party affiliation rather than merit. As a result, even highly qualified experts are compelled to seek political approval. The recent appointments of Vice-Chancellors at B.P. Koirala Institute in Dharan and Gangalal Hospital are prime examples.  In addition to these issues, several other structural flaws persist. What we urgently require is a comprehensive systemic reform|||Gen Z laid them in the grave, and now they're shoveling the dirt themselves.|||# How to make Gen Z movement bullet proof ?

Anything you write remotely close against Maoist terrorist party or nice about 'Monarky', or say anything about the mod. Your post will be immediately banned.

Like I suspected, There seems to be group of Maoist sympathizing insurgents in most of the nepalese subreddit with Communistic Ideologies who will get your post banned or Comment deleted by group reporting if it doesnt align with their thoughts and who will like their own comments to make it look like they are saying meaningful when they are not.",

Villagers depended on landlords for loans, justice, and protection, which kept exploitation unchallenged (Kamaiya, Haruwa-Charuwa, Haliya systems).

Every politicians are coming back like it was never happened ani haami ? Haami pani kei na kei !!|||What happened to the Deuba family wasn‚Äôt just unfair‚Äîit was an orchestrated humiliation carried out in the most cowardly way possible. Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not ‚Äúrevolution,‚Äù it‚Äôs not ‚Äújustice,‚Äù and it sure as hell isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe voice of the people.‚Äù It‚Äôs mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn‚Äôt make you brave‚Äîit makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that‚Äîsurrounded by a wave of so-called ‚Äúyouths‚Äù who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let‚Äôs not sugarcoat it‚Äîthe so-called Gen Z ‚Äúwarriors‚Äù hiding in the mob weren‚Äôt heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country‚Äôs social fabric. He still can‚Äôt step foot in certain countries because he‚Äôs internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he‚Äôs propped up as a ‚Äúleader.‚Äù  Let‚Äôs be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn‚Äôt an accident‚Äîit was a setup. While Deuba‚Äôs family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don‚Äôt get it twisted‚Äîthose sharpshooters in the crowd weren‚Äôt just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres‚Äîformer insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let‚Äôs stop pretending this was ‚Äúthe people rising up.‚Äù It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist‚Äîthe one who drowned this nation in blood‚Äîwalks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don‚Äôt for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn‚Äôt that Deuba suffered humiliation‚Äîthe real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn‚Äôt a flower; he‚Äôs a weed choking the soil of Nepal‚Äôs democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too na√Øve to realize they‚Äôre being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||Prachanda and Baburam are India's puppet.

People watched her speech where she said stuff like, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?‚Äù  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still don‚Äôt have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we don‚Äôt have the right connections.  We don‚Äôt get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, it‚Äôs still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? That‚Äôs probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  We‚Äôre out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor people‚Äôs kids not boil?  On top of that, there‚Äôs already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent. Because this have  been suppressed for so long, and now the mindset is like ‚Äî ‚ÄúIf we can‚Äôt reach anywhere through the system, then we might as well destroy it.‚Äù  And even if some third party tries to trigger people, the truth is, it was already there deep down in their subconscious. This is just it coming out. Right now it feels new, but honestly, it was bound to happen sooner or later.|||No Shit Sherlock (You guys got  manipulated into doing the wrong thing) üòî|||Sherey ko choro lai dhulai diye ki nai ?|||Each Hilton hotel employees 400+ Nepalese nationals üòÇ what about the people that lost their jobs?|||https://preview.redd.it/muoumzxh6eof1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63da78ae8b2a74c1f669dc95f01e062ff9e299b0|||https://preview.redd.it/rjynwvrk6eof1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04a5f8cbe1243c2dfca73c29dea57aa5425243bf|||We could‚Äôve turned this into Hospital but Nope|||This is an absolutely great work revolution.|||Aur Karo money money wali gand masti|||if you make a good system and government now that‚Äòs important!

U all r pretty blinded by jealousy and his popularity. Only in a lifetime we get such leader. He‚Äôs not quite and shy like Kulman who was loathing when he got fired and insulted from his job, Harka is just an Enigmatic person and leader!

(**Bank run**¬†is a situation where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a bank simultaneously, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or financial stability. This can lead to liquidity problems for the bank, as it may not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands. Bank runs can create a cycle of panic, potentially leading to the bank's failure.)  The real pain starts after the protests have calmed. Economic crash is certain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh both went through it. Stock market/real estate crash, inflation and what not.  Whoever takes charge next, likely Balen, will need to address the pointless 'Greater Nepal' rhetoric and become a moderate on this issue. Thanks to Trump, India-China relationship is stable for the first time in ages. The only way Nepal has a future is pledge allegiance to both neighbour's.  Bangladesh under Yunus has been a pain in the ass for India. Nepal cannot make the same mistake. Any wrong steps and a free floating Nepali rupee against the dollar would go from 140 now to 25,000 like similar countries in our GDP range. Probably worse since our economy is in much worse shape. ($1 = Lao Kip 21,631.66 LAK)  Nepal needs one stable leader for the next 40 yrs. No interim gov paving way for elections bullshit. Forget the democracy experiment.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.¬†¬† Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.¬†¬† Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||How credible is this info?|||Use bitchat for conversation.

            "comments": "We are living in a moment where anger is boiling over. People are tired of corruption, censorship, and being silenced. Many of us are ready to take to the streets on Sept 8. But before we move forward, we must stop and think carefully.  History has shown us what happens when we rush in without preparation. In Bangladesh last year, in Sri Lanka not long ago, ordinary people gave their lives while corrupt leaders fled the country with protection and comfort. Their deaths were forgotten within weeks, while the guilty walked free. If we are not careful, Nepal risks becoming the next chapter in that same tragic story.  That is why this movement must be different. We cannot afford to be reckless. We must protect our people, keep our voices peaceful, and make sure the world is watching every step so that accountability cannot be erased.  Here is what we need to do before Sept 8:  * Get international human rights groups, UN observers, and peace monitors involved beforehand so there are eyes on the ground. * Publish clear and peaceful agendas so nobody can label us as rioters or mobs. * Document everything with photos, videos, and testimonies. Every arrest and every injury must be recorded and shared. * Avoid following local leaders who are affiliated with political parties. Big parties will try to infiltrate, hijack, and twist this movement for their own gain. * Know who is truly standing beside you. Trust matters because infiltrators can turn peaceful protests into chaos.  This movement is about dignity, rights, and accountability. It is not about violence. It is not about revenge. If we lose focus, if we let anger replace strategy, then we risk repeating the same cycle where the powerful walk free and ordinary people pay with their lives.  Nepal deserves better. The world must see us not as mobs, but as citizens united for freedom and justice. If we do this right, our voices will be impossible to silence. If we do this wrong, we risk being forgotten like so many before us.  Stay safe. Stay peaceful. Stay smart.",

She is the daughter of Chabi Rijal, a communist leader and Chief District Officer in Nepal, who recently ordered a shoot-on-sight against youth peacefully protesting corruption in Nepal. His orders have killed over 18 innocent people, injured more than 100 students, and more deaths are expected. This is pure fascism and a gross misuse of power. Young people in a peaceful protest were shot dead, which is totally unacceptable. While our brothers and sisters die in Nepal, Sweta Rijal has no right to study in the US with money from corruption. Her entire funding is from the money from corruption. The US, as a democratic country and a voice for the UN, stands for freedom and justice. Allowing her to stay contradicts everything the US represents. We are struggling to fight this battle in Nepal, and she must be held accountable. I urge you to investigate her visa and take necessary action to send her back to Nepal. Regards, Concerned Citizen from Nepal",

Ra aba jhan gen z revolution lai nai sidyauney prayas hudai cha.   So i think we all to think with cool mind. K yestai huna ko lagi yo zenz revolutiok start vayeko ho? If sudin gurung is trying. Why can't we try to support eachother instead of blaming each other??   And No body knows. Since those politicians where chased. They have little chance to establish again.  And the hotel was belonging of politicians son. So, they could have made fake protestor's to do it, to claim insurance?  Why are indian and nepalese are fighting here about this matter?? This isn't time for fighting.   And about destroying properties, there are theories that the protest were hijacked by other political parties. Like wise, about governments offices, they wanted to destroy the proofs of corruptions. And public building and properties was collateral damages for those fake protesters to look it real.   So stop blaming and fighting with each other. Please please please üôèüôèüôèüôèüôè.  And sudin gurung, if you are reading this in anyway, now i hope you have  understood how harka sampang had felt when he was coming forward to save the country and you didn't supported him because of your personal vendetta.

Unless someone takes control. President and Army is supposed to take control in situations like this but Nepal Army Seems too hesitant. There's no government currently . President in hiding and Army doing nothing, when the country actually needs them.    Sigha Durbar, Parliament Building, Supreme Court , all public properties that were not significant monuments but also held importance in history were burned along with all its documents . NO leader has come forward to lead , neither from Gen Z or Balen or Rabi or Harka or even Army. Everyone seems to be in a game of wait and watch and let the anarchy unfold.

            "heading": "The Shrinkhala Khatiwada I knew at Harvard",
            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada‚Äôs classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.¬†  We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking‚Äìmuch to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in¬† Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate -¬†the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala‚Äôs approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.¬†  Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn‚Äôt mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‚Äòhelp‚Äô. One time, she even said airily, ‚ÄúI wash my own dishes, you know.‚Äù She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala‚Äìa beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth‚Äìlingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don‚Äôt intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‚Äònepo babies‚Äô who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).¬†  Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It‚Äôs a troubling idea to think that despite what‚Äôs happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

I never liked her naak ma singan adke jasto boli.. And always felt she has a cunning personality that clings over you until she can no more use you for her advantage..  Sisan literally dodged a  bullet.. all thanks to her greed though..|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn‚Äôt some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake ‚Äúbeauty with brains‚Äù narrative. Do you guys remember Niti‚Äôs big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let‚Äôs not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala‚Äôs prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it‚Äôs her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let‚Äôs be real- Sisan wasn‚Äôt perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they‚Äôd known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn‚Äôt even exist. This just proves it- they weren‚Äôt just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can‚Äôt just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala‚Äôs career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav‚Äôs narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What‚Äôs the lesson we can learn from here ?  Karma is real af & money can‚Äôt give you lifelong happiness, night Redditors|||Wish we had more tea like this on all nepo babies.|||She didn't get any fucking scholarship from the Nepali government.

Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don‚Äôt even make sense to begin with. Don‚Äôt know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don‚Äôt even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It‚Äôs so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It‚Äôs astounding what the world has come to and it‚Äôs deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can‚Äôt be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn‚Äôt she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It‚Äôs better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has. It‚Äôs disheartening!|||I‚Äôve realized just how cunning and calculative she really is. Nothing feels natural with her. Every move, every word, every connection seems like part of a bigger calculation. While most people get dragged through the mud on social media, she somehow stays a step ahead.

I would assume that she was in her best behavior since she was not in Nepal and probably wanted to portray the best of her image.  My moment of disdain for her came about when her father one of the members of the parliament who were on monthly housing allowance along with the monthly pay. The beinfit is probably meant for the MPs who had to move temprorarily to the capital or who didn't have their own residence. Iirc, they had to manually opt in to get that added housing allowance. When the news published, her father's reaction was something along the line of \"I didn't know, I was getting it. I am happy to return it.\"  Question for her, how come you dont know the source of wealth and your parent's ethics?

These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!! And the way she's silent when the country is bleeding says alottt too!!!!!!  And about the Nepal's government scholarship for harvard,this is not true, she is telling an entire different story about harvard scholarsip & how she paid fees there. She said she got 30% scholarship at harvard and the remaining 70% is paid through her brand endorsements money as she is brand ambassador to few company. We didnt buy that story, she tried hardest to sell it though and still fools people with this shitty madeup script about harvard's 30% scholarship & 70% funding through brand endorsement's money lmao. And lately she's being questioned on 50,000USD she got during miss world competition after winning \"beauty with the purpose\" title.

This is valuable for those of us who were shocked and skeptical about her success right from the day she got into limelight. I watched her view on Youtube yesterday and couldn't get past a minute of that video, she is clearly playing victim and trying to play the game.  Nope! she doesn't deserve any chance at all.  The students that I know personally who went to Harvard, MIT and many other prestigious institutions had grit, determination, belief in hard-work, may be little bit of luck but most of all they had \"humility\". They NEVER used their \"Harvard degree\" or Ivy league label to show off. It's those who want to fame and fake pride that put up social media posts to show off their diplomas. Honestly, it was very very clear even before she went to Harvard that she was on the wrong side of fame game.  For the longest time I thought it was a generational difference, since there are many other Harvard students who have publicized themselves in several Youtube videos and they are all Gen Z, and as a Gen Y (Millennial) observing this trend seemed justifiable.  However, Shrinkhala was building a house of cards and the fact that she had the audacity to publicize and put Sambhav Sirohiya in the limelight using Harvard freebies was just laughable a few years ago.  Like you pointed out, the fact that she still has 900K followers is troubling for sure but let's hope those are just her fake followers (some % are bought/in-organic followers, some her closest elite allies like \"Other Miss Nepals/ Businessmen/political affiliates etc. and some her enemies) as they say, **keep your friends close and enemies closer.**|||keep exposing|||Why it is always about shrinkhala, I am never going to vote her for her being at Harvard!

Don't try to fool us - the taxes are supposed to be paid by you, not by the brands as you claimed. I want to see your tax returns.

Plus, getting into Harvard is not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea no matter how much money one wishes to spend. Frankly speaking, linking her Harvard degree with nepotism& corruption is making ordinary people like us into more likely believing her part of the story. Targeting her is only gonna make her more famous, still 900k+ followers believe her part.

You say their work has benefited generations ‚Äúlike me‚Äù but what about the millions still without quality education, clean water, jobs, or justice? If that legacy was truly built for the people, then why does inequality keep growing? Why is access to opportunity still limited to a select few families like yours?  No one is attacking your elders for their hard work but using that work to claim political or social superiority today is exactly the kind of dynastic thinking that holds progress back. Legacies don‚Äôt entitle children to power. Competence, accountability, and public trust do.  You‚Äôre not being attacked, you‚Äôre being questioned. And if your only answer is to call others ‚Äúsmall-minded‚Äù and ‚Äúungrateful,‚Äù then maybe you‚Äôre not as prepared to face criticism as you think. Respect is earned in every generation, not inherited like land or a business.  The days of hiding behind the achievements of the past are over.

I mean gross national happiness instead of gross national product. I believe every single country on this planet should take Bhutan as a role model a little bit more. Where else in the world are citizens asked what their main problems are and what they want from the government? And later, citizens are asked how satisfied they were with the government's performance. I know it's a bit naive of me to make such a suggestion from afar, as a sheltered European who is not really familiar with the form of government in Nepal.

The most expensive clothes, the biggest cars, houses, and palaces. Flying to New York for dinner in a private jet, or to Monaco for F1, or around the globe in a yacht as long as a soccer field. And in the media, they try to appear close to the people, to be there for them, to advance the country by investing in infrastructure or new hospitals, etc. But no, a large part of your taxes ends up with the rulers themselves. The rich and powerful acquire more wealth and more power. Money rules the world!

Even if they have the intention and will to do so (like many of us want), they do not know how to run a country.

The thing is they have a lot more to learn and they will, with time.       This situation would not have happened if there were transfer of power to youth in timely manner. Now the rising youth leaders do not have experience because these corrupt politicians did not allow that.      What we need is a system where corruption should now be absolutely dreaded, seeing how corrupt politicians had to run away for thier life. They have to realize that people will not just punish the corrupt polticians, they will also punish whoever was responsible to prevent that.

I truly want Sushila Karki to be prime minister, but according to our constitution it's not possible. And if we ditch our constitution our country is open for invasion from other countries. So, what's the best option it's BALEN. I know that he won't be able to run for prime minister for the next election but it is a risk we have to take. It's already proven that our protest was the result of different politicians 'parties'involvement. So, let's play it safe and try to choose the best result for us. Already many Indian politicians are saying that they are ready to deploy an army if needed. It's not goodwill but an invasion. So it's best we know what we do for the country.  But if it's possible for her to be prime minister without disturbing our constitution then I'm all for it. I also want a good leader who will work for the development of the country.   Indian is already eyeing the district like Lipilekh and Limpadhura. If we take too long to make a responsible decision, they are favourites to win the case.   The country is already in chaos. So we must do our best to calm it down. We protested against corruption and got unexpected results. We are not ready for it. And we don't have time to think about it and make a decision. But, we must make a decision and make it work, isn't it all there is to it ?    It's not that I don't support \"Sushila Karki\" . She has my full support. But if it is disturbing our core rules set by our constitution. I just thought it isn't right. So it's my request all my fellow citizens ( not just gen-z ) to make a right decision.   But my final warning is that if we defy our current constitution ourselves. It will not be a suprise other countries take advantage of it. So we shall make a decision ourselves and take the best route possible. But you've my support to make her ( Sushila Karki) intrim prime minister. It is the best result seeing her experience on political field.   It might have been a bit long for the attention span of gen-z but i just want to say that, neither the constitution nor the national rules be any shorter üòä.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.¬†¬† Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.¬†¬† Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||Jaha Bhetyo tehi thok saley madarchod lai...|||Aaos na india ma ni nepali xan birsyo kya|||Bro timro yo pic use garey haii Tiktok ma vid halchu|||kun desh jala teta bebasta garnu parxa|||yo machikne lai samatna paryo jasari bhaye ni yellai bachne kunai adhikar xaina|||Bhagey ra canada nai ja la, canada ma nee xodnu hudaina.

This way we will have clean central government in which no one can capture state function and minimize corruption.¬†   Since we don't have any functioning people in power, either let lower house to vote for temporary governor and magistrate. No minister, let bureaucracy handle them under strict scrutiny of Governor and Magistrate.¬†   Then start a fresh election, 1 President, 7 Governors, 1 Premier, 7 Magistrates, Lower House or Province Parliament member, then from each Province send 10 representative in Upper House/Federal Parliament 3 voted by Lower House/Province Parliament, 5 directly elected in Upper House and 2 votes each from Province Governor and Province Magistrate. Let the bill for Upper House be registered by directly elected member of Upper House. Upper house will vote for foreign minister, ambassadors and diplomats.   For now, either make Mayor and Deputy Mayor of each capital of Province to be interim Governor and Magistrate to bring law and order in state-province security and function.

Personally I have next to no clue who Sumana is, and normally I'd think that makes her a good candidate because there's nothing but positive vibes so far. I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both.

She is the one who has been abroad for so long and has so many foreign connections and relations that even if she  doesn't want interference, there will be far more foreign interference with her as a leader.  We can not deny that .   3. Sumana did absolutely nothing as a health minister apart from stunts. Ministers are supposed to amend laws and execute them. could have done so much more .   4.

BTW, Gen Z doesn‚Äôt just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didn‚Äôt exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who weren‚Äôt even present for the protests claim we don‚Äôt know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldn‚Äôt even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, ‚ÄòWe have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server you‚Äôre all listening to is just for public discussion‚Äô. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal.

They are hot blooded. They can do anything with teen minds.  Look at your genZ, destroying their own land...  GenZ is a popular word on the internet.  Now whenever you talk about GenZ people will remember this amount of brutalism and rage against their own land own assets.|||**What next? thoughts from a fellow Gen Z**    The motherland burns, my heart aches, my mind ponders, is all hope lost? My soul hurts to see violence, arson, anarchy, and the loot and burning of our national properties. We, Gen-Z, seem to have won, yet feel lost. Hope feels lost. Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? I‚Äôve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we can‚Äôt let our nation fail.** We can‚Äôt let our nation burn. We can‚Äôt let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**¬†    **1) We lay down our weapons.**¬†  We came in peace, we protested in peace, and we‚Äôve always wanted peace. We shall end this in peace. Be it known that anybody inciting violence isn‚Äôt part of our movement.¬†    **2) We extend love.**¬†  Love towards our brothers and sisters, love towards our nation, love towards our neighbours, our society, and the opposing side. The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.¬†    **3) We wear white.**¬†  White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that we‚Äôve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.¬†    **4) We have hope.**¬†  Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.¬†    Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.¬†    Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.¬†    Sincerely,¬†  Pantji, a Gen-Z¬†|||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger. You can only hope the rational one can eventually be the leader, and put the chaos and violence under control.|||You just need to re-steady the ship.

When the rich don't know the limits of expoliting the poor these are the consequences. Every freaking nepali politician only gave a fancy speech but never worked towards development of the country. The crowd going crazy is the result of fustration building towards government and the younger generations seeing nothing for them in nepal. All these people in power had to do was work towards uplifting of people rather exploit them, if they would have done 10% as well that would kept the citizens happy.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Why not sagar Dhakal?|||Yesss|||Just promote it in your social media handle|||K bhairacha yarr discord ma pm choose bhairacha|||Ahile non political manxe thik huncha...her or Dr ‡§∏‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Å‡§ï Ruit.

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen.

One for the 165 candidates who are elected directly (first-past-the-post), other for the party. The votes that party gets determine the remaining 110 members via proportional representation.  so aba either we need new political parties to replace the existing ones by Falgun 21, or we have to vote for the same parties again. This is more complicated because Nepal is not just Kathmandu. The political players which we have termed jholey will be active outside Kathmandu.
