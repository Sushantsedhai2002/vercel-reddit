            "body": "Janamat Party Chairperson Dr. C.K. Raut has called for the autonomy of Madhesh Province, following the appointment of UML’s Saroj Kumar Yadav as Chief Minister. Describing the current federal structure as “Nepali colonial rule,” Raut urged the launch of an autonomy movement and declared that the Madhesh Provincial Assembly should proclaim self-rule — even if it must convene “on the streets.”  Raut accused the federal government of violating the constitution by appointing governors and other officials without respecting provincial rights, saying such acts suppress Madhesh’s voice. He demanded that Madhesh form its own police, administration, and governance system, reflecting the will of its people.  “Madhesh, with 54% of the population, deserves its own government,” he asserted, calling the moment “a historic opportunity to end centuries of oppression.”",

Madhesis are not indigenous to Nepals Terai, tharus are.   Before the malaria eradication campaign, no one could live in the dense jungle of Terai except in very few places due to mosquitos. Only Tharus have genetic mutation, sickle red blood cells that makes them immune to it.  The earliest settlers, pahadiyas (from the north) or madhesis (from the south) only came in after 1950s when large amounts of trees were cut down, the second wave after the 1960s after Malaria was successfully eradicated.

But that’s not the main thing. Right after hearing the diagnosis, the he( the patient) then started asking about social health services or options for free treatment. Interestingly, he had a brand-new iPhone 17 Pro Max and he looked like someone who could easily afford the treatment. And remember, this is a government hospital, where the treatment cost is already minimal. It really makes me think why do people become so money-conscious when it comes to health? People will happily spend over a lakh on the latest phone, or thousands on dinners and movies. But when it comes to a doctor's fee of Rs. 1000 or a life-changing surgery, it's suddenly \"too much.\" My main thought wasn't even about the doctor's fee (though we do train for 10-15 years). It was about fairness. The subsidized system is a lifeline for people who genuinely have nothing. When someone who can comfortably afford to pay uses those limited resources, they might be taking that spot from someone who truly can't. Am I seeing this the wrong way? I'm genuinely curious to hear what others think about this.",

But I’m thinking of returning back to Nepal for a 12 to 16 months.  Main reason is health. I’ve had stomach issues for the past 4 years. Nothing life-threatening, but it’s been constant—pain, discomfort, just feeling off every single day. It’s exhausting. And getting proper care here is super slow—need to wait 9 months just to see a specialist. I’ve tried to push through, but I’m tired. I need to rest and actually heal.  PR-wise, staying and working here doesn’t help much. If I go back and get a year of experience or study French, there is a high chance I can return with PR if I stay Nepal for a year.  My mom left went to UAE for work when I was 10, came back after I’d already moved here. We barely spent time together. I miss her. I miss home. Plus never got chance to explore Nepal, max I have been to is Pokhara  I’ve sent her around 15k CAD, and I’ll have about 25k in cash when I leave. We don’t have a house, just lands worth maybe 120–150k. The main reason I am talking about money is I feel guilty. My mom never had a home of her own and I can see how much she wants. She never asked, but I always wanted to build one for her. If I stayed another 7–8 months, I probably could’ve done it.    Mero plan chai Kathmandu mah furnished apartment line French classes line, Nepal sake sama explore garne, guitar haru sikam jasto lagya xah life is so rush here so halka slow mornings, sathi haru snga simple time bitaune vanne xah.

I went to the store and those guys were selling it for 15000 (in Big digital store, Kumaripati) without shipping fees and after showing them their daraz prices they agreed for 12300 without shipping fees but they same time selling like 13000 in Daraz.  I think the story is same for every other seller like in-store prices are hell expensive if you ask me and then on 11.11 Deal I was able to get 3k more cheaper. (Even cheaper than in India)  Used Daraz 8 per voucher capped at 999, SC Debit card 1500 Off, couldn't apply Gems though and free 418 shipping price.

But honestly, I’ve never voted in any election since then.  Now, with all the political chaos and the so-called Gen Z revolution happening, I feel like maybe this is the right time to get involved. There’s another election coming up on Falgun 21, and I’m thinking of finally making my voter ID and voting for the first time.  But here’s my confusion:  * Is it really worth making the voter ID and voting this time?  * If yes, which party or individual do you all genuinely believe can help make Nepal beautiful, developed, and politically stable?  * I’m not into blind party loyalty — I just want to support someone who actually wants to make a difference and not repeat the same old politics.  Would love to hear your real, honest opinions — whether you’re supporting new movements, independents, or even old parties with new faces. 🙏",

If people don’t vote or don’t make their voter card, Nepal could face several problems in the future, especially given the current situation.   1. Weak Leadership – When responsible citizens don’t vote, unqualified or corrupt leaders can easily win. This weakens governance and slows down development.  2. Unaccountable Government – If voter participation is low, leaders feel less pressure to listen to the public. They may misuse power, waste resources, or ignore public needs.  3. Corruption and Poor Policy – Without active voters, there’s little demand for transparency. Corrupt practices can increase, and policies might only benefit a small group instead of the whole nation.  4. Slow Progress and Development – When citizens don’t take part in elections, issues like unemployment, inflation, and poor infrastructure remain unsolved because leaders aren’t held accountable.  5. Loss of Voice and Representation – Not voting means letting others decide for you. Your district, community, or age group may not get proper attention in national decisions.  6. Public Frustration and Division – People may keep complaining about the system but forget that change starts with voting. This creates frustration and political instability.  Not voting weakens democracy.",

I really want to study medicine, and I’m planning to go to the Philippines for MBBS (or MD program).  I’ve heard from a few friends that even if your name isn’t on the CEE list, you can still go to the Philippines — some of them are already studying there. But I’m a bit confused about how that actually works.  * Is it really possible to study MBBS/MD in the Philippines without clearing the CEE in Nepal? * If yes, how did you (or someone you know) manage the NOC process? * Does the rule about needing CEE only apply if we want to register as a doctor in Nepal later, or does it also affect studying abroad in general? * I don’t plan to work as a doctor in Nepal, just study abroad — so will skipping CEE create any problem later?",

Here’s what no one in power will say:  Nepal is a rentier economy. 30% of our GDP comes from remittances, not real production. People abroad earn, send money home, and that money gets spent on imported cars, gold, and land — not factories or exports.  Consumption instead of production. Banks don’t lend to agriculture or industry.... they lend for real estate, housing, and car loans. The economy runs on consumption of imports, not domestic output.  Low inflation is not good news. Inflation dropped to 1.8% because demand has collapsed. Businesses can’t sell. Farmers can’t get paid. Everyone’s sitting on unsold goods while banks hoard liquidity.  Reckless banking policy. NRB restricted debit withdrawals (now only Rs 50,000/day) while pretending the economy is “stable.” Loan recovery is half of last year. NPLs are rising. There’s liquidity, but no credit demand.  Fake prosperity, real vulnerability. Luxury imports make Kathmandu look rich, but it’s all funded by debt and remittance money. The second remittances slow or the rupee weakens, it all collapses....housing, cars, consumption.  No other poor country does this. Bangladesh, Vietnam, Ethiopia .... all used remittance to build factories and export powerhouses. Nepal used it to import Toyota Prados and iPhones. We’re the only “low-income” country running a consumer economy like a Gulf state .... but without oil.  “We’re landlocked” is used as an excuse for inaction. Yet Bhutan, Switzerland, and Rwanda prove landlocked isn't doomed. Nepal isn’t poor because it lacks resources, it’s poor because its elite class has chosen illusion over development  If this continues, 2026 could be the reckoning year when liquidity, remittance, and political illusions all converge into a crash.",

            "body": "I want to share my wife’s story because I hope it helps someone who might be going through something similar. It's been a tough two years for us, and I’ve learned a lot the hard way.  After 2 years of getting married to my wife. In December 2023, we got the news no one ever wants to hear. My wife had a tumor near her pituitary gland (large lobulated heterogeneously and vividly enhancing mass). The MRI came back showing it was about 33x29x26 mm basically, the size of a small egg. I don’t think I’ll ever forget that moment. The world felt like it stopped spinning, and I had no idea what to do.  I immediately went into panic mode and started researching everything I could. We were ready to go to Delhi and see the top neurosurgeons, but then a relative suggested we see Dr. Gopal Raman Sharma at Nepal Mediciti for suggestion and consultation. Honestly, we were skeptical, but we decided to give it a shot.  When we met Dr. Sharma, it felt different from the start. There was no sugarcoating it, he was very serious, and made it clear that the tumor was dangerous. He kept saying it had to come out immediately, that something could happen to my wife *right now* if we didn’t do anything. I won’t lie, his words hit hard. He made it sound like we didn’t have time to think.  So, without really questioning much, we agreed. We trusted him. The surgery was scheduled for the very next day, and everything moved so fast. We didn’t even have time to breathe.  The surgery took around 2 hours. When he came out, Dr. Sharma told me, “We removed what we could, but there was a lot of blood loss. It was complicated.” And that was it. There was no explanation beyond that. When I tried asking how much of the tumor had been removed, he didn’t really answer me. At that point, I should’ve pressed more, but I was just in shock. My wife was kept in the ICU for two days, and we just had to wait.  A few weeks later, she came home, but we were still uneasy. He dragged us for an year saying there was nothing that can be done. We just wait and watch. \"Wait and watch\" thats all we heard from him for an year. It didn’t feel like it was over, not by a long shot. So, we did another MRI in December 2024, and when we got the results, I couldn’t believe my eyes. The tumor hadn’t shrunk. At all. It was still about 34x26x25 mm.  I was furious. I felt like we’d just been taken for a ride. All that money, all that stress, all that hope, and nothing had changed. I was angry at Dr. Gopal Raman Sharma and his assistant Prashant for not being more upfront, and angry at myself for not questioning more. But, as much as I wanted to blame someone, I knew anger wasn’t going to fix anything. So, I decided to take a step back, calm down, and get a second opinion.  That’s when we decided to go to AIIMS in India. We met with a neurosurgeon there who really took the time to explain everything. He did MRI and looked into everything in detail. He told us that the diagnosis was wrongly done by Dr. Gopal Raman Sharma at mediciti. That was a tough pill to swallow, but it also gave us some clarity. He told us that the tumor is made up of nerves and its jelly like. At least now we understood why things hadn’t gone as planned. The second surgery was scheduled right away. It was a long one, about 8-10 hours. My wife lost almost 5 liters of blood, but the team handled it. They managed to remove 97% of the tumor.  After the surgery, Neurosurgeon at AIIMS told us that the first surgery didn’t work because Dr. Sharma had tried to remove the tumor from wrong place and also tried three different places, but couldn’t reach it properly. In fact, the repeated attempts had damaged the tumor, making it harder to remove. The tumor was now scattered, which is why it was so difficult to get rid of.  It wasn’t easy. She was in the ICU for 7 hours after the surgery, but eventually, she was moved to a private room, and after 3 days, we were able to go home. It was a huge relief, but there was still the small matter of the remaining 3% of the tumor.  We had to come back to India for gamma knife radiation to get rid of the rest. The procedure took about 5 hours, but in the end, it was successful. The last of the tumor was gone. We just returned to kathmandu today.  Now, my wife is doing well. She’s back to her normal self, and for the first time in over two years, I feel like we can finally breathe easy. It’s been an incredibly tough journey. I’ve never felt so much responsibility in my life. As the eldest son, you carry that weight, and it can take a toll on you in ways you don’t expect.  But looking back, there are a few things I’ve learned that I wish I’d known from the start:  1. **Don’t rush decisions**. We let urgency take over in the beginning, and that clouded our judgment. Don’t be afraid to take a step back and think things through. 2. **Get a second opinion**. I can’t stress this enough. Don’t just trust the first doctor you see, no matter how confident they sound. If something doesn’t feel right, ask around. get **Get third and forth opinion** too. 3. **Trust yourself and your instincts**. In those early days, I didn’t trust my gut as much as I should have. Trust your intuition and don’t be afraid to ask questions—even when the doctor seems like they’re the expert. 4. **It’s okay to be angry, but don’t let it control you**. I was angry at Dr. Sharma, and I still feel that way sometimes. But holding onto that anger didn’t do anyone any good. It’s better to focus on moving forward. 5. **Life is unpredictable**. You never know what’s around the corner. But even in the toughest times, there’s always hope.  We’re finally able to move forward with our lives. I’m grateful my wife is healthy again, and I’m thankful for the lessons this journey has taught me. I just want to share this so that anyone who’s in a similar situation knows that they’re not alone. Keep fighting, keep questioning, and trust that things can get better.",

Some lack knowledge, others just don’t care about patient. Most MBBS graduates can’t even get license in first try. There’s also little consequence for doctor mistake because of doctor shortage in Nepal and all doctors protesting if anyone is prosecuted. Even doctors I know suggest to go to India or other country for any serious health issue. |||>After the surgery, Neurosurgeon at AIIMS told us that the first surgery didn’t work because Dr. Sharma had tried to remove the tumor from wrong place and also tried three different places, but couldn’t reach it properly.

A Nepali doctor rushed us into surgery, which didn’t remove the tumor and gave us only “wait and watch” for a year. The tumor didn’t shrink. We went to AIIMS India, where we learned the first diagnosis and surgical approach were incorrect. AIIMS surgeons did an 8–10 hour surgery, removed \\~97% of the tumor, and then gamma-knife radiation cleared the remaining 3%. After two years of fear, stress, and uncertainty, my wife is finally healthy. Biggest lessons: don’t rush medical decisions, always get multiple opinions, trust your instincts, ask questions, and stay hopeful.  If you want, I can also help you turn your story into a **Reddit-friendly version**, or prepare titles like:  * *“2-Year Brain Tumor Journey: Why You Must Always Get a Second Opinion”* * *“Thought We Lost Everything.

Vauju lai mero tarfa bata 1kg anar dinu hai|||If you have money, don't ever do anything serious medical stuff in Nepal. What happened to OP is unfortunately common. My aunt had a similar experience where the doc said immediate surgery but her family decided to wait and instead went straight to Thailand. The doc over there said that it WASN'T even serious. Some meds and she was perfectly fine. Btw this was more than a decade ago. She's healthy as an ox. Not saying that all doctors are bad here but anecdotes like OPs are more common than I realised.|||I think I had very similar case like your wife. A bit long but you can read. When I was 17 I had tumor in my right eye, I noticed my eye was diff. sometimes in mirror/photos so I went to Tilganga then did diagnosis then dr.Rohit Saiju of Tilganga said we need to do surgery and cut your bone of upper part, it is critical, if tumor turns to be malignant then it will be sad news, and there is risk of Vision loss, etc. they scared me, told everything that will help them to escape if things don’t go right later. But I said ok fine, there is no option, I have to do, I have another eye if sth goes bad. Looking back now, I can only salute that 17 yrs old brave guy. And operation happened, I was unconscious, they even showed tumor mass taken out. And thankfully, tumor was benign. Then slowly I focused on recovery, for 3 yrs I found nothing strange, but slowly I saw that same eye a bit different/strange, during this whole 3 yrs during follow-up with same doctor he did basic eye checks, and said it’s fine, you can come after 3 months like that. I mean he didn’t know or didn’t tell that I had tumor recurrence again. I went to diagnosis again and mri showed tumor again, I was shocked/speechless. That doc said we need to redo surgery, and said like this kinda tumor comes again, but I asked question like should I then again come back in few years to again do, that is hard, I had no idea at this time that operation could have been better, I just cried like why me god? Why did tumor reoccur? I thought enough, I am not doing operation here, I am going India, then researched then went to Aiims Delhi, there same as yours case, doctors said that it could have been success in first surgery, it’s a capsule kinda tumor and you can easily take out, how did that doc fail, kinda like that, only then I knew Dr. Saiju could have done better or could have recommended to India if he couldn’t, or could have diagnosed faster in second time, he failed in all this, I was more shocked than angry as it was my decision to do surgery with him, and mistakes could happen from any doctor so I thought like that. Then I discussed with many doctors, researched so much on that area that one doc even said did you also study medicine? So I dig deep, analyzed experience/capacity of all possible surgeons, as I knew only one thing: The only thing I have under control is to choose best surgeon, as after surgery they can do nothing, they will only tell it happens because of this case/surgery, so only that 2-3 hrs of surgery matters. I was so daring that once I asked to one so reputed doctor in face that, how many such my case kinda operations did you do till now? How confident are you, what are your thinkings, etc. because it’s my right, my life. I finally thought to do surgery with one reputed doctor dr.A.K. Grover , then he did operate. And i am 24 now, it’s 3 yrs after that second surgery, till now going good after that surgery, much sincere thanks to dr. Grover from my heart. Hopefully, I will be fine. Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies.|||I read the whole story and im glad that she has recovered and now you both are relieved and have normal life once again.

Attention within the Nepali Congress–CPN-UML alliance has now shifted to deciding who will be appointed the next Chief Election Commissioner.  >With Congress obtaining the governor’s post, UML leaders have argued that the position of Chief Election Commissioner should go to their party. Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba had previously stated during a conversation with journalists on May 6 that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had agreed to allow Nepali Congress to choose the central bank governor.  >In line with that agreement, Dr. Biswo Nath Poudel was appointed governor on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Election Commission has been operating under an acting head for over a month. Ram Prasad Bhandari, who himself is facing a legal challenge in the Supreme Court over his own appointment, has been serving as acting chief commissioner.  >Currently, the commission is operating with only three out of its mandated five officials. One chief commissioner and one commissioner position remain vacant. The commission had seen a sweeping round of appointments when the previous Oli-led government amended the Constitutional Council Act via ordinance and appointed 52 officials to various constitutional bodies in a single move.|||hell nahhhhh.  was thinking of making it at lalitpur office.

            "body": "I was just 17, when i got my bike license , a friend of my elder brother called me. Lets call him Boss. He was in hardware business. He offered me job, the only requirement was license and someone he could trust. He explained my job was not in hardware but in hundi business he was secretly running. I knew it was illegal but thought it was just minor offense like \"not giving bill while selling stuff.\"  Everyday, he used to give me list of names and their account number and amount to deposit.  He used to give me 10-15 lakhs cash everyday. My job was simple, just deposite the money to different bank accounts according to list. At first, i was enjoying it. Usually By 1/2 o'clock my job was over so only 3/4 hrs a day, if it's bank's holiday then it's my holiday day too. Salary was 10k. For a teenager, 10years ago 10k wasn't that bad. My friend was so jealous of me because he was working 10 hrs a day 6 days a week for same salary.  Then I started to get skeptical, first bank's staffs always gave this weird look like they know everything but just letting it slide, heard people getting arrested evey other day for running Hundi on news. One time i had to go to this big furniture to collect money. Man led me to some shady dark room and asked for 5rs note that boss gave me. It was half torn, then that man pull out the other half from pocket and matched the number. Then he gave me 15 lakhs. After couple of months I didn't feel right at all.   Oneday My cousin who had years of experience in banks told me to quit right away. He said, hundi offense has same prison time as murder. I scared af since all my details were recorded in banks.   After few months, i told boss that i am quitting. He told me to not worry, he said \" Pokhara ma jo SP aaye ni first ma sanga basera bhat khanchha.\" But I wasn't convinced at all. I asked my brother to talk  to him and he did then finally Boss let me quit. I heard the guy who took over after me made far more money since he was making his own clients. In other words he was smarter than me.   It's been 10 years, Boss still running it without any problems. Made fortunes. Looks like he was telling the truth when he said \" Pokhara ma jo SP aaye ni first ma sanga basera bhat khanchha.\"",

Describing the current federal structure as “Nepali colonial rule,” Raut urged the launch of an autonomy movement and declared that the Madhesh Provincial Assembly should proclaim self-rule — even if it must convene “on the streets.”  Raut accused the federal government of violating the constitution by appointing governors and other officials without respecting provincial rights, saying such acts suppress Madhesh’s voice. He demanded that Madhesh form its own police, administration, and governance system, reflecting the will of its people.  “Madhesh, with 54% of the population, deserves its own government,” he asserted, calling the moment “a historic opportunity to end centuries of oppression.”",

And 12th is alll about organic ,yup almost all.The same teacher will teach u organic chem till the last day of 12th ,yup u heard it right.However, its not the matter to be intimidated .Personally i practiced organic each day,some day i took a break obviously .So, ya u should revise it from the first chapter. My organic chap teacher was amazing ,calm and gave notes and also provided ideas to make it easier to study while i was in KMC . If u dont have those ,study from youtube.  Ya and i got an overall 3.8  and ya forgot to mention, If u dont understand a topic than u have youtube .To be frankly honest,i used to watch a lecture from youtube everytime a topic or concept or terms even if its subtle. Without the teachers from youtube, well i wouldnt have scored even a 3.6.

And for, writing section. I think there are three section. 7,8 and 10 marks question . For 7 and 8 marks writing write 150-200 words with right content. If the content is good you will get marks And for 10 marks 250-300 is recommended. But this doesnot imply everywhere. Its totally up to teachers how they veiw . Some prefer good writing and content while others just give marks based on how long you write. I would suggest you to mix both. Focus on good writing skills and also consider the  ideal word range...|||Not answering the question directly writing off-topic. Ignoring part of the question e.g., explaining causes but forgetting solutions. Unclear position, not showing your opinion when required. Rewriting the question instead of giving your own ideas. Weak support ideas without explanation or examples. Coherence and Cohesion Poor paragraphing  no clear introduction, body, or conclusion. Overusing connectors like “Firstly, Secondly” without logic. Limited variety of linking words  repeating “However” or “Moreover.” Abrupt transitions  jumping between ideas with no smooth link.  Lexical Resource (Vocabulary) Repetition using the same word many times. Wrong word choice  word doesn’t fit the context. Misused “fancy words”  using dictionary words incorrectly. Incorrect collocations e.g., do a crime instead of commit a crime. Too informal words like kids, Grammatical Range and Accuracy Trying to impress with big words but using them wrongly.|||question answer ki essay type??|||from teacher's mark giving scheme, I saw marking for using transition words.",

            "body": "So, yes, this was me the same person who got a 3.97 GPA in the SEE. I’ve always known that grades don’t define everything, and I’ll continue to believe that. At the end of the day, even though I scored 3.97 GPA, In the Kathmandu Metro Scholarship exam, I choked. I barely made it onto the second nomination list and ended up in a college that’s just “okay.” But honestly, I don’t blame the college I blame myself. There were others who got into better colleges than me, even though they had lower grades. So, I can’t say grades don’t matter, but the first term really showed me how tough things can get. I know I need to improve, and I’m determined to do so. I got an A+ in Computer Science, even though I didn’t study as much as I should have. I love Computer Science and building a lot of skills in the field. Right now, though, I’ve decided to take a break from everything every extracurricular activity, including learning JavaScript, React, and other things. I know I probably shouldn’t, but I feel like it’s necessary for now. Starting today, I’ll be locking my phone and using my laptop strictly for studying. I need to focus on my second terminal exams, and it’s time to set boundaries.If I’ve said anything wrong, I apologize. I don’t blame anyone or anything but myself, even though I studied harder than I ever have. My lack of proper note-taking has cost me. Right now, I’m just looking for advice from seniors who have gone through this and come back stronger, getting good results in the end.",

            "body": "Hello! Myself (20M), along with two of my friends and our families, visited Nepal during the Diwali holidays. We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8. Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)

            "comments": "First of all, commendations for such well written and structured post, that too with all the additional info at the end. (For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".

I have a relative who works as a travel agent, and he told me that many agents and shopkeepers tend to focus more on foreign tourists than on Indians, because they believe they can overcharge them easily. So, bro, be careful  there are many thugs and dishonest agents who might try to charge you extra. **Bargaining is the key.**  In almost every corner, if a hotel recommends you a place or a service, remember that the hotel usually gets a commission from it. The entire system in tourist areas like Thamel often runs on commission-based deals. So it’s always better to ask genuine locals for suggestions rather than agents pretending to be locals. In Thamel, you’ll find many such people who act friendly but are just trying to make money off tourists.  If you have Nepali friends, you can travel cheaply and safely otherwise, just be a bit cautious and smart while dealing with people. To be honest, a few uneducated people here may dislike Indian tourists, and that’s an unfortunate reality. But overall, we Nepalese are known to be **very hospitable, kind, and friendly**, and most people will treat you with respect and warmth. Just stay alert, bargain wisely, and you’ll have a wonderful time in Nepal.|||Bro, timi Darjeeling bata vayae taa, yo sabai Normal hola ni taa timro laagi taa?? 🤔|||where did u take that video bro? was it in pokhara?|||You skipped Bandipur en route Pokhara from Kathmandu.

Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||Have a great time here, enjoy it and after you go back to your home just think is it fair to take land of the country who provided you with such great hospitality?|||[deleted]",

I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it. Capitalism and communism don't antagonises each other. They coexist in a healthy modern economy.|||Ask a regular min wage worker in the US if capitalism is working for them.

            "heading": "A Night in Kathmandu — The Unexpected Bar Scam Experience",
            "body": "After completing our last destination in Kathmandu, our Nepal trip was almost coming to an end. We had planned to spend the evening shopping around local markets before heading back home.  But as luck would have it, the weather had other plans. It started raining heavily, and most of us decided to cancel the shopping plan and stay inside the bus, waiting for the rain to stop.  While we were sitting there, a Nepali guy — sort of an agent — climbed onto the bus. He started chatting with my friend, talking about dance bars, attractive girls, and fun nightlife in Kathmandu. My friends, curious and excited to explore something different, agreed to check it out. So, we went along with him from Gaushala Chowk.  ⸻  The Arrival  We reached around 7 PM. The place looked more like a small pub or lounge — dim lights, loud music, and barely anyone inside. There were just two Indian guys with a few Nepali girls, sitting at a corner table, smoking hukka and drinking.  We were a group of 12 people, so we took two tables (6 on each). I sat on the other table, while two Nepali girls from the bar joined my friends’ table. They were friendly, laughing, and talking in Hindi — chit chat, masti, jokes — sab Hindi mein.  After a few minutes, the girls said they wanted to have a drink. The same agent who brought us there told my friend, “Sir, bas 400 Rs ka juice hai.” They wrote the order on a small paper chit, took my friend’s signature, and soon two juices were served.  That’s how their system worked — write on paper, take a sign, and serve the order.  We also ordered 4 beers for ourselves. Out of 12, only 4 were drinking — the rest were just watching the dance show.  ⸻  The Show Begins  Soon, Nepali girls started dancing on Hindi songs, followed by a couple of male dancers and another girl joining the floor. The vibe felt okay at first — typical dance bar scene, music, lights, drinks.  But after the girls finished their drinks, a waiter brought a hukka pot to our table without even asking. We immediately told him to take it away. The girls got off from our table soon after that.  ⸻  Something Felt Off  After finishing the beer, me and my friend went to the washroom. There we saw those same two Indian guys who were sitting earlier — looked like North Indians (maybe Delhi or Haryana). They seemed tense, arguing with the bar staff.  Out of curiosity, I asked one of them, “Bhai kya hua?” He said, “Dekho na bhai, kuch khaya nahi, thoda piya sirf — aur bill 32,000 Nepali bana diya!”  That one line was enough to send chills down my spine.  I quickly went back to my table and told my friend what had happened. We immediately asked for our bill — but the damage was already done.  ⸻  The Shocking Bill  The bill came in Nepali currency: \t•\t4 Beers = 4000 \t•\t2 Drinks for girls = 8000 \t•\t23% Service charge = 2760 Total = 14,760 NRS (≈ 9,840 INR)  My friend was shocked. He said, “Ladies drink price to 400 bola tha,” but by then, the agent who brought us there had vanished.  There was no point arguing — the staff was large in number, and the situation didn’t look safe. Finally, we settled the bill for 9,500 INR and left the place quietly.  ⸻  What Happened Next  As we were leaving, I noticed those two Indian guys being locked in a small office, surrounded by bar staff demanding they hand over their mobiles or belongings to pay off the bill.  I felt genuinely bad for them — and guilty for not sitting at my friend’s table earlier, or checking the price list before signing that paper chit.  But at the same time, I was thankful that we escaped early — with just a 4-beer loss instead of a full-blown scam.  ⸻  The Reality Behind the Glamour  While we were stepping out, a few more Nepali guys entered, and immediately all the bar girls — including those who had been at our table — went to join them, smoking hukka and ordering drinks.  Just watching that, I could only think: “Isko to aaj 40,000–50,000 ka chuna lagne wala hai.”  ⸻  Final Thoughts  Our Nepal trip overall was beautiful — from Pokhara’s serenity to the spiritual vibe of Pashupatinath. But this one Kathmandu nightlife experience was a reminder that not everything that glitters is gold.  If you ever plan to explore nightlife in Kathmandu, be cautious: \t•\tNever sign anything you don’t understand. \t•\tAlways ask for the price upfront. \t•\tAnd if something feels shady — walk away.  This experience became a story to remember — not for the fun, but for the lesson it taught us.",

Describing the current federal structure as “Nepali colonial rule,” Raut urged the launch of an autonomy movement and declared that the Madhesh Provincial Assembly should proclaim self-rule — even if it must convene “on the streets.”  Raut accused the federal government of violating the constitution by appointing governors and other officials without respecting provincial rights, saying such acts suppress Madhesh’s voice. He demanded that Madhesh form its own police, administration, and governance system, reflecting the will of its people.  “Madhesh, with 54% of the population, deserves its own government,” he asserted, calling the moment “a historic opportunity to end centuries of oppression.”",

Minimal revenue but still something.  Simply reducing the tax burden will lead to less revenue in government funds.

Interestingly, he had a brand-new iPhone 17 Pro Max and he looked like someone who could easily afford the treatment. And remember, this is a government hospital, where the treatment cost is already minimal. It really makes me think why do people become so money-conscious when it comes to health? People will happily spend over a lakh on the latest phone, or thousands on dinners and movies. But when it comes to a doctor's fee of Rs. 1000 or a life-changing surgery, it's suddenly \"too much.\" My main thought wasn't even about the doctor's fee (though we do train for 10-15 years). It was about fairness. The subsidized system is a lifeline for people who genuinely have nothing. When someone who can comfortably afford to pay uses those limited resources, they might be taking that spot from someone who truly can't. Am I seeing this the wrong way?

For advanced features(that require internet or calls), you will need to recharge often, maybe like 1500/year. But for basic tracking, Rs.500 will basically run the GPS until your validity expires, I think. You could even recharge lower - just upto the point where you maximize your validity.

For example, my old Sony Vaio can handle up to 8GB, while an older Dell model only supports a maximum of 4GB. You can easily check online by searching your laptop model to find out if it supports SSD upgrades and the maximum RAM capacity.

I like that you have SIP investment and Commodity like Gold/Silver, but if this is your edge over others then  you need to realise your uniqueness or your \"edge\" can be easily replicated.  I think your product would be more valuable if you can do some kind of analysis on the market itself but then that is a difficult thing because there are again a lot of websites that do basic analysis like nepsealpha. For basic portfolio summary there is a widget called \"Advanced Widgets for MeroShare\"  which gives you all those numbers like P/L%, daily P/L, overall P/L and the good thing is you dont need to pay anything or upload the data anywhere, it's integrated into the browser.  If this is done as a hobby project to show case your FE skills, well then it's a good one, but if this is done with the intention that people may use it, well then, ermm im not sure there's anything special for people to upload their data into your website.  If you want people to use this, maybe also incorporate some kind of advanced market analysis, and make sure it's thoroughly tested!

And then he started to ask me question like Why this ? Did you think of another approach ? Why or Why not ?  Now as I was confident in my project I could answer them quite easily. Then they said I was  a candidate with high probability and I woukd get response no matter my outcome.  Tespaxi I mentioned whats hybrid ? Then they say as college ko timing haru milauna garo hunxa so we dont force candidate people to come on fix time and that was such a relief as mero college alli tadai parxa and exams haru ni sochna paryo.  And the final question I asked why its called bootcamp but not internship ans they say internship vanyp vane final year ko matra auxan but this is for anyone interested wether its just student who crossed 12 or passed masters. Interested jati plus who show initiative they plan to take those.  Dar laerathyo because I thought its was a perfect fit for me. And now sigh of relief I just got an email that I was selected.  Well I am sure yaa aru pani tannai talented manxe haru xan so dont think you wont get internship mero ni kunai katrai teyena and do apply who knows maybe you are my next colleuge whom I would work with.",

At the very least she is knowingly or unknowingly grooming kids. This is neither an isolated event nor out of context. Almost everything she has posted has a clear sexual undertone. She is trying to reach a demographic whose brains are rotted by deviant thoughts because of the constant stream of porn injected into their veins. It's attention-seeking for sure, but involving children into her bullshit is wrong. Take it up a notch and think if she was making OF content but with children next to her. It's not that making sexual content (or content in general with certain undertone) is wrong, it's wrong when you involve children into shit that they don't have the capacity to understand. Let's say she does not understand that involving children in her sexually-charged videos is wrong, is that supposed to automatically make it right?

Do you even know what does that word mean? There is something called affection and being affectionate. Timro ghar xeuma weren't there ximeki didi when you were small? Werent they affectionate with you? She didn't do a hard kiss. It was a soft kiss. For women to be close to any kids it's normal. They're emotional and affectionate towards babies. If they're not, they're mentally abnormal. I don't wanna say anything about reddit women but to my understanding most girls here in reddit already have hatred towards men or some sort of toxicity. I've never seen any healthy feminine girls in reddit from nepal. They usually join to stress out or rant or listen to rants.  ​And this thread is a perfect example of that. People are just looking for something to be outraged about.  ​Not every single interaction between an adult and a kid has to be sexualized. That's a very Western way of thinking, and everyone here is quick to import it. It's all about intent. You can clearly see from the video there was no malicious or sexual intent. It was a brief, caring gesture, exactly like an aunt or an older sister would give.  ​Besides, the context of the video itself matters. As the song and caption show, it's clearly meant to be lighthearted, a 'loke.'  People are taking a 5-second clip out of context, projecting their own dirty minds onto it, and trying to make a huge issue out of nothing. Everyone needs to get a grip and stop looking for problems where there are none.  Also, In Nepal, the level of conservativeness depends on caste/community. For brahmins even dating seems taboo but while for other it's pretty much common. Even choice of clothes, what they dress, what they reveal, everything is totally dependent on their caste. She's seems Newar and I've seen newars being way open than that.   TLDR: Video is perfectly normal as it should, it's on social media, people are projecting their own fantasies over reality. It's all about your upbringing and it reflects you didn't get enough love from your elder sisters during childhood.  PS: Even a single touch can be bad and whole bape cosplay can be beautiful.  It's all about person and intent, remember that.|||what the helllll|||nah. I thought it was mom and son tiktok|||Poor kid.

This is an insane lifestyle, nothing less than Dahal family. If a local ward chairperson can amass such wealth, those at the level of IGP and mantri have looted us taxpayers a hundred times higher.   This guy is apparently the son of nepal’s most corrupt chief justice Gopal Parajuli, btw he had to resign because of fake citizenship.

Garima Paudel daughter of ex minister devendra paudel proudly faunting her international lifestyle. International tours, comfortable international lifestyle, business class travels while the poor are forced to use tuins for daily commute. Are we not tired of this? This is why we are exposing corruption in nepal  Sangita Pahadi has recently been sued by CIAA for 3 arba scam. Their children have been living a lavish lifestyle since ages. No shame. 30 hajar ko talab, 30 ota gharbari. Finish them all.  We found another generational corruption run. Khushi Pandey is the granddaughter of Ramesh Nath Pandey, he was the FORMER MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, INDUSTRY, TOURISM, ENVIRONMENT and COMMUNICATIONS. She is also the daughter of Nischal Nath Pandey, who served as a government employee during ramesh nath pandey’s long ministerial run. Look at this damn lifestyle. How is it possible to afford all of this when the family has nothing except civil service for the past 50 years?  Supriya Bohora, granddaughter of Deepak Bohora, former member of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and the House of Representatives, has recently come under the spotlight. Deepak Bohora was known for his strong hand in the Panchayat system and his unwavering support for the monarchy. His political journey is remembered not only for his allegiance to authoritarian structures but also for allegations of corruption. One of the most prominent accusations linked to Deepak Bohora is the illegal consumption of land where the Fun Park ice rink in Bhadrakali Road now stands. What was once a symbol of political maneuvering and alleged misappropriation of public assets is now being flaunted by his granddaughter as a mark of achievement, raising questions about how the spoils of corruption are normalized across generations.  Anusandhan khai ta comrade? Granddaughter living in europe to protect all the money stored in swiss bank. EXPOSE THEM ALL!  Most corrupted ones are the generals from police special dsp and upwards.👮 I have seen them using massive funds to get their sons n daughters abroad or in prestigious schools by paying hefty fees. their home looks like that of a king , literally narayanhiti jastai same and their sons n daughters are living the life of luxuries carrying iphones and designer dresses and bags . Actually what these officer do is they heavily launder money and budgets which comes to their department . They practice “milijuli khane” . They also take funds from criminals to manage cases. Then they use these funds to bribe politicians for getting higher post like dsp to dig , from DIG to IG and so on . They conduct massive weddings and ceremonies spending crore of rupees. this is same with army generals as well.  `-`  **TLDR - REGISTER AND CONVINCE YOUR FRIENDS, COUSINS IF THEY STILL HAVE NOT MADE VOTER ID**  Read an interesting blog on this. Hamro lato politician le k bujhla esto. Chorra chorri lai instagram delete garna chai layo dhanna teti chai buddhi raicha.  >The corrupt ruling elites of the Third World, who used to steal everything, destroy economies, and create hell for their own populations, have now added one more thing: they openly allow their children to flaunt the spoils of corruption on Instagram, right in front of their starving people. Something previous generations never witnessed.  >The new rich have never gone through a revolution so they don't understand not to flaunt their wealth like the old bourgeoisie who have witnessed multiple revolutions throughout history. It's ironic that the Maoists instigated a revolution yet the children of said Maoists are now living the luxurious lives posting everything not knowing whats simmering in society. It looks like at least the kids have understood not to flaunt their stolen wealth to avoid angering the masses.  >In any ways what happened in Nepal highlights a trend I’ve discussed on here before, which is how Instagram utterly radicalizes youth heavy developing societies.  >Suddenly you as a poor but striving young man or woman have full visibility to how the elite/upper class of your country + diaspora live, but you have little access or hope of ever living the same for the most part. The impact of this on mental health, societal stability, and also fertility rates cannot be underestimated.  >Imagine going from a society with five state channels and a few cable options in the 2000s to Instagram in just five years. That’s what happened to all of South Asia + Africa + a lot of Latin America.  These guys were being exposed to the lifestyles of the baddie daughters and Chad sons of the fucktards ruling their country,  >You see their trip to Japan and London for the summer. See their parties at their elite mansions in the most posh suburbs and neighborhoods and you realize you’re just fucked and not getting there ever, your country simply does not have the mechanism to enable that for you, you’re unemployed even despite a college degree.  >**Upward mobility is like a pressure valve. Nepal never had that. The elites taxed people, slapped tariffs on imports & ignored building institutions that foster upward mobility. Instead, they assumed that sending their populace to the Middle East would be sufficient.**  >What’s surprising is how the corrupt politicians allow their kids to flaunt stolen wealth so brazenly. Kids of politicians in developing countries flaunting their extravagant lifestyles on public Instagram accounts is so foolhardy. Exposure to social media and bragging about your luxurious lifestyle risks fuelling resentment and envy.  >It's how uprisings have always been. Old bourgeoisie don't show off their wealth like those Nepali elites did. This behavior is what got both the iranian and russian noble families killed. This also happened in Mongolia earlier this year, although less dramatically. The Prime Minister had to step down due to protests that kicked off because his son was showing off his luxury holidays and clothes too much on Instagram.",

Marriage is about supporting each other through thick and thin. Maybe few wealthy guys wouldn’t mind if you are not earning money, but don’t bet on that horse.   Speaking of normal non marriage relationships, and this is just my take so I am okay if people disagree with it, just don’t take anything seriously if you are unsure you are going to be with them, And that goes out for both guys and girls. Unsure chau vane, relationship nabasa or you can extort all gifts from that mf, dhak dekhayo vane dip out lol. Guys le chai, do what you do best and dip out. Its a materialistic world.

            "heading": "A Two-Year Journey Through My Wife's Tumor Diagnosis, Surgeries, and Recovery: What I Wish I Knew and What I Learned",
            "body": "I want to share my wife’s story because I hope it helps someone who might be going through something similar. It's been a tough two years for us, and I’ve learned a lot the hard way.  After 2 years of getting married to my wife. In December 2023, we got the news no one ever wants to hear. My wife had a tumor near her pituitary gland (large lobulated heterogeneously and vividly enhancing mass). The MRI came back showing it was about 33x29x26 mm basically, the size of a small egg. I don’t think I’ll ever forget that moment. The world felt like it stopped spinning, and I had no idea what to do.  I immediately went into panic mode and started researching everything I could. We were ready to go to Delhi and see the top neurosurgeons, but then a relative suggested we see Dr. Gopal Raman Sharma at Nepal Mediciti for suggestion and consultation. Honestly, we were skeptical, but we decided to give it a shot.  When we met Dr. Sharma, it felt different from the start. There was no sugarcoating it, he was very serious, and made it clear that the tumor was dangerous. He kept saying it had to come out immediately, that something could happen to my wife *right now* if we didn’t do anything. I won’t lie, his words hit hard. He made it sound like we didn’t have time to think.  So, without really questioning much, we agreed. We trusted him. The surgery was scheduled for the very next day, and everything moved so fast. We didn’t even have time to breathe.  The surgery took around 2 hours. When he came out, Dr. Sharma told me, “We removed what we could, but there was a lot of blood loss. It was complicated.” And that was it. There was no explanation beyond that. When I tried asking how much of the tumor had been removed, he didn’t really answer me. At that point, I should’ve pressed more, but I was just in shock. My wife was kept in the ICU for two days, and we just had to wait.  A few weeks later, she came home, but we were still uneasy. He dragged us for an year saying there was nothing that can be done. We just wait and watch. \"Wait and watch\" thats all we heard from him for an year. It didn’t feel like it was over, not by a long shot. So, we did another MRI in December 2024, and when we got the results, I couldn’t believe my eyes. The tumor hadn’t shrunk. At all. It was still about 34x26x25 mm.  I was furious. I felt like we’d just been taken for a ride. All that money, all that stress, all that hope, and nothing had changed. I was angry at Dr. Gopal Raman Sharma and his assistant Prashant for not being more upfront, and angry at myself for not questioning more. But, as much as I wanted to blame someone, I knew anger wasn’t going to fix anything. So, I decided to take a step back, calm down, and get a second opinion.  That’s when we decided to go to AIIMS in India. We met with a neurosurgeon there who really took the time to explain everything. He did MRI and looked into everything in detail. He told us that the diagnosis was wrongly done by Dr. Gopal Raman Sharma at mediciti. That was a tough pill to swallow, but it also gave us some clarity. He told us that the tumor is made up of nerves and its jelly like. At least now we understood why things hadn’t gone as planned. The second surgery was scheduled right away. It was a long one, about 8-10 hours. My wife lost almost 5 liters of blood, but the team handled it. They managed to remove 97% of the tumor.  After the surgery, Neurosurgeon at AIIMS told us that the first surgery didn’t work because Dr. Sharma had tried to remove the tumor from wrong place and also tried three different places, but couldn’t reach it properly. In fact, the repeated attempts had damaged the tumor, making it harder to remove. The tumor was now scattered, which is why it was so difficult to get rid of.  It wasn’t easy. She was in the ICU for 7 hours after the surgery, but eventually, she was moved to a private room, and after 3 days, we were able to go home. It was a huge relief, but there was still the small matter of the remaining 3% of the tumor.  We had to come back to India for gamma knife radiation to get rid of the rest. The procedure took about 5 hours, but in the end, it was successful. The last of the tumor was gone. We just returned to kathmandu today.  Now, my wife is doing well. She’s back to her normal self, and for the first time in over two years, I feel like we can finally breathe easy. It’s been an incredibly tough journey. I’ve never felt so much responsibility in my life. As the eldest son, you carry that weight, and it can take a toll on you in ways you don’t expect.  But looking back, there are a few things I’ve learned that I wish I’d known from the start:  1. **Don’t rush decisions**. We let urgency take over in the beginning, and that clouded our judgment. Don’t be afraid to take a step back and think things through. 2. **Get a second opinion**. I can’t stress this enough. Don’t just trust the first doctor you see, no matter how confident they sound. If something doesn’t feel right, ask around. get **Get third and forth opinion** too. 3. **Trust yourself and your instincts**. In those early days, I didn’t trust my gut as much as I should have. Trust your intuition and don’t be afraid to ask questions—even when the doctor seems like they’re the expert. 4. **It’s okay to be angry, but don’t let it control you**. I was angry at Dr. Sharma, and I still feel that way sometimes. But holding onto that anger didn’t do anyone any good. It’s better to focus on moving forward. 5. **Life is unpredictable**. You never know what’s around the corner. But even in the toughest times, there’s always hope.  We’re finally able to move forward with our lives. I’m grateful my wife is healthy again, and I’m thankful for the lessons this journey has taught me. I just want to share this so that anyone who’s in a similar situation knows that they’re not alone. Keep fighting, keep questioning, and trust that things can get better.",

Some lack knowledge, others just don’t care about patient. Most MBBS graduates can’t even get license in first try. There’s also little consequence for doctor mistake because of doctor shortage in Nepal and all doctors protesting if anyone is prosecuted. Even doctors I know suggest to go to India or other country for any serious health issue. |||>After the surgery, Neurosurgeon at AIIMS told us that the first surgery didn’t work because Dr. Sharma had tried to remove the tumor from wrong place and also tried three different places, but couldn’t reach it properly. In fact, the repeated attempts had damaged the tumor, making it harder to remove. The tumor was now scattered, which is why it was so difficult to get rid of.  why Nepali doctors are like this, afule nasakne ho bhane.. aru doctor lai kina refer gardainan.. aru ko jindagi sanga kina helchekrai garchan ..  tetro time, pain.. mental health.. paisa.. tesai kharcha bhayena..  complain garna mildaina teo Dr. Sharma lai ??     good to hear your wife is healthy now and back to normal life|||So happy for you and your wife, Dai.

Also, I'm proud of you on how you handled the situation and how much you love your wife bhanera.|||Tapaiko jasto critical case ta thiyena mero. Back ko surgery hunu parne thiyo.

A Nepali doctor rushed us into surgery, which didn’t remove the tumor and gave us only “wait and watch” for a year. The tumor didn’t shrink. We went to AIIMS India, where we learned the first diagnosis and surgical approach were incorrect. AIIMS surgeons did an 8–10 hour surgery, removed \\~97% of the tumor, and then gamma-knife radiation cleared the remaining 3%. After two years of fear, stress, and uncertainty, my wife is finally healthy. Biggest lessons: don’t rush medical decisions, always get multiple opinions, trust your instincts, ask questions, and stay hopeful.  If you want, I can also help you turn your story into a **Reddit-friendly version**, or prepare titles like:  * *“2-Year Brain Tumor Journey: Why You Must Always Get a Second Opinion”* * *“Thought We Lost Everything. Turns Out We Just Needed One Better Doctor.”*  Want a more emotional version, shorter version, or a version without doctor names?|||Hope u are feeling better, brother. Vauju lai mero tarfa bata 1kg anar dinu hai|||If you have money, don't ever do anything serious medical stuff in Nepal. What happened to OP is unfortunately common. My aunt had a similar experience where the doc said immediate surgery but her family decided to wait and instead went straight to Thailand. The doc over there said that it WASN'T even serious. Some meds and she was perfectly fine. Btw this was more than a decade ago. She's healthy as an ox. Not saying that all doctors are bad here but anecdotes like OPs are more common than I realised.|||I think I had very similar case like your wife. A bit long but you can read. When I was 17 I had tumor in my right eye, I noticed my eye was diff. sometimes in mirror/photos so I went to Tilganga then did diagnosis then dr.Rohit Saiju of Tilganga said we need to do surgery and cut your bone of upper part, it is critical, if tumor turns to be malignant then it will be sad news, and there is risk of Vision loss, etc. they scared me, told everything that will help them to escape if things don’t go right later. But I said ok fine, there is no option, I have to do, I have another eye if sth goes bad. Looking back now, I can only salute that 17 yrs old brave guy. And operation happened, I was unconscious, they even showed tumor mass taken out. And thankfully, tumor was benign. Then slowly I focused on recovery, for 3 yrs I found nothing strange, but slowly I saw that same eye a bit different/strange, during this whole 3 yrs during follow-up with same doctor he did basic eye checks, and said it’s fine, you can come after 3 months like that. I mean he didn’t know or didn’t tell that I had tumor recurrence again. I went to diagnosis again and mri showed tumor again, I was shocked/speechless. That doc said we need to redo surgery, and said like this kinda tumor comes again, but I asked question like should I then again come back in few years to again do, that is hard, I had no idea at this time that operation could have been better, I just cried like why me god? Why did tumor reoccur? I thought enough, I am not doing operation here, I am going India, then researched then went to Aiims Delhi, there same as yours case, doctors said that it could have been success in first surgery, it’s a capsule kinda tumor and you can easily take out, how did that doc fail, kinda like that, only then I knew Dr. Saiju could have done better or could have recommended to India if he couldn’t, or could have diagnosed faster in second time, he failed in all this, I was more shocked than angry as it was my decision to do surgery with him, and mistakes could happen from any doctor so I thought like that. Then I discussed with many doctors, researched so much on that area that one doc even said did you also study medicine? So I dig deep, analyzed experience/capacity of all possible surgeons, as I knew only one thing: The only thing I have under control is to choose best surgeon, as after surgery they can do nothing, they will only tell it happens because of this case/surgery, so only that 2-3 hrs of surgery matters. I was so daring that once I asked to one so reputed doctor in face that, how many such my case kinda operations did you do till now? How confident are you, what are your thinkings, etc. because it’s my right, my life. I finally thought to do surgery with one reputed doctor dr.A.K. Grover , then he did operate. And i am 24 now, it’s 3 yrs after that second surgery, till now going good after that surgery, much sincere thanks to dr. Grover from my heart. Hopefully, I will be fine. Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies.|||I read the whole story and im glad that she has recovered and now you both are relieved and have normal life once again.

They see things online, get influenced, and start imitating behaviors they don’t really understand. It’s like skipping from grade 1 to grade 5 without learning anything in between the foundation just isn’t there.Many girls also get drawn to guys who talk like they have everything figured out confident, ambitious, “world conqueror” types. But often (not always), those guys turn out to be narcissistic and end up leaving or abandoning them. Unfortunately, most girls don’t realize it until it’s too late.So it’s important to be careful. If someone seems too good to be true, take a step back. Check their background, maybe look at their social media or talk to their close friends (without telling them). If he seems genuine, great but never rush into trust. A lot of the victims you see in those kinds of videos ended up there because they trusted the wrong person too quickly so i think this is important for every girls to not view every guys as bad guy and not trust every guy who approach like they know it all.|||nepal k*anda in big 2025? f no.|||this sub is being used to train horniest nepali ai|||Don’t go to those sites or stop watching these kind of shit bro.

What changed is a new court interpretation that looks more at who paid for what and whose name the property’s under.

Basically, it’s about clearer proof, not banning claims. Stop oversimplifying laws and for once, read past the headline before running with it.   And btw, alimony is a gender-neutral term it’s not solely “for women.” The reason most recipients are women is because many are still financially tied to their husbands.

There were others who got into better colleges than me, even though they had lower grades. So, I can’t say grades don’t matter, but the first term really showed me how tough things can get.

I love Computer Science and building a lot of skills in the field.

But it turned out none of it actually mattered.   Last year I gave CEE exams for MBBS ug , I couldn't get a scholarship and it felt like the end of the world especially because people expected a lot from me. I used to avoid talking to anyone. But I am ok now. Ek barsa drop liye and gave entrance exams again, BHOLI results aaudai chha and I feel positive about the results.  I honestly believe 11 ko results le kei matter gardaina. Ramrari padeu bhane mazza le ramro gpa lyauna sakinchha. Here's a quick tip for you...  1.Sab teacher ko chhutai chuttai notes banau and make sure to store them safetly.  2.

PW ko lectures herera teacher le chapter suru garna aagadi nai timi finish gardeu (PW ko notes pani ramrari banau )   4. Napadhne keta haru sanga aali kam sangat rakha, also if you're talking to a girl ( romantically) make sure it doesn't take a lot of your time and energy.

You do have enough time after plus two.  well, ma pani college ma kehi bujhdina thiye but I managed to score 3.9 in 12th final jyst by watching youtube at peak time.  hope tou do your best. by the way science aint that difficult as people exaggerate if you just go with syllabus.|||Chill 12 ko grade katai matter gardaina tei abroad jane bhane ho aba ramro gare hunchha|||No this aint the end,I had a B+ in SEE without studying at all cause I was carefree,had an A in 11 and an A in 12 and yes I took science cause I had interest in it and no I didn't study my ass off,I just put consistent effort.If I could do it u are a hardworking student for sure,U can surely do it.U have a high chance to improve english,nepali.B's in english and nepali is not that good.|||Nah it's fine twin  Bhujhera padha aba bata ramrari all the best|||dont panic. class 10 ko ra 11 ko format haru farak huncha. first time exam didai xau tei pani yesto ramro aako xa (yo result ramrai ho) ma 11/12 ko most exams haru ma literally fail vako ho. i can confidently say ki timle aaile laga ko effort vanda halka dherai matrai lagayeu vane pani timro result babbal aaucha.  if in case socheko jasto khassai vayena vane pani kei xaina. exams haru dherai aauchan. 11 ma ali chill ma basa. 12 ma gaye paxi baru ali seriously padhna thala. that does not mean im telling you to take 11 lightly. foundation banaune yetai ho.|||broda ngl 11 ko internal exam ma esto pressure naliga learn to chill and keep your brain relax although you need to lock in for finals cause bdesh jana gpa chainxa nai tapani dehrai mental stress ligera padhni kam nagara +2 isn't the time to loose mental health life get's more tough from here on out|||Maile plus two St.Xaviers bata gareko.

I understand it looks a lot worse to you (and maybe your guardians) coming from 3.97 to 3.10 and your feelings are very valid. I have seen toppers with dead end jobs and barely first class pass having a stellar careers. I'm somewhat middle of the lot myself.  You've got a lot going for you, you got a 4.0 in the subject you love and sounds like you're pretty proactive with it and fairly competent too. All the B's and B+'s  could have been A's with a little discipline and bit of a good luck, and most of all hopefully this has given you a wake up call.  You got a great career and life ahead of you, so take a long breath and carry on!|||mero 3.07 aako 2 baarsa vayo, I'm still alive so this might not be the end. 😅|||From experience, just be happy you didn't fail. I being a metro scholar failed real bad my terminals. It shook all the confidence within me, had me go through lots of bad mouthing from my own parents. So all I'd like to say is you can improve and reach greater heights much easily than me. Took me lots of hardwork to get back on track. You can put in half the efforts but improve further than me, don't be sad your marks degraded rather try improvising new study methods to help you improve.|||You do realize that there are ppl who will absolutely kill for your current grade right?|||Bro mero ni SEE ma 3.9 aako thiyo ani 11 ko first term ma 2.9 muskil le (I was from sci background) pachi 12 ma balla talla push garera 3.65 lyauna safal bhaye|||SAT is the only thing that can save you my sister/brother|||mero 11 ma 3.7 ani  12 ma 2.62 xa|||listen   you have got a+ IN COMPUTER   looks like you will do very good in tech  do tech degree bachelors ma   just my suggestion !|||ye sab moh maya hai Balak.|||This guy thinks getting 3.10 GPA is the end of the world🤣🤣🤣|||what do you mean its the END ? have you learned to give up this easy ? tetro SEE ma 3.97 lyayeko aba aayera yesari easily ta give up dont do brother. you got it myan its not the end   bharkhar ta suru bhayo lmao   still have time to improve   Goodluck|||good enough gpa for terminal exam mero 3.08 aako thyo 11 ko first term ma 12 ko boards ma got 3.79|||🤣🤣 don't overthink, this happens to everyone.|||Dw at all.

Consistency is what matters the most - whatever you do.      Marks matters to some extent but not much. Especially if you wanna pursue cs and want to continue doing that in the future.

Now, in the parallelogram, Triangles △APD and △BPQ are on the same base PD (or same diagonal portion) and they lie between the same parallel lines AD and BC.

And for, writing section. I think there are three section. 7,8 and 10 marks question . For 7 and 8 marks writing write 150-200 words with right content. If the content is good you will get marks And for 10 marks 250-300 is recommended. But this doesnot imply everywhere. Its totally up to teachers how they veiw .

Ignoring part of the question e.g., explaining causes but forgetting solutions. Unclear position, not showing your opinion when required. Rewriting the question instead of giving your own ideas. Weak support ideas without explanation or examples. Coherence and Cohesion Poor paragraphing  no clear introduction, body, or conclusion. Overusing connectors like “Firstly, Secondly” without logic. Limited variety of linking words  repeating “However” or “Moreover.” Abrupt transitions  jumping between ideas with no smooth link.  Lexical Resource (Vocabulary) Repetition using the same word many times. Wrong word choice  word doesn’t fit the context. Misused “fancy words”  using dictionary words incorrectly.

They outsource their jobs to poorer countries where people are happy to accept a meager $2800/month, whereas a domestic worker in the US would have to be paid at least double that. So the company saves 50% of their costs pretty much immediately. Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to. If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.

            "body": "Hello! Myself (20M), along with two of my friends and our families, visited Nepal during the Diwali holidays. We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8. Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)  (used chatgpt to refine my text)  (attached a video of sarangkot as i was mesmerised by the view)",

            "comments": "First of all, commendations for such well written and structured post, that too with all the additional info at the end. (For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".  During off season, it's easily manageable & fun because less people & no need to queue to get a selfie with some peculiar rock or a waterfall, butttttt, it's called off season for a reason, the majestic views might be compromised or not, it's a gamble.|||Dhulikhel rock view point, man why would they take you there! 🤦  Are you speaking 'Bangla'?|||Bhaktapur is the jewel 🙏|||kudos to camera work- given the health condition of your mum- i recommend you sepnd more time in chitwan- janakpur and lumbini-- may be 3 days each city- it covers pilgrimage and cultural aspect-|||Others have already suggested you some places to visit, so I just want to give you one important piece of advice. I have a relative who works as a travel agent, and he told me that many agents and shopkeepers tend to focus more on foreign tourists than on Indians, because they believe they can overcharge them easily. So, bro, be careful  there are many thugs and dishonest agents who might try to charge you extra. **Bargaining is the key.**  In almost every corner, if a hotel recommends you a place or a service, remember that the hotel usually gets a commission from it. The entire system in tourist areas like Thamel often runs on commission-based deals. So it’s always better to ask genuine locals for suggestions rather than agents pretending to be locals. In Thamel, you’ll find many such people who act friendly but are just trying to make money off tourists.  If you have Nepali friends, you can travel cheaply and safely otherwise, just be a bit cautious and smart while dealing with people. To be honest, a few uneducated people here may dislike Indian tourists, and that’s an unfortunate reality. But overall, we Nepalese are known to be **very hospitable, kind, and friendly**, and most people will treat you with respect and warmth. Just stay alert, bargain wisely, and you’ll have a wonderful time in Nepal.|||Bro, timi Darjeeling bata vayae taa, yo sabai Normal hola ni taa timro laagi taa?? 🤔|||where did u take that video bro? was it in pokhara?|||You skipped Bandipur en route Pokhara from Kathmandu.

Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||Have a great time here, enjoy it and after you go back to your home just think is it fair to take land of the country who provided you with such great hospitality?|||[deleted]",

I'm no expert but I  do come with a few facts . The actual knowledge I feel like I know it better than anyone here. Not bragging .  So take it as a means of education. I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years.

            "heading": "A Night in Kathmandu — The Unexpected Bar Scam Experience",
            "body": "After completing our last destination in Kathmandu, our Nepal trip was almost coming to an end. We had planned to spend the evening shopping around local markets before heading back home.  But as luck would have it, the weather had other plans. It started raining heavily, and most of us decided to cancel the shopping plan and stay inside the bus, waiting for the rain to stop.  While we were sitting there, a Nepali guy — sort of an agent — climbed onto the bus. He started chatting with my friend, talking about dance bars, attractive girls, and fun nightlife in Kathmandu. My friends, curious and excited to explore something different, agreed to check it out. So, we went along with him from Gaushala Chowk.  ⸻  The Arrival  We reached around 7 PM. The place looked more like a small pub or lounge — dim lights, loud music, and barely anyone inside. There were just two Indian guys with a few Nepali girls, sitting at a corner table, smoking hukka and drinking.  We were a group of 12 people, so we took two tables (6 on each). I sat on the other table, while two Nepali girls from the bar joined my friends’ table. They were friendly, laughing, and talking in Hindi — chit chat, masti, jokes — sab Hindi mein.  After a few minutes, the girls said they wanted to have a drink. The same agent who brought us there told my friend, “Sir, bas 400 Rs ka juice hai.” They wrote the order on a small paper chit, took my friend’s signature, and soon two juices were served.  That’s how their system worked — write on paper, take a sign, and serve the order.  We also ordered 4 beers for ourselves. Out of 12, only 4 were drinking — the rest were just watching the dance show.  ⸻  The Show Begins  Soon, Nepali girls started dancing on Hindi songs, followed by a couple of male dancers and another girl joining the floor. The vibe felt okay at first — typical dance bar scene, music, lights, drinks.  But after the girls finished their drinks, a waiter brought a hukka pot to our table without even asking. We immediately told him to take it away. The girls got off from our table soon after that.  ⸻  Something Felt Off  After finishing the beer, me and my friend went to the washroom. There we saw those same two Indian guys who were sitting earlier — looked like North Indians (maybe Delhi or Haryana). They seemed tense, arguing with the bar staff.  Out of curiosity, I asked one of them, “Bhai kya hua?” He said, “Dekho na bhai, kuch khaya nahi, thoda piya sirf — aur bill 32,000 Nepali bana diya!”  That one line was enough to send chills down my spine.  I quickly went back to my table and told my friend what had happened. We immediately asked for our bill — but the damage was already done.  ⸻  The Shocking Bill  The bill came in Nepali currency: \t•\t4 Beers = 4000 \t•\t2 Drinks for girls = 8000 \t•\t23% Service charge = 2760 Total = 14,760 NRS (≈ 9,840 INR)  My friend was shocked. He said, “Ladies drink price to 400 bola tha,” but by then, the agent who brought us there had vanished.  There was no point arguing — the staff was large in number, and the situation didn’t look safe. Finally, we settled the bill for 9,500 INR and left the place quietly.  ⸻  What Happened Next  As we were leaving, I noticed those two Indian guys being locked in a small office, surrounded by bar staff demanding they hand over their mobiles or belongings to pay off the bill.  I felt genuinely bad for them — and guilty for not sitting at my friend’s table earlier, or checking the price list before signing that paper chit.  But at the same time, I was thankful that we escaped early — with just a 4-beer loss instead of a full-blown scam.  ⸻  The Reality Behind the Glamour  While we were stepping out, a few more Nepali guys entered, and immediately all the bar girls — including those who had been at our table — went to join them, smoking hukka and ordering drinks.  Just watching that, I could only think: “Isko to aaj 40,000–50,000 ka chuna lagne wala hai.”  ⸻  Final Thoughts  Our Nepal trip overall was beautiful — from Pokhara’s serenity to the spiritual vibe of Pashupatinath. But this one Kathmandu nightlife experience was a reminder that not everything that glitters is gold.  If you ever plan to explore nightlife in Kathmandu, be cautious: \t•\tNever sign anything you don’t understand. \t•\tAlways ask for the price upfront. \t•\tAnd if something feels shady — walk away.  This experience became a story to remember — not for the fun, but for the lesson it taught us.",

From any browser:  Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID → Find iPhone → select your Mac from All Devices and use the same options.   What each option does:  Play Sound — helps if it’s nearby.  Mark as Lost / Lock — remotely locks the Mac with a passcode and shows your message/phone number on screen. It also disables Apple Pay.  Erase Mac — wipes data. Use only if you’re sure you can’t get it back; after erasing you can no longer track it.   2) If Find My was not enabled  Tracking is much harder. Still:  Check your Google account (if Chrome was signed in) for recent device activity.  Check services you used (Dropbox, Microsoft, email) for recent logins — they sometimes reveal IP/location.  Look at any linked accounts for device lists under your Apple ID (appleid.apple.com → Devices) — it shows serial numbers and last seen info.   3) Gather identifying info (do this now)  Serial number of the Mac (found on original box/receipt, Apple invoice, or appleid.apple.com under your devices).

You can easily check online by searching your laptop model to find out if it supports SSD upgrades and the maximum RAM capacity.

When you cut off the expectations, you feel more happier and contained with yourself. You begin to prioritize, be selfish and learn more about people. I have the same situation. Accept that I left home 2 years back. First year was really difficult. This year also, I shifted in a new city. My aunty just bought me dry ass cookies and call it a day. I begin to hide my birthday and treat myself biryani,  ice cream and stuff. And why just birthday? I try to make my every moment special. I try to treat myself the most special person in this world. And people are getting attracted to me these days. But I don't care at all. I am just focused on my goals. People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within. And people don't understand that simple thing.🤣🤣🤣|||Yesterday it was mine birthday too but same situation.|||Happy belated birthdayyyyy|||mero nii birthday aaudai xaa wish gara la mallai on  November 4 nai birse bro . anyways dhillo bhaye Pani wish gare haii Happy birthday dai/dd|||Happy Belated Birthday <3|||Meroni thyo hijo.

At the very least she is knowingly or unknowingly grooming kids. This is neither an isolated event nor out of context. Almost everything she has posted has a clear sexual undertone. She is trying to reach a demographic whose brains are rotted by deviant thoughts because of the constant stream of porn injected into their veins. It's attention-seeking for sure, but involving children into her bullshit is wrong. Take it up a notch and think if she was making OF content but with children next to her. It's not that making sexual content (or content in general with certain undertone) is wrong, it's wrong when you involve children into shit that they don't have the capacity to understand. Let's say she does not understand that involving children in her sexually-charged videos is wrong, is that supposed to automatically make it right? Ignorance, \"oopise, I didn't know\", \"it's not a big deal\", \"she probably doesn't know\" is not a defense. Idiots.|||[deleted]|||Views ko lagi k k garxan hau 😭 he is Just a kid  Isn't she supposed to teach good and bad to that kid|||here is her [profile](https://www.tiktok.com/@samishres345?_r=1&_t=ZS-91DbiR5twtW)|||Ok but why the lips chuppa to a student?

Do you even know what does that word mean? There is something called affection and being affectionate. Timro ghar xeuma weren't there ximeki didi when you were small? Werent they affectionate with you? She didn't do a hard kiss. It was a soft kiss. For women to be close to any kids it's normal. They're emotional and affectionate towards babies. If they're not, they're mentally abnormal. I don't wanna say anything about reddit women but to my understanding most girls here in reddit already have hatred towards men or some sort of toxicity. I've never seen any healthy feminine girls in reddit from nepal. They usually join to stress out or rant or listen to rants.  ​And this thread is a perfect example of that. People are just looking for something to be outraged about.  ​Not every single interaction between an adult and a kid has to be sexualized. That's a very Western way of thinking, and everyone here is quick to import it. It's all about intent. You can clearly see from the video there was no malicious or sexual intent. It was a brief, caring gesture, exactly like an aunt or an older sister would give.  ​Besides, the context of the video itself matters. As the song and caption show, it's clearly meant to be lighthearted, a 'loke.'  People are taking a 5-second clip out of context, projecting their own dirty minds onto it, and trying to make a huge issue out of nothing. Everyone needs to get a grip and stop looking for problems where there are none.  Also, In Nepal, the level of conservativeness depends on caste/community. For brahmins even dating seems taboo but while for other it's pretty much common. Even choice of clothes, what they dress, what they reveal, everything is totally dependent on their caste. She's seems Newar and I've seen newars being way open than that.   TLDR: Video is perfectly normal as it should, it's on social media, people are projecting their own fantasies over reality. It's all about your upbringing and it reflects you didn't get enough love from your elder sisters during childhood.  PS: Even a single touch can be bad and whole bape cosplay can be beautiful.  It's all about person and intent, remember that.|||what the helllll|||nah. I thought it was mom and son tiktok|||Poor kid.

No, yet most nations frown or ban them from being raised for slaughter.  The same is true here. Cows are important part of their religious or cultural identity for most Nepalese people.

No, frankly I don't care as long as it does not impact humans or the species themselves on a conservation scale.  But I don't think this can or should be implemented nation wide. If you want to allow this for some specified region where nobody is impacted, then go ahead.|||Secular country ma to please a majority religion banning beef is well hypocrisy, but I always thought beef was banned because cow was our national animal|||\"rastrabadi\" 🥀🥀|||Pakistan ko visa didina ma  सरकार लाई हार्दिक अनुरोध गर्छु।|||legalize beef vanda herana christian haru khussi vayeko , yetro ni hunna legalize|||Beef khana suru garaudai ek din Christian missionary haru le hamro native culture rw traditions pani birsaune xa !

Even though I come from a strict Hindu family, even my grandfather agrees with this. Back in the villages, people treat Jersey cow calves so badly, if it’s a female, they raise it, but if it’s a male, they don’t even let it drink milk properly, as if they just want it to die on its own.   If killing cows is banned because they’re the national animal, at least there should be a system like giving a specific certificate and allowing it only in certain places. That way, at least those poor calves would have a better chance to live a little|||  Im a hindu and I have never eated beef or plan to in the future and don't really see the problem in eating beef in Nepal, but If you eat it near me I will walk away. Another point to consider is Cows are the national animal of Nepal and I see slaughtering them as a anti-patriotism.   I think whatever the law is now is good.

We are Hindu majority. Nepalese of all religion are already normalized to not consuming beef, this will start a conflict amongst our own majority. Us not consuming beef has kept Muslims and Christians in low numbers- they are major consumers of beef and send missionaries everywhere to increase their numbers. If there are two similarly sized groups with different people- that will create political conflict and add to our issues. We already see this play out in western countries- they have major political issues around Muslims and recently Indians (who they associate with Hinduism which they've already begun to hate in Canada, and if you a brown Nepali- you are Indian to them) Don't make moves that will drive your own group's numbers low. We have to keep the status quo in regards to issues like this.   Not eating cow has not created any issue that is worth our attention. Focus on tackling actual issues like further eradicating this baun, chettri nonsense which is the bane of Hinduism- we can and are doing it while keeping our culture, traditions and identity.|||just say chamal ko bora ta paako this , visa ni paaulas ni and move on|||So much for a secular nation|||lets eat beef guys",

This is an insane lifestyle, nothing less than Dahal family. If a local ward chairperson can amass such wealth, those at the level of IGP and mantri have looted us taxpayers a hundred times higher.   This guy is apparently the son of nepal’s most corrupt chief justice Gopal Parajuli, btw he had to resign because of fake citizenship.

No shame. 30 hajar ko talab, 30 ota gharbari. Finish them all.  We found another generational corruption run. Khushi Pandey is the granddaughter of Ramesh Nath Pandey, he was the FORMER MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, INDUSTRY, TOURISM, ENVIRONMENT and COMMUNICATIONS. She is also the daughter of Nischal Nath Pandey, who served as a government employee during ramesh nath pandey’s long ministerial run. Look at this damn lifestyle. How is it possible to afford all of this when the family has nothing except civil service for the past 50 years?  Supriya Bohora, granddaughter of Deepak Bohora, former member of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and the House of Representatives, has recently come under the spotlight. Deepak Bohora was known for his strong hand in the Panchayat system and his unwavering support for the monarchy. His political journey is remembered not only for his allegiance to authoritarian structures but also for allegations of corruption. One of the most prominent accusations linked to Deepak Bohora is the illegal consumption of land where the Fun Park ice rink in Bhadrakali Road now stands. What was once a symbol of political maneuvering and alleged misappropriation of public assets is now being flaunted by his granddaughter as a mark of achievement, raising questions about how the spoils of corruption are normalized across generations.

Actually what these officer do is they heavily launder money and budgets which comes to their department . They practice “milijuli khane” . They also take funds from criminals to manage cases. Then they use these funds to bribe politicians for getting higher post like dsp to dig , from DIG to IG and so on . They conduct massive weddings and ceremonies spending crore of rupees. this is same with army generals as well.  `-`  **TLDR - REGISTER AND CONVINCE YOUR FRIENDS, COUSINS IF THEY STILL HAVE NOT MADE VOTER ID**  Read an interesting blog on this.

Chorra chorri lai instagram delete garna chai layo dhanna teti chai buddhi raicha.  >The corrupt ruling elites of the Third World, who used to steal everything, destroy economies, and create hell for their own populations, have now added one more thing: they openly allow their children to flaunt the spoils of corruption on Instagram, right in front of their starving people. Something previous generations never witnessed.  >The new rich have never gone through a revolution so they don't understand not to flaunt their wealth like the old bourgeoisie who have witnessed multiple revolutions throughout history. It's ironic that the Maoists instigated a revolution yet the children of said Maoists are now living the luxurious lives posting everything not knowing whats simmering in society. It looks like at least the kids have understood not to flaunt their stolen wealth to avoid angering the masses.  >In any ways what happened in Nepal highlights a trend I’ve discussed on here before, which is how Instagram utterly radicalizes youth heavy developing societies.  >Suddenly you as a poor but striving young man or woman have full visibility to how the elite/upper class of your country + diaspora live, but you have little access or hope of ever living the same for the most part. The impact of this on mental health, societal stability, and also fertility rates cannot be underestimated.  >Imagine going from a society with five state channels and a few cable options in the 2000s to Instagram in just five years. That’s what happened to all of South Asia + Africa + a lot of Latin America.  These guys were being exposed to the lifestyles of the baddie daughters and Chad sons of the fucktards ruling their country,  >You see their trip to Japan and London for the summer. See their parties at their elite mansions in the most posh suburbs and neighborhoods and you realize you’re just fucked and not getting there ever, your country simply does not have the mechanism to enable that for you, you’re unemployed even despite a college degree.  >**Upward mobility is like a pressure valve. Nepal never had that. The elites taxed people, slapped tariffs on imports & ignored building institutions that foster upward mobility. Instead, they assumed that sending their populace to the Middle East would be sufficient.**  >What’s surprising is how the corrupt politicians allow their kids to flaunt stolen wealth so brazenly. Kids of politicians in developing countries flaunting their extravagant lifestyles on public Instagram accounts is so foolhardy. Exposure to social media and bragging about your luxurious lifestyle risks fuelling resentment and envy.  >It's how uprisings have always been. Old bourgeoisie don't show off their wealth like those Nepali elites did. This behavior is what got both the iranian and russian noble families killed. This also happened in Mongolia earlier this year, although less dramatically. The Prime Minister had to step down due to protests that kicked off because his son was showing off his luxury holidays and clothes too much on Instagram.",

Yeah it is hard but I never got this mentality of “Wake up everyday ready to fight” that i hear from people who have been living abroad for a year or so.  Life is hard and difficult everywhere not just abroad .  “You will be judged by how useful,capable,disciplined you are” “Read and learn everyday” bro chill it’s literally not that dramatic.  Yeah your advice is good but acting like its like a warzone everyday being abroad is crazy.|||I am 14 and this is deep. Chill out.|||Unless you're privileged, and your parents are rich..

Idk if its just Australia but everywhere i go from Jobs to Uni you are given training from the ground 0. If you are just mindful of what you are taught (which you should if you wanna live in foreign country) and have basic survival skills you will do just fine.|||I think that’s just comes with trying to make an independent living. If you ask anybody who’s moved from outside Kathmandu (especially rural areas) to Kathmandu, they will let you tell almost a similar version to what you said.|||So basically it's the same as in homecountry. I don't understand why people think life is only hard abroad. Bro you choose you choose to go abroad. So earn your choice and yes survival is hard everywhere.|||As an older Canadian brother -  I have housed 3 Nepali guys.   Each one of them tried to scam, trick, avoid and lie their way through various things.    I made connections with each and everyone of them and helped them establish understanding that things do not get handed to them.   The concept to the OP post is not far off. Get up, have a goal and be driven. However, do not lie, cheat, steal or ask for money. If you are kind - you will see kindness shown back.   Of the 3 boys - one is getting deported. IRCC is the least of your worries. Its the boarder patrol services you should be concerned about if you try anything illegal - even a small one once to a kind Canadain.   Im glad I didnt turn my back but im also glad that somes awareness is bringing to light.    P.s. Don't pretend to be gay either - thats fraudulent and also solictitaion of sex and goes against your agreement with going abroad. Be careful fellas.   also - why only is this post geared to boys ?

You can also just aim for a comfortable life. If everyone is striving to dominate instead of collaborate, imagine how awful the world would be.   Be mentally tough re lol. Like mental toughness is something one can just learn. It comes with experience, dealing with hardships. It's not something you can just build at home. \"Read and learn every single day\" LOL.   Even in Nepal bills and rent don't wait. People don't feel sorry for you anywhere, even more so in Nepal where you are actually expected to spend so much on relatives and friends.   It's just a different country. Yes, it will be hard but it isn't a warzone.|||Boys and girls, Work hard and enjoy your life too while doing that. I see alot of international students in Canada from India, Nepal who just hustle , which is good but you have to take a break. Western countries can make you rich but at the same time could take your mental health away without you realizing it and it costs u in the long run.|||hor|||Communication and confidence are two main players.

People romanticize going abroad, but they don’t realize it’s a full reset! Your last name, your family status, your struggles back home, none of it matters. What counts is how disciplined and valuable you are in that new system.  I’d add, learn to manage your emotions too. It’s not just physical or financial survival — it’s mental. You’ll feel lonely, rejected, homesick, but those who turn that into fuel grow faster than anyone else. Also, you don’t have to be the smartest person, but be reliable. The world respects consistency.|||J pani overdramatic banauna parni hau Nepali harulai..

I barely made it onto the second nomination list and ended up in a college that’s just “okay.” But honestly, I don’t blame the college I blame myself. There were others who got into better colleges than me, even though they had lower grades. So, I can’t say grades don’t matter, but the first term really showed me how tough things can get. I know I need to improve, and I’m determined to do so. I got an A+ in Computer Science, even though I didn’t study as much as I should have. I love Computer Science and building a lot of skills in the field. Right now, though, I’ve decided to take a break from everything every extracurricular activity, including learning JavaScript, React, and other things. I know I probably shouldn’t, but I feel like it’s necessary for now. Starting today, I’ll be locking my phone and using my laptop strictly for studying. I need to focus on my second terminal exams, and it’s time to set boundaries.If I’ve said anything wrong, I apologize. I don’t blame anyone or anything but myself, even though I studied harder than I ever have. My lack of proper note-taking has cost me.

Area=1/2\\*base\\*height(Height and the base are same for both triangles)|||I MISS CLASS 10 HUHU|||Triangle AQD ra triangle BQD ko same area, same base and same height because under same parallel lines, haina ABA both Bata Triangle PQD subtract gara, then result ayo  Bujyau?|||here,  triangle abq= triangle abd ( triangles standing on the same base AB betwenn same parallel lines DC )   ABD-APB=AQB-APB ( subtracting common side )   APD=BPQ    short and simple|||I miss you  edit: Talking to the math, not to you OP|||Is that opt math?|||Yes, their areas are equal. Reasoning: ABCD is a parallelogram (from the figure). Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. That means the diagonal AC and BD intersect each other at point P such that AP = PC and BP = PD. Now, in the parallelogram, Triangles △APD and △BPQ are on the same base PD (or same diagonal portion) and they lie between the same parallel lines AD and BC. Hence, Area of △APD = Area of △BPQ.|||Trauma, dhattt|||ABD and ABQ has same area. now ABP is common triangle in both of them. Thus remaining halves i.e sodheko duita triangles should have same area 🔥😉",

            "heading": "Time-Travelling to the 90s with Notepad 😭",
            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I’ve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don’t know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts. So, yeah definitely a result of afforestation but there is more to this and would be a great topic to delve deep into.|||what about terai ko char koshe jhadi?|||It’s meant to highlight the loss of ice and glaciers.

No confirmed sighting.   No verified proof of life.   No closure.      Two years have passed; two years of waiting, diplomatic efforts, and hope refusing to fade.      Today, reports have emerged suggesting he may no longer be alive.   But even now, there is no definitive evidence; only assessments, assumptions, and silence.      His family still holds on.   Nepal still waits.   And many of us wonder: how different might things have been?      If Bipin were from a more powerful nation, would the world have moved faster?   If he held a different passport, would there be answers by now?   If every life were valued equal, would this post even need to exist?      Bipin’s story is not just one of tragedy.   It is a reflection of how quiet lives are often overlooked,   how conflict steals not just people, but peace itself.      We continue to hope.   We continue to speak.   Because silence is not an option.",

They called the “earn and learn” program an internship, likely just to bypass foreign employment laws. In reality, it was pure exploitation. From what I’ve read, students were made to work five days a week in questionable conditions and study only one. I wouldn’t be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.  I just hope this changes with the new government.|||i thought hamas was fighting gaza right after they kill him i think they just sick isreal PM both are shit they just want control people.. fucking hate hamas|||Sad|||I'm Israeli, sadly his DNA was diagnosed and was believed to die in the first months of the war R.I.P Bipin|||Vayo vayo pugyo,  He is dead, confirmed by Israel and hamas both.

They outsource their jobs to poorer countries where people are happy to accept a meager $2800/month, whereas a domestic worker in the US would have to be paid at least double that.

Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to. If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.

We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8.

Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)

It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".  During off season, it's easily manageable & fun because less people & no need to queue to get a selfie with some peculiar rock or a waterfall, butttttt, it's called off season for a reason, the majestic views might be compromised or not, it's a gamble.|||Dhulikhel rock view point, man why would they take you there! 🤦  Are you speaking 'Bangla'?|||Bhaktapur is the jewel 🙏|||kudos to camera work- given the health condition of your mum- i recommend you sepnd more time in chitwan- janakpur and lumbini-- may be 3 days each city- it covers pilgrimage and cultural aspect-|||Others have already suggested you some places to visit, so I just want to give you one important piece of advice. I have a relative who works as a travel agent, and he told me that many agents and shopkeepers tend to focus more on foreign tourists than on Indians, because they believe they can overcharge them easily. So, bro, be careful  there are many thugs and dishonest agents who might try to charge you extra. **Bargaining is the key.**  In almost every corner, if a hotel recommends you a place or a service, remember that the hotel usually gets a commission from it. The entire system in tourist areas like Thamel often runs on commission-based deals. So it’s always better to ask genuine locals for suggestions rather than agents pretending to be locals. In Thamel, you’ll find many such people who act friendly but are just trying to make money off tourists.  If you have Nepali friends, you can travel cheaply and safely otherwise, just be a bit cautious and smart while dealing with people. To be honest, a few uneducated people here may dislike Indian tourists, and that’s an unfortunate reality. But overall, we Nepalese are known to be **very hospitable, kind, and friendly**, and most people will treat you with respect and warmth. Just stay alert, bargain wisely, and you’ll have a wonderful time in Nepal.|||Bro, timi Darjeeling bata vayae taa, yo sabai Normal hola ni taa timro laagi taa?? 🤔|||where did u take that video bro? was it in pokhara?|||You skipped Bandipur en route Pokhara from Kathmandu.

Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||Have a great time here, enjoy it and after you go back to your home just think is it fair to take land of the country who provided you with such great hospitality?|||[deleted]",

Nepal army was already very cautious by what happened in 23rd and also long while back during maoist insurgency.

Now nearly **45% of Nepal’s total land** is covered by forests — up from around **25% in the early 1990s**.  Pretty wild, right?

I'm no expert but I  do come with a few facts . The actual knowledge I feel like I know it better than anyone here. Not bragging .  So take it as a means of education. I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it.

            "heading": "A Night in Kathmandu — The Unexpected Bar Scam Experience",
            "body": "After completing our last destination in Kathmandu, our Nepal trip was almost coming to an end. We had planned to spend the evening shopping around local markets before heading back home.  But as luck would have it, the weather had other plans. It started raining heavily, and most of us decided to cancel the shopping plan and stay inside the bus, waiting for the rain to stop.  While we were sitting there, a Nepali guy — sort of an agent — climbed onto the bus. He started chatting with my friend, talking about dance bars, attractive girls, and fun nightlife in Kathmandu. My friends, curious and excited to explore something different, agreed to check it out. So, we went along with him from Gaushala Chowk.  ⸻  The Arrival  We reached around 7 PM. The place looked more like a small pub or lounge — dim lights, loud music, and barely anyone inside. There were just two Indian guys with a few Nepali girls, sitting at a corner table, smoking hukka and drinking.  We were a group of 12 people, so we took two tables (6 on each). I sat on the other table, while two Nepali girls from the bar joined my friends’ table. They were friendly, laughing, and talking in Hindi — chit chat, masti, jokes — sab Hindi mein.  After a few minutes, the girls said they wanted to have a drink. The same agent who brought us there told my friend, “Sir, bas 400 Rs ka juice hai.” They wrote the order on a small paper chit, took my friend’s signature, and soon two juices were served.  That’s how their system worked — write on paper, take a sign, and serve the order.  We also ordered 4 beers for ourselves. Out of 12, only 4 were drinking — the rest were just watching the dance show.  ⸻  The Show Begins  Soon, Nepali girls started dancing on Hindi songs, followed by a couple of male dancers and another girl joining the floor. The vibe felt okay at first — typical dance bar scene, music, lights, drinks.  But after the girls finished their drinks, a waiter brought a hukka pot to our table without even asking. We immediately told him to take it away. The girls got off from our table soon after that.  ⸻  Something Felt Off  After finishing the beer, me and my friend went to the washroom. There we saw those same two Indian guys who were sitting earlier — looked like North Indians (maybe Delhi or Haryana). They seemed tense, arguing with the bar staff.  Out of curiosity, I asked one of them, “Bhai kya hua?” He said, “Dekho na bhai, kuch khaya nahi, thoda piya sirf — aur bill 32,000 Nepali bana diya!”  That one line was enough to send chills down my spine.  I quickly went back to my table and told my friend what had happened. We immediately asked for our bill — but the damage was already done.  ⸻  The Shocking Bill  The bill came in Nepali currency: \t•\t4 Beers = 4000 \t•\t2 Drinks for girls = 8000 \t•\t23% Service charge = 2760 Total = 14,760 NRS (≈ 9,840 INR)  My friend was shocked. He said, “Ladies drink price to 400 bola tha,” but by then, the agent who brought us there had vanished.  There was no point arguing — the staff was large in number, and the situation didn’t look safe. Finally, we settled the bill for 9,500 INR and left the place quietly.  ⸻  What Happened Next  As we were leaving, I noticed those two Indian guys being locked in a small office, surrounded by bar staff demanding they hand over their mobiles or belongings to pay off the bill.  I felt genuinely bad for them — and guilty for not sitting at my friend’s table earlier, or checking the price list before signing that paper chit.  But at the same time, I was thankful that we escaped early — with just a 4-beer loss instead of a full-blown scam.  ⸻  The Reality Behind the Glamour  While we were stepping out, a few more Nepali guys entered, and immediately all the bar girls — including those who had been at our table — went to join them, smoking hukka and ordering drinks.  Just watching that, I could only think: “Isko to aaj 40,000–50,000 ka chuna lagne wala hai.”  ⸻  Final Thoughts  Our Nepal trip overall was beautiful — from Pokhara’s serenity to the spiritual vibe of Pashupatinath. But this one Kathmandu nightlife experience was a reminder that not everything that glitters is gold.  If you ever plan to explore nightlife in Kathmandu, be cautious: \t•\tNever sign anything you don’t understand. \t•\tAlways ask for the price upfront. \t•\tAnd if something feels shady — walk away.  This experience became a story to remember — not for the fun, but for the lesson it taught us.",

I’m currently abroad, but my mom and my rabbit were at home. The noise was so intense that even over the phone, I could hear it in the background. My rabbit was terrified and yesterday morning, on Laxmi Pujamy mom called crying, he was gone. The continuous sound of fireworks had stressed him so much that his little heart couldn’t take it anymore. He died scared and alone, and I wasn’t even there to hold him. I was supposed to be home in just 1.5 months. I kept imagining how happy he’d be when he’d see me again.   He wasn’t just a pet. He was family, my little brother. I don’t have siblings, and he filled that space in my life with his sweet energy and unconditional love. I can’t describe the guilt and pain I feel. I keep imagining him hiding in fear, shaking every time another pataka went off, and I hate that I couldn’t be there for me. My lil bro didn’t deserve this. None of them do.",

I'm sorry your beautiful little bunny brother is gone.|||This was a festival meant to celebrate what we mostly ignore, nature's gifts and spiritual connections but people make it about pleasure in harmful ways. I'm very sorry for your loss. What was meant to be a heartwarming celebration, was infiltrated by these customs no one knows who started.|||I am so sorry for your loss. Try to dont play such scenarios in your head, I know its hard..  Yes, many animals experience severe distress due to fireworks and firecrackers, cows, dogs, cats etc. The smaller the animal, stronger the distress.   You can check statistics over the world, its a real issue. We humans dont respect the native habitants (animals) and this is just one of examples. Like, is the loud sound more important than a divine life (as all life is divine)?  Can that simbolism be expressed in a better way, by singing, instruments etc...  Luckily, as the world is slowly becoming aware of this, so the regulations starts to exist. In many countries there are now regulations that prohibit fireworks and firecrackers, exactly because of this reason (not to mention distress to some humans that exist too..).|||I am so so sorry.

I'm not trying to be rude or to devalue your loss. It must be sad for you, yes, but I feel worse for that rabbit who lost its life because you made it live with humans and could not accommodate its needs. Firecrackers didn't take his life.  Saying \"firecrackers took my rabbit's life\" is like putting a child on the middle of the road and complaining that \"car took my child's life\". Should the driver have been more careful? Yes. But shouldn't the parent be accountable too?|||Is a rabbit more important than a chicken? Is the festival cultural practice of fireworks less important than rabbits life?

From your iPhone / iPad:  Open Find My → Devices → tap your Mac.  Options: Play Sound, Directions (if location available), Mark as Lost (Lock), Erase This Device.   From any browser:  Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID → Find iPhone → select your Mac from All Devices and use the same options.   What each option does:  Play Sound — helps if it’s nearby.  Mark as Lost / Lock — remotely locks the Mac with a passcode and shows your message/phone number on screen. It also disables Apple Pay.  Erase Mac — wipes data. Use only if you’re sure you can’t get it back; after erasing you can no longer track it.   2) If Find My was not enabled  Tracking is much harder. Still:  Check your Google account (if Chrome was signed in) for recent device activity.  Check services you used (Dropbox, Microsoft, email) for recent logins — they sometimes reveal IP/location.  Look at any linked accounts for device lists under your Apple ID (appleid.apple.com → Devices) — it shows serial numbers and last seen info.   3) Gather identifying info (do this now)  Serial number of the Mac (found on original box/receipt, Apple invoice, or appleid.apple.com under your devices).

I used to work for a Nepali Marwari owner here in the US who had around 30 stores under one of the biggest wireless companies in the country. Dude was loaded the brand name itself brought in enough business to make him filthy rich.  But man, the micromanagement was on another level. He believed employees should always be under pressure. Two minutes late? You’d get sent home with 2–3 follow-up emails. He had cameras everywhere and watched every move if you touched your phone for even a second, you’d get an email warning.  We had to message the group chat every time we clocked in, went on break, and clocked out while doing same in an app. It was ridiculous. The managers around him were total yes-men with no real management skills or education, just doing whatever the boss said.

Tech adaptations are wide and quick, but regulation and accountability are close to non-existent. There is also a steep decline in the quality and camaraderie of the developer community.   Ultimately, the possibility and goal of earning well compared to other professions is and has been the motivation for lots of young graduates getting into software/product development/design. With the field now getting more complex and overwhelming to start as a beginner, and the unstable tech-job market, it puts more pressure on newcomers to integrate.  For these kinds of companies (mostly newly started, providing services as consultants for foreign companies), there's a low probability of growing to the scale of other established tech companies in Nepal. But I'm not trying to undermine and paint a negative image here. Rather, it can be the best opportunity and environment for a motivated individual to learn and grow together with team members.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So, here are a couple of points I'd like to suggest to newcomers/students getting into this profession:  * **GROWTH**: Always keep your individual growth as the main motivator. Keep it as a core \"essence\" of being a developer. Comparing yourself with your own past self will help you a lot in the long run. Secondly, a good payslip is always great to have as a +motivator. * **Incremental & Iterative**: Anything you'll learn or want to improve upon will take time. You'll need to make mistakes/errors, analyse why and how they occurred, and do it again with the correction. * **EMPATHY**: It's what most people lack in every field, and I like to believe that people can change. An empathetic co-worker makes the working environment more pleasant just by being in the office. They will see their team members as a collaborator in their work rather than their 'juniors' or just 'people who work under their command'.  If the 'co-worker' or 'supervisor', who'll be involved with your onboarding/daily tasks, lacks any understanding of these aspects, then I believe they're not quite fit for a LEADERSHIP role, despite their years of experience and how much BETTER of a developer they are.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|||[deleted]|||\\#CompanyProfiling   noted!|||This is exactly what happens abroad lol.",

First of all, India has a 1bn population. Given the hostility between the US and china, most of the big tech have their satellite offices in India, and that gets so much of techs from India. Because, people see scope in tech, many Indians go for BTech, CS.  But - how much of tech innovation do you see from India vs China or the US?  There was a time once when you could hire 5 people in India with a budget for 1 in the US. Now that is slowly going away, so many of the tech companies are now expanding in Africa and Latin America.|||Lol I work with Indians in a US company, don't get me wrong there are a lot of quality indians software engineers but this premise about Indians being the only one who are crazy tech talented is a joke, if that was the case we'd see some innovative indian tech company comparable to the ones from China/US.|||'America Kya keheta tha' ?|||Bill Gates also said he would rather hire lazy people to his company because they would find an easier way to do difficult task.|||I once interned at one of the FAANG (now MAANG) companies, and from my experience, I can say without a doubt that Indians play a massive role in the top American tech firms. They’ve become an inseparable part of the U.S. IT industry a huge portion of the real engineering work is done by them. These companies rely heavily on Indian talent, and because of that, Indian Americans have grown to become quite influential, even in U.S. politics. It’s no surprise that they’re now the highest-earning ethnic group in the entire country.  I remember one senior engineer I worked with a German once told me, *“Indian Americans are the 21st-century Jews of America.”* That line stuck with me.  But it does make you wonder if Indians are so talented, why isn’t India as developed as the U.S.? The main issue is the lack of a strong support system and consistent government backing for innovation and startups. For a long time, India didn’t create the right environment to make full use of its skilled people.  Now, about whether India is catching up to China in tech not quite yet. Chinese engineers are incredibly skilled, and China still has a big edge in infrastructure, funding, and startup ecosystems. Right now, India sits at number three, behind the U.S. and China, in the global tech scene. But give it another 20–25 years, and India could very well take the second spot, right after China.  That said, India’s future looks bright. The liberalization policies and the country’s strong emphasis on education have built a solid foundation. Institutions like the IITs, AIIMS, and IIMs have produced some of the best minds in engineering, medicine, and business. These people are driving not just India’s growth but also global innovation. With an open economy, a thriving startup culture, and millions of ambitious young people, India is steadily moving toward becoming one of the leading technology and economic powers of the world behind China.|||Is there another Microsoft in China though?|||India chai haina China le chai banauxa arko MS    They are good at creating and that works too   India on other hand will send huge skilled resources tara banauna chai sakdaina hai   India ko IT market thulo xa    ani China ko le ta duniya nai chalya xa hai   reminded of some so called nepali techfluencers haru    Nepal lai IT hub banayera tech revolution lyaune    some dude from NASIT (shitty association of IT comanies of Nepal)|||Well Indians are great at tech that's a fact we can't deny that.

The reality is that India lacks internet giants, nor does it have widely used software applications. Even the major software applications developed domestically are from the US. While you could argue that Indians participated in the development of these applications, it's still not Indian software. This isn't entirely bad, however. The internet industry is dominated by only two major players: the US and China. Even Europe and Japan have seen their internet industries and talent drained by the US. For example, in the electric vehicle industry, Chinese electric vehicle companies are internet giants, while German electric vehicle companies are industrial giants. Germany's lack of internet talent forces it to partner with Chinese companies for technology, whereas 30 years ago, China partnered with German automakers due to a lack of technology. Before his death, Henry Kissinger expressed concern about Europe's extreme lack of long-term strategic planning. Many Europeans still fail to grasp this reality, their thinking still mired in outdated Cold War thinking, which sees a Soviet Union as the scapegoat for all their mistakes. India and many other countries haven't fared any better than Europe.|||Bro been working with Indians for last 2 years. 90% of them are \"Kaam chorr\".|||1.

But we studied together at NITR, India.  The process in India itself is top, so it's real hard to get recruited from Nepalese colleges.|||Applying to FAANG from India is not worth it bro. First thing the competition is huge and second thing the pay for FAANG position in India is like what at max 1.5 to 2 Crore if you get lucky. And I seriously believe that the stress to compensation is not worth it.  If it was in the case of USA especially in the bay area, then I would say the grind was worth it because they pay ridiculously high, like even after all the tax cuts and expenses you can save around 100-150k easily in a year given your compensation is 350-400k USD per year and the position is at the bay area.  But competition is tough there too, you need PhDs and all.  But I think it's still better than India. In India nowadays almost like minimum 10 lakhs students have already mugged up at least 300-400 leetcode questions so, chances are slim there.  My advice is target for such positions where the competition is low, grind there for 3-4 years and apply as independent contractors for remote position, you can easily make above 100k if you are sharp.  Then move to Romania applying a digital nomad visa and pay only about flat 10-11% tax for your 100k plus income. Cost of living is also affordable in Romania, soon to be included into schengen and of course after 5 years apply for PR, get the passport and travel freely for vacation. (It's passport is in top ten strongest list)  And this is the most achievable goal and path for a Nepali IT specialist. Even if you get 60k USD remote job in Nepal, it's not worth it because the progressive tax system will make the effective tax to around 30-33% and all your tax for what? Into the belly of corrupt politicians.  Actually it's a bad idea to live in Nepal, the tax is too much. You pay 25% tax and 13% vat for almost everything. Forget about buying vehicles, the added cost is like price of Vehicle(100%) and 80% flat tax + 13% vat + 10-25% profit margin + extraa whatever. You pay more than double for any vehicles.

Nepal has more women than men and many of girls are desperate to marry to any men. Also many men are abroad in gulfs and tend to return not very soon. So girls in villagers are getting short of mens so your opinion is laughable|||True af. Baau aama le milaidi halchan bhanera matra ho natra adhi Kta haru single nai marthe🤣|||For this are we to bame the social conditioning, the patriarchy, the education system, the parenting or just blame the male gender. It's not just a male flaw the problem runs deeper it's deep rooted in our culture and society. Maybe we're a flawed society. So let's create a better society where men aren't like this? But this doesn't mean we should use society as an excuse to avoid personal accountability. Every man is still responsible for unlearning harmful behavior and trying to be a better person. But we also can’t ignore why so many men think and act this way in the first place.|||Don't worry homies, it ain't just you.

Also, I can also see increase in bad marriages especially in lower/middle class. Why? Weak financial backgrounds being from lower/middle, and more lovestruck fools getting into marriage.|||Yea Arrange marriage is shit. You will get trap for unnecessary drama both for men as well as women and never ending fight. Better is to not marry than marry someone whom you don't like.|||There are more men than women. Also, if men don't get married, women automatically don't get married too.|||This is why I believe in dowry concept it might sound rude but this is what it is. Since, most of the people have their past life and multiple relationships even before marriage these days. And that relation sometimes seems so so deeply rooted that it becomes difficult to forget. Some are involved in extramarital affairs as well. Then there's bitterness in the present married life and relations with family of husband. Now assume if her husband was single till the marriage for a perfect wife but what he got? Nothing but mental tension afterwards.   The psychological impact a normal people can't even bear. And sometimes girls even planned to marry a rich guy just for money and then divorce and get alimony which she'll spend with her lover. Sometimes, she even plans to kill her husband to get out of that thing. This is freaking crazy how people are thinking this way. I'm not justifying that she's the only culprit here but also her ex cum present hidden lover is equally involved.   Now in this situation it's better to live unmarried or take a grand amount as collateral if you are doing an arranged marriage. So that it will be easier for alimony.   You might call me bias but the thing is different. If we alternate the situation like a groom will have to leave his home and settle with bride forever, and if alimony should be paid by the bride after getting divorced, yeah a groom should have to give dowry as the collateral.   Fun fact: Love marriages crash faster than arranged ones. It’s like 1 v 1 versus many v many, so too many players in the latter provide team support 😅 during clashes. Honestly, better to stay single… or marry someone who doesn’t try to wrestle your ego.      Nepal and India(depending upon urbanization)   Arranged marriage divorce rate: <5%  Love marriage divorce rate: 35-50%|||You can't blame just men on this.

Most men would rather call it \"hating on men\" or talk badly about women instead of rising to the occassion and actually trying to do and be better. It's not just a Nepal thing, though. The same thing is happening everywhere. Marriage isn't a means for money or safety anymore as it used to be. Women now are independent and can handle their own finances It's not even about social standing anymore, the patriarchal lines of hierarchy are slowly but surely getting blurred.   Nowadays, marriage is about partnership, trust, companionship, love and respect. Most men haven't understood that and would rather blame women as being \"gold diggers\" than realize that it's not the money (or the lack thereof) that influences the attitudes of women towards them.  Remember that we have an ever increasing **male loneliness epidemic** and it's not for no reason.|||The reason behind me not knowing how to approach woman is because of their parents who were mostly arrangely married and never allowed/encouraged their sons to do so|||Mate who gives a shit how people marry? let em marry arranged or by falling in love, as long as both parties consent who cares how good or bad they are at getting in a relationship|||Haha kta le matra bihe garne hora both party share equal part in this|||Girl has a lot of priorities.

When you cut off the expectations, you feel more happier and contained with yourself. You begin to prioritize, be selfish and learn more about people. I have the same situation. Accept that I left home 2 years back. First year was really difficult. This year also, I shifted in a new city. My aunty just bought me dry ass cookies and call it a day. I begin to hide my birthday and treat myself biryani,  ice cream and stuff. And why just birthday? I try to make my every moment special. I try to treat myself the most special person in this world. And people are getting attracted to me these days. But I don't care at all. I am just focused on my goals. People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within. And people don't understand that simple thing.🤣🤣🤣|||Yesterday it was mine birthday too but same situation.|||Happy belated birthdayyyyy|||mero nii birthday aaudai xaa wish gara la mallai on  November 4 nai birse bro . anyways dhillo bhaye Pani wish gare haii Happy birthday dai/dd|||Happy Belated Birthday <3|||Meroni thyo hijo.

At the very least she is knowingly or unknowingly grooming kids. This is neither an isolated event nor out of context. Almost everything she has posted has a clear sexual undertone. She is trying to reach a demographic whose brains are rotted by deviant thoughts because of the constant stream of porn injected into their veins. It's attention-seeking for sure, but involving children into her bullshit is wrong. Take it up a notch and think if she was making OF content but with children next to her. It's not that making sexual content (or content in general with certain undertone) is wrong, it's wrong when you involve children into shit that they don't have the capacity to understand. Let's say she does not understand that involving children in her sexually-charged videos is wrong, is that supposed to automatically make it right? Ignorance, \"oopise, I didn't know\", \"it's not a big deal\", \"she probably doesn't know\" is not a defense. Idiots.|||[deleted]|||Views ko lagi k k garxan hau 😭 he is Just a kid  Isn't she supposed to teach good and bad to that kid|||here is her [profile](https://www.tiktok.com/@samishres345?_r=1&_t=ZS-91DbiR5twtW)|||Ok but why the lips chuppa to a student?

Do you even know what does that word mean? There is something called affection and being affectionate. Timro ghar xeuma weren't there ximeki didi when you were small? Werent they affectionate with you? She didn't do a hard kiss. It was a soft kiss. For women to be close to any kids it's normal. They're emotional and affectionate towards babies. If they're not, they're mentally abnormal. I don't wanna say anything about reddit women but to my understanding most girls here in reddit already have hatred towards men or some sort of toxicity. I've never seen any healthy feminine girls in reddit from nepal. They usually join to stress out or rant or listen to rants.  ​And this thread is a perfect example of that. People are just looking for something to be outraged about.  ​Not every single interaction between an adult and a kid has to be sexualized. That's a very Western way of thinking, and everyone here is quick to import it. It's all about intent. You can clearly see from the video there was no malicious or sexual intent. It was a brief, caring gesture, exactly like an aunt or an older sister would give.  ​Besides, the context of the video itself matters. As the song and caption show, it's clearly meant to be lighthearted, a 'loke.'  People are taking a 5-second clip out of context, projecting their own dirty minds onto it, and trying to make a huge issue out of nothing. Everyone needs to get a grip and stop looking for problems where there are none.  Also, In Nepal, the level of conservativeness depends on caste/community. For brahmins even dating seems taboo but while for other it's pretty much common. Even choice of clothes, what they dress, what they reveal, everything is totally dependent on their caste. She's seems Newar and I've seen newars being way open than that.   TLDR: Video is perfectly normal as it should, it's on social media, people are projecting their own fantasies over reality. It's all about your upbringing and it reflects you didn't get enough love from your elder sisters during childhood.  PS: Even a single touch can be bad and whole bape cosplay can be beautiful.  It's all about person and intent, remember that.|||what the helllll|||nah. I thought it was mom and son tiktok|||Poor kid.

You’re not being bullied, you’re being held accountable and pay fair share.  And that “Shame on you, GreenPeace” line? Cute.

I agree that we have seen many rich and high power people get away with any crime. But let me remind you some cases : Maina Sunuwar, Rabi Lammichanne and other where everyone praised the court and claimed justice stood.Even you might know many of the cases  What I find uncomfortably troubling is that  People have been shifting their narrative about the court in whatever comforts them. Literally what Rabi did : When big politicians got GUITY from the court he said \"adalat le vaneko namanne?\"  When it was his turn he said every court is corrupt trying to get away. We are facing a same scenario here. Firstly the case was approached from a minor consent. And as far i believe the age couldn't be proven to be under 18. So this might have been a consensual sex.|||Maile timilai euta kunai case lagaidiye vane timi criminal vayou?

I don’t know Sandeep personally and don’t care if he’s arrogant or k k. It doesn’t matter. Because that’s not why he’s defamed.   Aba you’ll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re. Harek din naya bayaan and naya kahaani. Kt party ko main intention nai was to get as much of compensation as possible rather than punishing Sandeep.

No, yet most nations frown or ban them from being raised for slaughter.  The same is true here. Cows are important part of their religious or cultural identity for most Nepalese people. So, I don't think such legalization will work or be treated positively.  Do I personally think Cows, or even dogs or cats should be banned? No, frankly I don't care as long as it does not impact humans or the species themselves on a conservation scale.  But I don't think this can or should be implemented nation wide.

We are Hindu majority. Nepalese of all religion are already normalized to not consuming beef, this will start a conflict amongst our own majority. Us not consuming beef has kept Muslims and Christians in low numbers- they are major consumers of beef and send missionaries everywhere to increase their numbers. If there are two similarly sized groups with different people- that will create political conflict and add to our issues. We already see this play out in western countries- they have major political issues around Muslims and recently Indians (who they associate with Hinduism which they've already begun to hate in Canada, and if you a brown Nepali- you are Indian to them) Don't make moves that will drive your own group's numbers low. We have to keep the status quo in regards to issues like this.   Not eating cow has not created any issue that is worth our attention. Focus on tackling actual issues like further eradicating this baun, chettri nonsense which is the bane of Hinduism- we can and are doing it while keeping our culture, traditions and identity.|||just say chamal ko bora ta paako this , visa ni paaulas ni and move on|||So much for a secular nation|||lets eat beef guys",

How is it possible to afford all of this when the family has nothing except civil service for the past 50 years?  Supriya Bohora, granddaughter of Deepak Bohora, former member of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and the House of Representatives, has recently come under the spotlight. Deepak Bohora was known for his strong hand in the Panchayat system and his unwavering support for the monarchy. His political journey is remembered not only for his allegiance to authoritarian structures but also for allegations of corruption. One of the most prominent accusations linked to Deepak Bohora is the illegal consumption of land where the Fun Park ice rink in Bhadrakali Road now stands. What was once a symbol of political maneuvering and alleged misappropriation of public assets is now being flaunted by his granddaughter as a mark of achievement, raising questions about how the spoils of corruption are normalized across generations.

Something previous generations never witnessed.  >The new rich have never gone through a revolution so they don't understand not to flaunt their wealth like the old bourgeoisie who have witnessed multiple revolutions throughout history. It's ironic that the Maoists instigated a revolution yet the children of said Maoists are now living the luxurious lives posting everything not knowing whats simmering in society. It looks like at least the kids have understood not to flaunt their stolen wealth to avoid angering the masses.  >In any ways what happened in Nepal highlights a trend I’ve discussed on here before, which is how Instagram utterly radicalizes youth heavy developing societies.  >Suddenly you as a poor but striving young man or woman have full visibility to how the elite/upper class of your country + diaspora live, but you have little access or hope of ever living the same for the most part. The impact of this on mental health, societal stability, and also fertility rates cannot be underestimated.  >Imagine going from a society with five state channels and a few cable options in the 2000s to Instagram in just five years. That’s what happened to all of South Asia + Africa + a lot of Latin America.  These guys were being exposed to the lifestyles of the baddie daughters and Chad sons of the fucktards ruling their country,  >You see their trip to Japan and London for the summer. See their parties at their elite mansions in the most posh suburbs and neighborhoods and you realize you’re just fucked and not getting there ever, your country simply does not have the mechanism to enable that for you, you’re unemployed even despite a college degree.  >**Upward mobility is like a pressure valve. Nepal never had that. The elites taxed people, slapped tariffs on imports & ignored building institutions that foster upward mobility. Instead, they assumed that sending their populace to the Middle East would be sufficient.**  >What’s surprising is how the corrupt politicians allow their kids to flaunt stolen wealth so brazenly. Kids of politicians in developing countries flaunting their extravagant lifestyles on public Instagram accounts is so foolhardy. Exposure to social media and bragging about your luxurious lifestyle risks fuelling resentment and envy.  >It's how uprisings have always been. Old bourgeoisie don't show off their wealth like those Nepali elites did. This behavior is what got both the iranian and russian noble families killed. This also happened in Mongolia earlier this year, although less dramatically. The Prime Minister had to step down due to protests that kicked off because his son was showing off his luxury holidays and clothes too much on Instagram.",

People romanticize going abroad, but they don’t realize it’s a full reset! Your last name, your family status, your struggles back home, none of it matters. What counts is how disciplined and valuable you are in that new system.  I’d add, learn to manage your emotions too. It’s not just physical or financial survival — it’s mental. You’ll feel lonely, rejected, homesick, but those who turn that into fuel grow faster than anyone else. Also, you don’t have to be the smartest person, but be reliable.

            "body": "I always thought my life was done for. I was a bad son and a bad brother. I let my family down so many times that they eventually kicked me out. Fair enough, I couldn’t offer them anything except shame and duniya ko tana. I’ve heard things like “Yesto xora janmaunu vanda na janmekai thik hunthyo”. Those words used to hurt me a lot, but still I couldn’t change.  I’ve done many wrong things in life which i regrets . Been to jail a few times, have criminal charges, got rusticated from college because of fights, couldn’t complete my bachelor. Friends betrayed me too they were only there when they could use me. As time passed, I got more depressed. Most of the time, only suicidal thoughts used to come to my mind. I had no place to stay, used to sleep where I worked or sometimes on the street.  One day I finally decided I’d had enough. Bought a mouse poison, tried to take my life. But at the very last moment I was too scared to die. I cried for a long time that night. I realized how miserable I had become to even think of doing that.  But that night I also realized something  maybe I’m not done yet. Maybe there’s still a small ray of hope. I still wanted to live, and live a good life. I had only two options: either change myself completely or kill myself. I couldn’t choose the second option.  So I started working hard doing different odd jobs. Quitted smoking and drinking at once it was so hard. I used to get worst panic attacks, but I managed.   Now I’ve been clean for a year. I have my own small room to live in, my own second-hand bike, and I earn through a ride-sharing app. I also started self-studying because I couldn’t finish my bachelor. Been learning programming from YouTube for two months now. It’s tough, but I’m thinking of joining classes soon. Someone told me you don’t need a college degree to become a software developer, and that really motivated me.  I even tried to apply abroad, but because of my police record it wasn’t possible. So now I just want to become someone respectable in my own country. I want to prove my father wrong. They still don’t know where I am, but one day I’ll go to them when they can proudly call me their son.  It feels unreal sometimes that I have my own room, my own food, my own bike , own laptop(second hand😁) all this within just one year. I can’t believe it. A year ago, I wanted to die. Now I just want to live better. Even though I'm alone , It really feels like dream to live like this.   Happy Happy tihar everyone and happy  bhaitika. Aja didi ko kasto yaad aayo!!

I know current governement wont investigate genz \"leaders\" but next gov should launch serious investigations on these people as well. Though one might argue at there is difference between violence caused by those in power and those fighting against people in power but even then accountability doesnt just vanishes, this is the reason ghost of 17k still looms over prachanda, prachanda was also fighting for \"people\" but he is still accused of being a mass murderer, gyanendra shah is as much of a murderer as is prachanda. But this point isnt brought up as much, when discussing the civil war.

Im guessing that the girls felt like they were being stalked, its night and the girls only had each other so they called their brothers because they felt unsafe.   im in no way condoning the slap nor the public shame he had to go through. there is no black or white here, the entire situation is grey and both are at fault.|||Bro he's trying to make this seem like a class issue when it's clearly not.

At the end of the day, even though I scored 3.97 GPA, In the Kathmandu Metro Scholarship exam, I choked. I barely made it onto the second nomination list and ended up in a college that’s just “okay.” But honestly, I don’t blame the college I blame myself. There were others who got into better colleges than me, even though they had lower grades. So, I can’t say grades don’t matter, but the first term really showed me how tough things can get. I know I need to improve, and I’m determined to do so. I got an A+ in Computer Science, even though I didn’t study as much as I should have. I love Computer Science and building a lot of skills in the field. Right now, though, I’ve decided to take a break from everything every extracurricular activity, including learning JavaScript, React, and other things. I know I probably shouldn’t, but I feel like it’s necessary for now. Starting today, I’ll be locking my phone and using my laptop strictly for studying. I need to focus on my second terminal exams, and it’s time to set boundaries.If I’ve said anything wrong, I apologize. I don’t blame anyone or anything but myself, even though I studied harder than I ever have. My lack of proper note-taking has cost me. Right now, I’m just looking for advice from seniors who have gone through this and come back stronger, getting good results in the end.",

I understand it looks a lot worse to you (and maybe your guardians) coming from 3.97 to 3.10 and your feelings are very valid.

You've got a lot going for you, you got a 4.0 in the subject you love and sounds like you're pretty proactive with it and fairly competent too.

There could be others, who scored 1000, 999 and 998 before you. So, competition is tough, repeating same thing multiple times doesn't mean, good score. Overtime, brain starts to saturate, hallucinate and if not taken care, gives up and become mad. The competition itself is not for light hearted.

            "heading": "Time-Travelling to the 90s with Notepad 😭",
            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I’ve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don’t know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat.

All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can’t get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.
