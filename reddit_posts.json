On the surface of it, it is laughable. It is triggering. But let's dig deeper.   These old dusty ass politicians have started regrouping. They now even have a gall, after being almost publicly lynched, to stand up in the podium and take us for a fool. But the real question we should be asking, the one that keeps me up at night, isn't about their audacity. It's about our amnesia. It's about the system that allows this circus to continue.  **So let's ask the real question: Why are they so desperately reinforcing the constitution?**  Have we stopped to truly think about it? Why this sudden, fervent push to hold onto a document they themselves have mutilated, amended, and violated for decades? It's not for stability. It's not for democracy.  **It's for the system. The very system they built, not for the people, but for themselves.**  Think about it. The current constitution, for all its promises, has one fatal flaw: it's designed to keep them in power. It's a game of musical chairs where the music never stops, and the same few families keep circling the seats.  So when they cry \"Constitution! Constitution!\" they aren't defending a national document. They are defending their life-support system.   **Let's be clear. The stability we scream through preserving of constitution is not the stability of a prosperous nation. It is the stability of a graveyard. It is quiet because nothing living is allowed to grow. We are back to complacency.**",

            "body": "Roll back some 7 years, Gagan Thapa was probably the most popular politician in Nepal. He was seen as the rebel young politician amongst the aged politicians. But now he is nothing beyond Nepali Congress community. What do you guys think about him? Lets not bring baseless accusations and all that, but talk logic for a while , just a request.  I'll give my opinion - Gagan Thapa was rebel inside Nepali Congress, the dissenting voice, he presented populist ideas mostly and nepali society loves that. Everyone loved him for that. But as time passed on he started talking logic which people probably don't like. He started talking about economic policies, how a government running factories is inefficient and all that, and we as nepali society hate when big business houses make money. I am not talking about redditors only, but in general sense people love to believe that nepal was a mega industrial nation but after liberalization of 2048 \"desh ko sabai factory bechera khayo\". People have communist mindset in general. Talking opposite to that hampered gagan's popularity. As time passed, gagan thapa failed to oust the old leaders within his party. We have been listening same thing from him for almost 2 decades now, but still nepali congress , and the country is ruled by the old ones. I wont say he didn't try but he surely didn't succeed. People want outcome, thats fair and failing to deliver hampered him more. Then his bakhra case, which probably wasn't that solid, and no complaint against it in CIAA yet but people don't like factchecking in nepal, that case made it worse for him. In nutshell, his populist ideas made him popular and failing to deliver caused his downfall, thats my opinion.",

He used to talk about institutions and how he himself was ready to step aside if he can't deliver. His idea I understood was institutions above people. I was hopeful things would turn once he had reigned Congress.  However when someone came for his \"aslagdo\" title, he went after him with everything that he had. Rabi bagged what 10 seats and became home minister which I suppose Gagan couldn't after this many years of Rajniti. Wouldn't this have meant Gagan should have let institutions run (i.e. elections) and accepted the verdict? But he didn't. He ran a campaign to malign RSP and Rabi. He wanted to be the \"aslagdo\" person. He didn't trust institutions when they came to test him.  I suppose that is just how politics works and he is probably alright and everything but I remember he went after Rabi with everything that he had- he went around showing newspaper clippings saying that is irrefutable proof that Rabi was a Sahakari thug. Gagan keeps talking about his imprisonment but is fine with Rabi's. He hardly admits good moves made by RSP (like primary elections they did). He doesn't want to give up being the Yuwa Neta.  I am not saying Rabi is great, he is another gafadi who doesn't hesitate to say he used to earn crores of dollar, but Gagan went back on one single promise that he said he will hold on to: not let people get larger than institutions. When another Yuwa neta came he acted the same way old netas did: not by improving themselves but digging holes for others.|||The day he started discarding everything rsp propose even if they are good he lost my respect having beef with party leader is one thing but opposing everything the party does shows jealousy and how little he is and his ego|||Aru kura testai ho, tyo shere ko ghar ma vako paisa ko barema kin chuu bolya xaina gagan?

Most politicians during his time were not good in studies. He was a bright one.  He could have easily gone to medicine or engineering or even abroad. He grew in heart of the city and had opportunity to make his career. However, he chose full time politics over his career. In RSP, you will find people who had careers/businesses  but not full time politicians.  Sometimes I feel, he should have started his own party if he couldn't change congress but he did not have the guts, thats something I fail to understand. Gagan deserves a shot at Prime Minister.  I am sure if Balen and Rabi stick for next 10 years, they will stink. In politics it is easy to grab attention but extremely difficult to sustain it. The more you speak, the more toothless you become. That is politics and Gagan seems toothless by speaking.  I presume Balen's mentor have told Balen not to speak. But you dont become a politician by not speaking. Listen to some of the greatest speeches of best politicians the world has ever seen.|||He was talking the talk but not walking the walk.  He should have fought for the change and challenge the old guard long time ago.

But no, he got the taste of the game, system was well suited for him, he had his share of riches and to the public he will forever be known as ‚Äú Mutton Kaji‚Äù.  He has been corrupted beyond repair. No fuss, all head to do was wait for his time when country as a whole was suffering. Just waiting to be a proper ‚ÄúYuwa Neta‚Äù in his early 60 and then lead the country as a beloved Grand Fatherly dear leader at a prime age of early 70 when he would be seeing the world with the ‚Äúprismacolor‚Äù motibundu inflicted  eyes with a brain with early dementia, would be selling the dream of a great nation to the Gen ‚àû.

He asked resignation of Home minister who was accused of Sahakari ghotala. Which apparently triggered many.  The most Gagan Thapa is accused of is Bakhra ‡§ö‡•ã‡§∞. His firm didn't take any fund from the government. There is no official record of it. But legally they can. As Government has such scheme. Many don't realise this. And he started this firm in partnership. He clearly stated that he need additional income to support his family.   Third, he was Advocate of MCC. I believe his stand is right. As circulated in media, not a single country is invaded coz of MCC. And Nepal has done many worse treaty than MCC.   4th, he didn't speak against Deuba. Come on, he cannot throw baseless accusations without any proof. If he had, he would have come forward. He did try to overthrow Deuba in party election. He failed.   5th, Gagan Thapa never did populist politics. Like Prachanda, Kp Oli who was once very popular. To get vote, they did everything. Now Durga Prasai is doing same.  A leader is not the one who go after popularism.|||He got potential among his generation, in my opinion.|||He is a bafadar kutta who follows whatever his dai and vauju order.

Rabi and Balen are celebrities. I like balen for what he has done in Kathmandu but I have not seen anything from him that would make me feel he has a nation-wide agenda. But he is someone I am willing to consider and take a chance on. I hope he forms a political party and I do believe the ‚Äúgen-z‚Äù individuals will support him. Rabi I know is a charlatan. His prominence in Nepali politics even after all that we have seen from him, proves the stupidity and gullibility of the Nepali populace.  Coming back to Gagan, the whole bakhra thing is stupid. Though I have played my part in it by liking memes where he is called a Bakhra chor, or by calling him a bakhra chor in his comments section from an alt account. He is a normal neo-liberal centrist (maybe left of center) politician. From his role of establishing national health insurance for Nepali citizens when he was the health minister, to his role in advocating for democratic structures in Nepal akin to European models, he is a serious politician.   Like you said he wasn‚Äôt able to change his own political party, and honestly I think his time has passed now. Though I still think he‚Äôs the best amongst the old guard, but that doesn‚Äôt cut it anymore.|||The thing about liberalisation is as you said Nepalese have a communist mindset, popular bases of monarchists and communists have been propagandising against liberalisation for decades now. What's weird is that the panchayat in its later days realised the necessity of liberalisation and PC lohani in fact started it but we dont see any rajabadie defending it.  >Then his bakhra case, which probably wasn't that solid  Regarding Gagan, Bakhra case most certainly has no substance to it; otherwise, there would be a case against him since Gagan isnt short on enemies inside and outside the party. I had hoped that he would reform Congress, I know he is fighting now for the leadership and despite being \"mahamantri\" they cant really go against the chairperson but there were other avenues where he could have worked such as reforming the student union, which I believe was well within his influence. I find him very hypocritical too, I remember he questioned the \"unlawful killing \"of Ghaitey don, but now he rubs shoulders with Ganesh Lama. He failed on many occasions to successfully oppose his party's decision ,take the recent GenZ revolution, he failed to convince Sher Bahadur Deuba to leave the alliance in sep 8.  Besides that, Gagan was a good Health Minister. He started the government health insurance program, and I  remember he added a few more diseases to the list of free health care services such as free dialysis and some cancer treatment, I guess it helped many needy.  He is pretty consistent on democratic values and in my opinion has the correct approach on things like free speech ( he opposed IT bill wayback), federalism, monarchy etc. It looks like he has a real chance to take the congress leadership this time around, lets see what he does then.|||Gagan thapa le yeha kaslai maala lagaideko hola bro  https://preview.redd.it/wpyptk2tj3vf1.jpeg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a75372a7dabfad94a17b31d6c1948021d9c563e6|||‡§¨‡§π‡§∏ ‡§®‡•à ‡§ó‡§∞‡•ç‡§®‡•á ‡§≠‡§è‡§Å opinion ‡§®‡•à ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ó‡•ç‡§®‡•á ‡§≠‡§è‡§Å ‡§®‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Å ‡§¨‡•á‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡•á ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§∏‡•ã‡§ß‡•§  ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡•á‡§ñ‡•á‡§ï‡•ã ‡§õ‡•å ‡§•‡§æ‡§π‡§æ ‡§≠‡§è‡§® ‡§ï‡§ø‡§®‡§ï‡•Ä title ‡§Æ‡•à ‡§ï‡•Å‡§ï‡•Å‡§∞ ‡§Ü‡§∞‡§ú‡•Å ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§∞ ‡§ó‡§ó‡§® ‡§•‡§æ‡§™‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§è ‡§™‡§õ‡§ø ‡§™‡§¢‡•ç‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•Å‡§∞‡•à ‡§≠‡§è‡§® ‡§Ö‡§®‡•Ä OPINION ‡§∏‡•ã‡§ß‡•ç‡§®‡•á ‡§§‡§ø‡§Æ‡§ø ‡§™‡§æ‡§®‡§ø ‡§™‡§ï‡•ç‡§ï‡•à ‡§ó‡§ó‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡§æ‡•á ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§õ‡•á ‡§π‡•ã‡§≤‡§æ‡§ä ‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∏‡•à‡§≤‡•á ‡§§‡§ø‡§Æ‡•Ä‡§≤‡§æ‡§à ‡§ù‡•ã‡§≤‡•á ‡§≠‡§®‡•á‡§∞ ‡§¨‡§ø‡§¶‡§æ ‡§≠‡§è‡§Å ‡§Æ‡•§|||No health insurance was introduced before him.

My laptop was unplugged and at around 82% battery while connected to my external gaming keyboard and mouse. Suddenly, the battery percentage dropped from 82% straight to 10% in about two seconds, and the laptop shut off immediately.  When I plugged it back in, it turned on fine, but this sudden battery drop has me worried. Could this be a battery health issue, firmware problem, or maybe something related to power draw from peripherals?",

Attention within the Nepali Congress‚ÄìCPN-UML alliance has now shifted to deciding who will be appointed the next Chief Election Commissioner. With Congress obtaining the governor‚Äôs post, UML leaders have argued that the position of Chief Election Commissioner should go to their party.  >Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba had previously stated during a conversation with journalists on May 6 that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had agreed to allow Nepali Congress to choose the central bank governor. In line with that agreement, Dr. Biswo Nath Poudel was appointed governor on Tuesday.  >Meanwhile, the Election Commission has been operating under an acting head for over a month. Ram Prasad Bhandari, who himself is facing a legal challenge in the Supreme Court over his own appointment, has been serving as acting chief commissioner. Currently, the commission is operating with only three out of its mandated five officials. One chief commissioner and one commissioner position remain vacant.  >**The commission had seen a sweeping round of appointments when the previous Oli-led government amended the Constitutional Council Act via ordinance and appointed 52 officials to various constitutional bodies in a single move.**",

Indiako \"Pappu construction\" birsiyo? Badfaad ho yo! Diversity? Diversity should be of ideas not colors or race. One party policy is the only solution. Party won't change but policies will. Who will join us? Ma party suru garidinxu. This is madness. Here are the top priority:      1. Reversal of 1950 open border policy (Article 10 allows both party to reverse all decisions with 1 year of legal notice).    2. Revoke citizenships sold by corrupted leaders   3. Deportation (don't want to rile up people right now)   4. Modernization of Military into Gurkha format. Something similar to Nepal police starting with \"how to behave\" with civilians.   5. A 10 year plan to connect Mechi to Mahakali with inter city connected railways. Sewage system for Katmandu.   6. Revoke plans to sell electricity to India and Bangladesh. Value add options would be better. Let experts decide that not politicians, civilians or lobbyists.    7. Ban spitting red paan on the street. No Bihari kids collecting scraps and empty bottles on streets.   8. A special team to confiscate the wealth of all politicians and Nepo kids. That includes Gyandenra and his family as well. Money is where it hurts the most not cussing/disrespect from the people.     9. Protect the party leaders at any cost. No retaliation or revenge against India for Royal Massacre but \"NOT AGAIN\". We have to move on.   10. Fund law firms in all Middle East nation to support our migrant workers until we go through the transition economically.    11. Rewrite the constitution.   12. Declare Nepal as Gurkha land so no foreign powers can dare to influence in Nepal. In Nepal, culture is primary and religion is secondary. Buddha, Mt Everest came with the property. Gurkha pride was earned. Never colonized. America has Monroe's doctrine, China has communism.    13. Revoke all unfair water treaty with India. Be fair. They are neighbors and we have to deal with them but the party won't bow.   14. A special team to look for opportunities to trade. Like I said a nation designed for profit.   15. .........................................  Notes: Folks might be shocked, but this party will raise salaries for party leaders. Singapore has the highest salary for its ministers in the world. For a small nation its a must. Good governors deserves to be paid well.

The brother back in Nepal is now in a rehab in India because he is schizophrenic. The brother never recovers. He lives in delusion thinking that he is the owner of the rehab. He thinks that the reason he can‚Äôt go back to Nepal is because he has to manage his office. His sister and BIL never get to see him again. He died during Covid.  ‚Äî  One day in 2025, life was going as usual. The wife spends her time reading while the husband goes to work. He has a sudden pain in his abdomen and goes to the emergency. It turns out to be cancer. He needs dialysis - but the machine is stuck. He dies shortly after.  ‚Äî  Mother - suici*e  Dad - dead  Son - schizophrenic, dead  Son in law - tends invalid wife whole life, cancer, dialysis machine stuck, dead   Daughter - invalid and the lone survivor",

            "body": "Nepali Congress, which presents itself as a democratic and principled party, has a long record of protecting its own leaders instead of holding them accountable. Politicians involved in corruption, land scams, murder cases, and financial fraud were often shielded by the party, quietly acquitted, or given bail, while ordinary citizens face strict punishment. The party has also politicized colleges, universities, and state institutions, placing loyalists in key positions and influencing administration to serve political interests. Over the years, NC has relied on goons like Kumar Ghaitey, and today figures like Ganesh Lama reportedly continue this pattern, using intimidation to maintain control. They have repeatedly exploited the poor and ordinary Nepalis in the name of democracy, forming alliances with former communist rivals like UML and NCP Moist Center when it suited them to protect their leaders or maintain power. New political parties are cornered and attacked, while media outlets such as Kantipur, Setopati, and OnlineKhabar are used to shape public narratives and divert attention away from NC‚Äôs own failures. This combination of hypocrisy, self-preservation, and manipulation shows a party more focused on protecting itself than serving the people it claims to represent.  # Nepali Congress Leaders, Scandals, and Party Action  1. **Khum Bahadur Khadka** ‚Äì Illicit wealth accumulation.    * **Action by Party**: No suspension; continued to receive political respect even after conviction. 2. **Bijay Kumar Gachhadar** ‚Äì Lalita Niwas / Baluwatar land grab.    * **Action by Party**: Protected; welcomed back after Deuba government; not expelled. 3. **Mohammad Aftab Alam** ‚Äì Itahari ‚Äúlive burning‚Äù case.    * **Action by Party**: Publicly defended by leaders including Deuba; no disciplinary action. 4. **Deepak Khadka** ‚Äì Illegally took over Nepal Scouts‚Äô property.    * **Action by Party**: No punishment; instead promoted to ministerial roles. 5. **Arzu Deuba** ‚Äì Bhutani refugee scandal & Tikapur land case.    * **Action by Party**: Shielded; complaints ignored by party leadership due to her influence. 6. **Mohan Basnet** ‚Äì Termacs corruption scandal.    * **Action by Party**: No suspension; continues to hold senior party roles. 7. **Gagan Thapa** ‚Äì Goat farming PACT scandal.    * **Action by Party**: No action; portrayed as a ‚Äúreformist‚Äù despite allegations. 8. **Krishan Prasad Sitaula** ‚Äì Sudan scam.    * **Action by Party**: Strongly defended within NC; never investigated internally. 9. **BaalKrishna Khand** ‚Äì Bhutani refugee scam.    * **Action by Party**: Arrest embarrassed NC, but party never expelled or disciplined him. 10. **Girija Prasad Koirala** ‚Äì Plane hijacking case.    * **Action by Party**: Treated as a hero; incident glorified instead of condemned. 11. **Ramesh Lekhak** ‚Äì Visit visa scandal; Tinkune and Genz massacres.    * **Action by Party**: No punishment; continues as influential NC leader. 12. **Sunil Sharma** ‚Äì Fake MBBS degree, medical mafia links.    * **Action by Party**: No suspension; allowed to remain active in politics. 13. **Tek Bahadur Gurung** ‚Äì Fun Park corruption; convicted.    * **Action by Party**: Despite conviction, NC opposed his suspension from Parliament. 14. **Dhan Raj Gurung** ‚Äì Cooperative fraud (Miteri Cooperative).    * **Action by Party**: Publicly defended by NC leaders; kept in ministerial post until acquittal. 15. **Maya Rai** ‚Äì Swarnalaxmi Cooperative fraud.    * **Action by Party**: Only distanced after arrest; before that, she remained NC MP under PR category.",

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can‚Äôt get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

There are 0 to none scholarships for international students in the UK. Medicine jhan is  designed for UK residents only. If you were to (suppose) get a conditional offer, then you are expected to pay all your fees on your own! They only let few international students in this course in the hopes of making profit. So sorry to say but this isn't realistic.  Ani, the hours you can work as an international student CANNOT even pay off your living expenses; let alone school fees considering medicine is the most costly of them all (around 15- 20k pounds I believe per year). So if you can afford spending 500k pounds for just the fees for 6 years of medical school (not even considering the average cost of living) then sure, shoot your shot. This isn't the US. You aren't given full rides or scholarships. You need to be realistic.   MBBS Nepal ma padha then you can try going to the UK. Tyo ni you are expected to hold an MD to get a basic physician job in the UK. Good luck.|||UK ma ramro xainna",

We could blame Hamas or the IDF for his death, but the real responsibility lies with our own Nepalese politicians.  They called the ‚Äúearn and learn‚Äù program an internship, likely just to bypass foreign employment laws. In reality, it was pure exploitation. From what I‚Äôve read, students were made to work five days a week in questionable conditions and study only one. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.  I just hope this changes with the new government.|||I'm Israeli, sadly his DNA was diagnosed and was believed to die in the first months of the war R.I.P Bipin|||Vayo vayo pugyo,  He is dead, confirmed by Israel and hamas both.

In very rare, exceptional cases, NTC may have options for extremely large accidental top-ups, though the taxes already paid to the government make a full reversal highly complex. * **Attempt a formal complaint through the digital wallet:**¬†If they used a digital wallet like eSewa or Khalti, they should file a complaint with that wallet provider. These wallets can act as intermediaries and request a reversal from¬†[Nepal Telecom](https://www.ntc.net.np/), though ultimately, NTC controls the outcome.¬†  Long-term strategies for using the balance  Since a refund is almost certainly not an option, the best approach is to recover the value over time by converting the credit back into cash.  * **Offer balance transfers to friends and family:**¬†The¬†Reddit user¬†can offer to transfer balance to friends and family in exchange for cash. This is a common and reliable method of liquidating NTC balance.    * **Balance transfer limits:**¬†NTC allows up to 20 transfers per day, with a maximum of Rs. 500 per transfer.    * **Execution:**¬†They can use the NTC mobile app or the USSD code¬†`*422*SecurityCode*RecipientNumber*Amount#`¬†to initiate transfers. * **Offer mobile top-ups in the local community:**¬†For people who prefer cash transactions, the user can act as an unofficial recharge agent. They can offer to top up people's phones in exchange for cash, perhaps at a small discount to incentivize the transaction. * **Bundle and sell discounted packages:**¬†The user can purchase various voice, data, and SMS packs offered by NTC and resell them to others at a discounted rate. For example, they could buy a large 28-day data pack with a market value of Rs. 999 and sell it to someone for a reduced cash price. * **Use the balance for services and bills:**¬†The user can offer to pay for other people's utility bills that can be settled via an NTC number and accept cash in return. This could include things like landline or internet service bills if NTC provides them.¬†  Warning for the Reddit user  * **Scams:**¬†Advise the user to be very cautious about offers from strangers promising to buy the balance or provide a refund. They should only perform transactions with people they know and trust to avoid losing the balance without getting paid. * **Security code:**¬†The NTC security code for balance transfers is like a bank PIN and should never be shared with anyone. The user must perform all transfers themselves.¬†|||Chora chori thula vayinjel samma balance halna parena aba..üòù|||1xbet money.|||I have seen such thing alot of times I don't think now they did it mistakenly.

Not to mention he doesn't really have any long term plans or vision for the country and his tantrums and crash outs would hurt Nepal in the intl stage. He is kinda like a Stupider Version of Trump with a stupider more openly racist fanbase, and like in the US, foreign-backed fascists are also hoping to use him to get what they want. Very interesting parallels.|||Yeah, exactly yr|||can I be conspiratorial? holy wine, cambodia.|||Didn‚Äôt he say something on the lines of ‚ÄúKathmandu was developed by Oli and Balen is taking is credit a week back‚Äù|||kp oli against ma ta boleko xa hai bolya kura bolya bhannu parxa|||I am doubting if he is helping the 3 old parties by dismissing the Gen Z protest by constantly labelling it as a foreign manipulation.

            "body": "**Namaste everyone,**  I'm 16, from Rautahat - yes, that district everyone jokes about for illiteracy and underdevelopment. I'm Madhesi, Muslim by birth (though I don't really practice - I'm more rationalist/agnostic), and I have what might sound like a crazy dream: **I want to be Nepal's Prime Minister.**  Before you laugh or close this tab, hear me out.    # Who Am I?  I'm just a kid who refuses to give up on Nepal. My family, relatives, even I myself until a year ago thought: \"This country is for losers. Just study abroad, get PR, and forget this place.\" But my heart couldn't accept it.  I was born in the most backward part of Nepal. Hill elites don't see us Madhesis as \"real Nepalis.\" Muslims are less than 5% of the population. I'm probably the most \"un-prime-ministerable\" person you can imagine. But I don't care about that anymore.  I'm tired of seeing Nepal stuck while our neighbors move forward. I'm tired of corruption eating our future. I'm tired of smart Nepali youth feeling like they have to leave to have a good life.  **I want to be the Lee Kuan Yew of Nepal. The Deng Xiaoping of Nepal. The Barack Obama of Nepal.**  And I'm not just dreaming - I'm preparing. I'm going to study development economics (bachelor's and master's). I'm going to learn from every country that went from poor to rich. And one day, I'm going to lead Nepal to become a developed nation. The Gen Z revolution gave me hope.    # My Vision: Nepal 2065  **Simple question: Can Nepal become a developed, prosperous nation in 40 years?**  **My answer: YES. Absolutely yes.**  Here's my plan - **8 Pillars of Development**. I'll keep it short because this is already getting long:    # PILLAR 1: EDUCATION - Make Every Nepali Skilled  **The Problem:**  * Government schools are so bad that even poor families sacrifice everything for private schools * Teachers are underpaid and unmotivated * Rote learning, no critical thinking * English weak (we can't compete globally)  **My Solution:**  * **Pay teachers like professionals** (NPR 60,000-150,000/month based on experience) * **Make teaching prestigious** \\- only top 20% of graduates can become teachers * **English-medium education** (but keep strong Nepali language and culture classes) * **World-class facilities** \\- labs, computers, sports, arts in EVERY school * **Free quality education** K-12, so 90-95% of kids go to government schools (not private) * **Schools open 12-14 hours/day** \\- free homework help, clubs, sports after regular classes * **AI-powered personalized learning** \\- every student learns at their own pace  **Timeline:** 10 years to transform 50% of schools, 20 years for all schools world-class  **Cost:** \\~$300-400 billion over 30 years (sounds huge but totally doable with growing economy)  **Result:** By 2050, every Nepali kid gets education as good as Singapore or Finland. We become the most educated country in South Asia.    # PILLAR 2: INFRASTRUCTURE - Connect Every Part of Nepal  **The Problem:**  * Roads are terrible (takes 2 days to reach places that should be 8 hours) * Electricity cuts (though better now) * Rural areas isolated * Kathmandu traffic nightmare  **My Solution:**  **Roads:**  * Upgrade East-West Highway to 4-6 lane international standard * Build 10-15 North-South corridors (connect Terai to hills to mountains) * Every village connected with all-weather roads * **Investment:** $45-65 billion over 25 years  **Railways:**  * Terai railway connecting major cities (compatible with India) * Hill railways to Kathmandu, Pokhara (expensive but necessary) * **Investment:** $40-80 billion over 40 years * *(No bullet trains - too expensive for mountains, but modern 120-160 km/h trains? Yes!)*  **Electricity - Our BIGGEST Advantage:**  * Nepal can produce 40,000+ MW of hydropower * **Plan:** Build massive hydro projects, produce way more than we need * **Export to India, Bangladesh, Pakistan** \\- earn $20-30 billion/year * Cheap electricity attracts factories, industries * **Investment:** $40-65 billion * **Return:** $200-300 billion over time - **this pays for everything else!**  **Urban Transit:**  * Kathmandu Metro (4-6 lines) * Modern bus systems in all major cities * **End traffic hell**  **Internet:**  * High-speed fiber optic everywhere * 100 Mbps internet in every village by 2035 * Enable remote work, online businesses  **Total Infrastructure Investment:** $160-270 billion over 40 years    # PILLAR 3: ECONOMIC POLICY - Create Jobs and Wealth  **The Problem:**  * Too dependent on agriculture (60% of people, only 25% of economy) * Almost no manufacturing * Youth have no jobs * Everyone wants to go abroad  **My Solution:**  **Phase 1 (Years 1-10): Light Manufacturing**  * Textiles and garments (like Bangladesh) - **500,000-1 million jobs** * Food processing (tea, spices, dairy) - **200,000-300,000 jobs** * Construction materials - **150,000-250,000 jobs** * Target: $15-20 billion exports  **Phase 2 (Years 10-25): Heavy Industry**  * **Aluminum smelting** using cheap hydropower (like Iceland) - **huge export potential** * Steel production * Electronics assembly (like Vietnam) - **300,000-500,000 jobs** * Pharmaceuticals * Target: $50-80 billion exports  **Phase 3 (Years 25-40): High-Tech Economy**  * IT services (like India's BPO) - **500,000-1 million high-paying jobs** * AI and software development * Financial services hub * Advanced manufacturing * Target: $150-250 billion exports  **Special Economic Zones:**  * Create 8-12 SEZs with tax breaks, ready infrastructure * Attract foreign investment * Make it EASY to do business (start company in 1-2 days, not 6 months)  **Support Small Businesses:**  * Cheap loans (3-5% interest) * Business training and mentorship * Remove bureaucratic barriers  **Target:** By 2065, Nepal exports $500 billion - 1 trillion worth of goods and services    # PILLAR 4: GOVERNANCE - End Corruption, Make Government Work  **The Problem (We All Know This):**  * Massive corruption at every level * Nothing gets done without bribes * Politicians care about power, not people * Bureaucracy is nightmare  **My Solution - Learn from Singapore:**  **Zero Tolerance for Corruption:**  * Pay government officials WELL (so they don't need bribes)    * Ministers: $200K-300K/year    * Senior civil servants: $100K-150K/year * But **HARSH punishment** for corruption:    * Minimum 10 years jail    * Take all their stolen money + more    * Lifetime ban from public service    * Publicize their names (shame them) * **Independent anti-corruption commission** with real power * Fast-track corruption courts (decide cases in 6-12 months)  **Transparency:**  * Every rupee of government spending online, trackable * All government tenders open and transparent * Officials must declare assets publicly every year  **Meritocracy:**  * Hire best people, not party members or relatives * Tough exams for civil service (like IAS but tougher) * Promote based on performance, not seniority * Fire people who don't perform  **Digital Government:**  * 90% of government services online * Get licenses, permits in hours, not months * No need to visit offices and bribe officials  **This is CRITICAL - without this, everything else fails**    # PILLAR 5: HEALTHCARE - Healthy People, Productive Nation  **The Problem:**  * Government hospitals terrible * Healthcare expensive * Rural areas have almost nothing * People die from preventable diseases  **My Solution:**  **Three-Tier System:**  * **Health centers:** One per 5,000-10,000 people (basic care, vaccinations, maternal health) * **District hospitals:** 100-120 modern hospitals across Nepal (surgery, emergency, specialists) * **Major medical centers:** 8-12 world-class hospitals (advanced treatments, teaching, research)  **Universal Health Insurance:**  * Everyone covered from birth * Poor: 100% government paid * Middle class: Subsidized * Rich: Pay themselves * **No one goes bankrupt from medical bills**  **Train More Doctors:**  * Need 60,000-80,000 doctors by 2040 (currently have \\~30,000) * Expand medical schools * Pay doctors well so they don't leave for abroad  **Use AI/Technology:**  * AI diagnosis in every health center (even villages get expert-level care) * Telemedicine (video call with specialists) * Electronic health records  **Investment:** $100-150 billion over 30 years  **Result:** Life expectancy goes from 70 to 83-85 years. Everyone gets world-class healthcare regardless of wealth.    # PILLAR 6: AGRICULTURE - Modernize and Prosper  **The Problem:**  * Farming is still medieval (manual labor, low productivity) * Farmers are poor despite working hard * Young people don't want to farm  **My Solution:**  **Modernize:**  * Tractors, harvesters, modern equipment (subsidized) * Irrigation everywhere (80-90% irrigated by 2040) * Hybrid seeds, proper fertilizers, training * Result: **Productivity increases 3-5x, farmers earn well**  **High-Value Crops:**  * Premium tea and coffee (marketed as \"Himalayan\") * Organic fruits and vegetables (off-season for India) * Spices (cardamom, ginger, turmeric) * Medicinal plants * Export to India, China, Europe, Gulf  **Only 10-15% in agriculture by 2065, but they're prosperous** (like US farmers - few but rich)  **Investment:** $17-27 billion over 30 years    # PILLAR 7: TOURISM - Our Natural Goldmine  **Current:** \\~1 million tourists, $2 billion revenue  **Potential:** 8-12 million tourists, $35-50 billion revenue  **How:**  * Better airports (Kathmandu, Pokhara, Lumbini, plus new ones) * Good roads to tourist destinations * Range of hotels (budget to luxury) * Safety and cleanliness * Promote beyond trekking:    * Lumbini (Buddhist pilgrimage - huge potential)    * Cultural heritage    * Adventure sports    * Wellness/yoga retreats    * MICE (conferences, business events)  **Marketing:** Spend $200-500 million/year promoting Nepal (like Thailand does)  **Investment:** $13-26 billion over 30 years  **Result:** Tourism becomes massive foreign exchange earner, creates 2-2.5 million jobs    # PILLAR 8: SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT - Inclusive, Equal Society  **The Problem:**  * Inequality (rich-poor gap, regional disparities) * Discrimination (against Madhesis, Dalits, women, minorities) * Brain drain (educated youth leaving) * Social tension  **My Solution:**  **Equal Opportunity:**  * Education and healthcare free for all (no advantage from wealth) * Merit-based system everywhere * Special programs for historically disadvantaged groups (temporary) * All regions developed (not just Kathmandu)  **Gender Equality:**  * Equal pay enforced * Maternity leave (6-12 months paid) * Universal childcare (so women can work) * Safety and protection laws enforced  **Pension and Social Security:**  * Everyone 65+ gets pension ($100-150/month minimum) * Unemployment insurance * Disability support  **Stop Brain Drain:**  * Create opportunities at home (good jobs, good life) * Pay competitively (can't match US but reasonable) * Make Nepal attractive to live in * Engage diaspora (bring back their expertise and money)  **National Identity:**  * Nepali identity that includes everyone (Madhesi, Pahadi, Dalit, Janajati - all equally Nepali) * Respect diversity but build common purpose * Federal system works (provinces have power)    # THE BIG PICTURE: Nepal 2065  **If we do all this:**  **Economy:**  * GDP: $3-4 Trillion (from $40 billion today) * Per capita: $75,000-100,000 (from $1,350 today) * **Rich, developed nation - on par with South Korea, Poland**  **Quality of Life:**  * Life expectancy: 83-85 years * Everyone educated to university level * Everyone has comfortable home, good job, healthcare * Clean environment, modern cities, connected villages * Low crime, stable democracy, respected globally  **Global Standing:**  * Top 20-25 economy in the world * Regional leader (South Asia's success story) * Respected for renewable energy, education, sustainable development  **Most importantly:** Every Nepali child has opportunity to reach their potential. No more \"I have to leave Nepal to succeed.\"    # THE CATCH: Population & Technology Challenges  **Warning from Japan/South Korea:** When countries develop, birth rates collapse. Korea now has 0.72 children per woman - population will halve! Aging society, economic stagnation.  **Nepal must avoid this:**  * Support families (generous parental leave, free childcare, child allowances) * Make having kids compatible with career (especially for women) * Keep fertility at 2.0-2.1 (stable population, not shrinking) * Use AI/technology to maintain productivity even with older population  **Technology opportunities:**  * **AI in education:** Every student has personal AI tutor (learn at own pace, reach remote villages) * **AI in healthcare:** Expert diagnosis in every village health post * **AI in agriculture:** 3x productivity with precision farming * **AI in government:** Automated services, no corruption opportunities * Nepal can LEAPFROG - skip old technology, go straight to cutting-edge    # THE COST & FUNDING  **Total investment needed:** $870 billion - 1.35 trillion over 40 years  **Sounds impossible? It's not. Here's how:**  * **Government budget:** 40% (from growing tax base as economy grows) * **Private investment:** 30% (domestic and foreign) * **International loans:** 20% (World Bank, ADB - cheap long-term loans) * **Hydropower revenue:** Pays for itself + generates surplus ($20-30B/year exports)  **The math works. South Korea, Singapore, China did similar investments. Nepal can too.**    # THE REAL QUESTION  **Can Nepal really do this?**  **Historically, YES:**  * South Korea: $100 per person (1960) ‚Üí $35,000+ (2020) in 60 years * Singapore: Poor city-state (1965) ‚Üí $65,000+ per person (2020) in 55 years * China: $200 per person (1980) ‚Üí $12,000+ (2020) in 40 years * Estonia: Soviet legacy (1991) ‚Üí $28,000+ (2020) in 29 years  **What they had in common:**  * Long-term vision * Investment in education * Good governance (low corruption) * Strategic economic policy * Sustained effort over decades  **Nepal has everything needed:**  * Natural resources (hydropower, tourism) * Strategic location (between India and China) * Young population (demographic advantage NOW) * Democracy (legitimate government) * Can learn from others' successes and mistakes * Technology available to leapfrog  **What's missing? Political will and execution.**    # MY COMMITMENT  I'm 16 now. I'll be 26 in 2034. I'll be 46 in 2054. I'll be 56 in 2065.  **My plan:**  1. **2025-2029:** Complete high school, go to best university for development economics 2. **2029-2035:** Bachelor's and Master's in Development Economics, study successful transformations 3. **2035-2045:** Work in development (World Bank, ADB, or Nepal Planning Commission) - gain experience 4. **2045:** Enter politics seriously (I'll be 35-36, eligible for PM) 5. **2045-2065:** Lead Nepal's transformation (ideally as PM, or in other leadership roles)  **I'm not just dreaming. I'm preparing.**  And here's the thing - **I don't need to be PM to start this**. This vision needs thousands of committed people - in government, business, education, civil society. If you believe in this vision, YOU can contribute too.    # THE FINAL QUESTION (The One That Matters)  **Would you accept a Madhesi Muslim as your Prime Minister?**  I'm not asking you to vote for me now - I'm 16, that would be weird.  I'm asking: **If someone from Rautahat, someone Madhesi, someone from a Muslim family (even though I'm not religious), came to you in 20-30 years with this vision, this plan, this commitment - would you give them a chance?**  Or would you say: \"No, PM must be Bahun/Chhetri from Kathmandu hills\"?  Because honestly, that's what I'm most afraid of. Not that the plan is hard (it is, but doable). Not that it costs too much (it's affordable). Not that Nepal can't do it (we absolutely can).  **I'm afraid that Nepal will reject good leadership because of caste, ethnicity, religion.**  I want to believe we're better than that. Gen Z is showing we can be better than that.  So tell me honestly:  **Would you accept a PM who is:**  * Madhesi (from Terai, not hills) * Muslim by birth (though rationalist/agnostic in belief) * From Rautahat (most backward district) * But has the vision, knowledge, and commitment to make Nepal developed?  **Or would you prefer:**  * Traditional hill elite * \"Right\" caste and religion * From \"right\" family * But continuing same old politics that kept us poor for 70 years?    # Why I'm Posting This  I know I sound crazy. I know I'm just a kid. I know the odds are against me.  But someone has to say this. Someone has to have the audacity to dream that Nepal can be great. Someone from Rautahat, someone Madhesi, someone Muslim has to stand up and say: **\"I refuse to accept that we're destined to be poor. I refuse to accept that I have to leave Nepal to succeed. I refuse to accept that my identity disqualifies me from serving my nation.\"**  If you think this vision is stupid, tell me why (genuinely - I want to learn).  If you think it's impossible, show me what I'm missing.  If you think someone like me can never be PM because of where I'm from, at least be honest about it.  But if you think - even a little bit - that this could work, that Nepal deserves better, that maybe, just maybe, we should judge leaders by their vision and ability rather than their last name and birthplace...  **Then let's start a conversation.**  Because real change doesn't start in Singha Durbar. It starts in conversations like this.    **‡§ß‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§¶ for reading this essay. I know it's long. But Nepal's future is worth a long post.**  **Would you accept a Madhesi Muslim PM? Would you accept THIS vision for Nepal?**  **Let's discuss. ‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§ï‡§®‡•ç ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä (Truth and righteousness) - that's what Nepal needs, regardless of who brings it.**    *P.S. - To those who'll say \"just another kid dreaming, will forget in 2 years\": Maybe. But every leader who transformed their nation started by dreaming when young. Lee Kuan Yew was 35 when he became PM. Obama was community organizer in his 20s. Balen was just engineer before he became mayor. You have to dream before you can build.*  *P.P.S. - Yes, I know $3-4 trillion sounds insane when we're at $40 billion now. But Korea went from $4 billion to $1.6 trillion (400x) in 60 years. Nepal going from $40B to $3T (75x) in 40 years with modern technology? Actually conservative.*  *P.P.P.S. - If you're from Rautahat or Madhesi community or any minority - this post is especially for you. Don't let anyone tell you that you don't belong in Nepal's future. We belong just as much as anyone else. Maybe even more, because we know what it's like to be left behind.*      **What do you think?)**",

Sorry for that.|||- A Muslim prime minister is a big nono for small nation like ours.  - Since 80% of wealthy Islamic nations have some form of Sharia law implemented, they should first become completely secular, declare themselves non-Islamic countries, and elect a Hindu, Jew, or Christian prime minister.

But yea you were right , i never thought rautahat would have literacy rate worse than humla, jumla, mugu, jajarkot . So that is one area where you can contribute starting from today. Everything starts from a small effort and every place gets better solving a very basic problem. So, maybe its not about caste, color, place of origin etc, its about intent and your track record. Make a good track record and represent your place in future.

            "body": "Hello guys, I travel alot and here are some tips i collected from my experience to get cheap flights and save cost in travel.   1. Don‚Äôt book to KTM, book round trip to and from Delhi and do self transfer(meaning get separate ticket to delhi to ktm). Usually it unlocks more number of airlines and likely to get a cheaper deal.   Same applies to cheap destinations like Thailand. You can get an e visa easily and then do self transfer there as well. It costs $35 dollars for e-visa but you will get better deals in flights. Also thai air asia launched flights to BWA as well, so people going to western nepal, this could be better option.  this wont show in google flights cause it requires visa but its very easy to get.   recently i had booked usa - bangkok - usa (two way) and then bangkok - nepal - bangkok(two way) making usa-nepal round trip under $700. including two single entry visa $70.  2. Websites like skiplagged or sky scanner shows you the most optimal flights based on prices and duration, but remember to not book it from there. only use them to see prices. Use the official website to book.    3. never search up flights in official websites unless you are going to book cause the moment you will close the tab, they will price hike it. thats why use other third party or incognito google flights to do price search.   4. international students can get discount if you use student universe app (now called byo jet or sthm like that). you need to verify yourself as student tho. but remember that your credit card cashback will only be  1% if you use this. but if you had used official website, it could be upto 5%. so calculate this and only use student universe discount if it is cheaper than normal cashback.   5. if you dont have a travel credit card, apple cash (tap pay) (if you are iphone user) works with no foreign transaction fee anywhere in the world. it does not have cashback tho but you can use it to pay anything outside your country. works in nepal too, bhatbhateni, restaurants, daraz delivery, etc. exchange rate is realtime price.   6. domestic flights during festivals, when flights to and from ktm is expensive, you can try to do alternative airports as well.   example. this dashain, ktm to bhairahawa was 8500 but KTM to Pokhara was 4200, and Pokhara to Bhairahawa was 3200. total 1100 cheaper. I did this and chilled in pokhara with my friends for 2 hours (layover lol). (this is subjective and prices are subject to change. just giving you idea to look for options cause there are flights from pokhara to/from bhairahawa, bharatpur and nepalgunj).",

Also skyscanner has an option to use flexible date or even select a month for departure and return and then you can select different dates to see which combination will have the cheapest option.   Also to add what OP as listed. When you transfer make sure to check your luggage options. For example - you bought 2 different tickets, and self transferring in Delhi. Make sure that the Delhi to KTM leg has the same luggage options. Your flight between the USA and Delhi will probably have 2x23 kg check in luggage and you used both. But usually the DEL-KTM leg will only have 20 kg or something like that. You will have to pay for rest or perhaps buy second baggage. Also you will have to collect your luggage , pass through immigration and then re check in. Make sure to have a good amount of time.   Also if your first leg gets delayed/canceled, you might miss your second leg and airline is not responsible so it's important to give yourself time.   This is a good option if you travel light or alone. What OP has suggested is a good travel hack.   For skiplag, most of the time you need to travel with carry on only since you are likely to skip the second leg.|||Indian Airport ma Nepali ko lagi NOC haru chaine testo kei ta hudaina ni?

            "body": "Yesterday, I received what seemed like a great opportunity. A nonprofit reached out saying I'd be a perfect fit for their full stack role. My previous colleagues vouched for me, and everything felt right.  Then came the reality check.  They couldn't figure out how to send payments to Nepal. Something about international payment systems, tax handling, and complications I honestly didn't fully understand. The conversation ended there.  I'm 18 and actively looking for frontend roles. I've got the skills and the drive, but I'm clearly missing something important about how remote work actually works from Nepal.  Here's what I'm trying to figure out:  How do you handle international payments when companies can't use standard methods? What platforms or workarounds do Nepali developers use? Are there specific things I should know about taxes and compliance? Should I only target certain types of companies that can handle these complications?  If you're from Nepal and working remotely for international companies, I'd really appreciate hearing how you navigated this. What do you wish someone had told you when you were starting out?  I don't want to miss the next opportunity because of something I could have prepared for.  Open to connecting with anyone who's been through this or has advice to share.",

Reasonable: You are getting paid directly to your bank with a nominal transfer fee. 2. Legal: Bank will deduct 5% tax as per government rule 3. Scalable: This action is repeatable month-after-month regardless of amount.  If you're doing any third party systems, like Wise, you lose on three fronts:   A. Wise cuts a transfer commission   B. The amount needs to be converted to NPR before sending and costs money   C. Depositing in Nepali bank has another processing fee in rupees  So this is not a good way to receive salary every month. See how much money you're losing even before paying a single rupee in tax amount.  Some companies do have issues setting up complex arrangements for just one person. I say this because I am the only Nepali person there. Everyone, including Indians are cool with receiving salaries in crypto, Wise wallet or other forms that do not work in Nepal.  The finance team in Dublin, Ireland was extremely helpful and they corresponded directly to the folks at Nabil Bank here and got my salary account set up. I just had to do some signatures and IDs and that's all.

If they commission the salary on bank account then they should have no problem of wiring it straight to your bank account. They'd send you invoice and use that Invoice to show the bank in Nepal as proof of your income and you can setup that recurring payment as your employment payment and bank'll deduce 5% on each transaction from that party, hence your tax payment for Nepal government.  Ask or search for your Bank's SWIFT code and provide necessary documents, that should suffice for international payment afaik.  Edit : unconventional payment should involve third party transaction. Paypal & payoneer work but payoneer is very unreliable. If everything works, no problem but to resolve ANY problem with payoneer is a nightmare. Skrill (I haven't used it) could be an alternative. You could use someone trusted who's abroad to use their paypal. But due to multiple transaction, multiple person's involvement & its extra fees I won't recommend it.|||Ppl saying swift so easily, clients won‚Äôt easily do swift transfer it costs more than wise, remitly or whatever that payoneer is.|||Deel works fine.|||Use bank Bro!

I'm currently juggling a small low-paying project alongside a few higher-paying student final-year projects from Australia (using MERN).  The thing is, I'm already feeling the **MERN saturation**. I'm finding it tough to land solid fresher jobs, so I know I need to learn something new on the side for better long-term security and income.  I've narrowed it down to two options, but I'm totally open to other suggestions:  1. **Solana (Web3/Blockchain):**    * I see huge buzz following **100xDevs** and **Superteam Nepal/India**. The money looks fantastic right now.    * **Goal:** Chase the high-paying, less-crowded early market. 2. **AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning):**    * This is obviously massive and seems like the safer, more secure bet for the next few decades.    * **Goal:** Maximum long-term job security and high income potential.  **The ultimate goal is money and security.** I'm leaning towards Solana because of the immediate high pay I see, but AI/ML feels more stable.  **Which path makes more sense for a developer who is self-learning and needs to be market-ready ASAP? Any other tech stacks I should be looking at?**   **also I hear a lot about rust and golang buzz also tell me about that also learning is not an issue to me I can learn things quick like I have been a good learner and good student as well so.. also like or should I go in Devops ,Nuxt and things like that a lot of buzz very very confused every other post in X and every other yotube video keeps on confusing me**",

I no longer use Wordlink, but the router still works fine ‚Äî except it‚Äôs completely locked down.  When I access its IP, I only see a status/information page. There‚Äôs no login prompt at all, and I can‚Äôt change passwords, SSID, or any settings. It looks like Wordlink has installed their own custom firmware.  Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve tried so far: - Default logins like admin/admin, admin/1234, root/root ‚Äî none worked. - Hidden paths such as `/admin`, `/engineer.html`, `/userRpm/LoginRpm.htm` ‚Äî still no luck. - Factory reset with the reset button ‚Äî didn‚Äôt unlock anything. - Checked for Nokia firmware online ‚Äî found only G-2425G or G-1425G models, not G-0425G-B.  So I‚Äôm wondering: - Has anyone successfully gained admin access to this exact model (G-0425G-B)? - Are there known hidden URLs, default credentials, or engineer logins for it? - Is there any way to flash or restore the *original Nokia firmware* (not the Wordlink-locked one)? - Or should I just use this as an ONT and connect my own router behind it?

What do they mean?   22 seeders mean there are 22 people who have the complete torrent downloaded to their machines, and are sharing it.  144 leechers mean people who have partial torrent but not the complete torrent.  If you are downloading a torrent, you first become a leecher. If you download the complete torrent, and keep it active in your torrent client, then you become a seeder. If you only download partial torrent but keep sharing (seeding) what you have downloaded, then you will still be reported just as a leecher.   > Don't the people (servers) need to communicate to each other to send me the files for download, where does it take place? Doesn't it needs some sorts of coordination server?  There are torrent trackers, such as The Pirate Bay. Trackers normally don't host any content themselves, they will just have a listing of the content, and the tracker will track the seeders and leechers. So when you download a torrent file (or use a magnet link), the torrent file will have information on what content the torrent should have (the actual torrent content will be with seeders/leechers) as well as information on seeders/leechers.  > And if there is one, can't people who don't want their stuff illegally downloaded track those coordination servers?  It's not so easy. It's fairly easy to start your own torrent tracker. If you take out one torrent tracker, then many more would pop up to take its place. And the seeders/leechers would continue to have access to the files, they could just switch to another tracker.   There are also countries with cheap internet access and loose copyright laws who won't cooperate with US/EU, so many trackers are hosted on those countries.  > Also can I become seeder too if I want to put out something on pirate bay myself with my 16 GB RAM laoptop?   You don't need to upload to become a seeder, you just need a completed version of the torrent active on your torrent client.  You can upload torrents on various trackers, or even have your own tracker. There are many legitimate uses of torrents such as hosting Linux ISOs.  > And what do people who provide their own computing resources get for their efforts? Why do they do it?   It doesn't really take much computing resources other than disk space and bandwidth (CPU and RAM usage will be low on a decent torrent client).  Torrenting does require generous people who have the spirit of sharing. Without this, torrenting won't work.  There are also private torrent trackers which have seeding and ratio rules (you may need to seed each torrents for at least a minimum amount of time set by the tracker and/or maintain a good upload to download ratio, and there are generally incentives for seeding long term). Here you will have to follow the rules of seeding if you want to download. What this means is the files will be better seeded in private trackers, and the quality of files will be higher too.|||**Basically, if you've already downloaded the file or parts of the file, and have enabled seeding, other downloaders can request chunks of the file, and it will be sent from your computer to their computer. Hence termed peer-to-peer.**  **If you've enabled seeding, you're a seeder.**  **If you're just downloading without enabling seeding, you're a leecher.**  **There are communities dedicated to keeping popular torrents active for years, with server farms that keep seeding thousands of torrents 24/7. And some torrent creators seed it themselves with gigabytes per second speeds. Spreading the file throughout the network.**  Torrent files or magnet links just tell your client where to look; trackers(hosted somewhere) or DHT help it find other peers sharing that file. Trackers or DHT don‚Äôt host the actual file, just a list of connected peers and info about which chunks they have.  Once connected, it grabs tiny chunks from many at once and shares what it‚Äôs got back, pure decentralized magic.  See the graph highlighted in red?  https://preview.redd.it/kr31xb3u7xtf1.png?width=976&format=png&auto=webp&s=c84151228f898cc0e6eb3846e87737d6714745d0  The black lines are the chunks that you've already downloaded. As you can see, the chunks are requested in random order.  However, some applications like WebTorrent allow you to download the chunks in order, from beginning to end. Hence, it lets you stream the video without downloading the entire file. Possibly, [goku.sx](http://goku.sx) does this as well.  **That's why torrents are hard to counter.**  Because everyone who's downloaded the file can send it to the ones who request it.  **It's truly genius.**  And people usually **don‚Äôt get paid**. They seed because they want to **help others download faster** and keep torrents alive, like giving back to the community that helped them.  Some do it for **reputation on private trackers**, or just **because they enjoy being part of a swarm**.|||Peer to peer transfer ma seeder bhaneko jo sanga tyo file paila dekhi hunxa ani aru download garne harulai usle share garxa tyo ho   ani leecher bhaneko chai kati thaau ma tyo seeder harule share gareko file download garirako hunxan tiniharuko number ho.|||From my knowledge, Seeders are the providers who have the files installed on their system and they are distributing it in parts to the leechers that is you in this case.   And to be a seeder is not a heavy task, after finishing the download by taking bits one by one and arranging the file, the torrent itself starts to seed if the torrent client is open. I seed on my 4 gb ram laptop too. It's not done for profit, it's done cuz you wanna help others out cuz you also got helped by others. And use QBittorrent if not alr.|||Torrenting is just file sharing among people. The torrent file is not the movie,it is really like a map that shows where the pieces are located. Seeders have the full file and share it out. Leechers download but also share what they got. Your computer downloads small pieces from many people at the same time. It also shares the pieces you've already downloaded with others. No single server contains the file,trackers just help computers find one another. You may share your own files also by leaving your torrent running. People generally share to help others and keep torrents running. The more you share, the faster your downloads are.|||What it is: 1. p2p nai ho. 2. Decentralized vatekole files are divided into equal parts. Each part may be a small chunk of 2MB, 4MB, 8MB etc depending on configuration. 3. Example: 64MB filr would have 16 parts each of 4MB or, 8 parts each 8MB. 4. SEEDER = who hosts parts (seeds)source 5. LEECHER is who downloadeds(leeches) from source 6. For this to work, SEED (Part of File) must exist with ATLEAST one Seeder.  Gow it works: 1. When you do a torrent download, you are initially a Leecher Only. For all parts. 2. As soon as you download ANY part, you become a Seeder for that part. 3. Meaning, you are now a source for that part for someone on the network  4. If more people have the part that you want, and if they are nearby, your download of that part will be significantly faster. 5. If a single Seeder is serving some particular PART, the download of that part (Leeching) will be painfully slow. 6. Thankfully, many Leechers for that PART means someone downloading closest to that Seeder will complete the download faster, and they in-turn will become Seeder for that part. So, -1 Leecher +1 Seeder happens. This makes your download faster. You can download each part from 1 peer by default, but you also have the option to choose multiple peers for a PART. 7. If you leave the file as-is after the complete download. That file will continue being seeded. You will act as a peer with all parts. Essentially, making the download faster for everbody. 8. Downloads are not sequential by design, because UDN will grab whatever is available. But modern torrent clients have the option of concurrent download. You trade download speed with serial download of parts. Useful for things like streaming video (You can play video on VLC as it is downloading, that way!)|||Simply understand like,  seeders - those who have complete files  leechers - those who have incomplete files  In this case the new downloader also becomes leechers as it has incomplete files.   In Torrent the client who is downloading is also uploading at the same time to others that doesn't have incomplete files. Only when the file is completely downloaded the client becomes a seeder.   There is no server here. All leechers act on its own who wants which chunk of missing file and completes it from the easiest seeder or peecher.  Count that the more the seeder the better the download as multiple chunks of files can be taken from multiple seeders which may find the easiest.  For a file to be downloaded completely there needs to be atleast one seeder and none or any no. of leechers.  More the leechers means multiple clients has incomplete files. In this case each leechers acts selfish grasping incomplete file of its own from any leechers or seeders with the shortest or easiest available route or port.   Note that when there is only single seeder then leechers downloads from any other leachers which file is available but since the complete file is only one so the missing piece is only completed through that single seeder. As soon as the leecher completes its file it instantly becomes seeder.  Also there is role of port which can make complex for time being.|||lots of questions but i will try to answer them one by one!  Seeders are those who have the complete file. leachers are those who are still downloading the file and have parts of it.  Most  .torrent has a tracker url. its doesnot host the file but keeps the ip addresses of the people who have the file i.e seeder and leechers. when you start downloading you client qbittorrent ask for the file and the trackers replies with the ip addresses of the people who have it. and then you client directly connects you to the seeder (no server in between).  Yes ‚Äî trackers are public, and law enforcement or copyright agencies can (and do) monitor them. and join in the swarm and look for seeder or people who are downloading. That‚Äôs how copyright notices often originate by logging IPs seen sharing a particular movie or software.   you are saring the file as you are downloading(leacher). Once the download is complete you client automatically starts seeding it as long as you are kepping the application open, and everytime you open the application. in the case of seeding it does not take much bandwidth.  torrenting is bandwidth, I/O heavy not ram or cpu, You are not hosting the file Like a server you are just sharing it.  For the love of the game. if nobody shares it the torrent dies. most client forces their users to seed or do it on auto . some do it for the freedom. and sharing is caring.  No significant computing power is needed torrenting mostly uses bandwidth and disk I/O, not CPU or RAM.  Torrenting itself is completely legal  it‚Äôs just a peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol. What can be illegal is *what* you download or share. Distributing copyrighted material (like commercial movies, games, or software) without permission can violate copyright laws in many countries. In practice, enforcement often focuses on large uploaders or tracker sites rather than individual users. so you are safe.|||Basically, you are looking for a packet of parle G. Say, 10 people on this thread have a packet of parle G each. So we agree to share you a copy of our individual biscuit each. Some will give you 2 piece, some will give 5 etc untill you complete an entire packet worth of biscuits. Sharing a copy of your file is Seeding.  Getting said file from other sharing the same file is leeching.  Now, you asked for a friend to help you look for said parle g is the torrent file/sites  After you get your copy of file, just let it be on the torrent. Others who'd want it will then get connected to you and you will share a copy of your file with them.  Torrenting itself is not illegal, sharing copyrighted files is. (But who cares, most of us can't afford any useful softwares legally anyway :D)|||Just set your torrent client to run at startup & keep it running in the background to seed. Office wifi ma chai torrent nagare hola. Don't want to risk issues with company or them potentially getting legal letter (Nepal ma ta nahola). Natra at least naya torrent chai add nagara, feri aru ko internet speed affect huncha. Download complete bhayesi seed matra garda ta dherai bandwidth khadaina.|||Beware of malware while using it.

What do you have to tell about this ? Love is never impure and childhood love NEVERR.. it is just that society hates people who truly love. Because society wants control and love has that power to go beyond any boundaries. Thus they break hearts who truly belonged to each other. Neither caste nor religion can confine love or any close relation despite your (immediate family members like siblings,  uncles, aunts or 1st cousins (in most of the cultures) and marriage is not always about producing child but core is to find a suitable partner with whom you desire spend your whole life with. If sex and children were only the reason to get married then homosexual relationships or marriages should never happen right!? society had always tried to confine and condition love whereas love is usually spontaneous and unconditional and can happen with anyone . But Choice is always yours . So choose your path carefully:-   If you have more of an endurance capability--> choose your cultural values and societal rules and protect your external peace over internal harmony where you must face pain when you have to suppress your emotions and live in silent suffering. GOD SHREERAM'S PATH   OR   if you have more of a courage--> choose your love and internal peace over external conflict you must have to face for violating societal or cultural rules called taboo. GOD SHREEKRISHNA'S PATH.   See, nothing is superior,  love or duty. Both are sacred and you should choose  one thing and overcome your indecisiveness .. either duty or love , you must choose as per your soul's capability i.e  either sacrificing your love in exchange of external peace. (Endurance) ( go with this route,  if you believe or think you can supress your emotions for the rest of your life and can digest silent suffering)   Or,  Embracing love you desire at the cost of your external peace. ( if you don't care what society thinks and are courageous enough ,go with this route )   Both paths involves hurdles and suffering either internal or external.  Choice is yours that which can you digest. God is there and he'll obviously help you in your journey.|||bro went from saiya to vaiya real quick|||Are you Kumai Bahun?

But this point isnt brought up as much, when discussing the civil war.

I don‚Äôt know the exact philosophy of the religion or the teachings of the Quran, but based on what I see in many Islamic countries and among some Muslim communities, Islam is the most violent and intolerant religion in the world. Muslims struggle to coexist peacefully with other religions and never accept religious diversity (The same case with the Nepali Converted Chsitian, they cannot accept the Hindus and Hindus festival whereas those Foreigner who have been practicing Christianity since Century do no have any Obligation to celebrate and take part in different festival and celebration of different religion)**  In many non-Muslim majority countries, Islam is allowed to grow and Muslims are free to practice their religion. But in many Islamic-majority countries, the population of other religions often declines over time, sometimes due to violence, forced conversions, or systemic discrimination. For example, just look at the religious demographics of Pakistan 40‚Äì50 years ago compared to today.  In Europe and North America, Muslims frequently protest and express their views against the Ruling people and religion too, often quite aggressively. But can you imagine Hindus, Christians, or Buddhists openly protesting against Islamic leaders or Islamic policies in Islamic countries? It would likely result in severe consequences or violence.  In Nepal too, while Muslims may seem peaceful now, it‚Äôs worth noting that the long-settled Muslim communities (who have been here since the time of Prithvi Narayan Shah, when they were brought in for weapon-making and other skilled work) have generally coexisted peacefully. However, the more recent or growing Muslim population seems peaceful possibly only because they are still a very small minority.¬† Lets jus see if their population ever reaches 10‚Äì15%, there could be a rise in communal tensions or violence.  **This is not a hate-filled statement, just an observation based on patterns seen in various parts of the world. I am expressing what I see and fear, based on history and current events.**|||Finally someone makes sense.  RESITANCE DOESN'T MEAN KILLING INNOCENT PEOPLE.

Maybe you can try to be less idiot and read [this](https://www.marxists.org/archive/gandhy/2001/00001.htm) so you can begin to understand the role of the 3 major religious fundamentalism in ostensibly shaping world conflicts (remember wars are **never** *really* fought over fictitious gods, it's always resources. True, even for those who **fought** thinking they were fighting for other reasons as they are mostly not the ones getting the resources either way, thus, the reason must be made for them. As evident in this quarreling thread.)|||You should ask the orthodox Jews in Israel who are in government, the supporters of Likuud Party what they think of \"our Hindu religion and our gods\". Lol. Hamas actually offered to release all hostages and Israeli government refused because they had bigger plans.

War and violence in general is bad. I don't say what hamas is doing is right or good but for the people of Gaza they are their saviour. Kids and women are being killed in Gaza. Kids who didn't chose to be Muslim. Noone is born religious without it being labeled or forced. They have done nothing wrong. Women are tormented and suppressed by religion. What's happening is not their fault. And if USA and pet Israel had announced ceasefire many Israeli and Palestinian children would have been saved.|||shalom|||Bipin Joshi and those 12 in Iraq !!

That doesn't surprise me at all though especially because of the covert (and sometimes even overt) backing - financially, logistically, militarily, intelligence, etc. - those terrorist groups receive from some nations - especially (but certainly not limited to) the US and Israel.  In short, the lack of coverage isn‚Äôt just neglect, it‚Äôs structural. It reflects editorial priorities shaped by political alliances, audience demand, and the need to protect state narratives.|||Well, I am a straight right leaning Christian. What Isreal's government has been doing to Palestinians since 2020, is objectively a genocide, and we Americans are tired of funding their war efforts, heck we don't feed the impoverished and homeless here in the states, but we can fund a stupid war? Both sides are wrong, Hamas and Isreal's government. Both should be brought to justice, and both need to give us our damn money back.   Listen up, over 50k innocent Palestanians have died, mainly women and children, they didn't deserve that. The people on Oct 7 didn't deserve that either. Screw Hamas, and screw Netanyanhu. Put these monsters in jail where they belong and remove Isreal's entire government and arrest the IDF bombers as well. By force, if necessary. America before the 60s wouldn't have funded this crap, neither any European entity/country.  Yes there are other genocides, yes Christians are being genocided in The Middle East/Africa, yes there's radical Islamists, yes there are rising crime rates in the UK ETC. This should all be addressed, and CAN all be addressed. Empathy doesn't have a limit and its not situational, or else its not empathy. None of that excuses what Isreal's government body has done!!

We belong from upper dolpa yet our ancestor where from tibet. But after king prithivi narayan shah united the nation our home came under the great nepal too. We have our own caste similar to tibetan. But yet we have to use \"gurung\" word in our citizen ship. Im not saying like im not happy with that but uts important that person must live with his or her real identity. Instead of adopting others. When i say im gurung from dolpa. Most people wont even agree on this. Last time i saw a video there was one scholar or expereinced one saying there are two type of \"gurung\" one who is mainland gurung which is located in pokhara side and other who comes from tibet side like paila mongol dekhe ayera base ko vandai thio. And in that videos comment real land gurung werent happy with that. So that made me think twice. Since we all came under nepals map. We follow every rule by nepals goverment.

Plus nepali goverment hasnt even been able to light up our home till now. No electrcity, no job offer, no proper health care, no proper road, we still stayed silient till this date.

You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can‚Äôt get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.

And let me know if you found the answer|||Don‚Äôt look up bangladesh/australia. Nepal has average population density.|||Population in SE Asia seems to be quite high in general. I think regarding your question about where the population is concentrated, you will find that the population is scattered throughout the country - everywhere minus above 3000m up the himalayas. Then if you do a deep assessment what % of Perus Land actually has people vs % of Nepal where people reside, you may find the two land sizes may not be off by a magnitude like now when you compare the full size of the country. For eg UK has a landmass of 250k but has a population of 69 mil. That's 2x population of Peru in 1/5th of land. In the other hand australia has a population of 27mil in 7.7mil km2. Russia has 143mil people in 17mil km2 (4x Pop of Peru in 16x land area).  You are also looking at the mercader projection which further makes Nepal look more visually small in the map. Not that it should have any basis when you talk about numbers.   I suppose what I am trying to say is the population may still be high in Nepal but it may not be as high as you think when you factor in livable land in the country. Total land mass alone is not a great indicator.|||Fertile land, fertile people, most are on terai belt. Look at india and bangladesh, how densely populated they all are.

It calculated on a flat, two-dimensional plane, not by measuring the surface area of its mountains, hills, and valleys. The total land area of a country is determined by projecting its borders onto a standardized reference surface, typically an ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the Earth.      Nepal is roughly a \\~1000 km long, and 150 km wide and so the approximate area of 150 sq km.   Now if you count the mountains and valleys that covers like 70% of that 2D area, the actual habitable space is order of magnitide larger. maybe even 50x.   So the actual living space is quite a lot for mountainous country like Nepal. I would imagine same for Peru.|||You know about canada?|||You should have started with Bangladesh and it's population density.  Regardless, depends on how fertile and navigable the lands are.

Build cool projects and show them off on X or LinkedIn. Follow a bunch of US founders. Research YC and follow YC founders. The projects will need to show extraordinary level of depth in whatever field you want to pursue. A simple webapp, or a mobile app wont suffice. I would say, go deep into AI engineering, do multi-model, multi-agent projects and show them off in LinkedIn. Be raw and honest. Good AI talent is hard to find everywhere. I‚Äôm not talking about AI chatbots, have depth. 3. Look at dev opportunities in Europe. While I was in Norway, it was comparatively a whole lot easier to get a CS job than in the US.

The widget of nepali date is what sold me. The UI looks clean. I like that i can see the previous month and calendar years back but it would be cool if instead of the drop-down it was something else as the drop-down blocks the view of the current calendar and i feel it looks like the design aesthetic with the rest of the app design.   I hope you keep improving and adding new features !|||Tried it. Looks good.   One thing that i felt redundant was the popup layout when seeking other dates. Like when i want to see what is on 3rd Kartik, it opens up a popup therefore blocking the calendar entirely. I have to then close the popup  to seek through the next date. I feel that you could just update the info below the calendar for the selected date instead of the popup.   Makes it easier to seek through the dates.|||whats smarter in this calendar?|||Best!

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. üò≠üò≠2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye üò≠|||3 brsa vo dashign namanako|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

Because there was no one to guide me, i failed this year's neb board.   so from someone who learned from his own experience, my best advice is that you don't depend only on teachers from your school. there are tons of videos on youtube and tons of notes and  straight up answers in the internet.   if you do not understand and get anything at all, then only focus on the questions that are asked many times or repeated i.e only imp questions.   you have to make sure that you atleast passing marks, so look focus on the chapters you understand and master them first then only focus on others.   You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

When Are we going to hold this guy (Prachanda) so called \"revolutionary hero'\"responsible for all the senseless Killing of the poor 17,000 illiterate nepalese people in villages and brainwash them with Socialist/Communist ideas in the name of poverty. When Are we going to Stop this Communist/socialist ideas before it foster and becomes a cancer in Nepal.   WAKE UP NEPAL !!!   PS- this is not a call for violence on any human or party members, This is just a call for arrest of Prachanda who is responsible for all the previous killings and get rid of any Socialist ideas from constitution and bring back meritocracy  Edit Update- I've notice Most of the reddit nepalese community seems to be heavily censored to some level. Anything you write remotely close against Maoist terrorist party or nice about 'Monarky', or say anything about the mod. Your post will be immediately banned. Something tells me this is done deliberately to not bring back 'Monarky' and promote anti religion and pro communistic sentiment among young minds by suppressing the Voice of the other/ Please be Mindful !!!! --- Hope this Post wont get banned after this update.  2nd Update- I just got warned by Reddit that my account might get banned. Like I suspected, There seems to be group of Maoist sympathizing insurgents in most of the nepalese subreddit with Communistic Ideologies who will get your post banned or Comment deleted by group reporting if it doesnt align with their thoughts and who will like their own comments to make it look like they are saying meaningful when they are not.",

He pushed Nepal towards democracy and republicanism.   He gave poor villagers and lower-caste groups a voice in national politics.   He increased women‚Äôs participation in politics and society, with many ex-fighters now active in leadership roles.   In western hills and Madhesh, state institutions were weak or absent. Villagers depended on landlords for loans, justice, and protection, which kept exploitation unchallenged (Kamaiya, Haruwa-Charuwa, Haliya systems). His movement gave villagers confidence to defy landlords for the first time.   Fighters who believed they sacrificed for justice and equality still respect him as the leader who turned their struggle into a new political order.

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not ‚Äúrevolution,‚Äù it‚Äôs not ‚Äújustice,‚Äù and it sure as hell isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe voice of the people.‚Äù It‚Äôs mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn‚Äôt make you brave‚Äîit makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that‚Äîsurrounded by a wave of so-called ‚Äúyouths‚Äù who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let‚Äôs not sugarcoat it‚Äîthe so-called Gen Z ‚Äúwarriors‚Äù hiding in the mob weren‚Äôt heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country‚Äôs social fabric. He still can‚Äôt step foot in certain countries because he‚Äôs internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he‚Äôs propped up as a ‚Äúleader.‚Äù  Let‚Äôs be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn‚Äôt an accident‚Äîit was a setup. While Deuba‚Äôs family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don‚Äôt get it twisted‚Äîthose sharpshooters in the crowd weren‚Äôt just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres‚Äîformer insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let‚Äôs stop pretending this was ‚Äúthe people rising up.‚Äù It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist‚Äîthe one who drowned this nation in blood‚Äîwalks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don‚Äôt for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn‚Äôt that Deuba suffered humiliation‚Äîthe real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn‚Äôt a flower; he‚Äôs a weed choking the soil of Nepal‚Äôs democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too na√Øve to realize they‚Äôre being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||Prachanda and Baburam are India's puppet. Baburam was trained in India's JNU which wiped out more than 10% of our population while Madhessi bihari and Marwadi have exponentially grown.

At the end of the day, the bigger issue here isn‚Äôt her‚Äîit‚Äôs the massive misuse of taxpayers‚Äô money by politicians who were supposed to develop the country but used it for their own gain. Shrinkhala was never appointed to run the country; she‚Äôs a celebrity, not a public official. The problem is we put celebrities on a pedestal, expecting them to be flawless, when they‚Äôre just people who can make mistakes.  I‚Äôm also disappointed she hasn‚Äôt spoken up about the protests or the deaths of those kids, but the level of hate she‚Äôs facing right now is over the top. No one deserves that.

            "body": "The country is burning, and Shrinkhala uploaded a 34 minute PR reel. I just finished watching 11 minutes of the 34 long video Shrinkhala Khatiwada uploaded to ‚Äúexplain her silence‚Äù and I had to stop, not because I was bored, but because it was painful to watch someone so out of touch, so self-absorbed, and so deep into their own victim complex that they‚Äôve become completely blind to reality. I‚Äôm making this post and hoping people don‚Äôt fall for the carefully packaged sob story. First off is the immediate red flag that there is zero acknowledgment of her privilege. She talks about having a simple life, and claims her parents worked hard for her and her brother. That they had a house with 3 bedrooms, didn‚Äôt have to pay rent, had a good upbringing and she still thinks that counts as simple. And that‚Äôs the only privilege she‚Äôs ever had. That alone shows how detached she is from what ‚Äúaverage‚Äù really means in Nepal. She never even briefly reflects on the fact that her father is a powerful politician, and instead, she makes it sound like she built her life from scratch. It‚Äôs baffling.  She genuinely believes her name shouldn‚Äôt have been dragged into any of the national discourse and says that people were using her name just to get content and she literally says something along the lines of, if people got attention that way, ‚Äúso be it.‚Äù That‚Äôs her takeaway. The entire nation is in shambles, people are angry, protesting, waking up to decades of injustice and she still can't look beyond her own image. It's almost unbelievable how someone can watch a country crumble and somehow make it all about themselves. She positions herself as the one being targeted ‚Äúfor no reason‚Äù and says she wanted to fight back but was too overwhelmed by people turning against her. Again, not a word about why people might be justifiably critical, just a one-sided narrative of being attacked unfairly.  She says TikTok posts were changing the narrative of her entire life. But does she stop for a second to reflect on why people are questioning her? No. Instead, she keeps doubling down on this idea that she‚Äôs misunderstood, and that her critics are just trying to take her down for no reason. There is no realization that being the daughter of a well-known and allegedly corrupt politician is a reason why people hold you accountable especially when you‚Äôve benefitted from that influence. That‚Äôs not defamation. That‚Äôs public scrutiny. Then comes the part where she calls herself ‚Äúself-made.‚Äù And at that point, I had to pause and ask how? You‚Äôre born into a powerful and connected family. You have access to platforms, resources, and networks that most Nepalis can‚Äôt even dream of. And yet here you are, trying to claim some underdog story? She goes on to brag about her accomplishments, how she‚Äôs made so much money, and how people apparently can‚Äôt handle the fact that someone as young as her is so successful. As if that‚Äôs why people are questioning her. No, Shrinkhala, people aren‚Äôt criticizing you because you‚Äôre young and successful. They‚Äôre angry because you‚Äôre trying to rewrite your origin story while skipping over the very privileges that made your success possible.  She even says she never felt the need to justify herself to anyone before because ‚Äúsatya ko saath cha.‚Äù That‚Äôs when I realized how deep her delusion runs. She genuinely believes she‚Äôs standing on moral high ground, and yet her video is filled with nothing but self-praise, image management, and emotional manipulation. She talks about being ‚Äúsatya‚Äù while ignoring every contradiction, every unfulfilled promise, and every instance where she stayed silent when it mattered. Then she says if she doesn‚Äôt defend herself, then ‚Äúthe rest of the world will write her narrative.‚Äù Again, it‚Äôs about her. Not the truth, not justice, not accountability, not the people, but her narrative. The country is collapsing under the weight of corruption, and her priority is that her public image might be misunderstood. She even says her future generations will suffer if she doesn‚Äôt clear her image like that‚Äôs the greatest injustice here. Not the looted resources, not the betrayed citizens, but her family name. She thanks those who ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt unfollow her‚Äù and those who supported her privately. That‚Äôs her criteria for support which is social media metrics. Then she starts talking about her life story, narrates her autobiography, and once again, takes the opportunity to list her accomplishments and how she was a topper, won design competitions, etc. But does she ever stop to think about why she got those platforms? Does she reflect on how being a politician‚Äôs daughter might have given her access others don‚Äôt have? Of course not. Instead, she paints herself as someone with a ‚Äúsmall-town mindset‚Äù while talking about winning designer competitions. How many small-town Nepalis get to do that? There‚Äôs such a massive contradiction in her story, and she doesn‚Äôt even seem to see it.  She even says ‚Äúma maa nai kei kami thiyo hola‚Äù and tries to sound reflective, but it‚Äôs just another way to victimize herself. As if people criticizing her now are just reinforcing her lifelong feeling of being ‚Äúnot enough.‚Äù Then she addresses people who accuse her of not following through on the promises and ideals she expressed during Miss Nepal. And honestly, that criticism is completely valid. If you stood on a national stage making tall claims about development and change, then yes, people will hold you accountable. That‚Äôs not trolling. That‚Äôs responsibility. And finally, the most absurd part that she says she never had any power. How? You were Miss Nepal and are one of the most followed influencers in the country, daughter of a powerful political figure, a Harvard graduate. And you don‚Äôt have power? Then who does? If you truly believe you never had any power to make a difference, then what was the point of all the public positioning, speeches, and social impact projects? That‚Äôs not humility. That‚Äôs denial.  She tries to play down her travel experiences too. Says that before Miss Nepal, she had only been to India, and that‚Äôs ‚Äúnot an achievement,‚Äù and that her Hong Kong trip immediately after the pageant was the only international travel till then. Then she brings up her UK trip, saying it was funded by youth, and she didn‚Äôt really get to enjoy it because she was only there for work, so apparently, that doesn‚Äôt count as privilege either. Every step of the way, she undermines and downplays her privilege, refuses to acknowledge her advantages, and continues to position herself as a victim. And all of this? Is just the first 11 minutes. I honestly couldn‚Äôt keep watching. It became clear very quickly that this wasn‚Äôt a sincere explanation. It was a 34 minute long PR video just to clear her image, filled with narcissistic reflections, gaslighting, and image control disguised as vulnerability. I really hope people don‚Äôt fall for victimized narrative. Please don‚Äôt.",

The lack of self-reflection and the constant logical fallacies, positioning anyone who challenges her as lacking critical thinking, etc, is not lost on us.

Like cleaning garbage on the street or starting a free tuition for street children. We should make heroes of those ordinary people. We should also start questioning our perception of beauty. Why is Shrinkhala Khadka considered *anything*? Is she physically appealing or sexually affable or glamorous? Why should she have *any* followers, to begin with? Then we should start questioning the perception of our 'beauty standard'. Why should only fair skinned, better looking people get millions of followers. It's not going to be easy but we should always question. If we play the same pop culture game and dig deep into how propaganda and algo can be manipulated then we can perhaps start asking questions like the way you have did.   It's not easy because it's a biased platform where heritage money and incumbent power are in bed with the forces of propaganda (e.g. Insta algorithm). Its a hard battle to win.

There are way worse people than her in Nepal. In my view, arson who damaged the private and public properties are way worse than her and legally criminals. Similarly, there are better faces of nepo babies - the OG nepo baby, the ex-king.  I am saddened that there is no empathy. Literally, her house was burned down by an angry mob. Have some empathy.  Nepal has systematic corruption at every level. Everyone has either given or taken bribes.  There are minimal financial opportunities within Nepal. It makes financially more sense for an honest person to seek employment abroad. By destroying businesses and targeting the elites, the country will witness even less investment. It needs money to create investments for more jobs. Ironic thing was people who protested showed their own corruption by looting private companies - which again legally is a crime.   If I can have empathy for arsons and thieves who destroyed and looted public and private properties, have some empathy for another Nepali who was threatened and attacked viciously online just for being more successful than most people.|||If you guys really think she got what she deserved - having her old parents house.

The majority of the people didn‚Äôt even know who her father is . It‚Äôs easy to blame her , easy to hate her now , but that‚Äôs the sad part of brainwashed social media freaks who are on their phones 24-7 .

Then she got married to the son of Kantipur. She goes on expensive foreign trips with him. She is the daughter-in-law of the most influential media company.  What is really our problem with her? What do we want from her? Are we jealous she became rich and famous? Are we mad at her because both her parents are CPN UML politicians? Are we mad at her for marrying with a rich guy? Are we mad at her because she carried around an expensive label bag? Are we mad at her because she did not single handedly end corruption like she said she wanted to 10 years back in a fucking beauty pageant? What do you want Shrinkhala to tell the world? Yes she is privileged? Yes she married into a well-off family? Yes she went to Harvard?   What is it really? We need to be really clear about these conversations first before dragging someone down.|||Enough has been said about this girl. Let's close this chapter, ignore and move on.|||Not a single shred of self-realization and the level of denial of privilege is just whole another level.

She used to go around Harvard telling everyone that she received a prestigious Nepal government scholarship to fund her education. She lied about receiving the scholarship s she can appear smart amongst other students who got there on their own merit. She kept quiet for a long time when Nepali people asked her about her educational expenses. Now, all of a sudden, she is claiming she funded it with her own influencer money.¬†",

We could blame Hamas or the IDF for his death, but the real responsibility lies with our own Nepalese politicians.  They called the ‚Äúearn and learn‚Äù program an internship, likely just to bypass foreign employment laws. In reality, it was pure exploitation. From what I‚Äôve read, students were made to work five days a week in questionable conditions and study only one. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.  I just hope this changes with the new government.|||I'm Israeli, sadly his DNA was diagnosed and was believed to die in the first months of the war R.I.P Bipin|||Vayo vayo pugyo,  He is dead, confirmed by Israel and hamas both.

I was so impressed by such a positive take by this man.  But today, like many others I got to see the video of his graduation speech on Nebraska University. I searched some more on YouTube and this man has been actively saying nothing but 'my home village' and 'my country Nepal'.  His love for this nation is second to none. Even after how he has been treated by everyone including myself. Even I never bother to search online about him.  Everyone in Nepal like me need to apologize to Dr.Mahabir Pun.  His quote,\"There comes a difficult time, unusual situation that people usually don't need to go through. In that situation it is necessary to have uncommon faith and uncommon approaches to face the uncommon odds of human life.\" from the same video of graduation speech. It will never leave my brain. This man said those words on 2007 and lived by it. His uncommon faith and uncommon approaches has definitely made huge impact on me today. And hoping Nepal will follow his will of uncommon faith and uncommon approaches to face the uncommon odds of human life.  This is not a time to be wasting on excel sheets, Facebook status, conspiracy theories and on egocentric people. We won't get any better person than him to lead the change on his sector.

            "body": "My house was vandalized in the name of \"Gen z protest.\" My dad is a civil servant, and we live in a humble 3 story house (the third story was only recently built). It was a small house when we moved in, which was 17 years ago‚Äî few months after I was born.   After working for over 25+ years for the government, this country, and its public, my dad still has a very clear history. No bribery, no corruption, no money laundering‚Äî nothing. Rising high in status and the post, he is recognized for his diligent work and highly stable work ethic.  Now, back to the present. The protestors had reached our house. I had once thought, why would anyone target our house? It's a civil servant, not some minister or anything of that sort. My father rose high due to his hard work and competitiveness, not any connection or bribery. We can all see from how my parents lived rental first (he was already a civil servant then). Only after a few months of me being born did they buy a house, not without taking loans.  I don't know why it happened because our house was aba and definitely not supposed to be a part of whatever that was. The protestors were going to burn our house, but because of it being attached to other houses, the neighbours finally calmed them down into not burning our house. Instead, they burned our bikes, went into our house, and threw things out to burn them. What's worse? When the protestors left, all the people living nearby, went in and out for 2 days straight‚Äî morning, day and night, pickng whatever things they liked amd taking it home with them as if our house was some kind of thrift store giving away our stuff for free.  We were at our relative's house, and when we saw all the black smoke coming from the direction of our house, we were devastated. \"Our house got burnt.\" That's what we thought. As i was the oldest child in the family, i couldn't let myself break down. I can still hear those devastating gut-wrenching cries and sobs from my mom, haunting me like a ghost every time i close my eyes.   I am a college student. My uniform is gone, and so are my books and copies. My sister is in middle school. Her uniform and books and copies are nowhere to be found as well.   Our money and jewelries, of course, are gone too. The same money my father earned and mind you, a civil servant's earnings isn't much. Only enough to label us as a middle-class family. The same money my sister sent us, her hard-working money(which was in dollars at that).  Our clothes, bags, and even utensils are gone, and so are our food storage(stuff). My mom is someone who saves money. However, she can just like my dad because she knows she has experienced the hardships with my dad. Because they know. Because they have experienced hardships and complications in their life. Because they have faced obstacles.  We have never wore any designers, no luxury fashion brand. All are affordable and comfortable. The only designer my mom and dad ever even had is when my big sister from abroad visited us and surprised us with some designer bags (which she also got scolded for spending so much because she is still studying and working in between only).  Our guests'clothes, laptops, phones, everything is gone. Me and my sisters' savings and my mom's little spending for managing our household‚Äî nothing is left. Not even our puja ko thaan(a small place we had to worship and pray gods).   We have tons of debts. I am old enough to learn that by now. Now that our house was totally and utterly robbed and vandalized while my dad kept on working for the same public, we have nowhere to sleep on. No clothes to wear. There is no place to shower or bathe.  We had to hide away from our own house we once called home to keep ourselves alive. My father was lucky enough to be safe because if it was even a few seconds late, it would have all been over. We were fortunate to be alive, even though we had done nothing wrong to people.  Morality? Humanity? Conscience? Guilt? Remorse? None. The same people, the same public, that my dad is working so hard to serve with his whole heart, has done this to him, to his family.  Gen z, huh? Protest against corruption, huh? My dad, having the cleanest history‚Äî no corruption, bribery, connection, whatsoever. So why our house? Why? What had we ever done to them? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.   I have no hope left. None for this country, none for the people of this country. This is now a country full of robbers and thieves. Humans are jealous. Humans are greedy. People are full of themselves, full of greediness and selfishness. In my heart, humans are creatures who have ruined any hope for more in me and my family. My father, who once poured his heart for this country and the people in this country, is on the verge of giving up on it.  You people, opportunists, and robbers who call yourselves voice of justice‚Äî I'll be watching, watching who you are going to tame to pull this country back together. People like my dad who are so wronged will be out of all this mess soon, Who are you going to pull to patch this broken country? I'll be watching. I'll be happily watching everything crumble and fall apart with your \"justice.\" You have given the opportunists a sense of win. You've let them think anything is possible, and now, everything will fall apart while you watch everything crumble in front of your eyes.  Lastly, I'd like to be a little vulgar and uncensored. If you are uncomfortable, scroll away.  Whoever has participated in vandalizing my house and robbing it empty‚Äî You are going to see hell and worse. I hope you feel yourself rotting away. I hope you don't think it's over now because whatever you stole, it will haunt you for the rest of your life and afterwards. I will forever haunt you, even in your dreams, converting it into a disastrous nightmare. You'll see hell. You are going to suffer.  [Edit: I never expected this post to gain so many views. I‚Äôm very grateful to those who are wishing me and my family well, thank you very much for that. And I also understand those who might raise an eyebrow on this post and not believe in my words. It‚Äôs up to you, whether you want to believe me or not. I have no intention of forcing it on you.   I‚Äôd also like to request anyone who knows me through this post to maintain my privacy and not reveal anything about me or my family on the internet(please refrain any stalker behavior). I have never gone public like this and I also don‚Äôt like the attention this is getting(makes me uncomfortable) but I‚Äôm going to keep this post so other people who have experienced something like this can be open about it here. Let this be a safe space for those to speak up.]",

While this was an absolutely needed protest and it did bring much-needed attention and change, we also can‚Äôt deny the darker side of it.

Gen Z cannot ignore the fact that others died in fires, or that people were looted and harmed during the unrest.

Much love to you all Aussies too.|||Appreciate it mate|||Thanks for your kind appreciation. Let me tell you our Nepalese perspective.  As a Nepalese, it's really tough for us to enter Australia, first you must pass at least high school with good marks, then get a really good English test score, then you must show a significant bank balance, so your immigration policy is already filtering only the best people from other countries.   I am a Engineer myself, it's relatively easy for someone like me to immegrate to Australia, but for students of other field, you're immigration policy already make sure only the best students come in your country, and it should be that way to be honest.   Regarding your immigration issue, well I believe any country should only allow immigration if there is net positive for the country, you don't want a bunch of liabilities to come in your country, right??  So, just look at the data, you can very easily find out what communities are contributing to Australia, and what communities are hampering the country, and simply adjust the policies that way, it's really that simple.   Regarding recent protests against Immigration, well I think that's just the coverup done by the rich and elites to brainwash common Aussies so that the blame is shifted towards immigration when in fact Australia has the best immigration compared to many Western countries.   My cousin recently returned back to Nepal, they lived in Melbourne for almost 10 years, they shared the economy isn't doing great compared to past years, and the blame is being shifted solely towards immigration.|||U will be welcomed here in Nepal.

There is nothing anyone could do because of the constitution for the old leaders to try again.   But this time, if we play our cards right, next election ma voter Id card banayera we need to vote for the party/person who we think can bring a change.  Change doesn‚Äôt happen overnight, we need to be patient.  Either start doing politics by yourself, or support someone who does. That‚Äôs the only thing our constitution allows.|||Lol, things never chang overnight. Expecting these corrupt people to just give up their power and privilege is not that easy. They will come back and try to do everything possible to regain their power.   Instead of being discouraged by their appearance we can get ourselves involved in more and more constructive dialogue and create a scenario where they will not be back again from the next election. Engage in political debate. Spread words. More intellectual discuss will help create a \"vibe\" when they will find hard to regain power. We can never demand so and so person or party should not participate in election or use their constitutional rights. So them trying to resurface and whitewash their image is normal. Unless we convict then for crime in court they are free to start doing that.  Let's keep being vigilant. Let's continue this discourse and may be, just may be, we can tip the society as a whole towards a future without the \"musical chair\".   What the jenji protest has done is create eye opening moment for a lot of the old generation people and has made the younger generation a major stakeholder in the country's governance and politics. Nothing else, this is major achievement in itself. Adem√°s, the parties also feel some sort of pressure to restructure and change. But if we keep on using this momentum to keep on being watchful and create more awakening over time I think the courage and sacrifice will not be for nothing.|||Have patience guys. impatience always brings anger and anxiety.

Yet, even after all this time, I still carry deep respect and pride for the land I came from. But watching this horrific video of a mob savagely beating an elderly man and his wife left me utterly speechless. Regardless of what the couple may have been involved in or accused of, nothing justifies such cruelty.  I thought Nepali men were the descendants of the brave Gurkhas‚Äîwarriors respected and admired worldwide for their courage and honor. Instead, I saw a man sucker punch a woman who wasn‚Äôt even facing him. That wasn‚Äôt bravery‚Äîit was pure cowardice. And the chaos that followed‚Äîhundreds of people raiding and looting their home under the excuse of ‚Äújustice‚Äù‚Äîwasn‚Äôt justice at all. That mob was just as corrupt and criminally responsible as the very people they claimed to oppose. They were not upholding the law; they were exploiting the breakdown of law and order to terrorize and humiliate helpless individuals.  But this rot doesn‚Äôt stop with the mob. The government, too, is guilty. Innocent children were killed during the protests, yet there has been no true accountability. Those in power‚Äîthe Prime Minister, the Home Minister, and the security forces‚Äîbear responsibility for those heinous crimes. They were entrusted with protecting the people, but instead, they used their authority to spill the blood of innocents.  So when I look at this situation, I see two sides of the same coin: mobs acting as judge, jury, and executioner in the streets, and leaders hiding behind power while allowing or even enabling violence against their own citizens. Both are forms of terrorism, both have destroyed public trust, and both have crippled the very soul of Nepal.  And if this mob truly represents the next generation‚Äîif this is the standard of ‚Äújustice‚Äù that today‚Äôs youth believe in‚Äîthen Nepal‚Äôs future is not just uncertain, it is in grave danger. Because a society that celebrates cowardice, looting, and lawlessness, while a government escapes accountability for killing its own children, is a society heading toward doom.|||Maile paila post garya ho, yo bare  https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/s/okOHZ5elMo|||https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/s/okOHZ5elMo|||It's not going to change in one day.

So its simple man a big country in size doesn't mean big population because the more than half the country might only be freaking forest and stuff. And I think in Mongolia all the people live in like 1% of the land.|||Wait till you hear about Bangladesh|||Well Australia is 6 times bigger than Peru, yet has a smaller population than peru.|||India has 1.5 billion Bangladesh 170million. So Nepal population is low for the region but Almost 40%water in the ganges basin also comes from Nepal. This basin supports 600million people. Which is more than the population of south America.

History shows that the European contact vanished your almost 80% of the population due to the disease like Smallpox and measles and your population could not ever recover again unlike here in Nepal where we did not had any epidemic of such level which would wipe out almost 4/5th of the country's population. Our factor is liveable land if you see in N. America, the two countries Canada and USA are one of the biggest countries in the world, But USA has almost more than 10x population of Canada as most of the land is Canada is Tundra and life cannot flourish there.|||well maybe cuz people of Peru aren't spread out across the entire country??|||Favorable climate, fertile plains, and river systems enable multiple harvests a year.

This affectes every country in south Asia including Nepal. That's a problem we should solve. IT's gradually under control I guess.|||Google Bangladesh. And let me know if you found the answer|||Don‚Äôt look up bangladesh/australia. Nepal has average population density.|||Population in SE Asia seems to be quite high in general. I think regarding your question about where the population is concentrated, you will find that the population is scattered throughout the country - everywhere minus above 3000m up the himalayas. Then if you do a deep assessment what % of Perus Land actually has people vs % of Nepal where people reside, you may find the two land sizes may not be off by a magnitude like now when you compare the full size of the country. For eg UK has a landmass of 250k but has a population of 69 mil. That's 2x population of Peru in 1/5th of land. In the other hand australia has a population of 27mil in 7.7mil km2. Russia has 143mil people in 17mil km2 (4x Pop of Peru in 16x land area).  You are also looking at the mercader projection which further makes Nepal look more visually small in the map. Not that it should have any basis when you talk about numbers.   I suppose what I am trying to say is the population may still be high in Nepal but it may not be as high as you think when you factor in livable land in the country. Total land mass alone is not a great indicator.|||Fertile land, fertile people, most are on terai belt. Look at india and bangladesh, how densely populated they all are. Nepal's population comes from the region similar to them. I have no clue why peru has low population, maybe there isn't most habitable land. Like how russia is so massive but its population is low¬†|||If you know Peru, it's almost all mountainous terrain like a huge chunk of it is the Andes, and another chunk of it is the Amazon, with the rest being deserts where most people live.  Absolute extremes. The terrain absolutely messes things up.  Nepal ain't no heaven land but I would say the climate is very hospitable.|||Tokyo has 14 million people in 2,194 km ¬≤|||Such a great question. Most of the people are concentrated in the cities and in the low lands where theres lots of rivers and fertile land till 1990s people procreate and like crazy plus modern medicine less infant mortality and less knowledge of contraceptives. Also temperate climate.|||Time zones bro.|||Look at bangaldesh's area and population. You'll be shocked my guy|||The reported surface area of a country is always the 2D surface area. It calculated on a flat, two-dimensional plane, not by measuring the surface area of its mountains, hills, and valleys. The total land area of a country is determined by projecting its borders onto a standardized reference surface, typically an ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the Earth.      Nepal is roughly a \\~1000 km long, and 150 km wide and so the approximate area of 150 sq km.   Now if you count the mountains and valleys that covers like 70% of that 2D area, the actual habitable space is order of magnitide larger. maybe even 50x.   So the actual living space is quite a lot for mountainous country like Nepal. I would imagine same for Peru.|||You know about canada?|||You should have started with Bangladesh and it's population density.  Regardless, depends on how fertile and navigable the lands are.

Similarly, reports and videos from Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda's' house indicated the presence of significant unexplained cash.

Okay, I get that the police had given up. However, the police are now back in power.  Why has no one even talked about arresting them?  Forget the corruption charges; just finding the money alone in their homes should have been enough to jail them.  Why has it not happened?  And why are we being misled?

Many payment platforms like Stripe, Polar, etc. do not support Nepal due to geo-political restriction. It is very difficult to receive payment internationally if you want to sell your products/services outside of Nepal. I'm a Software Engineer and I have to perform multiple hacks to just receive payments from my international consumer and I also need to constantly fear that the hack might be caught and my account be sanctioned.   I think this is the great opportunity for us GenZ to discuss about possibility of hassle-free international payments for solo or team businesses.

            "body": "We all know most ISP here lock the router and dont give any access to the web management. As a devops practitioner and someone who is very invested in homelabbing and selfhosting, locked router was my biggest achilles heels.   Requirement: A secondary router, you main router will stop working and secondary router will only work through LAN1 port.   Solution: All you have to do is create a ticket on vianet app stating \"Turn the router into bridge/modem only mode\". Someone will call you back, just ask them username and password for PPPOE and use your secondary router to configure through PPPOE instead of DHCP. Tada!!! you now have full control over your router.   Bonus 1: You can flash openwrt with Luci web interface and you will be able to configure anything you can think of. extra advantage is you can configure mesh routing without needing a special router. I have managed to easily flash it on my Mi router and a old tp link router, search for guides depending on your model or ask Claude or Gpt to search specifically for your router model.   Bonus 2: Vianet gives you globally accessible IPV6. That means you are free from CGNAT. Use this to access your home services without needing any relay like Cloudflare Tunnel or Tailscale VPN. Direct connection means no extra latency and maxed bandwidth and you can use this to host online game servers to play with your friends!! But for some reason Worldlink doesnt connect sometimes. Ncell and ClassicTech seems to have no problem tho. I am not sure if NTC offers IPV6.  Bonus 3: Host a adguard DNS server and configure your openwrt to use it as your default DNS server. This way you will have adblocking for your whole network. Your parents and old grannies wont have to see ads no more (wont work with Youtube app - use revance) and it keeps them safe from online phishing and malwares. You can also set some static ip and adguard to block some websites like gambling and pornography if there are minors in your household.   Disadvantage: The only downside of this is your main router will turn pretty much useless. Internet wont work through wireless and extra ports. So dont forget the vianet tech support to turn off the DHCP and wireless on the main router. Since my secondary router also has 2 ports only I had to invest some money on extra gigabyte switch.   I know some of you will appreciate this so this is my appreciation and giving back to this community. enjoy and have fun!! Happy Dashain!!!

Did it impact your internet speed in any way?   Also, directly exposing your local network and devices through IPv6 is not really a good idea.

So I have a camera that allows remote viewing.

So there was this post by a user named TastyMarketing47 in Tech Buy/Sell offering GPT Plus at Rs.699/month or Rs. 1000/3 months(claiming ‚Äúpay after getting the product in your own email‚Äù).  He had written a long convincing description saying things like:  > ‚ÄúScam ho vannu vanda agadi read: I buy from Vietnam promotional offer and sell it here with Rs.200 profit per account. The price is cheaper than Toolsmandu (999) because of the Vietnam offer. Search it up.‚Äù   Sounded somewhat believable, so I messaged him. He acted very genuine ‚Äî said ‚Äúno need to pay before getting access,‚Äù and even added me to some kind of Oxaam workspace.  It actually worked for about 30 minutes, then I got logged out. Tried refreshing, logging in again, clearing cookies ‚Äî nothing worked. I messaged him, and he replied once saying he‚Äôs ‚Äúsorting it out for all clients ,‚Äù but after that ‚Äî no reply, I checked post too deleted, and he disappeared.  I‚Äôve attached screenshots below ‚Äî just sharing this as a lesson for everyone. If the price looks too good to be true, it probably is.  Stay safe guys üôè",

This isn't just about a bad interview, it feels like a deliberate strategy to exploit job seekers for free labor.  I went through **multiple** rounds of interviews over several weeks. Everything seemed promising. The conversations were positive, and they talked about a great fit for their team. Then came the \"final\" task: to design a comprehensive digital marketing campaign.  I spent days on this. I researched their brands, analysed their competitors, and built out a full strategy, complete with campaign ideas, target audiences, content plans, and performance metrics. I treated it like a real, paid project because I genuinely wanted the job and to show my capabilities.  I submitted the work, feeling confident. Then... nothing. Total radio silence. I followed up, but no response. The most infuriating part? The reason given was a flimsy, nonsensical excuse that had nothing to do with the work I submitted.  This isn't an isolated incident. I've heard from others who have gone through the exact same process with them. They get you to design a full campaign, which they can then use or adapt, and then they ghost you or reject you on some silly pretext. It's a blatant exploitation of job seekers' time and skills.  If you're a digital marketer in Nepal and you're considering applying to IMS Group, be warned. This is not a legitimate hiring process. It's a fishing expedition for free campaign ideas. Save your time and your work for a company that respects candidates and values their professional effort.  They were still hiring 2 days ago and I gave the interview 3 months ago.",

I request to not include other garbage like calculator, radio, payment, washroom, and what not. If you want to make a radio app keep it seperate.|||Thanks buddy exactly what I was looking for. I absolutely hate the Google calendar app on my phone. If you need some contributions for the app I can donate via PayPal or direct bank transfer if you are in Nepal. Also one small suggestion if you can make it support up to 120hz. It fluctuates between 30 to 90 quite often. Thanks.|||https://preview.redd.it/jd3fs0m3y7uf1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a465c5024319f30c913c0234458d6c758792eb97  5 October? Wth|||works offline once loaded. that was a great feature.|||atleast has no ads and does not refresh when changing month  unlike hamropatro  W|||Amazing ! Just replaced it with hamro patro. The widget of nepali date is what sold me. The UI looks clean. I like that i can see the previous month and calendar years back but it would be cool if instead of the drop-down it was something else as the drop-down blocks the view of the current calendar and i feel it looks like the design aesthetic with the rest of the app design.   I hope you keep improving and adding new features !|||Tried it. Looks good.   One thing that i felt redundant was the popup layout when seeking other dates. Like when i want to see what is on 3rd Kartik, it opens up a popup therefore blocking the calendar entirely. I have to then close the popup  to seek through the next date. I feel that you could just update the info below the calendar for the selected date instead of the popup.   Makes it easier to seek through the dates.|||whats smarter in this calendar?|||Best! Appreciated!|||How is it different from nepali patro. It also have date conversion horoscope etc.|||If you have home screen widgets, I'll install.|||Hey there! This is great.

Loads way faster than HamroPatro. Going good till now. All the best.|||Wow! I‚Äôm super impressed. Great work, man!  Also, I saw a comment saying it‚Äôs not smooth and stuck between 30-90fps. Well! It‚Äôs really smooth on my iOS. It feels like above 90, probably 120. Also, when adding reminders, can you make it show nepali date as well? I often have to hop between two apps to confirm the Nepali date while adding reminders.  And, can you make the widget also switch between light/dark mode based on my device theme?|||Well the best part of the app is it's minimilastic. Thanks.. üòä|||Loved the widgets more. Less bloat.

But without any credible information just blatantly labelling it exploitative and child abuse will do more harm than good.|||True, the Kumari tradition is precious but it needs to be modified so culture thrives without harming the child.|||  Wait till the local Newar finds out that someone has spoken a fact here. üòÇ|||Hi all I am a Newar, and i don‚Äôt oppose the tradition.  The child will have access to education and almost everything another child can ask for. We have belief that the child carries spirit of Taleju Bhawani, which gives the child immense power. Again, in an age where we have lost our belief, I cannot prove it.  The kumaris I have visited emit strong aura (i may have been brainwashed to feel this). But she does have to be disciplined (i dont mean someone disciplines her). The child is treated with utmost respect by the best people in a homely environment.   Aba before age of 15 16, Manang Mustang ghumna khasai koi jaadaina hola (only speaking for myself) After she is no longer a Kumari, she can go whereever she wants to.

Jay Desh|||We should support female pope in Vatican gender equality let's goooo!!!|||What about the rights of Nuns... We should talk about this also|||Kumaris: A common doll for everyone.   A 3 year old child has no idea what she is getting into. She cannot grasp what a normal childhood is, what is right and what is wrong. The only thing she knows and does is based on her likes and dislikes, which is heavily depended upon how her parents/surrounding elders dictates.   Ani about 'No complains' from past Kumaris:   Newari culture is super sensitive. You cannot say anything against their culture. Otherwise, you'll have to face \"Tom n Jerry\" like people. I think, every ex Kumaris understands this at some point. With this much pressure along with the grooming done from a very young age, I don't think anyone dares to speak up. Which basically means none of us know what they really feel inside.    Well, of course, keeping in mind how they're thrown away once they reach a certain age or goes through ü©∏. At least, a life time opportunity to be a Kumari where they could renounce their position if they don't feel like it should be a way.   They don't preach, they don't teach, they only show up during jatras. I've never seen Kumaris actively participating in rituals or any sort of activities. Yestai ho vane, why not create a statue of a Kumari for the rest of our lives and stay quiet???|||Also it adds to the stereotype that period blood is impure|||Yeah the 1sttime ever I saw Kumari it was not aww like I hoped but pity to the \"Living Goddess\" she had the look of not a girl her age but of an \"ice princess\" in anime.

The only thing you should feel bad about is her parents who now have to be her full time care takers probably having to leave their jobs and careers and move into the kumari house with her.|||I used to extremely religious before and used to glorify ts But realising Kumari tradition is cruel was my first step towards atheism|||As a Newar, I understand the cultural side of it. But living in the US and having global exposure, I also see it as more of a pageant. If you‚Äôve seen Little Miss Sunshine, you‚Äôll get the context.||| The Living Goddess tradition of Nepal is a complex institution rooted in centuries of culture. While modern concerns about child rights are valid, the practice is governed by strict rituals and has evolved to address contemporary welfare standards. Here are the key facts:  1. The Selection is Meticulous and Considered an Honor:  ¬∑ A Kumari is chosen from the specific Shakya clan of the Newari community, a Buddhist goldsmith caste. ¬∑ The selection process is incredibly rigorous. Candidates must meet 32 strict physical perfection requirements (e.g., eye shape, voice quality, hair color) and demonstrate a fearless and serene demeanor (e.g., by not crying during a ceremony in a room of 108 ritually sacrificed animal heads). ¬∑ For the family and community, her selection is not a punishment but the highest spiritual honor.  2. The Role is Central to National Culture and Unity:  ¬∑ The Kumari is not just a religious figure but a national symbol. ¬∑ Her most important public duty is during the Indra Jatra festival, where she blesses the President of Nepal, providing divine legitimacy to the state in a ceremony that blends Hindu and Buddhist traditions. This is a key event for national identity.  3. Significant Reforms and Safeguards Have Been Implemented:  ¬∑ Education: By law, the Kumari now receives a formal education from private tutors within her residence. The government provides a monthly stipend specifically for this purpose. ¬∑ Family Presence: Contrary to isolation claims, her family (typically her mother) lives with her throughout her tenure. ¬∑ Financial Security: Upon retiring at puberty, the state grants her a lifetime pension. As of recent years, this is approximately NPR 10,000 per month (roughly $75 USD), along with a lump sum of NPR 1 million (roughly $7,500 USD) to support her transition. ¬∑ Successful Reintegration: Former Kumaris like Dr. Chanira Bajracharya, who served until 14, have publicly spoken about their positive experiences, pursued higher education, and built successful careers, demonstrating that life after the role is viable.  The Kumari tradition is a deeply embedded socio-religious institution. It is factually inaccurate to frame it simply as the \"isolation\" of a child. It is a state-sanctioned, culturally sacred role with defined rituals, significant community support, and legally mandated provisions for the girl's education, family life, and long-term financial security. The debate around it highlights the global tension between cultural preservation and evolving child rights, but the practice itself has demonstrably adapted to modern norms.|||I ain't newar but also I think aaba yesto kura chai parents haru le vhaneko ramro hami third party le vhannu vhanda pani . look if kumari ko parents le chahanu hudaina vhani tyo kumari ko candidate mai na leraunu parni ho . so parents lai kehi problem xaina , kumari le as a normal human being ni basna paunu hunxa after completion so I think we are no one to question sodhna lai|||What about the tradition of marrying off daughters into the inlaws house?|||After giving this some thought question is of a philosophical one. What freedom does a child have?  What life does a child choose? Isn‚Äôt everyone forced and fed their parent‚Äôs beliefs?   Also, can you give some evidence of abuse? If not your post would be baseless and in attempt of defamation of our culture.  One Kumari‚Äôs time ended when she was just 12. How much do you remember of your life before you were 12? I asked myself the same question and the answer is not much.   I disagree with your claim that the Kumari‚Äôs are discarded. They are always welcome. What it shows is the core principle of Buddhism that nothing is permanent. All things, even being revered as the living goddess, comes to an end. It teaches humility, an art that is now lost in this modern time.

Khaire ko documentary haru herera brainrot kura nagara na. Not everyone is privileged to become kumari and nor they are selected randomly. The family members themself have to fill the form and there's a long running selection process. Only a certain clan of newar can become Kumari. There are lots of inhuman and child abusive traditions going on all over. In case of kumari they get highest level of love and respect. They can live with their parents, they can play, they can watch TV, they can even play video games. It would be better if you watch podcasts of ex kumaris it's really helpful. I used to think same like everyone calling this inhuman before but they are living the normal life as you and me. And the fact that you can't speak up being kumari is totally false, yes you can't but only in jatras and other religious ceremonies, do you speak up during sharad and other pujas(it's prohibited to talk during sharad if you don't know). Go visit sudurpaschim hundreds of girls are being raped during their chhaupadi bas. Go visit terai Muslim villages girls at the age of 15 are getting married and at the age of 21 they are booned with 3 childs. Ex Kumaris themself enjoy being kumari and love to live their that phase again. If they are fine, their parents are fine no need to talk about that. Now the rules and prohibitions are amended.

How many injustices do females have to suffer in the name of culture, tradition and religion- it never crosses anybody's mind.|||Ask ex-Kumaris if it felt or was cruel. Others life always looks cruel and difficult from outside point of view. If their parents don‚Äôt object the tradition, who are you as an outsider to object it? Are you saying you love someone else‚Äôs kid than their own parents?|||Do the parents not have any say in this?|||This is sick|||I feel like more people should be aware (not trying to disrespect the culture)|||OP, you‚Äôve raised a really important point. To those insisting Kumaris are always ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù or dismissing criticism by belittling others, few things we can reflect on:   1. How much do we actually know about child psychology and development, especially at such a young age when experiences shape a lifetime? 2. Yes, a Kumari is worshipped as a goddess now but when her time ends, how does a goddess step back into an ordinary life? How do peers treat her? How does she even make friends? 3. With isolation and the constant expectation to suppress emotions, what happens to her social, communication, and interpersonal skills? Who helps her navigate that later? 4. Does she ever get space to express her own feelings and thoughts or is silence part of the job description? 5. We‚Äôve all seen videos of new Kumari, some barely three years old, literally asleep in full dress during rituals. How on earth can a toddler be burdened with divine expectations when they can barely stay awake through it? 6. As Nepalis, many of us defend dal bhat tarkari because it‚Äôs what we grew up with it feels untouchable. (I know it‚Äôs not the same but for reference) For a Kumari, this role is all she has ever known. So how would she even recognise or articulate what she‚Äôs missed out on, when she never had the chance to experience it? 7. And let‚Äôs be honest do we really believe someone put on a pedestal that high, surrounded by cultural pressure, guilt, and shame, would openly talk about the negatives of being Kumari? Yes, things have changed there‚Äôs more education, some family contact,but none of that cancels out the developmental and human rights concerns we‚Äôre talking about.  And honestly, the comments here kind of prove the point: we were never really taught to think critically. Instead of having an actual discussion, people are throwing around ‚Äúbahun,‚Äù ‚ÄúChristian,‚Äù or ‚Äúother cultures‚Äù like that somehow answers the question. When we turn conversation into belittling, blaming, or name-calling, we‚Äôre not defending culture but normalising this behaviour. I mean how hard is it understand you can agree to disagree without all these?|||Actually the closest thing that happens in the west like this is children beauty pagents  AT LEAST, at the very least, this Kumari affects one child over a years. USA child beauty pageants produce so many|||I think this is so cruelüòû a kid should not be isolated from the society, and should not be sit there to just take photo with tourists ..|||People talking about normal childhood and growing up \"normal\", a lot of misconception here.  Goodness flows through Kumari.  She is worshipped for being the medium of taleju bhawani. They are taught that they as an individual are not god, but the goodness that flows through her is what makes her worshipped.  And calling Kumari as a \"virgin goddess\" is stupid and a complete disregard of religious belief. It's a literal translation not a literary translation.   A lot of misconceptions have already been debunked.  Therefore they are able to integrate back into society well. They have good societal support . They are mentored, taught and are well taken care of. They themselves have immence respect for their religion and tradition.  If you think being a Kumari is wrong, you simply look at other practices in other religions. Nuns are not allowed to marry or consummate. Denying the right to marry and consummate can be considered as an oppressive practices denying one from their human desires. In radical Islam, burka, multiple marriages, denial of human rights for wemen.  While such petty comparisons are stupid themselves, what I want to say is we are worshipping female power. We are actually looking at females as devine. Not simply blind worship.   Nothing about today's childhood is normal.  You see young boys and girls sent off to boarding schools as normal? It's more isolating depressing. Parents just sticking their child to an iPad, or a hyperactive parent forcing their child through multiple activities (music class, sports, extra activities) even when their child may not want to to them, and pushing their child to extremes, putting their child through ridiculously high expectations, so that they can fulfill own ego( yes I've seen it happen).  A lot is not normal in so called modern normal childhood.   A lot of narratives and propogandas have infiltrated our thinking. Be water and explore into the culture. A lot has been written about Kumari from a propogandist and religious infiltration viewpoint.  A lot has been written to criticize our culture and ostracize ourselves from our religion and culture. Beware.|||Yeah agreed I thought it was just culture as a child but now I see it as different|||Sadhguru has spoken about the Kumari tradition of Nepal. It is an understanding about God making.

A case was registered in high court of Nepal but the court didn't make decision against Kumari tradition but asked to reform. There have been quiet few reforms.

But let‚Äôs be real: he‚Äôs the only king after Prithvi Narayan Shah who actually did something that mattered for the survival of Nepal.    Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus ‚Äî with nine governments in ten years. That wasn‚Äôt democracy, it was chaos. Leaders were busy stabbing each other in the back while the nation stayed dirt poor, uneducated, and vulnerable. Tell me, what ‚Äústable democracy‚Äù exists when governments collapse every year? None. Mahendra saw this and did what no one else had the guts to do: he hit reset.    Yes, he dissolved parliament. Yes, he banned parties. And you know what? He was right to. Without stability, Nepal was on track to become India‚Äôs backyard project or another pawn in the Cold War. Mahendra‚Äôs Panchayat system gave the country one thing it desperately lacked: stability.    And let‚Äôs talk achievements:    He balanced India and China like a chess master. Without him, we‚Äôd have been swallowed by one side decades ago.    He pushed Nepal onto the global stage ‚Äî Non-Aligned Movement, a stronger UN presence, and an independent foreign policy.    He jump-started modernisation: roads, schools, universities, tourism. These are things no king before him, and very few leaders after him, have been able to deliver at that scale.    But historians? They love to cry about ‚Äúdemocracy dying in 1960.‚Äù These same historians never admit that the so-called ‚Äúdemocrats‚Äù of the 50s were busy running the country into the ground. It‚Äôs easy to glorify B.P. Koirala in hindsight, but Mahendra was the one cleaning up the mess in real time.    Here‚Äôs the hard truth: Mahendra was the only king who actually acted like a king ‚Äî a protector of sovereignty. Everyone after him either coasted on his legacy or failed miserably. Without him, Nepal might not even exist as the independent state it is today.    Call him authoritarian all you want, but facts don‚Äôt lie. After Prithvi Narayan Shah, King Mahendra was the only true king Nepal ever had.",

He saved Nepal from being a puppet of foreign countries. He was a gem.|||Its not an unpopular opinion though. Those who know history know how Progressive Mahendra was. One thing though, his rapid advancements did over heat a fledgling Nepalese economy which is why we needed to privatize our industries. But the privatization was a joke,   they privatized it too quickly and privatization advocates in Nepal did admit they made a huge mistake later on.|||Mahendra is a complicated figure. On one hand, he did keep Nepal intact at a time when regional instability and internal divisions could have easily spiraled out of control.  On the other, his coup dismantled the first democratic experiment and concentrated power in the monarchy, which created long-term issues that Nepal is still untangling today.   It‚Äôs less that historians hate admitting he saved Nepal, and more that they frame it as a tradeoff between short-term stability and long-term democratic development.|||Popular opinion. It's because of Prithvi Narayan Shah and King Mahendra that modern day Nepal even exists as a separate country in its current form. Otherwise there would not have even been an independent country known as Nepal.|||His authoritarian enforcement of the Nepali language and Hindu traditions on a diverse population that wanted nothing to do with them was one of the causes of the civil war that would follow.  He killed democracy in its crib and pulled us back into medieval institutions. Even if I were to hypothetically accept that he was a good ruler for the sake of argument, there is no guarantee and his heirs and his heirs‚Äô heirs would have been good rulers, which is why absolute monarchy fails. Any good that he might have done during his reign is negated by the fact that long term institutions are more important than charismatic rulers, and he ruined the institution of democracy. All the instability that we have faced since 2008- would have happened in the 1950s and we could have been a prosperous democracy by the present. This guy pulled us decades back.  It‚Äôs easy to look back at the past with rose tinted glasses and romanticize it, that is the first step on the road to fascism, but the truth of life, prosperity and happiness is in the future and progressive institutions.|||The problem with Monarchy in Nepal and everywhere else is that there are few good apples in 1 crore ropani orchard.  Except PN Shah, Mahendra and maybe Birendra (many sources call him spineless but I don't know), no one else were fit to rule. The country fell into Ranas dictatorship  because of Monrachy system failure.  So here we are, dealing with generational political trauma.|||A quick ChatGPT will give you some real perspective:  Most historians and political analysts agree that King Mahendra‚Äôs reasons were more of a pretext to consolidate royal power rather than genuine democratic concerns. Here‚Äôs why:  1. Political instability was exaggerated  Nepal‚Äôs first elected government (1959‚Äì1960) under B. P. Koirala had been in office for only 18 months.  While there were some administrative problems, it wasn‚Äôt long enough to judge the parliamentary system a failure.  Corruption and inefficiency existed, but not at the level Mahendra claimed.   2. Fear of losing monarchical dominance  The 1959 elections gave the Nepali Congress a clear majority.  Koirala‚Äôs government was popular and gaining legitimacy, which posed a direct threat to the king‚Äôs absolute authority.  Mahendra feared the monarchy would become a ceremonial institution like in India or Britain.   3. Foreign policy pretext  Koirala pursued a relatively independent foreign policy, maintaining balance between India and China.  Mahendra accused him of endangering Nepal‚Äôs sovereignty, but in reality, the king wanted direct control over diplomacy, which was vital for aid and recognition.   4. Use of \"underdeveloped society\" argument  Mahendra claimed that Nepalese people weren‚Äôt ‚Äúready‚Äù for democracy due to illiteracy and lack of experience.  This was partly true, but instead of strengthening democratic institutions, he abolished parties and built a system where only the king‚Äôs will mattered.   5. The Panchayat system benefited him most  Under Panchayat, all political power flowed through the king.  It created the image of \"guided democracy,\" but in practice, it was royal autocracy with no accountability.   üìå Conclusion: Mahendra used the excuses of instability, corruption, and national unity to justify a royal coup. The deeper reason was to preserve absolute monarchy and prevent Nepal from transitioning into a genuine parliamentary democracy.|||Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus, with nine governments in ten years. That wasn‚Äôt democracy, it was chaos.  LOL. The King chose PM. He was the one responsible.|||Yes man agreed. He is the guy who defined Nepal and Nepali people. He did a lot of great works for the country. But many people and our school books consider him as a dictator telling about how he banned political parties and not mention about the reforms and development made by him for the country. One of the greatest leader of our country King Mahendra!!|||Ali history paddam, 1959 ma first election vako ho tyo vanda aagadi sab PM king le choose garya ho, 1st election ko 1.5 years ma coup vako ho.|||But his policies are disastrous for Nepal till this day  He opened Nepal's border with India, opened free trade with India, allowed India to build its Army base in Lipulekh Limpiyadhura Kalapani since then these territories are occupied by India  He also forced Khas culture on Newaris and Janjatis which influenced them to become Communists|||Agreed!|||Will not let anyone discredit the blood of 17k Nepali|||We wouldn't have been swallowed by any side. Non-alignment was the default policy from the beggining, and B.P koirala would have continued that policy. Nepal would have 'modernized' without an iron-fisted dictatorship.|||Matrika literally wanted to suck cock of india..   He was puppet of India...while BP was good...Matrika and BP's power struggle caused mahendra to step in...and take all the powers..   Thats my unpopular opinion too.|||I agree with most of your points. But your point about 10 governments in nine years doesn't show the instability created by parties but by the monarchs. The monarchs were the ones that were making them unstable. The one time it seemed to be stable, he couped the government. That doesn't diminish the fact thought, that his rule saw probably the most balanced foreign policy of Nepal, where Nepal truly stood out as a sovereign nature. I still believe that had Mahendra controlled a bit of his authoritarian ways and worked together with B.P. Koirala, Nepal would have been in a much better position that it is currently. Both of them are the best leaders Nepal had post P.N. Shah. It might be an unpopular opinion but I think P.N. Shah might be more important historically, but these two are probably the best leaders Nepal got, even better than P.N. Shah.|||Unpopular hoina, brain-dead opinion.

Ani jabo dui tukra road pitch garyo bhandai ma khusi hune??|||sovereignty? of who? Mahendra model of nation-building was \"one religion, one custom, one language.\" Hindu orthodoxy was enforced as state ideology, treating non-Hindu communities as second-class. Nepali was imposed as the only legitimate language, sidelining rich traditions like Maithili, Newar, Tharu, Tamang, Limbu, etc. This wasn't genuine unity - it was control through forced uniformity. What looked like stability was in fact suppression. That brittle foundation is why today's Nepal wrestles with federalism, ethnic assertion, and identity politics: democracy didn't invent division, it revealed what had long been silenced.  The Koiralas, born and educated in Banaras, were accused of being \"too Indian.\" But Nepal had no universities, no political freedom, no space for intellectual growth - precisely because the tyrants had closed those doors. Should they be condemned for seeking ideas in India, or credited for importing the democratic imagination Nepal lacked?  So the paradox is clear:  Mahendra centralized the state but weakened society.|||First question, why was Nepal unstable during those years? And second more important question, if stability was the most important thing for us, why did he take over from a parliament that had a 2/3 majority and the government was led by THE BP Koirala? There was a little chance that the Koirala govt would have toppled and was doing good work..  Yes, there were some long term projects under him that were very good for Nepal. There‚Äôs no denying that and kudos to him. But he was authoritarian, there is no denying that either. Let‚Äôs not over glorify someone and gloss over facts because they don‚Äôt fit our views..|||Educated boomers hate him(my boomer dad lol).|||Nepal was too small for the OG Mahendra.

While the country was grieving and people were literally risking their lives for justice, she was sitting back, polishing a script and preparing an Excel sheet to clear her image. That‚Äôs not just tone-deaf, it‚Äôs calculated. The timing, the fake vulnerability, the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm innocent‚Äù narrative, it‚Äôs all image management. And to drop that while the nation is still mourning? It‚Äôs actually disgraceful. Her silence during the peak of the movement spoke volumes, and now this video just confirmed everything people feared about her.

I got a sudden boost in heart-beat thinking she actually shot herself & unlived her|||Hijo matrai I saw a YouTube video of thesadiapsychology‚Äôs scam who provides everything but proof that she is a licensed psychologist with degrees. It‚Äôs a different story but that‚Äôs exactly how I felt watching Shrinkhala‚Äôs videos.  I never idolized her or hated her, but this is too much. It was giving manipulation & narcissism. It‚Äôs one thing to defend her reputation, but completely another to do so by playing the victim card, shifting narratives & repeatedly saying things so that they are perceived as truth & dodging accountability by blaming others. Tbh it really bothered me that she (and her PR team) thought that we‚Äôre dumb enough to believe those excel sheets. Maybe what she said is true, but she could have showed the actual proof.  In her place, all of us would feel terrible. But to say things like leaving instagram account as it is so that it can be a testament to hate while not acknowledging her silence on a platform with a million followers over deaths of youth is crazy. Becoming an influencer means you are sometimes answerable to questions & accusations, it‚Äôs not just about making your feed aesthetic & scoring brand deals. People turned her into an influencer, so ofc she will have to be answerable sometimes. I wonder what she thought? Yea it‚Äôs not easy, but it‚Äôs part of all that fame & money.  To see that she was so concerned about setting her narrative & defending her image while not even feeling sorry for those who died, were injured & whose families are now forever incomplete is baffling.   Her narrative has been set forever now. Clearly, not to everyone, but to lots of us. Someone said that she‚Äôs only sad now because she lost followers, and that pretty much sums up how I see her now.|||Tesko bhanda ta Anmol KC ko acting ramro yarr|||Aafule khaneko khaldo ma aafai parnu vaneko ehi ho :D|||Yeah couldn't agree more.

Honestly asking. Why did the Nepo Kids trend include her?

Was Binod Khatiwada known to be corrupt? Please dont tell me that every politician is corrupt. I am asking if there has been any concerns raised regarding Binod Khatiwada like he owning multiple buildings, cars etc when he is only a politician.    If no one really knows that her dad is corrupt, her defensiveness makes sense to me. I too would be devastated if my image was destroyed for no apparent reason.   Again.. I am saying this because I honestly don't know about Binod Khatiwada.|||K garos ta garna chai, yeti sab vaisakdaa, yeti sab accusations huda, euta manche le aafno clarification ta dihalxha ni yr.

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. üò≠üò≠2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye üò≠|||3 brsa vo dashign namanako|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",
