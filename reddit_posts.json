            "comments": "Hello everyone,  I believe this subreddit has a large Nepali community in Australia, so I wanted to share my situation and seek genuine guidance. I come from a lower middle-class family in Nepal and recently completed my B.Sc. in Physics from Tribhuvan University. (My certificate shows 2023, but the actual completion year is 2024, and I can provide a gap verification letter.)  My profile: Percentage: ~72% | IELTS: 7.5 | GRE: 317 | Publications: 2 papers in Q1 (SJR-ranked, low IF) | 1 national journal paper | 1 paper currently under review (First author in all)  My main goal is quality education and research, not money. I have applied for some PhD programs in the USA, but due to the current situation there and my uncertain chances, I am now seriously considering Australia.  However, I know that Australian universities strongly emphasize percentages, and I feel that direct PhD may be very difficult with my profile. I am open to doing a Master’s (even self-funded), but my financial condition is weak, and this is where my confusion begins.  I would be very grateful if someone could honestly answer:  1. With this profile, is it realistic to get admission into an MSc in Physics in Australia? 2. How expensive is the tuition fee for MSc Physics (approximate range)? 3. Can a student realistically pay tuition and living expenses by working part-time in Australia? 4. Are there any scholarships, fee reductions, or affordable universities that I should look into? 5. Are there other countries where a student like me can pursue higher studies in Physics without extreme financial pressure?  I truly have a deep passion for physics and research. My family cannot support me financially, so I want to study abroad on my own, without causing them stress. Any advice, experience, or guidance would mean a lot to me.  Thank you so much in advance 🙏",

Maybe because when you sit across from someone, you try to figure out what kind of person they are before they do the same to you.  “So, Mr. Prabhu” he says, looking down at the papers & adjusting his glasses “your CV says you have more than nine months of experience teaching mathematics for class eleven and twelve.     But I don’t see an experience letter from your previous college. Usually they give one when you leave.”    “Oh, sorry about that, sir,” I say. “I thought mentioning the experience on my CV would be enough. I didn’t realize it had to be attached separately. But I do have the certificate here.”  I slide the paper toward him.    He doesn’t look like the type who cares much about recommendation letters, but I  still made a fake one. Just in case. you never know who suddenly decides to do their job properly.     He reads it. Slowly. Slower than I expected.    It’s just a letter. Still, he keeps reading. I wonder if he’s actually going through each line or if something about it feels off to him. I keep my face neutral. If he doubts it, he’ll ask. If he doesn’t, then it’s done.    After a while,  finally , he hums.    “They’ve used some strong word for you hah” he says. “And you completed the written test quite fast too.”    He looks up. “Mathematics is often seen as a scary subject among students. Would you agree?”    The first answer that comes to my mind is that math isn’t scary, students are just dumb. But I don’t say that. I need this job.    “Yes” I say. “Many students fear math. Not because it’s difficult, but because they fall behind early. Once that happens, they stop trying and blame the subject instead.     He listens without interrupting.   “I try to keep things strict in the beginning,” I add. “If students feel too comfortable early on, they stop taking the subject seriously.”    He nods and writes something down.     That part is true . just not in the way he thinks.     “Why did you leave your previous college?” he asks.    I smile. not too much.    “It wasn’t anything major,” I say. “Over time, I realized that the academic structure and learning environment there didn’t really match what i was looking for. I wanted more focus on practical learning and clarity in my direction.\"    That seems to satisfy him. like the answer confirmed something he already believed.     Outside the window, a group of students are crossing the courtyard. They’re laughing about something. None of them look inside the room.    The principal stands and offers his hand. I stand too. The handshake is firm. appropriate. forgettable.     “We’ll call you by tomorrow with our decision,” he says.    I nod. Thank him. Smile once more. Not too much.  As I walk out, I already have a fair idea of how this will go.    They never want honesty. They want to feel reassured. They want to be told they won't regret hiring you.            When I step out, two people were waiting for their turn.   A man and a woman. Both probably some years older than me. early thirties maybe. They’re dressed neatly. The kind of clothes people wear when they’re nervous and want to look serious.    The man smiles when he sees me. It’s polite. A little hopeful.    “How did it go?” he asks.   “Good” I say.  He nods quickly. “what did he asked?”  “nothing. just basics. He seemed more interested in how fast you respond tho”      \"fast?\". He laughs. A nervous sound. “Right.”    I smile at him. Not friendly. Not rude.    The woman doesn’t say anything. She just looks at the door, then at me, then back at the door.    After a pause, the man says, “Okay. Best of luck.”  “You too,” i say.     I walk away before he ask anything else.       The next afternoon, the call comes when I’ve just returned to the room after another interview at a different college. Yesterday it was a bigger one. Reputed. I don’t know if they want me. I don’t wait to find out.     Unknown number.  I pick it up anyway..    “Mr. Prabhu? Congratulations. You’ve been selected for the position of Math lecturer at our college.”    A formal voice. She went over the timings. The start date. I listened until she stopped talking. finally the call ended.     I don’t move for a few seconds. Not because it matters. Just because my hand is still holding the phone. I put it down on the table.    The room is quiet again. It’s a small room. One bed pushed against the wall. Thin mattress. The bedsheet is clean but old. It doesn’t fit properly, one corner always slipping off. I stopped fixing it a long time ago. There’s a table near the bed. Cheap wood. A few scratches. On it: my phone, a pen, a notebook, and a file with my documents. I keep the file closed even though I know what’s inside. Habit.    The window is open. Not fully. Just enough for air. From outside, I can hear bikes and a kabadi man shouting for raddi-paper. Normal sounds. I don’t look out.     I take off my shoes and place them near the wall. Parallel. I don’t remember when I started doing that. I just do.        My bag is on the floor. Half-open. Books inside. Mathematics. Old notes. Some pages folded, some clean. I don’t mind the disorder inside the bag. As long as the room itself stays the same. I boil water using the kettle. It makes a sound like it’s struggling. I wait. While waiting, I count the money in my wallet. Not because I need to. Just checking. Enough for rent. Enough for food. Enough.    The water boils. I pour it into a cup with two wai-wai noodles. Close the lid. four minutes.    While waiting, I sit on the bed. The mattress sinks slightly under my weight. The ceiling has a dark patch near the corner. I’ve seen it grow slowly over months. I don’t know if it’s damp or something else. I don’t ask the owner.    The noodles are ready. I eat standing up. It’s faster that way. The taste is the same as always. I don’t think about it. Food is food.     My phone lights up. A message from the college. Confirmation. Same details as the call. I read it once. Then lock the screen. I should feel something. People usually do. New job. New place. Fresh start. I’ve heard these words before. They don’t stick.    I wash the cup and place it upside down to dry. Wipe the table even though it’s already clean. Small routines keep things in place. I open the file and check the documents again. Certificates. CV. Experience letter. The fake one is there too. Printed properly. Signed properly. Looks real because it doesn’t try too hard.     I read one line and then stop. No point rereading things that won’t change. I fold tomorrow’s clothes and place them on the chair. Shirt. Pants. Nothing fancy. I don’t like clothes that stand out. They make people look twice.    I set the alarm. Early enough. Not too early. For a moment, I stand near the window. I don’t lean out. Just stand there. A group of boys pass below, laughing, pushing each other. Probably students. Their voices fade quickly. I don’t follow them with my eyes.    I turn off the light and lie down.  The room doesn’t feel heavy. It doesn’t feel light either. It just exists. Like me.    Tomorrow will start like any other day. I’ll go. I’ll teach. I’ll leave when it’s time.    I stare at the ceiling until my eyes adjust to the dark.           Chapter 2:     The next day , morning.  Day 1  I arrive ten minutes early.  Not because I’m eager. Being late creates unnecessary explanations. Being early doesn’t.    The college gate is already busy. Students everywhere. Groups forming and breaking. Some with bags slung low, some still half asleep. A few look at me briefly. Long enough to register that I’m not a student. Not long enough to care.    I walk past them.    Inside, the principal’s office door is open. I knock once and step in.  He looks up from his desk. Same mustache. Same watch.  “Oh, you’re early,” he says.  I smile.    He talks. Rules, schedules, expectations.  four periods. Two for class twelve. Two for eleven. Forty-five minutes each. He mentions discipline. Results. Reputation. I listen. None of this is new.    Two other teachers are there. They smile. Introduce themselves. Names. I don’t try too hard to remember. We exchange small talk. Where I taught before. Which subject. How long.  Nothing important.    After a while, a staff member comes to take me to the class.  We walk through the corridor. The walls are covered with posters. motivational quotes, exam schedules, faded notices that no one has removed. Students pass by, brushing shoulders, laughing, arguing. Someone runs and almost bumps into me.    The classroom is on the second floor.  Class 12. Section A.    The staff member opens the door and steps aside.  “Sir, this is your class.”  I nod and walk in.    The room is loud. Students laughing.  talking. Some still chewing something. first period energy. A few notice me. Most don’t. The noise fades slowly. Some students are still standing. Some sitting casually.  I don’t say anything.  I wait. Silence. Good.    I place my bag on the desk. Put my notebook down. Look at the room.  Thirty-something students. Faces blend together at first. But a few stand out.  There’s a girl near the window sitting straight, notebook already open. She isn’t looking at me. She’s looking at the board. Waiting.    There’s a boy in the middle row leaning back slightly, arms crossed. Watching me. Not curious.   I write my name on the board.    Prabhu Kunwor.     Under it:  MATHEMATICS  “I’m your new math teacher,” I say. “Sit properly.”  They do. Some immediately. Some after a second. The chairs settle.    I turn back to the board and write the chapter name. Algebra. Permutations and combinations. The marker squeaks slightly. Cheap marker.    “Sir,” the boys say, “the previous teacher already finished the first four exercises of algebra. Do we start from five?”  “No,” I say. “Doesn’t matter where he left.”  I turn slightly, facing the class.    “You have ten months for the board exam. We’ll revise everything.”   “I expect everyone to have a separate practice notebook and a notes notebook from tomorrow.”  “For now, pay attention to the board. Don’t write yet.”   A few faces changes.   I start explaining the concept.    A whisper. Then a small laugh. From the middle rows.  I stop writing. Not suddenly. Just stop.    I turn around.    The boy with crossed arms is still leaning back. He hasn’t laughed. He hasn’t stopped it either.  “What’s your name?” I ask.  He straightens a little. “Rohan.”  “Rohan,” I say. “Stand.”  He does. Calm. Confident. Slightly untidy, but not careless. Used to attention.  “Come here. Solve question number four.”  Not the hardest. Not the easiest.    I need to see where they actually stand before deciding the pace.  Rohan solves it. Confident. Clean.  “Good,” I say. “go sit.”   A pause.   “Next time, raise your hand.”    He sits. The class waits. Nothing else happens. I turn back to the board and continue. The room is quieter now.    I explain the core logic slowly. Logic lasts longer than formula. I don’t simplify more than necessary.  Some struggle. Some follow easily.  Rohan follows easily.    The girl near the window writes everything. She doesn’t look up much.  By the time the bell rings, the board is full. The students look tired. That’s fine.    “Next class, we continue from here,” I say. “Don’t fall behind.”    The bell rings. Chairs move. Noise returns immediately.  I erase the board halfway. Not all of it. I leave some there.    As I step out, I hear Rohan say something to the student next to him. I don’t turn back.  In the corridor, the staff member waits to show me Section B.        By the time the last period bell rings, my throat feels dry.  Four periods.  Two sections of twelve. Two of eleven.  Different faces. Same tired eyes.  Nothing went wrong. Nothing went right either.    I leave the building with rest of them. The crowd spills through the gate. Students loosen up immediately.     Outside the collage, there’s a small shop. Cigarettes. Tea. Biscuits stacked behind dusty glass.  I stop there. “Ek packet shikar,” I say.  The shopkeeper doesn’t look up. He slides it across the counter like he’s done it a hundred times today. Probably has.    I light one. First drag burns a little. Good.  I stand near the road, away from the students. Smoke mixes with dust and exhaust. A bus passes too close, horn blaring for no reason. It’s already full. People hanging from the door like that’s normal. Someone inside is shouting for the conductor to wait. The bus doesn’t.  Another one comes. Same condition. No order. No line. Just urgency pretending to be routine.  I don’t move yet.  The day replays itself in pieces.  Class Twelve A . quiet by the end. One boy too confident. One girl too focused.  Class Twelve B . More louder. Less patient.  Class Eleven .  Raw. Still forming habits. Easier to control.    The college itself feels exactly like I expected. Trying to look serious. Trying to look important.  Posters telling students to dream big. They don't mention the price tag attached to the rocket.     I finish the cigarette. Crush it under my shoe. Light another without thinking. I didn’t introduce myself too much. That’s enough for day one.    A bus finally stops. People rush in. I get pushed from behind and end up inside whether I want to or not. The conductor shouts something about change. Someone argues. Someone laughs. I hold onto the metal bar. The bus smells like sweat and old seats and yesterday’s rain.    First day.  It didn’t ask anything from me. I didn’t give it much either. That’s good.",

Here is my concern : -  Nepali don’t seem to exists in the system of most tech companies. How many have you noticed that when you use AI and make them speak nepali, they start mispronouncing words as if they were speaking Hindi.  Also, look at google. YouTube’s AI classifies Nepali songs and videos as Hindi. This is the AI doing it. System doesn’t know about us. ( i could not post the pictures as evidence cus the it is not allowed here)  Aba kasari chinauni hola. Having the correct tags and classifications will help boost and gives the system the option to apply separate rules for our content. This can lead to better classification, recommendations and many more ( i am not a data scientist )  I am a firm believer that our narrative should be in our control. We cannot do that if the system everyone uses doesn’t even know about us.  The content of the future will be driven by AI, if this misclassification continues, it will surely affect us.  So, if any of you are a data analyst/scientist or in tech. Please share your thoughts on what can be done about this.",

            "body": "Just my thoughts  Lately, I am seeing one pattern in Nepalese politics. It feels like a readymade template to me.  Step 1: Become popular First, a person becomes popular using social media, TV, YouTube, Facebook, interviews, etc. They build an image like a social activist or truth speaker. Hami laai esto lagxa he is the right person. Waha haru le esto vaan parnu hunxa ki:  “I am doing this for society” “I am not earning money from this” “This is not for profit\" They attack others, expose issues, criticize leaders, expose others all using social media/ media. Jasle garda Fame increases.  In this step Money is not the goal, fame is.  Step 2: Monetize the fame (into power) After enough popularity, next step is election. The fame earned by criticizing and defaming others is converted into political power. From activist → candidate → leader.  Step 3: Use the power Once elected, they start exercising power. Mero bicharma System remains almost same, faces change.  Now my questions is: Is this a good practice ? Does being a good reporter, YouTuber, or social activist automatically mean someone can be a good leader? Is popularity equal to capability? This is just my observation, not targeting any single person. I may be wrong too. What do you think?",

Just because someone’s well known, through charity, social work, or social media, does not mean they’d be great policymakers and/or administrators. Bureaucratic work is painfully slow, and I’m not sure these “like aayena vane saajha feri delete garera re-upload garxu” group are patient, diplomatic, or understanding enough to bring real, necessary changes in society. But, this is happening all across the world now, and is just a bit more acute in Nepal.   That being said, what are the options for people like us in Nepal? Who do we vote for? If people are on their phone for 6-8 hrs a day, they WILL vote for people they see every day as opposed to people they haven’t seen at all, right? Plus there’s the issue of wanting to place younger people in power since the older folks haven’t done much for us.|||It depends on the capability you like to see on the representative. But election more about capability of voter than the candidate. I think one think all voters do is get all the names,address and contact no. Of all the party representative if possible everyone that came to your house. Make them realised that they stand not bcoz party gave them ticket but you drop your vote on ballet box. It doesn't matter if he owns by 5000 vote out of 20000 vote all 20000 voter should call or get to his house and ask his or her work plan. |||Kasari aune ta bro politics ma?

            "body": "I’m very hopeful about the upcoming election and really want to see RSP form a stable government that actually lasts a full five-year term.  That said, with all the chaos going on, I think we might end up even more politically unstable as a country. Don’t get me wrong, I still believe that anything is better than the old regime coming back, and right now that alternative is RSP. I’ve always felt that Nepal would have been far better off if we were governed by people who were ethical and genuinely nationalist, even if they weren’t highly educated. Just eliminating corruption alone would have taken us much further as a country, and that’s what I expect (and hope) from RSP.  I’m pretty into geopolitics and write about it often, so I’m genuinely curious what others think. Are you satisfied with the candidates the political parties have put forward this time? Personally, I feel a bit disappointed when I look at what we’re calling our “best” options.  Education became fairly accessible for most men in Nepal by the early 1980s. Around that same period, Nepal had a solid international reputation and decent relationships with countries like the UK, Russia, and China. So after 40+ years, how is it that we still don’t have enough leaders with proven experience, strong knowledge, and real credibility?  Even within RSP, aside from a few notable figures like Swarnim Wagle, I honestly struggle to see strong lawmakers, especially after Sumana left. It makes me wonder: what exactly are the rest of them going to do in Parliament?  Right now, most of the messaging seems to be “we’re new” and “we represent change,” and a lot of the candidates are basically social media personalities. To be fair, I don’t completely oppose that. Politics is partly a popularity game, and visibility matters. But popularity alone isn’t governance.  Ideally, after this election, I hope we can amend parts of the constitution, repeal bad policies, clean up the judiciary by removing party-appointed judges, and create stronger checks and balances. Strengthening national defense and improving foreign relations should also be priorities.  And finally, my hope is that after five years, the people who are mainly there because of media hype will step aside, real primaries will be held, and people with actual merit, competence, and integrity will take over. That’s how we move from “new party” energy to real, lasting reform.",

So, manipulators use this psychology to inflate stock prices.       Many investors think manipulation is simple: a big player buys, the price goes up, and they sell. In reality, the game is more planned.  In NEPSE, manipulation often runs in a cycle. It uses “fake walls” to confuse and pressure you, so you sell cheap or buy high.  I have written new blog diagnosing how these fake orders work, how big players manipulate market and how to spot them.  Looking for your feedback.

If ordinary citizens are never released like this, how and on what basis is he the only one released? Has the Nepali judiciary set separate standards of justice for ordinary citizens and VIPs?  There is a campaign to prevent elections, incite roadblocks, and spread confusion by saying, 'There will be no more elections'. Not only are candidates who have entered the election fray being assassinated, insulted, and abused without any evidence, but the government and the country's independence have been attacked by giving money to extremist groups. Trying to stop the elections by dragging an important organ of the state, the Election Commission, into controversy and spreading confusion has increased the risk of pushing the country into a vortex of great instability and conflict.  Even in such a serious situation, can't he be kept in detention until there are 1-2 months left before the elections? Does this court understand the seriousness of the election and the needs of the country? The tendency to release today and tomorrow raises the question of whether the court has no concern for the independence and stability of the country. Does Nepal really have the rule of law or is it just empty rhetoric?",

If your post is a mere comment or reaction on that event, there is no need for a separate post.  • if it’s a repeat content, like someone has already posted the news, you can include your own ideas, inputs, thoughts along with the post with an intention to invoke engagement and meaningful discussion, this will make your post stand out among others.  • TikTok and instagram political edits with no substance in the post are being removed.  This is a temporary measure to give space to other users, topics, maintain balance and overall quality in the subreddit.  Thank you for understanding and cooperation.",

Such behavior does not convince anyone, it only creates division.  \t•To aim for discussions that are informative, educational and constructive.

I sincerely request the mods not to discourage political discussions at this time.  The community has the entire year for casual, entertaining, and non-political content—but elections come once every five years, and this one is especially important. Even if some points or arguments are repeated, let them be. Repetition is part of public discourse.  Right now, people need space to express their views, debate, and mobilize. This is a moment when the country needs conversation more than silence. Let the community speak—this is the time for it.

The feeling of my heart having faster and my stomach twisting like an eel holding it's prey is not new to me but still it's not wholly mine.   The feeling of lying in the bed with inherent thoughts of disperse happiness and the want to be able to understand if that happiness is as true as it seems is not new and it's also not wholly mine   I look at all these motion picture hoping to find something. And what that might be is as ananomus to me as it is to you. I look at these things, listen as they talk, but the existence of this feeling of watching doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm lying on this virgin earth, unmolested and untouched, devoid of any feeling of any sort except for one; consciousness. The consciousness reigns supreme within and without all within the vicinity of my existence.  At this point, life as you call it feels not a moments passing by or time flowing like my thoughts.  My head feels particularly heavy, as if I'm thinking but a thought is yet to process. But how can this be? Without a thought, how can you think? How can one live, without knowing the value of death? But that's not right either. For one to know the value of death,.one must first know of its qualities, it's feature in all it's dimensions. The inherent idea of a thought being, and to think not sounds stupid as if not funny enough. But you can't overlook the idea behind such ponder.   I take very long breaths as I think. My heart beats loud enough for me to hear it. And all my bodily functions seems very much obvious to me. This isn't new but it's not wholly mine.   Ahh now my head hurts a little to. But this shall too pass.   Theres this lingering feeling of solitude that I feel very sensationally. For solitude has been my friend far longer then any. The silence that made me feel alone after some years felt not pleasing but good enough to make me feel a bit stingy if it got disturbed.  But now this solitude engulfs me, strangles me so that I choke these thoughts out of me which are yet to be. But it was this very solitude that made me form a thought but now it want it back. Like how death waits right Infront of you, lingers above you with it's hands around neck, and then takes you through the stairs of lifelessness while you climb oblivious. Similar is the solitude that I experience right now, but instead of lifelessness, I climb and climb but towards nothing, I climb and climb but climb on empty thoughts.   My agitated muscles ache in the silence of my breath while my breath gets shorter and heavier each micro instant.",

I am in US, and I can say 98% of my friends don’t support his policies. There are a few who do but there’s always an exception.   Now many, including myself, do support some level of checks and restrictions on immigration. Those who didn’t get in take that as being opportunistic or slamming the door after I got in. Far from it.   What I don’t support is people coming through illegal means. What I don’t support is people cheating and providing 100% false representation while applying. Then once they get in, they try to game the system and just be a leech sucking in the benefits without contributing. They are making it harder for the legitimate immigrants and that’s exactly what we hate.  Now I don’t support the current position of not granting any immigration visa indefinitely to Nepal. But you know why this happened? Because almost 40% of Nepalis, about 70-80k take welfare benefits from the US government. You don’t need it if you are a contributing member of the society (except for in some disability/age related case).   There are people coming to US to get free medical treatment. One performer got the treatment and left the Us without paying the medical bills- that person is now banned from coming. Another famous pair got the DV and justified their entry by saying they get free medical for their kid (their case may be legit, but I am just giving an example of what people have been doing).   The administration is going to the other extreme to curb this- but some of it is because the past administration didn’t do anything to prevent it from happening.|||I seriously doubt the accuracy of this sentiment. Nepalis who have settled in America invariably work to bring other family members here. The effort is long and hard, and many are still in process, meaning that spouses, siblings, and others are now cut off from coming over. My brother in-law was able to finally secure his wife's visa a few weeks ago, after working on it for 2 years.  a few weeks later and she wouldn't get to come, so no, Nepali uncles and aunties aren't supportive, and there is no indication that most nepalis voted for trump.  The other thing to consider is the message behind the visa suspensions.  The trump administration is basically saying that immigrants who have come here have not improved conditions, but rather they have made it worse by taking advantage of government programs that they are not entitled to. In other words immigrants are lazy, and thieves. Not a lot to take pride in about that.|||Let me know what you are smoking..seems like good stuff.|||Just like the viral trend chori manchey ko khutta tanney chori manchey naai huncha.

They pay taxes since it's automatically deducted from the paycheck to a social security number that doesn't belong to them. If they try to use the services they're caught and deported  We're fighting back but our leaders are ineffective, the police are working with ICE and if we call in the military we're unsure of whose side they'll take.

Why would anyone be happy about the current situation ? All of you who agree with the statement are in Nepal who couldn’t make it to the US.|||May I dare present a different perspective?   Not everyone who votes Republican is \"hiding the ladder since they've made it\". That claim is lazy, false, and ignores basic economic reality.  Some of us vote based on numbers, not slogans. When you are paying over $100,000 a year in taxes (household)—income tax, state tax, property tax, sales tax—and you don’t see proportional benefits in return, fiscal policy starts to matter a lot. At that level, voting conservative isn’t ideological—it’s rational. Lower taxes, limited government, and accountability in spending simply align better with that reality.  Paying six figures into the system and being told you’re “privileged,” “selfish,” or morally inferior for questioning where that money goes is not persuasive—it’s alienating. Wanting to keep more of what you earn does not make you hateful. It makes you financially literate.  Many Republican voters reject racism and extremism outright. What they do reject is runaway taxation, bloated government, and being constantly generalized or morally lectured by people whose policies they fundamentally can’t relate to. The same way not all Democrats are extremists, not all Republicans are villains.  And yes—we are also tired of being lumped together with fringe elements just because we don’t align with extreme progressive ideology. Disagreeing with activist politics, identity absolutism, or ideological purity tests does not make someone anti-human. It means they prioritize practicality over performative outrage.  People vote based on lived experience. For households paying $100k+ in taxes every year, conservative policies often make more sense. That’s not hate. That’s math.",

What about the Dhanraj Gurung sahakari case?  - You were part of the Government Efficiency team when the recent UML–Congress coalition government was formed. Will you question or take responsibility for the recent GenZ killings? Your party member Ramesh Lekhak was also the Home Minister at that time—have you questioned him about this?  - You have been a Member of Parliament four times, and during your tenure, the Congress has formed the government multiple times. Can you point to any concrete, policy-level achievements you delivered during your party’s time in government?  - What about Aftab Alam case during your party's government was he rightfully being prosecuted or your party's government have him impunity from jail, what about that case?",

Deuba, as an individual, may once have been a true leader—but over time, the gang culture around him is what turned everything rotten and made him look bhrasta.  From this point onward, Gagan is free.  Free from:  All blame linked to Arzu  All accusations about money in Deuba’s house  All baggage related to Bhutani saranarthi  All the kandas, Teramox, and backroom deals  All blame connected to Lekhaks and their networks  These were never Gagan’s sins to carry.  So why should he keep answering for other people’s cults? Why should a reformist voice be held hostage by the corruption, compromises, and power games of an old guard that refuses to let go?  If anyone needs to answer, it’s the system that protected those networks for decades—not the one who finally challenged them.  Gagan doesn’t need to answer anymore.

Don't get me wrong there are shortcomings from him and nobody is perfect but most of the questions you raised here are poor attempt to make him look bad.  You have to realize that even though Gagan is a prominient member of Nepali Congress, he was never the executive. Every decision the party makes as a whole, the chairman (Deuba) has the supreme authority and he is little to no say in any of the decisions.  Even then, he has clearly spoken against all wrongdoings. And you say \"just speak\". But that's the problem of not being in executive power, he can only speak.  You trying to  make the money burnt in Deuba's house somehow a crime by Gagan Thapa clearly tells me that you are just trying to hate. Otherwise as everyone else has said, there is a special probe commission formed to specifically study the burnt money case and all we can do is wait for their report and the government will file the case if there is wrongdoing (which we all believe there is). And Gagan has clearly affirmed this, as any sane person would. You should read him and listen his many public interviews/videos and not just assume he didn't say anything.  He has clearly said multiple times that any and all involved in sahakari kanda should be investigated including naming people from his own party by name, again multiple times in multiple of his public appearences and writings, you should read/watch/listen those. The government should file cases. I don't understand how this would be his fault.  If you again watch his comments in good faith and listen to his parliament speeches, he as said multiple times that  the public is angry, they need delivery. He said he opposed the coalition and publicly opposed it multiple times. But he is not the executive, deuba is. When there is coaliation, he has the moral responsibility to make the government successful. He was indeed in the efficiency team and he said he tried is best to make the government successful because he knew people needed delivery even though he opposed the coalition. He publicly told long before the Gen-Z protest that he couldn't get the government to do what the efficiency team was supposed to do, and he left it. So I don't think that makes him culpable for the massacre during gen-z protest.  But still he has taken moral responsibility for what happened during the protest. He has apologized multiple times for any moral culpability he has. He said he immediately asked the party leadership to break coaliation in the first day of protest and asked Lekhak to resign. Lekhak did resign but the party didn't leave coalition because again Deuba is executive and makes the decision.  He has been parliament member four times. The first time and he failed to deliver the constitution as promised which he was elected for. The second tenure was again the CA election, which delivered the constitution and you can't deny he played crucial role in making the constitution, and he (among all others) delivered the constitution. The next term he went to the parliament again and became health minister and people say he delivered some reforms in health sector (again refer to public catalogues of his works during this tenure). And you have to grant that he has been constant voice in the parliament on various issues, which the MP is sent for. This last time was a short tenure, but as everyone he has played crucial role in voicing concerns in the parliament. Ironically he strongly demanded there be independent probe in sahakari case and there have been multiple arrests and cases filed against some major fraudsters. You should grant that this was successfull. But we can always demand more. I am not his prabakta but to me seems like he could have definitely done more here and I am sure he agrees.  Yeah what about the case? Alam was a proven convict. But congress did dirty by lobbying to release him. I haven't seen him support Alam's release. Again, I am not sure the details of his release but how is Gagan culpable for the crime Alam committed?  Again I am not his prabakta. I try to speak with reason. You could certainly question that he didn't do enough at policy level as MP to propose new laws and pass them. You could ask him that he could not do enough to break Deuba stronghold. But he precisely did that recently.  Now I am watching him closely, he is now in the position to deliver at least from his party level. Make him accountable ask him tough questions. But the aforementioned questions seemed more like an attempt to make him bad (except may be how many policy changed did he make in 1 1/2 tenure as MP except CA MP which they delivered constitution).

At the check-in counter, the agent told me to move some items from my carry-on into one checked bag so I’d only have to pay excess for one bag. I did exactly that and reduced my carry-on to 12 kg.

I was exhausted and didn’t have the energy to argue, so they charged me for two excess bags — $80 each. No leeway, no consideration.  To make things worse, the agent openly suggested that if I paid cash and didn’t need a receipt, they could lower the price. At that point it was obvious they were trying to pocket the money.

The main difference is that airport scales are \"trade-legal\" industrial devices required by law to be regularly calibrated for high precision, whereas home scales are consumer-grade gadgets that use cheaper sensors and are almost never recalibrated. Additionally, the environment distorts the numbers; weighing a bag on a soft home carpet or trying to balance a large suitcase on a small bathroom scale often creates a \"lighter\" reading than reality, unlike the airport's large, stable platforms embedded in hard concrete.

The normal everyday workers working in bhansar get shitloads in corruption money as there are news about people smuggling things in the airport everyday, and those are the unsuccessful cases, thousands of cases we don’t even about that happens everyday. I know someone who worked in airport bhansar and had so much corruption money that their house was under custody by the CIAA and they were only a normal employee.

I know why he is liked by so many given how dysfunctional your political system as been lately, but Balen's performance during his stint wasn't that great either. Sadly, no culture of constructive criticism in Nepal.|||I am satisfied with his work because I know it’s not easy. The system itself is messed up, so obviously one person alone can’t fix everything on their own. There will be tons of hurdles, especially in the capital city of the country. Not just the capital, honestly, you can even say Kathmandu as Nepal itself, because it has become the center for everything. No matter what work you have, you somehow have to come to Kathmandu for it. So yeah, I understand his situation.  The one thing I really criticize him for is his lack of communication. That is something I am very disappointed about. During his entire campaign, he kept saying that he wouldn’t be like previous mayors and that he would stay in constant communication with the public. But after winning, he almost completely stopped connecting with people. There is no proper accountability, just one-sided Facebook status updates. This is the part where I am extremely disappointed in him and openly criticize him.  Other than that, I think he has actually shown that work can be done. He has also given inspiration to young people to enter politics.|||Done In some ways  . Even non Exciting programs .Some Jhara tareko type. Some Unfeasible .. some better options appear and done.

The TU equivalency provided was just 3 years despite the college promising 4 years. The batch before us had gotten 4 years.

Why do you need validation from strangers?   It's kind of contradictory to say you are not flexing than showing how much you earn. ( we call these people Hypocrite and nobody likes hypocrites. )  Majjale kamau ani khusi hau.       Remember Happiness comes from within , do not search for it without.|||Not flexing re ani motivation re!! Cant see both.|||if its real whatdo you do  ??? can you give some info or context|||I can see the angle of “look what you can get even from Nepal,” and yeah, that part can actually be motivating because a lot of people still assume they need to leave the country to reach certain compensation levels. But motivation usually comes from showing the path, not just the end result. A screenshot shows where you landed, not how you got there.  People here asked genuine questions about niche, stack, timeline, experience, etc because that’s the part that actually helps others move in that direction. That’s where the value would have been. Without that context, the post ends up reading more like a soft flex than mentorship. Nothing wrong with flexing, just don’t call it motivation if you’re not giving people anything they can learn from or replicate.  With 5+ years of experience you’ve seen enough of the field to know that the “how” matters more than the “what,” especially for people in Nepal who are trying to break into the global market. If the goal was to motivate, sharing the path would have done it way better than just the screenshot.|||Chyya kasto salty manche haru comments ma.

First, you’re told to learn:   HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, Python, C, C++, SQL, React, Angular, Vue, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL.      Then comes the mandatory grind:   DSA, LeetCode, CodeChef, Codeforces, System Design, OOPs, OS, DBMS, Computer Networks.      Then tools & cloud pressure:   Git, GitHub, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, GCP, CI/CD, Jenkins, Terraform.      Then frameworks & buzzwords:   Next.js, Spring Boot, Django, Microservices, REST API, GraphQL, WebSockets.      And now the new wave:   AI, ML, Deep Learning, GenAI, ChatGPT, LLMs, Prompt Engineering, LangChain, Vector Databases.      After all this…   You might get a job.   But there’s no guarantee you’ll survive in the long run.      AI is evolving faster than most people can upskill.   Tech stacks change. Roles disappear. Expectations keep increasing.      IT is no longer a “safe” career.   It’s a constant race with uncertainty.      This isn’t fear-mongering...it’s reality.   Students should seriously explore alternate paths where AI supports you, not replaces you.      Think long-term.   Don’t just follow the crowd.     Found on X",

Sure, it is not realistic to overlook the economy or the job scarcity that is so prevalant now, maybe for the longest time yet but it doesn't adjucate to the premise of Software Engineering isn't feasible as a career anymore, at least to the degree people are making it out to be. AI-driven development may very well be a 'bubble', and when it pops and the dust settles, the next big thing will provoke a similar reaction. While it is evident that people with years of experience are at a loss right now, and even more so for students trying to make it in tech, undergrads or young aspirants.  I believe it was never about how greatly any technology overshadows the current technology even if it transforms areas of it by overwhelming amounts but the ability to use it to your advantage. That is how you thrive here. You embrace, and not reject. AI cannot replace engineering but it does accelerate aspects of it that if you don't keep up, you get left behind. I mean, with AI-driven development so rampant right now, startups are at an all time high. People adapt and make it work. That mindset is obligatory now more than ever. Well, I could be speaking regardless of facts that I have yet to know, but I stand firmly on my grounds of not rejecting engineering as it has never been easier than now.|||I have 4 YOE.

An industry can only take so many people before saturation, especially in face of disruption / paradigm shift as is the case now. As with any other field, you have to dedicate time and effort to be good and stay good. If you are a computer engineer worth your salt, you know it's a lot more about structured and critical thinking, problem solving skills and architecting solutions than coding in the field, and if you have the basics right, tech stack changing shouldn't scare you as much.  As with any other field, only the most committed, knowledgeable and competent people will remain in the industry and that should always be the case. The gold rush is over.|||Difficult times? Yes.  First time? No.   I really want to see what time has. Best wishes.  Best will have the best.|||Not only in Nepal.

Tara the best way to develop skills nowadays is that you could be creating projects written on someone's research papers.

You will be adding more skills as you go, as your project requires it.   Yes its a challenging job but so are other jobs. If you enjoy learning/working in this field then its good for you else people can and should look for other carrier option. Do what feels natural to you.   Regarding AI, its here to stay wear we like it ir not. We don't need to me AI/ML experts we just have to learn how to use it, or embrace it, and not reject it.

After +2, I applied to Canada and the USA for further studies, but my visa got rejected. Instead of wasting a year, I joined BBS , and now I’m in my 3rd year.  When the visa didn’t work out, I decided to take responsibility for my own future. I started learning about AI, automation, and new technologies. Over time, I picked up practical skills, experimented a lot, and eventually started freelancing. Right now, I work as an AI Developer on Upwork, and even in the early stage, I’m earning more than 1 lakh NPR per month.  I’m not an expert and I still have a lot to learn but I know my strengths. I’m good at managing things, people, sales, content, and marketing, and I can execute fast. I have learned most of this by consuming real-world information online and applying it through actual work.  I have big plans in the AI space, but I also know that building something great alone is very difficult. That’s why I am looking for a technical co-founder, someone strong on the engineering side so we can build, learn, and grow together.  The idea is to:  * Start very small and lean * No heavy investment * Focus on AI services / automation / agency-style work * Only basic costs like hosting or APIs * Aim to generate revenue within 2–3 months  I currently live with my parents in Butwal, but I want to move to Kathmandu, take a small flat, and fully focus on building. I also plan to start creating content alongside the business.  I’m looking for someone who:  * Is disciplined and focused * Serious about long-term growth * Not into unhealthy habits * Wants a simple lifestyle with deep work * Has strong technical skills or is deeply committed to developing them  Most importantly, I want a co-founder who understands that things won’t always work. There will be hard times, failures, and uncertainty. During those phases, we should push and motivate each other, stay consistent, and keep moving forward. Even if something fails, we should come out smarter, stronger, and more experienced than before.  We don’t need much money to start just enough for basic living expenses. I have savings that allow me to manage accommodation and food for a long time, and I strongly believe we can make this sustainable within a few months.  The goal is simple:   Live together. Build together. Learn together. Grow together.  If you’re technically strong, disciplined, and serious about building a real AI business from Nepal, let’s connect.",

            "body": "I’ve been on both sides of interviews, both taking them and giving them, and one pattern keeps showing up.  Different engineers can solve the same problem in very different ways, and that’s completely fine. There’s rarely a single “correct” solution. What matters much more to me is how the technical conversation is structured and how the candidate thinks through the problem when constraints and ambiguity are involved.  I’ve noticed many candidates jump straight to advanced tools or complex architectures. They can name frameworks confidently and describe setups that sound impressive. But when you dig a bit deeper and ask *why* certain choices were made, the fundamentals are often unclear. Basic trade-offs, assumptions, data size considerations, or failure scenarios are sometimes missing from the discussion.  With AI tools now widely available, writing code itself is no longer the hardest part. Generating a working solution is relatively easy. What’s harder, and far more valuable, is having a strong grasp of fundamentals: understanding the problem clearly, framing it correctly, reasoning about constraints, and explaining why a particular approach makes sense over others.  When I evaluate candidates, I don’t expect perfect or complete code. In many cases, a clear approach or even well-explained pseudo-code is more than enough. It tells me how someone thinks, how they reason, and whether they can build solutions incrementally instead of jumping straight to complexity.  I’m curious how others see this.  For those who interview regularly, how do you judge candidates? Do you prioritize fundamentals and problem-solving approach, or do tools and implementation details carry more weight for you?",

Companies are telling me that (MAX INT) they can pay me as much as I ask (mu mngey rkm) but I need to be available at 1AM to fix the RAM of client's servers if required.   \"Din rat yuhi sada\" jobs ma basnu parne. What I wanted is a chill job. Instead keep duty personnel in shifts. So that 24x7 availability is achieved. But testo gardaina nikamma nepali companies haru private sector ma.  (This is my experience to the extent what an average fresher can get in Nepali tech market. If it does not relate to you, happy for you!)  **Thus I decided if I were to work with servers, there is no better opportunity for me than government. Because government handles lots of data and some compute as well.**  *Not only that, if I got opportunity in NEA, I was going to get work in Smart Grid and Big Data Technologies. Basically IoT+Big Data.. Future proof shit..And get opportunities on training worldwide country visit representing Nepal ef....K....Holy ef...why only 3 VACANCIES????*   The sad reality is that vacancies are opening at a so so low rate(As per insider's information). CDSC ma 2 seat open ma, NEA ma 3 seats open ma, NEC ma 1 seat open ma, Nijamati ma 1 seat open ma. And students appearing=500,1000 etc..   PS As much as I studied(6+ months), the syllabus started to feel vaster and vaster and never ending type. I have to first understand then memorize then revise so that I can write fluently in exam. There are like total 20 subjects in average (1st+2nd paper). It is looking extremely daunting lol.   Plus the pressure from home to start earning back again.  **I could not get opportunity on remote works. I understand that because server related data are very confidential and nobody will provide remote work for it(without having a company building at Nepal). Unless it is some random person's wordpress hosting configuration. Also remote jobs kaha search garne teti saro idea ni bhayena hola...**",

So CSS for buttons, header, header title, you put your styles here    Also you can add font sizes CSS and spacing CSS here so for consistency.  For getting good at CSS just look at complex design and try to recreate it in plan html CSS for style and js for interactive|||Consistent design across a web app is driven more by design decisions than by css itself. CSS simply implements what’s already been decided. Since there are many ways to achieve the same result with CSS, if your design lacks consistent animations, reusable patterns, or a defined color system, recreating it in CSS becomes unnecessarily messy.  As a rule of thumb, I prefer to: - Define a color palette first - Design for mobile screens - Scale the design up for desktop  I design for mobile first because web apps are more likely to be used on phones, so UX should be optimized for touch, small screens, and performance. Subtle animations usually work better than flashy ones. So tone them down wherever possible.  For example, instead of redefining buttons everywhere, design a single primary button style and reuse it consistently. So when implementing the design you end up clean and reusable CSS (something like the one below).  ``` .btn-primary {   background-color: #4f46e5;   color: #ffffff;   padding: 0.75rem 1.25rem;   border-radius: 0.5rem;   font-weight: 500;   transition: background-color 0.2s ease, transform 0.1s ease; }  .btn-primary:hover {   background-color: #4338ca; }  .btn-primary:active {   transform: scale(0.98); } ```  At the end of the day, the rest comes down to how well you notice design patterns and translate them into clean CSS implementations. [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides) and [Mozilla’s code organization guide](https://protocol.mozilla.org/docs/contributing/css-guide) is all you need to learn.|||so you are stuck at the complex next-js pages where you manage things one under another.

The one in the image is just made to uphold one's agenda.|||Heritage is history, not an achievement. I respect it, but I won’t wear it as a medal.

That’s why they get so sensitive about it. if you criticize that identity, it feels like you’re tearing down the only thing they have to hold onto. Thats also why you see so many extremists in religion, nationalism, or whatever. They’re usually people who haven’t accomplished much personally. The group identity becomes their entire sense of worth so they defend it like their life depends on it.|||Or geographically feature. #LandofEverest|||Last refuge of a person without wealth/achievements is caste|||😆🤣 this isnt his quote lmao|||![gif](giphy|Jir7AUookJHIVb5aYM)|||Big 2026/83 and we're still dealing with this caste system thing|||It is global phenomenon to be honest .

When someone says \"I am proud to be Nepali.\" You say there is nothing that the person did.   You don't say the same thing when someone says \"I am proud of my dad.\"   It is just positive gesture toward something they are attached to.  It is okay to be attached to your tribe and group.. But just as long as you are not putting other people down.|||Your caste and ethnicity influences the thinking|||All of them have rampant hate against each other. But somehow bahun are the only victim of hate according to the subs here:⁠-⁠):⁠-⁠):⁠-⁠)|||That also applies for nationalism, and i haven't seen a single person who is proud of being a bahaun/chettri/rai/magar|||This is a difference that Bahun, Chhetri people do not understand.  There is a huge difference between people saying \"I am proud to be a Brahmin\" vs. \"I am proud to be a Newar\", for example.  Brahmin represents a 3000 year old history of supremacy over others based on birth. It represents what it means to be supposedly superior based on caste, purity, lineage. It represents the root evil of our society that treats your own fellow human beings as untouchable. A society with a Brahmin will automatically have a Shudra too. That is what the 4 Hindu varnavyastha is. What Nepali Bahuns also don't realize is Brahmin, Chhetri - these varna identities are there everywhere in Indian societis too - from Kashmir down to Kerala - every Indian state, community, region has their own Brahmin and Chhetri. So calling yourself a proud Brahmin gives you absolutely no unique identity except your association as a self-superior caste.  Whereas calling yourself a Newar is not based on caste, but a linguistic identity. The notion of caste (and hence superiority-inferiority, pure-impure, higher-lower) automatically disappears when you identify based on the language you speak. You must be aware within Newars there are Hindu Brahmins (Rajopadhyayas), Kshatriyas (Malla, Pradhan, Rajbhandari, etc.) down to a whole range of Vaishyas and Shudras. But when these diverse caste groups identify singularly based on the language they speak (Nepalbhasha/Newar), the identity becomes secular. Your identity based on varna/caste slowly starts to fade off. This is exactly what happened among Newars as most non-Newars will be shocked to find out Brahmins, Kshatriyas even exist among Newars. This is exactly what Indian societies do too. For a majority of Indian people (especially young, educated, urban), their linguistic identity trumps caste identity, hence they identify as Kashmiri, Haryanvi, Bihari, Bengali, Tamilian, Maharastrian, Gujarati, etc. which are all their linguistic identity.  Of course identifying through language does not solve the root of the evil. That is always there. But at least it will be a step in the right direction.|||Magar, Brahmin haru ta tha vayena but yo rai , limbu, Kirat in general have become so full of themselves, they want a KIRAT PRADESSSH Arey.

But still people drag me in all their rasicm stuff, uff..|||It is not about proud , protecting what you inherited in such way where everyone can be happy.|||All are dumb fucks|||Don't like proud people.pride = ignorance+arrogance|||I’ve been thinking about how religion and power were connected in ancient societies, especially in South Asia and Nepal. Many kings tied themselves to religion and caste systems, which also helped them control and organize people. When society is divided into groups, it becomes harder for people to unite, which benefits those in power. So I wonder was religion only about belief, or was it also shaped to maintain authority and hierarchy? If you agree that religion has been used as a tool for control in history, raise your hand. Btw mah ne xetre nae ho.|||when you are Nepali this is ridiculous thing to be pride on. we are prideful of multi ethnicity not just a ethnic.|||Absolutely, this happens when people have only one identity; just like religion.|||Those are casts, not ethnicities|||the thing is the people’s representatives are using these methods in nepal 🫩|||I thik it's true for genders too|||When a man has nth left to eat, he bites the furnitures. a man always needs sth to eat.|||Is there caste discrimination going on ?

Fresh start. He likes another girl, different from the first one, proposes again, she says yes. He’s happy, confidence slowly coming back. And then… déjà vu. About a week ago, he finds out this girl is also a lesbian. But the real plot twist? His first girlfriend and second girlfriend are now dating each other. Yep. Both of them. Together. Now the whole college knows, and my guy is just standing there like a side character, wondering how his love life turned into a Netflix-level plot.

What I keep hearing from people and friends back home raises serious concerns about the tower’s commercial viability.  The issue is not the absence of a freight lift. The real issue sits with scale.  The building has a freight or service lift, but it is far too small for a high-rise of this size. Heavy furniture, industrial equipment, restaurant machinery, medical devices, or office setups will not fit or move efficiently.  In tall commercial buildings, freight lifts need large cabins and high load capacity. They support fit-outs, maintenance, and daily operations. A small service lift slows everything and forces people to misuse passenger lifts.  This reflects poor high-rise planning. Vertical transport should match the building height and purpose.  Residential use might still work. Commercial use looks compromised by design.|||🫩what?? industry ko lagi banako tower for tourism and all aba kina bigarnu paryo , there are plenty of areas where other parts of the city can be used for school or hospital.

What RSP did,was a political miracle a magic I say.Sumana was clearly unaware of it and her quick and sudden action cost her a lot. But,she is /was/will/ be important in questioning the future establishments too. Hope to see her in RSP back! Edit:Lol no way one can compare sumana and Gangan!|||No one with multiple brain cells hate her , she called black as black , she didn't sugarcoated shit with sugar or became shame less like Jhakri didi or others ...   I will always respect her for her stance and self respect.   she might have made political miss step (not wrong step) but she is superior human being than anyone in RSP.|||People hating on sumana and loving Gagan are not the same bro. Most of the RSP supporters hate Sumana and People who love Gagan are NC members.|||It simple, she was alone & she was not able to handle the pressure.     Rabi was highly criticized when he got out of jail. Also, Random Nepali spread fake rumors about how Supreme Court was burned down by RSP supports without any proof.|||Sumana leaving the party was RSP's loss.|||I am still hoping her to be the wild card entry in ktm-4. Gagan must lose and no better candidate than Sumana to contest against him.|||Although I support Rabi and RSP. Rabi shouldn't have walked away from jail during protest and should have waited for court order. Sumana called out Ravi and RSP on their bullshit and resigned from the party, showing she has her principles. It's a shame, that her political career is over because she was the only one with spine. |||Sumana is full of herself. She is smart but she is not a team player. She left RSP. Which is okay. I mean if your values do not align with the leader, you can leave. But she trashed talked and left. No grace or appreciation for a team that put faith in her. Same problem with Ujyalo party. Problem with Chim sign? Girl, be grounded. Appreciate your teammates.|||I love her and she did the right thing by stepping out of RSP. Also people called out her for staying silent in Ravi’s case|||we hate all awasarbadi brother. I hate her too, opportunistic women.|||What mistake are u referring to op? What was her mistake?|||Wrong move from her side should have waited for bit more.|||Mass doesn't have a brain.|||It is better for her now.

They support congress not only one individual.|||Politics has never been my thing, but something about her has always felt genuinely real.|||a lot of people disliked ravi during gen z protest but as soon as balen joined hands with him , lot of people stopped taking shit about rabi . a lot of people loved AND supported sumana  but as soon as balen sides with rsp , she becomes villain . ONE MAN'S STANCE IS SO STRONG THAT HE CAN SHIFT ENTIRE NARRATIVE UPSIDE DOWN .|||At least type properly!|||Noone hates her. Those blind supporter hate her.|||Her mistake was failing to recognize that most of the Nepali population lives with a memory of a goldfish.. She thought Ravi would struggle to make a strong comeback after the Jailbreak, but dumb fools of Nepal have allowed even Oli to strengthen his footing, Ravi was obviously going to come back. She is among the best, if not the best, legislators Nepal has ever seen and we may never see her again there. It is the curse we will live with.   But she was too good for RSP. That party didn't stand up for her when she was literally harassed and called names by pea brained people and even some MPs for THE CLOTHES SHE WAS WEARING. She is 'the one that got away'. This makes me extremely sad, but the general philosophy of politics says that societies never get a ideal leader and she is an example for it.   And Gagan and his pathetic brand of politics can never come close to her. Sumana is what Gagan always said he wanted to be but didn't have the balls for. He might be a party leader now, and might even end up at PM's post at some point, but all his successes will amount to nothing compared to the concessions he has made over 20 years that allowed the old guard to loot the country. Sumana is what happens when Gagans are not hypocrite and have the bravery to walk the talk.|||She still stands by her decision because she know who Rabi is. she isn’t like other member from rsp who suck up to rabi who we all know is a convicted criminal. I cannot fathom the way nowadays people think rabi is their hero and just disregard everything he has done. Including escaping from prison which triggered more than half of prisoners to escape. Congratulations people.  even if they win the elections nothings gonna change, they will support their own people(people who spent money for them) make laws for them and serve them not the people|||Where's she running from? And she really has become irrelevant now. I don't see any option for her outside of joining RSP.|||Sumana has always been right regarding her stance against Rabi Lamichhane. That MF has always been an opportunist and full of himself. He turned such a great team and party with full of potential party’s agenda all towards himself. Desh ma k k vayo yo bich ma, all agenda RaSwaPa carried along was to get Rabi out. Even nowadays, you can have a look at different election campaigns going around, including Manish Jha’s in Dhanusha, there are big posters and pictures of Rabi Lamichhane, but not the party’s. RaSwaPa and their supporters are now gradually moving towards the YeMaLe mindset. You can agree or disagree to it, but I am seeing doubtful future of RaSwaPa of they continue doing this. Only hope is Balen and his team, which have now infact given a chance to actually good personnels of RaSwaPa to shift their focus towards real agendas. Otherwise 5yrs samma majority government chalauxu vanne party ko only agenda chai Rabi ko mudda clear garnu ra purano party lai haraunu matra vanne hunu hudaina.|||yo bidesi sanga bihe garya bides ko nagarikta li sakya manche, ngo haru le push gareko, dubious past  gagane 20 + yrs active politics, republic re federalism ko revolution spearhead gareko student leader,samsad, minister, good popularity in public|||Because they don't have that good system to digest someone who has the potential to change things, but are more attracted to the ones who have masses and audience pull. Her leaving RSP is one of the major reasons the party is currently in a better state. If she didn't, the jam that was inside the party would have never gone free.

The feeling of my heart having faster and my stomach twisting like an eel holding it's prey is not new to me but still it's not wholly mine.   The feeling of lying in the bed with inherent thoughts of disperse happiness and the want to be able to understand if that happiness is as true as it seems is not new and it's also not wholly mine   I look at all these motion picture hoping to find something. And what that might be is as ananomus to me as it is to you. I look at these things, listen as they talk, but the existence of this feeling of watching doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm lying on this virgin earth, unmolested and untouched, devoid of any feeling of any sort except for one; consciousness. The consciousness reigns supreme within and without all within the vicinity of my existence.  At this point, life as you call it feels not a moments passing by or time flowing like my thoughts.  My head feels particularly heavy, as if I'm thinking but a thought is yet to process. But how can this be? Without a thought, how can you think? How can one live, without knowing the value of death? But that's not right either. For one to know the value of death,.one must first know of its qualities, it's feature in all it's dimensions. The inherent idea of a thought being, and to think not sounds stupid as if not funny enough. But you can't overlook the idea behind such ponder.   I take very long breaths as I think. My heart beats loud enough for me to hear it. And all my bodily functions seems very much obvious to me. This isn't new but it's not wholly mine.   Ahh now my head hurts a little to. But this shall too pass.   Theres this lingering feeling of solitude that I feel very sensationally. For solitude has been my friend far longer then any. The silence that made me feel alone after some years felt not pleasing but good enough to make me feel a bit stingy if it got disturbed.  But now this solitude engulfs me, strangles me so that I choke these thoughts out of me which are yet to be. But it was this very solitude that made me form a thought but now it want it back. Like how death waits right Infront of you, lingers above you with it's hands around neck, and then takes you through the stairs of lifelessness while you climb oblivious. Similar is the solitude that I experience right now, but instead of lifelessness, I climb and climb but towards nothing, I climb and climb but climb on empty thoughts.   My agitated muscles ache in the silence of my breath while my breath gets shorter and heavier each micro instant.",

My dad brought quite a few for me from KTM every few months, and I used to colour, solve crosswords etc. I event sent crossword solutions (never got published). This is where I knew about sudoku and still love sudoku to this day. I have read a lot of stories in this magazine and some of them  have been life changing for me. I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.  Few years later, through sheer luck (and a bit of reputation in my Nepali class), I got to be the guest editor of one edition of this magazine. Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र). I still absolutely vividly remember that letter, the paper, the handwriting, almost the content (almost 20 years later). The sender had found my information from the guest editor section.

I personally know someone who migrated illegally and their kids talking about how migration is bad and they are for denaturalization , oblivious to the fact that their parents moved there illegally.  Most Nepali living in US and Australia act like them the very month they enter the nation and they think that people in Nepal must not protest against the west as they fear that it might create  a problem for them.

The Trumpanzee Nepalis I know are like this:  - One has a severely disabled child. He doesn't like paying taxes. Of course, he got his college degree with taxpayer subsidized tuition, and his life would suck if his son's disability services were cut.  - One loser who noone would marry got his wife through arrange marriage, chain migrated his mom, got her qualified for benefits likely by falsifying employment history, hires the cheapest Central Americans to build his basement,  but is an America first, anti-immigration MAGA. He posted a few days ago that Musk is the man of the century, which happens to be a week after Musk retweeted a post supporting remigration (remigration is idea of sending all immigrants away regardless of their immigration status)  Sometimes, we think too much when we try to analyze the logic behind people like these two.

The same people who had arrived with suitcases full of hope now complained about overcrowding, about too many accents, about the country letting in “too many like us.” They wanted distance from the past they had escaped, forgetting how recently they themselves had stood on the other side of the door. Belonging, it seemed, came with the urge to guard the gate.”|||Never understood that mentality.

That said, Plenty of Nepali immigrants, their kids, etc. are pissed as hell about it and are pushing back in what capacity they can.

I am in US, and I can say 98% of my friends don’t support his policies. There are a few who do but there’s always an exception.   Now many, including myself, do support some level of checks and restrictions on immigration. Those who didn’t get in take that as being opportunistic or slamming the door after I got in. Far from it.   What I don’t support is people coming through illegal means. What I don’t support is people cheating and providing 100% false representation while applying. Then once they get in, they try to game the system and just be a leech sucking in the benefits without contributing. They are making it harder for the legitimate immigrants and that’s exactly what we hate.  Now I don’t support the current position of not granting any immigration visa indefinitely to Nepal. But you know why this happened? Because almost 40% of Nepalis, about 70-80k take welfare benefits from the US government. You don’t need it if you are a contributing member of the society (except for in some disability/age related case).   There are people coming to US to get free medical treatment. One performer got the treatment and left the Us without paying the medical bills- that person is now banned from coming. Another famous pair got the DV and justified their entry by saying they get free medical for their kid (their case may be legit, but I am just giving an example of what people have been doing).   The administration is going to the other extreme to curb this- but some of it is because the past administration didn’t do anything to prevent it from happening.|||I seriously doubt the accuracy of this sentiment. Nepalis who have settled in America invariably work to bring other family members here. The effort is long and hard, and many are still in process, meaning that spouses, siblings, and others are now cut off from coming over. My brother in-law was able to finally secure his wife's visa a few weeks ago, after working on it for 2 years.  a few weeks later and she wouldn't get to come, so no, Nepali uncles and aunties aren't supportive, and there is no indication that most nepalis voted for trump.  The other thing to consider is the message behind the visa suspensions.  The trump administration is basically saying that immigrants who have come here have not improved conditions, but rather they have made it worse by taking advantage of government programs that they are not entitled to. In other words immigrants are lazy, and thieves. Not a lot to take pride in about that.|||Let me know what you are smoking..seems like good stuff.|||Just like the viral trend chori manchey ko khutta tanney chori manchey naai huncha.

I've worked with Nepali people for years at my job, they work remotely from Kathmandu. I got the chance to visit Nepal this year and loved your country. Everyone is so nice, the food is great and there are so many interesting and beautiful places.   I was a little nervous since it was only a few weeks after the Gen Z protest, but everything seemed pretty calm. I thought to myself, wow it'd sure be cool if we could overthrow our government, get rid of trump and be back to normal in a few weeks.   The Nepali living in the us would not feel happy or safe if they lived in my city I guarantee it. Legal or not they're grabbing anyone off the street that isn't white and taking them to a detention center. If they can prove their residency they get released, maybe. It is completely white supremacist Nazi shit. It's horrible and I'm ashamed to be an American. These are my friends and neighbors, I don't ask people what their immigration status is, I could care less.   It's usually portrayed that undocumented immigrants are a drain on government services, but that is a lie. They pay taxes since it's automatically deducted from the paycheck to a social security number that doesn't belong to them. If they try to use the services they're caught and deported  We're fighting back but our leaders are ineffective, the police are working with ICE and if we call in the military we're unsure of whose side they'll take.   Trust me you don't want to visit the US anytime soon|||I am also very happy.|||Same reason you and others who are aspiring to migrate toUS are sad. Immigration is not good for lot of citizens. Higher housing prices, rent, more competition for jobs. Companies benefit from supply of cheap labor while workers suffer from depressed wages. There’s no need to portray this as some kind of good vs evil thing. Those guys are looking out for their own interests just like you are. No country is required to keep its borders open to outsiders.

Why would anyone be happy about the current situation ? All of you who agree with the statement are in Nepal who couldn’t make it to the US.|||May I dare present a different perspective?   Not everyone who votes Republican is \"hiding the ladder since they've made it\". That claim is lazy, false, and ignores basic economic reality.  Some of us vote based on numbers, not slogans. When you are paying over $100,000 a year in taxes (household)—income tax, state tax, property tax, sales tax—and you don’t see proportional benefits in return, fiscal policy starts to matter a lot. At that level, voting conservative isn’t ideological—it’s rational. Lower taxes, limited government, and accountability in spending simply align better with that reality.  Paying six figures into the system and being told you’re “privileged,” “selfish,” or morally inferior for questioning where that money goes is not persuasive—it’s alienating. Wanting to keep more of what you earn does not make you hateful. It makes you financially literate.  Many Republican voters reject racism and extremism outright. What they do reject is runaway taxation, bloated government, and being constantly generalized or morally lectured by people whose policies they fundamentally can’t relate to. The same way not all Democrats are extremists, not all Republicans are villains.  And yes—we are also tired of being lumped together with fringe elements just because we don’t align with extreme progressive ideology. Disagreeing with activist politics, identity absolutism, or ideological purity tests does not make someone anti-human. It means they prioritize practicality over performative outrage.  People vote based on lived experience. For households paying $100k+ in taxes every year, conservative policies often make more sense. That’s not hate. That’s math.",

Can you point to any concrete, policy-level achievements you delivered during your party’s time in government?  - What about Aftab Alam case during your party's government was he rightfully being prosecuted or your party's government have him impunity from jail, what about that case?",

Deuba, as an individual, may once have been a true leader—but over time, the gang culture around him is what turned everything rotten and made him look bhrasta.  From this point onward, Gagan is free.  Free from:  All blame linked to Arzu  All accusations about money in Deuba’s house  All baggage related to Bhutani saranarthi  All the kandas, Teramox, and backroom deals  All blame connected to Lekhaks and their networks  These were never Gagan’s sins to carry.  So why should he keep answering for other people’s cults? Why should a reformist voice be held hostage by the corruption, compromises, and power games of an old guard that refuses to let go?  If anyone needs to answer, it’s the system that protected those networks for decades—not the one who finally challenged them.  Gagan doesn’t need to answer anymore. The Mahadibesan already did.|||He can give you wai wai, not sure about answers.

Don't get me wrong there are shortcomings from him and nobody is perfect but most of the questions you raised here are poor attempt to make him look bad.  You have to realize that even though Gagan is a prominient member of Nepali Congress, he was never the executive. Every decision the party makes as a whole, the chairman (Deuba) has the supreme authority and he is little to no say in any of the decisions.  Even then, he has clearly spoken against all wrongdoings. And you say \"just speak\". But that's the problem of not being in executive power, he can only speak.  You trying to  make the money burnt in Deuba's house somehow a crime by Gagan Thapa clearly tells me that you are just trying to hate. Otherwise as everyone else has said, there is a special probe commission formed to specifically study the burnt money case and all we can do is wait for their report and the government will file the case if there is wrongdoing (which we all believe there is). And Gagan has clearly affirmed this, as any sane person would. You should read him and listen his many public interviews/videos and not just assume he didn't say anything.  He has clearly said multiple times that any and all involved in sahakari kanda should be investigated including naming people from his own party by name, again multiple times in multiple of his public appearences and writings, you should read/watch/listen those. The government should file cases. I don't understand how this would be his fault.  If you again watch his comments in good faith and listen to his parliament speeches, he as said multiple times that  the public is angry, they need delivery. He said he opposed the coalition and publicly opposed it multiple times. But he is not the executive, deuba is. When there is coaliation, he has the moral responsibility to make the government successful. He was indeed in the efficiency team and he said he tried is best to make the government successful because he knew people needed delivery even though he opposed the coalition. He publicly told long before the Gen-Z protest that he couldn't get the government to do what the efficiency team was supposed to do, and he left it. So I don't think that makes him culpable for the massacre during gen-z protest.  But still he has taken moral responsibility for what happened during the protest. He has apologized multiple times for any moral culpability he has. He said he immediately asked the party leadership to break coaliation in the first day of protest and asked Lekhak to resign. Lekhak did resign but the party didn't leave coalition because again Deuba is executive and makes the decision.  He has been parliament member four times. The first time and he failed to deliver the constitution as promised which he was elected for. The second tenure was again the CA election, which delivered the constitution and you can't deny he played crucial role in making the constitution, and he (among all others) delivered the constitution. The next term he went to the parliament again and became health minister and people say he delivered some reforms in health sector (again refer to public catalogues of his works during this tenure). And you have to grant that he has been constant voice in the parliament on various issues, which the MP is sent for. This last time was a short tenure, but as everyone he has played crucial role in voicing concerns in the parliament. Ironically he strongly demanded there be independent probe in sahakari case and there have been multiple arrests and cases filed against some major fraudsters. You should grant that this was successfull. But we can always demand more. I am not his prabakta but to me seems like he could have definitely done more here and I am sure he agrees.  Yeah what about the case? Alam was a proven convict. But congress did dirty by lobbying to release him. I haven't seen him support Alam's release. Again, I am not sure the details of his release but how is Gagan culpable for the crime Alam committed?  Again I am not his prabakta. I try to speak with reason. You could certainly question that he didn't do enough at policy level as MP to propose new laws and pass them. You could ask him that he could not do enough to break Deuba stronghold. But he precisely did that recently.  Now I am watching him closely, he is now in the position to deliver at least from his party level. Make him accountable ask him tough questions. But the aforementioned questions seemed more like an attempt to make him bad (except may be how many policy changed did he make in 1 1/2 tenure as MP except CA MP which they delivered constitution).

At home, my bags were 23 + 22 kg, and my carry-on was 20 kg.  At the check-in counter, the agent told me to move some items from my carry-on into one checked bag so I’d only have to pay excess for one bag. I did exactly that and reduced my carry-on to 12 kg.  Magically, after this:  •\tChecked bags became 32 kg and 25 kg    •\tCarry-on became 13 kg  Somehow, between weighing the bags at home, weighing them again at the counter, and then re-weighing them a third time, my bags gained weight out of nowhere.  I was exhausted and didn’t have the energy to argue, so they charged me for two excess bags — $80 each. No leeway, no consideration.  To make things worse, the agent openly suggested that if I paid cash and didn’t need a receipt, they could lower the price. At that point it was obvious they were trying to pocket the money. Absolutely shameless.  I paid by card, waited until they gave me a proper Turkish Airlines receipt, and made sure everything was legit.  If you’re flying Turkish Airlines out of Tribhuvan International Airport, I strongly suggest avoiding the chubby girl working at the Turkish Airlines check-in counter. She was incompetent from the start — struggling to even open the computer system and issue a boarding pass, while agents at nearby counters were processing passengers with ease.  Extremely bad service and blatant attempts at corruption. This kind of experience is one of the many reasons I seriously hesitate to visit Nepal anymore.",

Happened to me in airport outside nepal as well.  The main difference is that airport scales are \"trade-legal\" industrial devices required by law to be regularly calibrated for high precision, whereas home scales are consumer-grade gadgets that use cheaper sensors and are almost never recalibrated. Additionally, the environment distorts the numbers; weighing a bag on a soft home carpet or trying to balance a large suitcase on a small bathroom scale often creates a \"lighter\" reading than reality, unlike the airport's large, stable platforms embedded in hard concrete. Because of this, the airport scale is generally accurate, while your home scale is just an estimate that tends to drift.|||[removed]|||Are we allowed to video record our interactions there?

You are going through trauma bonding with him . Best solution is reporting to police as a civil citizen or initiate divorce on DV (domestic violence) but make sure you are backed up financially. Remember as a 3rd person we are suggesting you only based on what you have posted. And this is a clear case of Domestic violence which has been allowed by your emotional attachment with him.|||This is projection.  He's projecting his own cheating behaviour onto you. You said he goes for night outs as well, it's pretty obvious he cheats and when you are late, he automatically assumes you did the same.  Hire a private detective and make your case strong and confront him with evidence.  But if you're actually cheating, that's a completely different scenario.|||It seems like there is more to this story, we heard your side only.

And you have also said ma pani farkauthe ani maan santa parera basthe, if you make him deport or complain about it , it would be hypocrisy.  Either separate with him just never look his face back again or go to a couple therapist.  He have anger issues and he is patriarchal you both guys need therapy and a proper communication.

The next steps depend on what you want the outcome to be.   1. If you want mediation and your relationship to continue, have a serious discussion with your husband and let him know what the stakes are, either to work on the relationship together, or to end it. Couples therapy is also helpful for many. There's no point fighting forever. Has anyone else witness the violence, do you have kids? Does your husband drink? Does he have his own social life? Does he have any mental health issues? Many things factor. But a discussion with your husband should be your first thing to do and let him know boundaries and also reflect on yourself too.   2. If you want to end it, depends on where you are. Think through everything and then only decide. If you have kids or not. You need to contact a lawyer as well. What is your financial situation. Do you have any social support nearby as things can get stressful and messy.|||You work so it seems you're independent. Report him to the police.

This is 21st century to be that barbaric; it is normal to be jealous or to have fights as couple but it is never okay to raise hand against each other; and not many functional partners raise hand.   Having someone my close family member go through similar situation before, never believe that abusers will change, kukurko puchhar 12 barsa dhungro ma rakhne ukhan estai manxe lai banaeko ho. Assuming you are in 20s/30s, do you want to spend next 40 or so years of your life with such abuse?    Many people will try to convince you to stay and tell you that he will change but ask to yourself do you truly believe that?  Also you mentioned that “maile pani farkauthe”, if he hits you don’t hit back but report it to police (unless it is life threatening) and also talk to your parents/relatives/friends about it don’t bottle up till too late.  I know sometimes it is difficult to let go because of many reasons (eg. visa issues or money issues) but what if in the heat of the moment he hits you and you get a lifetime disability or even die; so for your own safety, i suggest to dump his ass.|||Leave before its too late|||Hi OP, garo huncha thulo decision lina divorce jastai.

Please find ways to get out from there..... Even if your parents don't support trust me and many others, this is not normal..... For the love of yourself, you should leave asap.|||I just realized you said tmle pani haat haltheu, hmmm.... If you both truly want to work it out.... Now I'm thinking about it after reading your comments that you really love him....   In that case, talk to him what is bothering him, if he has had lot of childhood trauma, stress, unprocessed emotions, it really does affect a person, they become like time bomb and a small trigger can make them very angry ..... Now note that I'm saying this in hopes that you both truly want to work it out..... Talk to him, let him know anger at this level is not normal and he can gently start a talk therapy or men's circles, or somatic healing sessions, emdr therapy (if it's a part trauma), etc. there are so many options in today's time to start a healing journey. I'm in full support for people to move this route, even if you are violent in the past. It's not easy being human and I get it. Please consider, I hope this helps. But please remember, if you are going to lead this journey for both of you, remember to be patient, kind, and loving. Sometimes you will have to let the other person be so angry and be able to watch them (it's a specific emotional release session) without you absorbing their emotions. For him, and for you too probably, when emotions come, you both have to remember it's NEVER about the other person. If you would like each other to do something, you can request but nobody is obliged to follow, just having this much boundary will help you both to process your emotions on your own. Start therapy or just start writing on your own, you will notice you stress or anger is often coming from something else within yourself, not from people around you.   I hope this help a little bit. Take care, pass love to each other. If it's easier, bring serious talk when you are getting romantic, I think that helps you both absorb and understand better. Take care please. It's not impossible to change yourself and your relationships in this time, especially with so much options, start meditation, therapy, dance, especially moving body helps move your emotions too. Take care.|||Just have a conversation with your husband. Ask him why is he is acting like that? IS he insecure about you or what? make everything clear. Why is he acting in that manner? Also, clearly state what you feel about his behaviour. You both will get a chance to understand each other. Make sure he is not going to do it again or what you think will be better.

Sadly, no culture of constructive criticism in Nepal.|||I am satisfied with his work because I know it’s not easy. The system itself is messed up, so obviously one person alone can’t fix everything on their own. There will be tons of hurdles, especially in the capital city of the country. Not just the capital, honestly, you can even say Kathmandu as Nepal itself, because it has become the center for everything. No matter what work you have, you somehow have to come to Kathmandu for it. So yeah, I understand his situation.  The one thing I really criticize him for is his lack of communication. That is something I am very disappointed about. During his entire campaign, he kept saying that he wouldn’t be like previous mayors and that he would stay in constant communication with the public. But after winning, he almost completely stopped connecting with people. There is no proper accountability, just one-sided Facebook status updates. This is the part where I am extremely disappointed in him and openly criticize him.  Other than that, I think he has actually shown that work can be done.

Its gonna take more than 10 years to build this nation if everything goes correctly in a rapid pace. Yeah he is not a saint nor is he a saviour.

Are we going to blame RSP already before their work because of our PTSD and keep on supporting the old guards who have done zero, nothing, nada? If we still think, we will develop, then why not vote for the new gen? If we dont think Nepal as a country will never develop, why not trust new gen? Imo, the choice is simple. The fucking tyranny KP oli and these other netas have done should not be supported and anybody who supports them are oppressor themselves. There's no doubt about it.

When it comes to his family, his wife or his daughter, he is always ready to betray anyone even the country. We all know well that it can be used as a weapon by westerns to control him and the country that we Nepalese are about to give in his hand.   Being a voter of KMC i can see a lot of changes in the city after Balen came as a mayor but when i saw same changes in every big cities of Nepal. It didn’t took me long to understand that he was just overhyped.   After he joined RSP where each members are opportunistic and work in Nepal for western interests it’s clear that he is not good candidate for prime minister.  He was voted to serve as a mayor, He could have waited until next election but for him misusing people’s trust and make them go against government by burning the Nation was easiest way to experience power.

The content is rarely original. It is compiled from existing news articles that anyone could find doing Google. It’s a summary service, not investigative journalism.  2. As it relies on secondary sources, it never goes deep. It stays on the surface of issues, prioritizing smooth editing over raw facts.  3. The channel’s main narrative is simple: 'The country is doomed.' This is a lazy narrative. Telling us that politicians are bad or the system is broken is stating the obvious. It validates anger but offers no insight.  If you want to be entertained, it works. But if you want to be informed, this is a waste of time.",

But motivation usually comes from showing the path, not just the end result. A screenshot shows where you landed, not how you got there.  People here asked genuine questions about niche, stack, timeline, experience, etc because that’s the part that actually helps others move in that direction. That’s where the value would have been. Without that context, the post ends up reading more like a soft flex than mentorship. Nothing wrong with flexing, just don’t call it motivation if you’re not giving people anything they can learn from or replicate.  With 5+ years of experience you’ve seen enough of the field to know that the “how” matters more than the “what,” especially for people in Nepal who are trying to break into the global market.

Sure, it is not realistic to overlook the economy or the job scarcity that is so prevalant now, maybe for the longest time yet but it doesn't adjucate to the premise of Software Engineering isn't feasible as a career anymore, at least to the degree people are making it out to be. AI-driven development may very well be a 'bubble', and when it pops and the dust settles, the next big thing will provoke a similar reaction. While it is evident that people with years of experience are at a loss right now, and even more so for students trying to make it in tech, undergrads or young aspirants.  I believe it was never about how greatly any technology overshadows the current technology even if it transforms areas of it by overwhelming amounts but the ability to use it to your advantage. That is how you thrive here. You embrace, and not reject. AI cannot replace engineering but it does accelerate aspects of it that if you don't keep up, you get left behind. I mean, with AI-driven development so rampant right now, startups are at an all time high. People adapt and make it work. That mindset is obligatory now more than ever.

You will be adding more skills as you go, as your project requires it.   Yes its a challenging job but so are other jobs. If you enjoy learning/working in this field then its good for you else people can and should look for other carrier option. Do what feels natural to you.   Regarding AI, its here to stay wear we like it ir not. We don't need to me AI/ML experts we just have to learn how to use it, or embrace it, and not reject it.

            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

If I have the time, I might join if I'm free. If they were inviting Harvard professors, it'd cost you 10x more to attend. Events take time and effort. Many costs. Let's switch the focus to you. Have you organized an event? Was it easy? Who did you invite as a speaker?   If you're a student, why care about an enterprise AI event? I fail to see your criticisms. Not everybody needs to start a business to prove their credibility. It literally takes <20k.  I don't expect them to cover hf peft best practices. It's an event for enterprises. I don't have expectations for food. If I meet somebody interesting, that's good enough for me.  I think you're being confused between training courses and networking events. Plenty of events if you want to learn. ANAIS, NAAMII charged 12k for students this year. Was fine. Good stuff. Made many friends.  I dislike AI non-profits that claim to do research and fail to have any publications or research projects, yet say they're open to collaborations. But the AI association isn't a research body, probably does just events. Executives don't open up VS code and grind all day. That's a very small minority. They're skilled, just not in a way that appeals to you. They bring in investors, organize events, lots of things. If you ask me, there's a lot more to a product than PRs and merges. If you're not already the Lead for some MNC, some humility helps. It's dumb to say a CEO doesn't have skills because they don't code like you do, don't you think?  I'm not affiliated with naamii or any non-profits.|||On one hand, I can see the low effort poster with multiple mistakes and the fluffy pointless nonsense that is the main paragraph probably written by ChatGPT with a 6 word prompt. There's no mention of the \"Experts\" that are supposed to lead the thing.  On the other hand, your post has offered no genuine criticism of the event. It is just as pointless as the poster. Maybe offer anecdotes? Some tangible verifiable reason to justify your \"nrs 350 for 2.5 hours is a massive waste\".  Organizing an event comes with some cost, and some of that must be passed to the visitor. NRS 350 is some money, it is definitely not a lot of money. It is most definitely not \"expensive\" for an event in any sense of the word.   Justify your claims. Why is this a \"scam\"? What other way can a person \"use nrs 350 to learn by yourself\" (your words)? Who are the speakers and why are they unqualified to speak on this program?  *disclaimer: not affilaited to this org or event*, *just a random angry redditor*",

After +2, I applied to Canada and the USA for further studies, but my visa got rejected. Instead of wasting a year, I joined BBS , and now I’m in my 3rd year.  When the visa didn’t work out, I decided to take responsibility for my own future. I started learning about AI, automation, and new technologies. Over time, I picked up practical skills, experimented a lot, and eventually started freelancing. Right now, I work as an AI Developer on Upwork, and even in the early stage, I’m earning more than 1 lakh NPR per month.  I’m not an expert and I still have a lot to learn but I know my strengths. I’m good at managing things, people, sales, content, and marketing, and I can execute fast. I have learned most of this by consuming real-world information online and applying it through actual work.  I have big plans in the AI space, but I also know that building something great alone is very difficult. That’s why I am looking for a technical co-founder, someone strong on the engineering side so we can build, learn, and grow together.  The idea is to:  * Start very small and lean * No heavy investment * Focus on AI services / automation / agency-style work * Only basic costs like hosting or APIs * Aim to generate revenue within 2–3 months  I currently live with my parents in Butwal, but I want to move to Kathmandu, take a small flat, and fully focus on building. I also plan to start creating content alongside the business.  I’m looking for someone who:  * Is disciplined and focused * Serious about long-term growth * Not into unhealthy habits * Wants a simple lifestyle with deep work * Has strong technical skills or is deeply committed to developing them  Most importantly, I want a co-founder who understands that things won’t always work. There will be hard times, failures, and uncertainty. During those phases, we should push and motivate each other, stay consistent, and keep moving forward. Even if something fails, we should come out smarter, stronger, and more experienced than before.  We don’t need much money to start just enough for basic living expenses. I have savings that allow me to manage accommodation and food for a long time, and I strongly believe we can make this sustainable within a few months.  The goal is simple:   Live together. Build together. Learn together. Grow together.  If you’re technically strong, disciplined, and serious about building a real AI business from Nepal, let’s connect.",

They essentially said that unless I have a certificate specifically stating that my course is equivalent to Computer Engineering, there’s no point in continuing. (They suggested I should show up for the bearing and physical tests, but couldn’t confirm whether I’d even get the opportunity. So, I decided to drop out of that path.)  Now, after seeing the NEA vacancy announcement, I noticed they also specifically require a Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering. Are there any Government Institutions in Nepal that would recognize my degree as eligible for such positions?",

This has now gotten out of hand, and this type of behavior will surely spread to other tourist areas, especially those closer to the border like Sauraha and others. I have seen these 'tourists' in Thars and other SUVs riding recklessly on our highways, mocking our rules and laws. In my local area in the Terai, there have been a couple of incidents where such SUVs have hit locals, including traffic police, and fled to India.  Let's continue to do what we can from our end - I have reported the videos and his channel, and let's keep reporting those videos wherever we find them, and from any other Indian 'YouTubers'. Influencers from Pokhara need to raise their voices collectively on other popular social media channels like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Local influencers need to unite and raise this issue from their platforms in their individual capacities. Otherwise, we might be just one incident away from breaking news.  I will share this thread with a popular Indian YouTube journalist-The Deshbhakt. I have been following him, and he has made videos on such stupidity by Indian tourists. I will leave his Instagram link here so that everyone with evidence can share information.

Till now RSP leaders are advocating Balen as representative of Madesh who will become PM. Take any interview of either RSP people or influencer they are just saying that Madesh bata ni PM aaunxa vanera. And everyone knows it is because of high vote share madesh have, and they want to capitalize it. Even beside Balen today every other RSP leader mostly focused on the state matter of Madesh rather than the whole of Nepal, so it is evident that they want to capture proportional candidate vote as much as they can. Every party has some way to approach the election and RSP is following this way.|||Yeti ta garnai paro ni PM huna painxa vane.|||हर हर बालेन, घर घर बालेन !|||KTM ko mayor bhako 3 years bhayecha.. 50% total expense every year...

My nephew, **Liam Thapa**, is battling **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)**.  It is a rare, cruel genetic disease that causes muscles to waste away. Without intervention, boys with DMD lose the ability to walk by their early teens, and many don’t survive past their 20s.  But, there is a ray of hope: A one-time **Gene Therapy (Elevidys)** that can stop this progression. But the cost is a staggering **$2.9 Million USD**.  I am posting from a business Reddit ID to maintain total transparency and accountability.  Yes, we know $2.9M sounds impossible, but we are fighting for every cent.  * Total Goal: **$2.9 Million USD** * Cost in Nepalese Rupees: **Approx. रु 41,92,00,000 (41.92 Crore NPR)** * Raised so far: **$85909** * Remaining: **$2814091**  Liam is nearly 4. This therapy is most effective the earlier it is given. We are racing against time and biological markers that could disqualify him if we wait too long.

DMD is heartbreaking, and I genuinely hope he gets the care he needs 🙏  Just sharing information for awareness (not to diminish the importance of Elevidys): there are FDA-approved medications available for DMD today that can slow progression and improve outcomes, depending on the child’s mutation and age. These include corticosteroids (like deflazacort or vamorolone), exon-skipping therapies (for specific mutations), and non-steroidal options like givinostat, in addition to gene therapy.  Of course, treatment choice depends on genetic testing, eligibility criteria, and specialist guidance, and early intervention is critical, which I understand is why Elevidys is being pursued.  Posting this only so families reading this thread know there are multiple therapeutic pathways worth discussing with a neuromuscular specialist. Wishing Liam strength, access, and support and hoping this campaign reaches the right hands. 🤍|||.|||42 crore to save just one life is simply not worth it.

The one in the image is just made to uphold one's agenda.|||Heritage is history, not an achievement. I respect it, but I won’t wear it as a medal. Be proud of what you do, not what you inherit.|||castism pride is lame tbh. sabei ko thoughts cultural perspective le back gareko hunxa. rather explore, read books and take what you can from each other in a good way.|||When someone doesntt have personal accomplishments to be proud of, they start defining themselves by a group instead. That’s why they get so sensitive about it. if you criticize that identity, it feels like you’re tearing down the only thing they have to hold onto. Thats also why you see so many extremists in religion, nationalism, or whatever. They’re usually people who haven’t accomplished much personally. The group identity becomes their entire sense of worth so they defend it like their life depends on it.|||Or geographically feature. #LandofEverest|||Last refuge of a person without wealth/achievements is caste|||😆🤣 this isnt his quote lmao|||![gif](giphy|Jir7AUookJHIVb5aYM)|||Big 2026/83 and we're still dealing with this caste system thing|||It is global phenomenon to be honest .

When someone says \"I am proud to be Nepali.\" You say there is nothing that the person did.   You don't say the same thing when someone says \"I am proud of my dad.\"   It is just positive gesture toward something they are attached to.  It is okay to be attached to your tribe and group.. But just as long as you are not putting other people down.|||Your caste and ethnicity influences the thinking|||All of them have rampant hate against each other. But somehow bahun are the only victim of hate according to the subs here:⁠-⁠):⁠-⁠):⁠-⁠)|||That also applies for nationalism, and i haven't seen a single person who is proud of being a bahaun/chettri/rai/magar|||This is a difference that Bahun, Chhetri people do not understand.  There is a huge difference between people saying \"I am proud to be a Brahmin\" vs. \"I am proud to be a Newar\", for example.  Brahmin represents a 3000 year old history of supremacy over others based on birth. It represents what it means to be supposedly superior based on caste, purity, lineage. It represents the root evil of our society that treats your own fellow human beings as untouchable. A society with a Brahmin will automatically have a Shudra too. That is what the 4 Hindu varnavyastha is. What Nepali Bahuns also don't realize is Brahmin, Chhetri - these varna identities are there everywhere in Indian societis too - from Kashmir down to Kerala - every Indian state, community, region has their own Brahmin and Chhetri. So calling yourself a proud Brahmin gives you absolutely no unique identity except your association as a self-superior caste.  Whereas calling yourself a Newar is not based on caste, but a linguistic identity. The notion of caste (and hence superiority-inferiority, pure-impure, higher-lower) automatically disappears when you identify based on the language you speak. You must be aware within Newars there are Hindu Brahmins (Rajopadhyayas), Kshatriyas (Malla, Pradhan, Rajbhandari, etc.) down to a whole range of Vaishyas and Shudras. But when these diverse caste groups identify singularly based on the language they speak (Nepalbhasha/Newar), the identity becomes secular. Your identity based on varna/caste slowly starts to fade off. This is exactly what happened among Newars as most non-Newars will be shocked to find out Brahmins, Kshatriyas even exist among Newars. This is exactly what Indian societies do too. For a majority of Indian people (especially young, educated, urban), their linguistic identity trumps caste identity, hence they identify as Kashmiri, Haryanvi, Bihari, Bengali, Tamilian, Maharastrian, Gujarati, etc. which are all their linguistic identity.  Of course identifying through language does not solve the root of the evil. That is always there. But at least it will be a step in the right direction.|||Magar, Brahmin haru ta tha vayena but yo rai , limbu, Kirat in general have become so full of themselves, they want a KIRAT PRADESSSH Arey.

But still people drag me in all their rasicm stuff, uff..|||It is not about proud , protecting what you inherited in such way where everyone can be happy.|||All are dumb fucks|||Don't like proud people.pride = ignorance+arrogance|||I’ve been thinking about how religion and power were connected in ancient societies, especially in South Asia and Nepal. Many kings tied themselves to religion and caste systems, which also helped them control and organize people. When society is divided into groups, it becomes harder for people to unite, which benefits those in power. So I wonder was religion only about belief, or was it also shaped to maintain authority and hierarchy? If you agree that religion has been used as a tool for control in history, raise your hand. Btw mah ne xetre nae ho.|||when you are Nepali this is ridiculous thing to be pride on. we are prideful of multi ethnicity not just a ethnic.|||Absolutely, this happens when people have only one identity; just like religion.|||Those are casts, not ethnicities|||the thing is the people’s representatives are using these methods in nepal 🫩|||I thik it's true for genders too|||When a man has nth left to eat, he bites the furnitures. a man always needs sth to eat.|||Is there caste discrimination going on ?

The feeling of lying in the bed with inherent thoughts of disperse happiness and the want to be able to understand if that happiness is as true as it seems is not new and it's also not wholly mine   I look at all these motion picture hoping to find something. And what that might be is as ananomus to me as it is to you. I look at these things, listen as they talk, but the existence of this feeling of watching doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm lying on this virgin earth, unmolested and untouched, devoid of any feeling of any sort except for one; consciousness. The consciousness reigns supreme within and without all within the vicinity of my existence.  At this point, life as you call it feels not a moments passing by or time flowing like my thoughts.  My head feels particularly heavy, as if I'm thinking but a thought is yet to process. But how can this be? Without a thought, how can you think? How can one live, without knowing the value of death? But that's not right either. For one to know the value of death,.one must first know of its qualities, it's feature in all it's dimensions. The inherent idea of a thought being, and to think not sounds stupid as if not funny enough. But you can't overlook the idea behind such ponder.   I take very long breaths as I think. My heart beats loud enough for me to hear it. And all my bodily functions seems very much obvious to me. This isn't new but it's not wholly mine.   Ahh now my head hurts a little to. But this shall too pass.   Theres this lingering feeling of solitude that I feel very sensationally. For solitude has been my friend far longer then any. The silence that made me feel alone after some years felt not pleasing but good enough to make me feel a bit stingy if it got disturbed.  But now this solitude engulfs me, strangles me so that I choke these thoughts out of me which are yet to be. But it was this very solitude that made me form a thought but now it want it back. Like how death waits right Infront of you, lingers above you with it's hands around neck, and then takes you through the stairs of lifelessness while you climb oblivious. Similar is the solitude that I experience right now, but instead of lifelessness, I climb and climb but towards nothing, I climb and climb but climb on empty thoughts.

He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

My dad brought quite a few for me from KTM every few months, and I used to colour, solve crosswords etc. I event sent crossword solutions (never got published). This is where I knew about sudoku and still love sudoku to this day. I have read a lot of stories in this magazine and some of them  have been life changing for me. I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.  Few years later, through sheer luck (and a bit of reputation in my Nepali class), I got to be the guest editor of one edition of this magazine. Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र). I still absolutely vividly remember that letter, the paper, the handwriting, almost the content (almost 20 years later). The sender had found my information from the guest editor section. We had a few exchanges through postmail.  https://preview.redd.it/tfj91e7zb1dg1.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=129a8de5a073704752f011cebed54e0499c69c11|||Muna, Sunkesra, and kopila defined my childhood.

Now many, including myself, do support some level of checks and restrictions on immigration. Those who didn’t get in take that as being opportunistic or slamming the door after I got in. Far from it.   What I don’t support is people coming through illegal means. What I don’t support is people cheating and providing 100% false representation while applying. Then once they get in, they try to game the system and just be a leech sucking in the benefits without contributing. They are making it harder for the legitimate immigrants and that’s exactly what we hate.  Now I don’t support the current position of not granting any immigration visa indefinitely to Nepal. But you know why this happened? Because almost 40% of Nepalis, about 70-80k take welfare benefits from the US government. You don’t need it if you are a contributing member of the society (except for in some disability/age related case).   There are people coming to US to get free medical treatment. One performer got the treatment and left the Us without paying the medical bills- that person is now banned from coming. Another famous pair got the DV and justified their entry by saying they get free medical for their kid (their case may be legit, but I am just giving an example of what people have been doing).   The administration is going to the other extreme to curb this- but some of it is because the past administration didn’t do anything to prevent it from happening.|||I seriously doubt the accuracy of this sentiment. Nepalis who have settled in America invariably work to bring other family members here.

My brother in-law was able to finally secure his wife's visa a few weeks ago, after working on it for 2 years.  a few weeks later and she wouldn't get to come, so no, Nepali uncles and aunties aren't supportive, and there is no indication that most nepalis voted for trump.  The other thing to consider is the message behind the visa suspensions.  The trump administration is basically saying that immigrants who have come here have not improved conditions, but rather they have made it worse by taking advantage of government programs that they are not entitled to. In other words immigrants are lazy, and thieves. Not a lot to take pride in about that.|||Let me know what you are smoking..seems like good stuff.|||Just like the viral trend chori manchey ko khutta tanney chori manchey naai huncha.

They pay taxes since it's automatically deducted from the paycheck to a social security number that doesn't belong to them. If they try to use the services they're caught and deported  We're fighting back but our leaders are ineffective, the police are working with ICE and if we call in the military we're unsure of whose side they'll take.

Not everyone who votes Republican is \"hiding the ladder since they've made it\". That claim is lazy, false, and ignores basic economic reality.  Some of us vote based on numbers, not slogans. When you are paying over $100,000 a year in taxes (household)—income tax, state tax, property tax, sales tax—and you don’t see proportional benefits in return, fiscal policy starts to matter a lot. At that level, voting conservative isn’t ideological—it’s rational. Lower taxes, limited government, and accountability in spending simply align better with that reality.  Paying six figures into the system and being told you’re “privileged,” “selfish,” or morally inferior for questioning where that money goes is not persuasive—it’s alienating. Wanting to keep more of what you earn does not make you hateful. It makes you financially literate.  Many Republican voters reject racism and extremism outright. What they do reject is runaway taxation, bloated government, and being constantly generalized or morally lectured by people whose policies they fundamentally can’t relate to. The same way not all Democrats are extremists, not all Republicans are villains.  And yes—we are also tired of being lumped together with fringe elements just because we don’t align with extreme progressive ideology. Disagreeing with activist politics, identity absolutism, or ideological purity tests does not make someone anti-human. It means they prioritize practicality over performative outrage.  People vote based on lived experience. For households paying $100k+ in taxes every year, conservative policies often make more sense. That’s not hate. That’s math.",

Do not ever compare human life against any short of building.   Building can be recreated or rebuilt. Can you recreate those innocent lives ?? Precedent has to be set that if you ever kill innocent people, consequences are inevitable.   And hate to see people preaching about businesses and job like they care.  Why the fuck import based economy who is fully dependent on remittances talking about job ?  Job in kantipur ? Job in bhatbhateni ?  These are blood sucking insects , Have you checked bhatbhateni business model ? Whole atmadaha in front of BICC was bcuz of bhatbhateni not paying money.   Even if they leave someone will come up to replace them.   Get your life together and find some kindness towards lost lives.|||Destruction is not an competition|||At least we are not as extremist as the dutch.   They shot their PM, mutilated the PM and his brother's body. Then they strung it up on a gibbet and cooked and ate their livers.|||I don't feel any sympathy for these conry capitalist and their political overlords, with their illegal building made from ill-gotten gains. These businesses have been involved in tax evasion, quid pro quo, illegal construction, land grab scams, corruption, and lord knows what else. I actually feel really sad that our public properties and institutions got torched along with millions of documents. Whatever happened shouldn't have happened. It was very unfortunate. But let's not sympathize with these cronies and corrupt politicians. For decades, the real victims have been the everyday citizens of our country. Our Parliament, the Supreme Court, and Singha Durbar getting burned down is a bigger tragedy than some 5-star hotel or supermarket chain. We have been screwed over by these politicians and their business counterparts for so long that on that day, the entire country became a rage room. Extreme events were a result of us getting pushed to the extremes after decades of built-up anger, frustration, and fatally shooting our fellow school and college-going citizens by our own government.|||I think OP forgets the fact that on September 8th ... Videos and photos of kids with their brains splattered on the road were on full display... These kids of schools and colleges had no fault other than practising their constitution given right to protest peacefully..  and yet our security system deemed it right to kill these students .. through closed gates.. not one rubber bullet was fired not a single one. And these were live ammunitions... videos of cops giving the middle finger after shooting and terrorising the shops till 9-10 o'clock at night  were circulating .. What happened on September 9th was a reaction to that. Yes heavy damages were done and many anarchists got the chance to create chaos on September 9th.. but only an idiot would compare this event which was completely reactionary .. to the on going protests and acts of violence going on in Bangladesh in the name of religion without any proof .. these acts of violence in Bangladesh is not reactionary . It is targeted by a mob of illitrate extremists..|||23 ko tyo frustration niskya ho tara 24 ma|||As far as I understand what happened in Bangladesh was religion war in false accusations.    What happened in Nepal was class war and we knew it.

Most south asian countries are poor and underdeveloped, that shouldnt be where we set the standard for ourselves.|||I think i can perhaps contribute a slightly different perspective here. I don’t think Nepali youth burning down this hotel or Bangladeshi youth burning down/breaking during the uprising in both countries have anything to do with extremism or religion for that matter. When you are going to protest against a bad government, practically I don’t think anyone have religion, race, color or anything of that sort in the back of their mind, the adrenaline is so high you are only focused on one thing.   During protests, when you see protesters burning down or breaking down anything, it is usually because that structure represent something significant. I know a lot of structures were burned, broken because they represented the tyranny under fascism. A significant driver behind Nepali uprising was corruption from what I understand, and I’m pretty sure this hotel was owned/majority stakeholder by some Nepali politicians, if so, then I see them burning a symbol of rampant corruption rather than a hotel.  That’s their perspective I suppose, nonetheless, I think it’s foolish to do things like this, and I’m sure some of them will look back and realize maybe it was foolish.|||You witnessed a freaking big-ass revolution, not some child-play games.

Even from those people who are asking about those incidents now, some were resigning from their political parties, some were posting their dissatisfaction in social media.   And this is a society if you have civic sense doesn't mean everyone has. Some people will always try to find a way to vandalize and that day it was a great opportunity for them because the state was without a government and no chain of commands.

            "body": "It’s 2026 now, and we’re still having to deal with this.  A few days ago, early in the morning, I was on the street and saw a public bus with people literally hanging from the door. It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this. This issue really needs more attention and more noise.|||KTM has enough budget with 40 percent going unused. these transportation comes under metropolitan ko authority. ask Mayor balen.

Your party member Ramesh Lekhak was also the Home Minister at that time—have you questioned him about this?  - You have been a Member of Parliament four times, and during your tenure, the Congress has formed the government multiple times. Can you point to any concrete, policy-level achievements you delivered during your party’s time in government?  - What about Aftab Alam case during your party's government was he rightfully being prosecuted or your party's government have him impunity from jail, what about that case?",

Deuba, as an individual, may once have been a true leader—but over time, the gang culture around him is what turned everything rotten and made him look bhrasta.  From this point onward, Gagan is free.  Free from:  All blame linked to Arzu  All accusations about money in Deuba’s house  All baggage related to Bhutani saranarthi  All the kandas, Teramox, and backroom deals  All blame connected to Lekhaks and their networks  These were never Gagan’s sins to carry.  So why should he keep answering for other people’s cults? Why should a reformist voice be held hostage by the corruption, compromises, and power games of an old guard that refuses to let go?  If anyone needs to answer, it’s the system that protected those networks for decades—not the one who finally challenged them.  Gagan doesn’t need to answer anymore. The Mahadibesan already did.|||He can give you wai wai, not sure about answers.

Don't get me wrong there are shortcomings from him and nobody is perfect but most of the questions you raised here are poor attempt to make him look bad.  You have to realize that even though Gagan is a prominient member of Nepali Congress, he was never the executive. Every decision the party makes as a whole, the chairman (Deuba) has the supreme authority and he is little to no say in any of the decisions.  Even then, he has clearly spoken against all wrongdoings. And you say \"just speak\". But that's the problem of not being in executive power, he can only speak.  You trying to  make the money burnt in Deuba's house somehow a crime by Gagan Thapa clearly tells me that you are just trying to hate. Otherwise as everyone else has said, there is a special probe commission formed to specifically study the burnt money case and all we can do is wait for their report and the government will file the case if there is wrongdoing (which we all believe there is). And Gagan has clearly affirmed this, as any sane person would. You should read him and listen his many public interviews/videos and not just assume he didn't say anything.  He has clearly said multiple times that any and all involved in sahakari kanda should be investigated including naming people from his own party by name, again multiple times in multiple of his public appearences and writings, you should read/watch/listen those. The government should file cases. I don't understand how this would be his fault.  If you again watch his comments in good faith and listen to his parliament speeches, he as said multiple times that  the public is angry, they need delivery. He said he opposed the coalition and publicly opposed it multiple times. But he is not the executive, deuba is. When there is coaliation, he has the moral responsibility to make the government successful. He was indeed in the efficiency team and he said he tried is best to make the government successful because he knew people needed delivery even though he opposed the coalition. He publicly told long before the Gen-Z protest that he couldn't get the government to do what the efficiency team was supposed to do, and he left it. So I don't think that makes him culpable for the massacre during gen-z protest.  But still he has taken moral responsibility for what happened during the protest. He has apologized multiple times for any moral culpability he has. He said he immediately asked the party leadership to break coaliation in the first day of protest and asked Lekhak to resign. Lekhak did resign but the party didn't leave coalition because again Deuba is executive and makes the decision.  He has been parliament member four times. The first time and he failed to deliver the constitution as promised which he was elected for. The second tenure was again the CA election, which delivered the constitution and you can't deny he played crucial role in making the constitution, and he (among all others) delivered the constitution. The next term he went to the parliament again and became health minister and people say he delivered some reforms in health sector (again refer to public catalogues of his works during this tenure). And you have to grant that he has been constant voice in the parliament on various issues, which the MP is sent for. This last time was a short tenure, but as everyone he has played crucial role in voicing concerns in the parliament. Ironically he strongly demanded there be independent probe in sahakari case and there have been multiple arrests and cases filed against some major fraudsters. You should grant that this was successfull. But we can always demand more. I am not his prabakta but to me seems like he could have definitely done more here and I am sure he agrees.  Yeah what about the case? Alam was a proven convict. But congress did dirty by lobbying to release him. I haven't seen him support Alam's release. Again, I am not sure the details of his release but how is Gagan culpable for the crime Alam committed?  Again I am not his prabakta. I try to speak with reason. You could certainly question that he didn't do enough at policy level as MP to propose new laws and pass them. You could ask him that he could not do enough to break Deuba stronghold. But he precisely did that recently.  Now I am watching him closely, he is now in the position to deliver at least from his party level. Make him accountable ask him tough questions. But the aforementioned questions seemed more like an attempt to make him bad (except may be how many policy changed did he make in 1 1/2 tenure as MP except CA MP which they delivered constitution).

At home, my bags were 23 + 22 kg, and my carry-on was 20 kg.  At the check-in counter, the agent told me to move some items from my carry-on into one checked bag so I’d only have to pay excess for one bag. I did exactly that and reduced my carry-on to 12 kg.  Magically, after this:  •\tChecked bags became 32 kg and 25 kg    •\tCarry-on became 13 kg  Somehow, between weighing the bags at home, weighing them again at the counter, and then re-weighing them a third time, my bags gained weight out of nowhere.  I was exhausted and didn’t have the energy to argue, so they charged me for two excess bags — $80 each. No leeway, no consideration.  To make things worse, the agent openly suggested that if I paid cash and didn’t need a receipt, they could lower the price. At that point it was obvious they were trying to pocket the money. Absolutely shameless.  I paid by card, waited until they gave me a proper Turkish Airlines receipt, and made sure everything was legit.  If you’re flying Turkish Airlines out of Tribhuvan International Airport, I strongly suggest avoiding the chubby girl working at the Turkish Airlines check-in counter. She was incompetent from the start — struggling to even open the computer system and issue a boarding pass, while agents at nearby counters were processing passengers with ease.  Extremely bad service and blatant attempts at corruption. This kind of experience is one of the many reasons I seriously hesitate to visit Nepal anymore.",

Happened to me in airport outside nepal as well.  The main difference is that airport scales are \"trade-legal\" industrial devices required by law to be regularly calibrated for high precision, whereas home scales are consumer-grade gadgets that use cheaper sensors and are almost never recalibrated. Additionally, the environment distorts the numbers; weighing a bag on a soft home carpet or trying to balance a large suitcase on a small bathroom scale often creates a \"lighter\" reading than reality, unlike the airport's large, stable platforms embedded in hard concrete. Because of this, the airport scale is generally accurate, while your home scale is just an estimate that tends to drift.|||[removed]|||Are we allowed to video record our interactions there?

On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP.

We can advocate for legal reforms to ensure excessive security isn't granted to those without genuine threats or controversies. However, for the sake of national security and peace, such measures remain essential for VVIPs. Whether we like them or not, an attack on a high profile figure can disrupt our national peace and damage our international reputation for years to come.  ​We can never be certain who might be planning an attack on a VVIP or for what purpose. These individuals hold their status for a reason, and they will have followers regardless of whether we perceive their character as good or bad. There will always be those who fight for their \"masters\" or those who have something to gain from these VVIPs, for them, personal interests and loyalty will always take priority over the country’s wellbeing. If an attack occurs, our country’s stability can derail overnight and Western media and racists in west love to make fun of \"third world countries\" to feel superior regardless of fact that they have been through worse. The global protocols built over centuries of human experience teach us that it is not worth risking national peace over the minor, occasional inconveniences caused by VVIP convoys.|||What if it was not a politician, but someone special like an Army Chief, Police Chief, Nobel Peace Prize winner, international delegate, or the Dalai Lama himself ? Whoever the person is hero or villain if they are given special security, it means they are important. Maybe not important to you, but important to some people. If you are important enough that people might attack you, the government provides security , please ask for one .other wise there is nothing wrong in giving way, or at least trying to do so. Your stupidity can cause serious issues for others involved, and once again, our country could be blamed internationally.",

Economy should be of utmost priority. Unrealistic speeches for public attention should be stopped from very beginning. Private sector should be let to invest and create jobs, while government regulates effectively.  Also, they should be very wise while speaking about international relations. Oli had smothered our relation with India and that needs fixing too. We've seen with Ukraine what happens when populist politics and bad relation with neighbor does to a country.

Now note that I'm saying this in hopes that you both truly want to work it out..... Talk to him, let him know anger at this level is not normal and he can gently start a talk therapy or men's circles, or somatic healing sessions, emdr therapy (if it's a part trauma), etc. there are so many options in today's time to start a healing journey. I'm in full support for people to move this route, even if you are violent in the past. It's not easy being human and I get it. Please consider, I hope this helps.

If you would like each other to do something, you can request but nobody is obliged to follow, just having this much boundary will help you both to process your emotions on your own. Start therapy or just start writing on your own, you will notice you stress or anger is often coming from something else within yourself, not from people around you.   I hope this help a little bit. Take care, pass love to each other. If it's easier, bring serious talk when you are getting romantic, I think that helps you both absorb and understand better. Take care please. It's not impossible to change yourself and your relationships in this time, especially with so much options, start meditation, therapy, dance, especially moving body helps move your emotions too. Take care.|||Just have a conversation with your husband. Ask him why is he is acting like that? IS he insecure about you or what? make everything clear. Why is he acting in that manner? Also, clearly state what you feel about his behaviour. You both will get a chance to understand each other. Make sure he is not going to do it again or what you think will be better. If it get repeated what action will be taken? Let him know. Its either reporting to police or having converstaion with both of your parents or divorce.|||Leave him ask for divorce report to police dont stay|||This is what an emotional vampire is.

            "body": "As it says, I recently got this and was hoping for some help, especially on the markings. There isn’t a ton of info on these in English so I figured I’d do to the source. My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6. This is probably the longest shot of them all, but any ideas what species of critter might have eaten up the stock at one point?

Key Manufacturing Factories  The Ranas established several sites for arms and ammunition production, primarily centered in the Kathmandu Valley and some regional hubs:   Nakkhu (Lalitpur): Notable for producing copies of the Martini-Henry rifle, specifically the \"De-Rifle\" in the late 1880s.  Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.  Jangi Megjin: Originally founded in 1793, it continued to function during the Rana period as a government foundry for manufacturing cannons and military equipment.|||You need someone from the Hanuman Dhoka Museum in Kathmandu.

But after winning, he almost completely stopped connecting with people. There is no proper accountability, just one-sided Facebook status updates.

The content is rarely original. It is compiled from existing news articles that anyone could find doing Google. It’s a summary service, not investigative journalism.  2. As it relies on secondary sources, it never goes deep. It stays on the surface of issues, prioritizing smooth editing over raw facts.  3. The channel’s main narrative is simple: 'The country is doomed.' This is a lazy narrative. Telling us that politicians are bad or the system is broken is stating the obvious. It validates anger but offers no insight.  If you want to be entertained, it works. But if you want to be informed, this is a waste of time.",

Esto kaam ekdum kam huncha hamro desh ma|||Kudos to subham vai. I remember when he talked about doing this in his free time.|||This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit.

But motivation usually comes from showing the path, not just the end result. A screenshot shows where you landed, not how you got there.  People here asked genuine questions about niche, stack, timeline, experience, etc because that’s the part that actually helps others move in that direction. That’s where the value would have been.

Nothing wrong with flexing, just don’t call it motivation if you’re not giving people anything they can learn from or replicate.  With 5+ years of experience you’ve seen enough of the field to know that the “how” matters more than the “what,” especially for people in Nepal who are trying to break into the global market.

            "comments": "You have 4 years of experience but you don't seem to understand that writing formatted code syntax was never the hard part. When you know exactly what to do it's pretty easy to write the code for it. The hardest part of IT is trying to find out what the right questions to ask is so that you have a semblance on what exactly to code. It's trying to understand what the users of your software want. Have AI figure that out for you and then tell me.|||You are just here because of money which is not bad, but  for some programming is getting their vision on screen, a way to show creativity. You dont get to decide who is a fool|||with the increase in AI expect to get shitty codes delivered faster than we have ever seen. Shitty code, more bugs and more opportunities for IT devs. Not every company can afford AI that is going to cost fortune in long run. Mid-level devs would collapse, there would be junior then senior. Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||[deleted]|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||Skill issue. While i agree to most part, if AI is already suggesting you things you can never think of or think you are not writing / thinking yourself - i dont think you are 4yoe of engineer. Maybe you need to level up your game.   Also, tech is passionate field. The whole reason you are being beaten down by AI already is you are here for money.  Dont get me wrong i have earned fortune from tech but if it was not for my passion, i would have been average guy with average payout in tech too.  Junai field maa ni tyo top maa huna you need passion.|||12YoE here.  IT is at its peak at the moment.

Don't get me wrong - vibe coding and low code/no code methods are getting popular with some LLM coders (Claude, Gemini) becoming absolute beasts, but, the real need of a human is in problem solving and building scalable systems. My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.  The problem is people jumping on the bandwagon which is creating a terrible environment for business owners, recruiters and stakeholders.  I hope you do well in your career my friend. Let's all stay hopeful about the future. We have a long way to go before judgement day arrives and they finally take over.",

Then tools & cloud pressure:   Git, GitHub, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, GCP, CI/CD, Jenkins, Terraform.      Then frameworks & buzzwords:   Next.js, Spring Boot, Django, Microservices, REST API, GraphQL, WebSockets.

            "comments": "This narrative of \"Software Engineering is done\" isn't new. This happens every time a revolutionary milestone in the technology space is achieved. Sure, it is not realistic to overlook the economy or the job scarcity that is so prevalant now, maybe for the longest time yet but it doesn't adjucate to the premise of Software Engineering isn't feasible as a career anymore, at least to the degree people are making it out to be. AI-driven development may very well be a 'bubble', and when it pops and the dust settles, the next big thing will provoke a similar reaction. While it is evident that people with years of experience are at a loss right now, and even more so for students trying to make it in tech, undergrads or young aspirants.  I believe it was never about how greatly any technology overshadows the current technology even if it transforms areas of it by overwhelming amounts but the ability to use it to your advantage. That is how you thrive here. You embrace, and not reject. AI cannot replace engineering but it does accelerate aspects of it that if you don't keep up, you get left behind. I mean, with AI-driven development so rampant right now, startups are at an all time high. People adapt and make it work. That mindset is obligatory now more than ever. Well, I could be speaking regardless of facts that I have yet to know, but I stand firmly on my grounds of not rejecting engineering as it has never been easier than now.|||I have 4 YOE.

An industry can only take so many people before saturation, especially in face of disruption / paradigm shift as is the case now. As with any other field, you have to dedicate time and effort to be good and stay good. If you are a computer engineer worth your salt, you know it's a lot more about structured and critical thinking, problem solving skills and architecting solutions than coding in the field, and if you have the basics right, tech stack changing shouldn't scare you as much.  As with any other field, only the most committed, knowledgeable and competent people will remain in the industry and that should always be the case. The gold rush is over.|||Difficult times? Yes.  First time? No.   I really want to see what time has. Best wishes.  Best will have the best.|||Not only in Nepal.

You will be adding more skills as you go, as your project requires it.   Yes its a challenging job but so are other jobs. If you enjoy learning/working in this field then its good for you else people can and should look for other carrier option. Do what feels natural to you.   Regarding AI, its here to stay wear we like it ir not. We don't need to me AI/ML experts we just have to learn how to use it, or embrace it, and not reject it. Its on the hype but it will die down and come back to its default.|||Jack of all with understanding of Ai tools and how to implement wins. Be the jack of all. Don’t try to master one thing. That’s what I suggest.   Decent apps can be build in a day if you know the requirements, understand system design and  logic needed. You need to understand things like how apps are build, deployed etc.  At least in US, Ai replacing engineerings is not exactly false.   With Automated workflows and Ai agents, team needing 100 members could only need couple members. That does mean Ai replaced 98 people among 100. That’s how I see.",

            "heading": "We built a social/dating app for KU students.",
            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

If I have the time, I might join if I'm free. If they were inviting Harvard professors, it'd cost you 10x more to attend. Events take time and effort. Many costs. Let's switch the focus to you. Have you organized an event? Was it easy? Who did you invite as a speaker?   If you're a student, why care about an enterprise AI event? I fail to see your criticisms. Not everybody needs to start a business to prove their credibility. It literally takes <20k.  I don't expect them to cover hf peft best practices. It's an event for enterprises. I don't have expectations for food. If I meet somebody interesting, that's good enough for me.  I think you're being confused between training courses and networking events. Plenty of events if you want to learn. ANAIS, NAAMII charged 12k for students this year. Was fine. Good stuff. Made many friends.  I dislike AI non-profits that claim to do research and fail to have any publications or research projects, yet say they're open to collaborations. But the AI association isn't a research body, probably does just events. Executives don't open up VS code and grind all day. That's a very small minority. They're skilled, just not in a way that appeals to you. They bring in investors, organize events, lots of things. If you ask me, there's a lot more to a product than PRs and merges. If you're not already the Lead for some MNC, some humility helps. It's dumb to say a CEO doesn't have skills because they don't code like you do, don't you think?  I'm not affiliated with naamii or any non-profits.|||On one hand, I can see the low effort poster with multiple mistakes and the fluffy pointless nonsense that is the main paragraph probably written by ChatGPT with a 6 word prompt. There's no mention of the \"Experts\" that are supposed to lead the thing.  On the other hand, your post has offered no genuine criticism of the event. It is just as pointless as the poster. Maybe offer anecdotes? Some tangible verifiable reason to justify your \"nrs 350 for 2.5 hours is a massive waste\".  Organizing an event comes with some cost, and some of that must be passed to the visitor. NRS 350 is some money, it is definitely not a lot of money. It is most definitely not \"expensive\" for an event in any sense of the word.   Justify your claims. Why is this a \"scam\"? What other way can a person \"use nrs 350 to learn by yourself\" (your words)? Who are the speakers and why are they unqualified to speak on this program?  *disclaimer: not affilaited to this org or event*, *just a random angry redditor*",

            "body": "Hi, I’m a 20-year-old student and freelancer who genuinely wants to build something meaningful in life.  After +2, I applied to Canada and the USA for further studies, but my visa got rejected. Instead of wasting a year, I joined BBS , and now I’m in my 3rd year.  When the visa didn’t work out, I decided to take responsibility for my own future. I started learning about AI, automation, and new technologies. Over time, I picked up practical skills, experimented a lot, and eventually started freelancing. Right now, I work as an AI Developer on Upwork, and even in the early stage, I’m earning more than 1 lakh NPR per month.  I’m not an expert and I still have a lot to learn but I know my strengths. I’m good at managing things, people, sales, content, and marketing, and I can execute fast. I have learned most of this by consuming real-world information online and applying it through actual work.  I have big plans in the AI space, but I also know that building something great alone is very difficult. That’s why I am looking for a technical co-founder, someone strong on the engineering side so we can build, learn, and grow together.  The idea is to:  * Start very small and lean * No heavy investment * Focus on AI services / automation / agency-style work * Only basic costs like hosting or APIs * Aim to generate revenue within 2–3 months  I currently live with my parents in Butwal, but I want to move to Kathmandu, take a small flat, and fully focus on building. I also plan to start creating content alongside the business.  I’m looking for someone who:  * Is disciplined and focused * Serious about long-term growth * Not into unhealthy habits * Wants a simple lifestyle with deep work * Has strong technical skills or is deeply committed to developing them  Most importantly, I want a co-founder who understands that things won’t always work. There will be hard times, failures, and uncertainty. During those phases, we should push and motivate each other, stay consistent, and keep moving forward. Even if something fails, we should come out smarter, stronger, and more experienced than before.  We don’t need much money to start just enough for basic living expenses. I have savings that allow me to manage accommodation and food for a long time, and I strongly believe we can make this sustainable within a few months.  The goal is simple:   Live together. Build together. Learn together. Grow together.  If you’re technically strong, disciplined, and serious about building a real AI business from Nepal, let’s connect.",

Now the male voice announces the initial location first e.g \"अहिले बाफल\" followed by the female voice, which sounds odd. I liked the way the female voice said those location names.

However, I've recently realized that this isn't the case in Nepali government institutions.

Aren’t all universities in Nepal considered similar?  I did get the equivalence, but it says it’s equivalent to a “relevant subject,” and the Army told me it’s not enough to proceed with the application. They essentially said that unless I have a certificate specifically stating that my course is equivalent to Computer Engineering, there’s no point in continuing. (They suggested I should show up for the bearing and physical tests, but couldn’t confirm whether I’d even get the opportunity. So, I decided to drop out of that path.)  Now, after seeing the NEA vacancy announcement, I noticed they also specifically require a Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering.

This has now gotten out of hand, and this type of behavior will surely spread to other tourist areas, especially those closer to the border like Sauraha and others. I have seen these 'tourists' in Thars and other SUVs riding recklessly on our highways, mocking our rules and laws. In my local area in the Terai, there have been a couple of incidents where such SUVs have hit locals, including traffic police, and fled to India.  Let's continue to do what we can from our end - I have reported the videos and his channel, and let's keep reporting those videos wherever we find them, and from any other Indian 'YouTubers'. Influencers from Pokhara need to raise their voices collectively on other popular social media channels like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Local influencers need to unite and raise this issue from their platforms in their individual capacities. Otherwise, we might be just one incident away from breaking news.  I will share this thread with a popular Indian YouTube journalist-The Deshbhakt. I have been following him, and he has made videos on such stupidity by Indian tourists. I will leave his Instagram link here so that everyone with evidence can share information.

            "body": "Yesterday I posted about how I felt like a Pathao for my girlfriend, and almost everyone agreed that I was being used. So I finally talked to her about it. She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess. Aba Don feri Bumble ma janxa haha  Thankyou everyone for your suggestions sabai Lai mero tarfa Bata coffee ly",

My nephew, **Liam Thapa**, is battling **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)**.  It is a rare, cruel genetic disease that causes muscles to waste away. Without intervention, boys with DMD lose the ability to walk by their early teens, and many don’t survive past their 20s.  But, there is a ray of hope: A one-time **Gene Therapy (Elevidys)** that can stop this progression. But the cost is a staggering **$2.9 Million USD**.  I am posting from a business Reddit ID to maintain total transparency and accountability.  Yes, we know $2.9M sounds impossible, but we are fighting for every cent.  * Total Goal: **$2.9 Million USD** * Cost in Nepalese Rupees: **Approx. रु 41,92,00,000 (41.92 Crore NPR)** * Raised so far: **$85909** * Remaining: **$2814091**  Liam is nearly 4. This therapy is most effective the earlier it is given. We are racing against time and biological markers that could disqualify him if we wait too long.  I have compiled all medical records, hospital documents from Australia, and identity proofs in a transparent folder for anyone who wishes to verify our story: [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1BHeXMPMnw7DZFLJZM3bBLWGqn7Rp8wc8](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1BHeXMPMnw7DZFLJZM3bBLWGqn7Rp8wc8)  If you can’t donate, please share.

DMD is heartbreaking, and I genuinely hope he gets the care he needs 🙏  Just sharing information for awareness (not to diminish the importance of Elevidys): there are FDA-approved medications available for DMD today that can slow progression and improve outcomes, depending on the child’s mutation and age. These include corticosteroids (like deflazacort or vamorolone), exon-skipping therapies (for specific mutations), and non-steroidal options like givinostat, in addition to gene therapy.  Of course, treatment choice depends on genetic testing, eligibility criteria, and specialist guidance, and early intervention is critical, which I understand is why Elevidys is being pursued.  Posting this only so families reading this thread know there are multiple therapeutic pathways worth discussing with a neuromuscular specialist. Wishing Liam strength, access, and support and hoping this campaign reaches the right hands. 🤍|||.|||42 crore to save just one life is simply not worth it.

Liam is lucky to have people fighting this hard for him. 💛    Huge respect for how transparent you’re being with records + receipts! That matters a lot when people want to help. And yes, thank you Elevidys (and the teams behind it) for giving families a real shot at hope.    Boosting this: if you can’t donate, please share. Even one repost can reach the right person/community. Wishing Liam and your whole family strength + a miracle-fast finish line. 🙏🧡|||I am sorry, baby. He is so cute.

No doubt we live in social media bubble and think that people will overwhelming vote UML and maoists out, but if you go to the rural areas(and I have), you see that they still have strong roots there. This is further emboldened by the recent strong statements UML has put out.  The old parties have their base established, and the more the new parties run for election, the more they dilute their own votes. Furthermore, they aren't organized yet to be a major national party and to compete in 165 different constituencies .

Congress and UML will form a coalition government with RSP, telling Ravi that failing to do so could mean the death of “democracy” in Nepal and urging him to put aside his ego for the greater good. Ravi will feel suffocated every single night, unable to do anything within yet another coalition government with Congress and UML. Rise and fall.

            "heading": "The Sisan Baniya I knew",
            "body": "I've been tempted to write this for a long time.       I was in a relationship with a popular male influencer for a long time. We broke up 2 years ago. During our 3+ year-long relationship, I got to be in his inner circle and hung out with Sisan and gang (and Shrinkhala too, before she went to Harvard). We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective. Just like Shrinkhala shamelessly posted those yellow highlighted Excel Sheets as her proof of innocence which had no third party audit or any verification.|||I have never watched Sisan Baniya, but I didn't feel that he ever portrayed himself as self made or coming from a humble background. He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Yeah, Sisan isn't 'dudh ka dhula' as he shows himself to be, he might be even worse.

Before he was viral. Even mod a subreddit for his work. And I do understand separating between the art and the artists. This all sounds very true and feels consistent with his person out of his art (videos)  It’s funny to see Sisan’s Simp Boys here, not even ready to listen to a different perspective. And they give such an Incel vibe, hating up on a woman.  I really hope they are all kids who will grow out of this someday and realize how lame they were.  Sisan 500% milked his breakup while Shrinkhala and was so out of character for the graceful guy character he tries to build up in vlogs.|||The day when he was targeting his ex.

I think i know who you are. I also worked and hung out with and around Sisan Shrinkhala a lot. So after the breakup, the way he acted like a kicked dog and gained public sympathy from incels licking on his balls and slut shaming Shrinkhala was so insane. And the way he spoke up about the Miss Nepal funds k k when the hate for her was at an all time high. Personally I have no sympathy or love for Shrinkhala so I am not saying this to defend her.

What an absolute joke. Absolute witch hunting behaviour. She was cool until she was relateable to most women but once you marry rich thats the end of it for women. Take away every thing that she has ever achieved and yeah jump on the hate train wagon.Most people who know sisan personally know that he is absolute shit head. Absolute narc. I know some of them and they all say that he didnt pay half of his saff well. Always made them work extra hours with out paying them well. And those who know them up and close know that the rumour about shrinkhala putting an extra effort on the relationship is true. I have even heard that Shrinkhala was ready to marry him but he kind of side lined and said he is not ready or something. He was always a snob dont know what took people so long to recognise. When he was in relationship with shrinkhala he would always put thumbnail of her in every video he posted to cash in the view and any body can tell he did the same thing after they broke up, used  every opportunity to capitalise her name, when we all know she was quite for the longest time.

I used to watch his vlog in 2019 and haven't been following him for a long time. The way he portrays himself, his Paradygm TV nonsense, I never liked that. And the way he helped to intensify hate and misinformation about Shrinkhala during that difficult time for her, shows the true character of the person.  It was (still is) unpopular to support Shrinkhala and criticize Sisan but we should never hesitate to tell the truth. Plus anybody whose father owns a house in Kathmandu is never struggling.

When someone says \"I am proud to be Nepali.\" You say there is nothing that the person did.   You don't say the same thing when someone says \"I am proud of my dad.\"   It is just positive gesture toward something they are attached to.  It is okay to be attached to your tribe and group.. But just as long as you are not putting other people down.|||Your caste and ethnicity influences the thinking|||All of them have rampant hate against each other. But somehow bahun are the only victim of hate according to the subs here:⁠-⁠):⁠-⁠):⁠-⁠)|||That also applies for nationalism, and i haven't seen a single person who is proud of being a bahaun/chettri/rai/magar|||This is a difference that Bahun, Chhetri people do not understand.  There is a huge difference between people saying \"I am proud to be a Brahmin\" vs. \"I am proud to be a Newar\", for example.  Brahmin represents a 3000 year old history of supremacy over others based on birth. It represents what it means to be supposedly superior based on caste, purity, lineage. It represents the root evil of our society that treats your own fellow human beings as untouchable. A society with a Brahmin will automatically have a Shudra too. That is what the 4 Hindu varnavyastha is. What Nepali Bahuns also don't realize is Brahmin, Chhetri - these varna identities are there everywhere in Indian societis too - from Kashmir down to Kerala - every Indian state, community, region has their own Brahmin and Chhetri. So calling yourself a proud Brahmin gives you absolutely no unique identity except your association as a self-superior caste.  Whereas calling yourself a Newar is not based on caste, but a linguistic identity. The notion of caste (and hence superiority-inferiority, pure-impure, higher-lower) automatically disappears when you identify based on the language you speak. You must be aware within Newars there are Hindu Brahmins (Rajopadhyayas), Kshatriyas (Malla, Pradhan, Rajbhandari, etc.) down to a whole range of Vaishyas and Shudras. But when these diverse caste groups identify singularly based on the language they speak (Nepalbhasha/Newar), the identity becomes secular. Your identity based on varna/caste slowly starts to fade off. This is exactly what happened among Newars as most non-Newars will be shocked to find out Brahmins, Kshatriyas even exist among Newars. This is exactly what Indian societies do too. For a majority of Indian people (especially young, educated, urban), their linguistic identity trumps caste identity, hence they identify as Kashmiri, Haryanvi, Bihari, Bengali, Tamilian, Maharastrian, Gujarati, etc. which are all their linguistic identity.  Of course identifying through language does not solve the root of the evil. That is always there. But at least it will be a step in the right direction.|||Magar, Brahmin haru ta tha vayena but yo rai , limbu, Kirat in general have become so full of themselves, they want a KIRAT PRADESSSH Arey.

Many kings tied themselves to religion and caste systems, which also helped them control and organize people. When society is divided into groups, it becomes harder for people to unite, which benefits those in power. So I wonder was religion only about belief, or was it also shaped to maintain authority and hierarchy? If you agree that religion has been used as a tool for control in history, raise your hand. Btw mah ne xetre nae ho.|||when you are Nepali this is ridiculous thing to be pride on. we are prideful of multi ethnicity not just a ethnic.|||Absolutely, this happens when people have only one identity; just like religion.|||Those are casts, not ethnicities|||the thing is the people’s representatives are using these methods in nepal 🫩|||I thik it's true for genders too|||When a man has nth left to eat, he bites the furnitures. a man always needs sth to eat.|||Is there caste discrimination going on ?

The feeling of lying in the bed with inherent thoughts of disperse happiness and the want to be able to understand if that happiness is as true as it seems is not new and it's also not wholly mine   I look at all these motion picture hoping to find something. And what that might be is as ananomus to me as it is to you. I look at these things, listen as they talk, but the existence of this feeling of watching doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm lying on this virgin earth, unmolested and untouched, devoid of any feeling of any sort except for one; consciousness. The consciousness reigns supreme within and without all within the vicinity of my existence.  At this point, life as you call it feels not a moments passing by or time flowing like my thoughts.  My head feels particularly heavy, as if I'm thinking but a thought is yet to process. But how can this be? Without a thought, how can you think? How can one live, without knowing the value of death? But that's not right either. For one to know the value of death,.one must first know of its qualities, it's feature in all it's dimensions. The inherent idea of a thought being, and to think not sounds stupid as if not funny enough. But you can't overlook the idea behind such ponder.   I take very long breaths as I think. My heart beats loud enough for me to hear it. And all my bodily functions seems very much obvious to me. This isn't new but it's not wholly mine.   Ahh now my head hurts a little to. But this shall too pass.   Theres this lingering feeling of solitude that I feel very sensationally. For solitude has been my friend far longer then any. The silence that made me feel alone after some years felt not pleasing but good enough to make me feel a bit stingy if it got disturbed.  But now this solitude engulfs me, strangles me so that I choke these thoughts out of me which are yet to be. But it was this very solitude that made me form a thought but now it want it back. Like how death waits right Infront of you, lingers above you with it's hands around neck, and then takes you through the stairs of lifelessness while you climb oblivious. Similar is the solitude that I experience right now, but instead of lifelessness, I climb and climb but towards nothing, I climb and climb but climb on empty thoughts.

The goal wasn’t to teach a full curriculum in an afternoon; it was to show these kids that technology isn't out of reach.  As a student-led initiative, we don't have a big corporate engine behind us. We’re just a group of peers showing up and leading where we can. This reel captures some of the curiosity we saw that day—it’s a small start, but a meaningful one.
