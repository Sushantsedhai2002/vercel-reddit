            "body": "1) People like Balen have no ability to form a party and mobilise intellectuals and other people at different levels. It is vastly more difficult than running for mayor as an independent.   2) Without a party with strong roots, you cannot meaningfully win seats in the parliament. No matter how proficiently their \"Expose jholey\" trend is run.   3) It would be much easier to win if the PM were directly elected like a mayor. That is because you do not even speak a word to win an election, and you do not depend on other people. Short-term social media trends can sway the votes towards any direction. So, whoever has the ability to manipulate social media trends, they are likely to dictate who will become the winner (honourable mention RoNB)     In a country with a sub-human average IQ, this would be fatal. You cannot guarantee who becomes your next PM. At one time, it could have been Mukunde just for a joke or Dhurmushe for campaigning for stadium funding.  There is a greater geopolitical risk, though.  With just a drop of money from foreign influencers, you can totally manipulate people with social engineering to prop up puppet candidates that, when they come to power, basically sell the country.    Look at this paid promotion being done on Reddit that advocates for the directly elected PM.

If you really need it get a goldstar trekking shoes, cost you around 3500 nepali rupees.|||don't get goldstar shoes as the other guy suggested. i bought a pair of la sportivas for around 16k npr in thamel. if you don't want to spend a lot, i would either stick with whatever shoes you have right now and bring multiple layers of warm socks as it will be cold once you get up in elevation. your plan to get second hand is much better as they can last you a long time, especially if they're well made. i wouldn't recommend goldstar as they are cheap but quality is not there.   as for what to bring, a thermos would be good. something that keeps water warm for 12 hours. if you have a metal one, it would be good. it'll save you in the cold. you also need a good down jacket and warm layers. pikey peak isn't that long so you should be fine with not having a lot of clothes but you need warm clothes. trust me.|||be respectful    don't throw garbage in mountains|||good. Come to visit Nepal. U r welcome 🙏|||You can visit kalapatthar store in Thamel in Kathmandu where you can get a hiking shoe under 5k npr which will be enough for your Pikey Peak trek. Dont worry about it.|||Few things as Indian you should note about travelling in Nepal  - in nepal only 100 RS denomination will be exchanged and accepted. So carry mainly those.  - best exchange rates will be at thamel. More the amount better the rate (so it’s negotiable)  - at thamel there are many stores for trekking products & you should opt for sturdy soles and water resistant ankle length shoe. Since you are on a budget avoid brands and look for what gives you comfort . Pikey peak isn’t very technical or tough imho so shoes pe itna paise mat dalna  - stay at dorms of hostel like Himalayas or ramblers - 500 nepali for a bed  - carry pre mix tea coffee soup.

            "body": "I just saw a post of a guy who faced racism in the UK and I wanted to tell you how I got treated when I was in the UK 👀😳.  👀☹️ The first time I faced racism in the UK was when I was with one of my classmates (she was South Indian Christian). I told everyone that I was a Nepali Hindu and she would be like, “Nepal is a part of India 😂” in front of the whole group. Fortunately for me, 70% of my classmates were either white or European. They scolded her and laughed at her poor geography 😂 and one even said, “Do you not know about your own country?” She would always try to prove why Christians are better than Hindus and asked why I eat cow and stuff 😂. Now one of my British and one French friend started practicing Krishna consciousness 😂. She wouldn’t leave a chance to mock me or humiliate me, but people around me were more into spirituality and yoga and stuff, so they would always hang out with me. She ended up coming to school very rarely due to her work at a restaurant, and I would always avoid her when she did come.  Another incident was with a random drugged-up guy shouting at me (I was in the poor part of London). I couldn’t understand what he was actually saying lol 😂 he could barely speak. But I heard him saying “return back.” I just laughed at his state lol poor guy.  And something I would never forget is once I was going for a date and a bunch of school-aged kids (mostly looked like Indians and Pakistanis) were targeting Asian-looking girls and throwing water at them—and I got hit. Like wtf, I couldn’t even scold them because they were kids 👀. I cried for the first time because the day was really important to me and they ruined all my clothes and makeup. Also, they ran away before I could even open my eyes 😢.  I used to work at a 5-star hotel as a waitress (Hotel Café Royal if you wanna Google it) and one extra rich man would drop coins at my table lol 😂 with eye contact, as if I was gonna pick them up. I just picked them and returned them to the guy 😂 saying, “You just dropped this, sir,” and he complained to my manager. After that day, my manager never gave me any rotas and eventually, I just left the job (got paid £350 a month commission for 6 months with no work lmao). Malai faida vayo thiyo.  In my experience, the racism mostly comes from either the poor part of the UK—the guy who has lost his job, the single fat woman who thinks you are taking all their men 😂, the old lonely Karens who’ve had their share of a shitty life and wants to make your life shit, and the immigrants who hate other immigrants, especially their kids who think they are better than us all lmao. They lack manners and project their frustration out of poverty onto us 👀. The other group is the extremely rich, who treat you like 👀😂 you are a fly. But there are many beautiful people who are in between, and I have met some amazing, amazing people on my journey 🥹 people who really treated me like their family.",

            "body": "I've been following the Rabi Lamichhane cooperative scandal and the discussions around it, and I feel like a crucial point is getting lost in the defenses I see most often online. I want to lay out the facts as they're being reported and ask people to look at the evidence itself and make their own informed decisions.  The Core Issue:  According to investigations by the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) and the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB), the core allegations are:  · Funds totaling at least NPR 1.42 Arba (142 Crore) were funneled from several cooperative societies (including Suryadarshan, Gorkha Media, and others) to Gorkha Media Pvt. Ltd., the company that operated the television channel where Rabi Lamichhane was a key figure.  · Rabi Lamichhane was a promoter, shareholder, and the Managing Director (MD) of Gorkha Media for a significant period when these transactions occurred. · Many of these cooperatives are now in financial crisis, leaving numerous depositors struggling to recover their savings.   Rabi ko Defense:  1. The \"I Wasn't Active in Management\" Defense: Rabi Lamichhane's defense centers on the claim that he was not actively involved in the day-to-day management of Gorkha Media and was unaware of the financial transactions.     · Fact-Check: While he may not have been involved in daily operations, he was the legally appointed Managing Director. Under Nepali company law, the MD holds significant responsibility for the company's financial and operational activities. The question remains: how could the MD be unaware of loans worth over NPR 1 Arba entering the company's accounts?  2. The \"Personal Loan\" Admission:     · Fact-Check: Rabi has admitted to taking a personal loan of NPR 1.8 Crore from Suryadarshan Cooperative while he was both its member and a shareholder of Gorkha Media.     · The Legality: This is a key point of illegality. Nepal Rastra Bank regulations strictly prohibit cooperatives from disbursing such large loans to their own board members or directors. This rule is in place to prevent conflicts of interest and protect depositors' funds. By his own admission, this rule was violated.  3. The Deflection to \"Political Witch Hunt\": While the timing and nature of politics in Nepal can be suspicious, this defense does not address the specific financial and legal irregularities documented by the regulatory body (NRB) and the police (CIB). The evidence needs to be addressed on its own merits.  The Human Cost  This is the most critical part. This isn't just a political debate. The misuse of cooperative funds has a direct human impact. Ordinary depositors, who trusted these institutions with their life savings, have been unable to withdraw their money. This is a serious socio-economic issue that should be the primary focus.  The desire for political change is understandable. However, holding new leaders to the same standard of accountability we demand from the old guard is essential for real progress.  Ask yourself:   · Does the \"Oli/Deuba are against him\" defense actually answer the concrete questions?  · Does it explain the legal responsibility of a Managing Director? · Does it justify taking a prohibited loan as a board member of a cooperative? · Does it address the plight of the depositors who lost their savings?   We should demand accountability based on facts and the law, not based on which political camp we dislike more. Let's move beyond tribal politics and make our judgments based on the evidence presented.",

Theres a famous case called Enron scandal, where two subsequent CEOs basically gave same excuse as Rabi, saying they were unaware about the fradulent schemes and blamed on CFO, auditors. Both of the CEOs were convicted, one jailed for 24 years and the other died.|||Thank you putting this out. Also remember the citizenship Kanda when he was first elected in parliament.|||Good luck, this place if full of rabis cult.|||He never took loans to run the media group. Also, that law saying owners  (shareholders)  can't take loans was just on paper no one was following it.  He clearly mentions GB Rai handled finances while he handled operations. You do business with someone you trust, since all of investment was of GB he handled finances and he was fine with it.  This Rabi didn't know where funds come from thing is so impractical. So people that got investment from Shark tank now should go after their investors asking them to show proof of how they have this money?  GB rai was a reknowned businessman so he believed it was his business ko money not sahakari scam one.  Also about money from sahakari being deposited into the media company. The person that did that clearly said she did it but was asked to deposit in Rabi's name Rabi didn't do it.  He did however take loans from Cooperative for personal purpose but that amount is 115 lakhs.  He can pay that amount back which is the fair punishment.  Why is he being framed as if he not GB Rai did the sahakari scam, when rabi collaborated with GB he was a businessman and news about his scam weren't out.  Also why are other sahakari owners that are directly involved being released on bail with low amounts?  Rabi and his party is the best alternative for now, which is why they deserve our support. Perfect politican hudaina, all old parties are after him and will try and frame him on anything they can find.  This fact alone is enough that Rabi is a threat to them and he's different so he can do a better job and deserves a chance.  Rabi is the most capable unless all these good swontantra candidates (Balen , Harka kuman open their own party?  So I think we should focus on the bigger picture and support him and see what he does.  Rabi is accountable which is why I like him and I believe he is better.|||I am not suggesting his innocence. But, didn’t he replaced the old MD and money was already invested in galaxy television before he came? For second point: he is at fault, but didn’t he returned back the money? He may get some punishment for it. But, it’s not embezzlement.  The thing that i am not clear is why Rabi has not criticised GB Rai at all. May be he is involved, who knows.|||Gagan Thapa come from real id|||This is some bullshit ass post for influence operation. Kun party ko jhole ho bro?

Parliamentary investigation report led by Surya Thapa has clearly said they have not found Rabi involved in any Sahakari lootne dhanda. I get it, he is being prosecuted for using Money that came from the Sahakari but he is personally not involved in how his partner brings money from where. I can't say you are guilty because the salary you have been receiving for your service might be some illegally earned black money from the boss. If there are other misconducts, then absolutely he must be punished on the full extent of the law.|||This is completely wrong, fact is distorted|||OK tell me what about the main coordinator gitendra? Why don't you talk about him? It seems like gitendra is doing some shady business putting Rabi in frame, gitendra is from congress he might played some conspiracy handing documents. By now, gitendra might clear his evidence. We need to soon catch him from interpol and bring him in custody. Everything will be clear afterwards. You don't have strong evidence that Rabi did all this work, gitendra could also do it. It's like 50% probability. So let's not put blame on Rabi yet. Why don't you talk anything about Gitendra? Is this because you are also from congress trying to protect him? If Gitendra has done nothing wrong, why would he has to hide in Malaysia? We need to think from this angle too.|||If he can't manage a company, how can he be a leader of a country.

While saner minds were trying to assess the situation and were looking for constitutional solution. Tara hatar hatar parliament dissolve gariyo.  It always seems obvious from hindsingt, but at that time it was a tough choice. And I don't see it as black and white. There was a good side and bad side of 'Samsad bighatan'. The disadvantage is that one of the demands ie directly elected executive is not possible as per the constitution. But the good part is that they don't have the status of MP's, no majority, we have made them powerless albiet temporarily.  If we wanted directly elected PM, then we had to make a political agreement, but could we have even pulled it off that easily. Gen Z's are not good at political games, political party harule jhulai dina pani ta sakthyo, the more they delayed the more we would lose momentum. Ani parliament ma vako majority abuse pani ta garna sakthyo, using an excuse like \"saving the country from crisis/power vaccum\" .  Don't be discouraged guys, we can still get what we want from this parliamentary elections as well. I know it's very difficult for a party to get majority but it's possible. If the alternative forces/party pre-announces their PM candidate ( for eg. like BJP announced Modi in 2014) and if the party gets the majority, it is as good as directly elected PM.       The good thing about 'samsad bighatan' is that we have our governent until the elctions. The corrupt politicians can be investigated, the elections can be conducted without political interference. Also, there is this increased awareness among the people, I have seen many old people change their political opinions. Pahila pahila chai young voters ko turnout low hunthyo, buda haru maximum le vote garthe, but this time a lot of young people are going to vote.

Since you lack them, you don’t have your brain but that of crowd and you are incapable to communicate what you want, how and why, because you lack clarity of thought. You float from one thought to another cluelessly. Emotion is your only compass to navigate.  What social media from Nepal needs is reasonable men and women with their own thoughts and principles based on which they demand, they question, they challenge, they fight, not to please anyone but for those thoughts and principles.",

            "body": "Guys, I have a serious doubt about the outcome of the GEN-Z protest in Nepal. We haven’t achieved our agenda. Our first demand is to have a directly elected Prime Minister. To make this happen, we need to amend the Constitution of Nepal. Right now, it requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament to appoint a Prime Minister. To amend it, approval from both the Upper House and the National Assembly is necessary. But since Parliament is dissolved, we don’t have that. This means we need a new House of Representatives, which will only be possible after the new election scheduled for Kartik 21 (correct me if I’m wrong).  Here’s my concern. What if the same corrupt parties get elected again, maybe with new faces but the same dirty politics? What if the old leaders return? They have huge amounts of money to buy votes, and our society is also corrupted. If they come back, or even worse people take power, we will lose everything. The sacrifice of the 72 martyrs will go in vain. A directly elected Prime Minister will never happen because they will never vote for it.  I wish this doesn’t happen. I wish we get a positive outcome from our protest. But if it doesn’t, what are we going to do? I’m scared about this.",

            "body": "My house was vandalized in the name of \"Gen z protest.\" My dad is a civil servant, and we live in a humble 3 story house (the third story was only recently built). It was a small house when we moved in, which was 17 years ago— few months after I was born.   After working for over 25+ years for the government, this country, and its public, my dad still has a very clear history. No bribery, no corruption, no money laundering— nothing. Rising high in status and the post, he is recognized for his diligent work and highly stable work ethic.  Now, back to the present. The protestors had reached our house. I had once thought, why would anyone target our house? It's a civil servant, not some minister or anything of that sort. My father rose high due to his hard work and competitiveness, not any connection or bribery. We can all see from how my parents lived rental first (he was already a civil servant then). Only after a few months of me being born did they buy a house, not without taking loans.  I don't know why it happened because our house was aba and definitely not supposed to be a part of whatever that was. The protestors were going to burn our house, but because of it being attached to other houses, the neighbours finally calmed them down into not burning our house. Instead, they burned our bikes, went into our house, and threw things out to burn them. What's worse? When the protestors left, all the people living nearby, went in and out for 2 days straight— morning, day and night, pickng whatever things they liked amd taking it home with them as if our house was some kind of thrift store giving away our stuff for free.  We were at our relative's house, and when we saw all the black smoke coming from the direction of our house, we were devastated. \"Our house got burnt.\" That's what we thought. As i was the oldest child in the family, i couldn't let myself break down. I can still hear those devastating gut-wrenching cries and sobs from my mom, haunting me like a ghost every time i close my eyes.   I am a college student. My uniform is gone, and so are my books and copies. My sister is in middle school. Her uniform and books and copies are nowhere to be found as well.   Our money and jewelries, of course, are gone too. The same money my father earned and mind you, a civil servant's earnings isn't much. Only enough to label us as a middle-class family. The same money my sister sent us, her hard-working money(which was in dollars at that).  Our clothes, bags, and even utensils are gone, and so are our food storage(stuff). My mom is someone who saves money. However, she can just like my dad because she knows she has experienced the hardships with my dad. Because they know. Because they have experienced hardships and complications in their life. Because they have faced obstacles.  We have never wore any designers, no luxury fashion brand. All are affordable and comfortable. The only designer my mom and dad ever even had is when my big sister from abroad visited us and surprised us with some designer bags (which she also got scolded for spending so much because she is still studying and working in between only).  Our guests'clothes, laptops, phones, everything is gone. Me and my sisters' savings and my mom's little spending for managing our household— nothing is left. Not even our puja ko thaan(a small place we had to worship and pray gods).   We have tons of debts. I am old enough to learn that by now. Now that our house was totally and utterly robbed and vandalized while my dad kept on working for the same public, we have nowhere to sleep on. No clothes to wear. There is no place to shower or bathe.  We had to hide away from our own house we once called home to keep ourselves alive. My father was lucky enough to be safe because if it was even a few seconds late, it would have all been over. We were fortunate to be alive, even though we had done nothing wrong to people.  Morality? Humanity? Conscience? Guilt? Remorse? None. The same people, the same public, that my dad is working so hard to serve with his whole heart, has done this to him, to his family.  Gen z, huh? Protest against corruption, huh? My dad, having the cleanest history— no corruption, bribery, connection, whatsoever. So why our house? Why? What had we ever done to them? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.   I have no hope left. None for this country, none for the people of this country. This is now a country full of robbers and thieves. Humans are jealous. Humans are greedy. People are full of themselves, full of greediness and selfishness. In my heart, humans are creatures who have ruined any hope for more in me and my family. My father, who once poured his heart for this country and the people in this country, is on the verge of giving up on it.  You people, opportunists, and robbers who call yourselves voice of justice— I'll be watching, watching who you are going to tame to pull this country back together. People like my dad who are so wronged will be out of all this mess soon, Who are you going to pull to patch this broken country? I'll be watching. I'll be happily watching everything crumble and fall apart with your \"justice.\" You have given the opportunists a sense of win. You've let them think anything is possible, and now, everything will fall apart while you watch everything crumble in front of your eyes.  Lastly, I'd like to be a little vulgar and uncensored. If you are uncomfortable, scroll away.  Whoever has participated in vandalizing my house and robbing it empty— You are going to see hell and worse. I hope you feel yourself rotting away. I hope you don't think it's over now because whatever you stole, it will haunt you for the rest of your life and afterwards. I will forever haunt you, even in your dreams, converting it into a disastrous nightmare. You'll see hell. You are going to suffer.  [Edit: I never expected this post to gain so many views. I’m very grateful to those who are wishing me and my family well, thank you very much for that. And I also understand those who might raise an eyebrow on this post and not believe in my words. It’s up to you, whether you want to believe me or not. I have no intention of forcing it on you.   I’d also like to request anyone who knows me through this post to maintain my privacy and not reveal anything about me or my family on the internet(please refrain any stalker behavior). I have never gone public like this and I also don’t like the attention this is getting(makes me uncomfortable) but I’m going to keep this post so other people who have experienced something like this can be open about it here. Let this be a safe space for those to speak up.]",

While this was an absolutely needed protest and it did bring much-needed attention and change, we also can’t deny the darker side of it.

Gen Z cannot ignore the fact that others died in fires, or that people were looted and harmed during the unrest. It’s easy to say the movement was hijacked by goons, but the videos and reports show some protesters themselves vandalizing property and stealing from people who had nothing to do with the issue.

I can tell you, they were criminals. Not GenZ.

Those days were literal anarchy. And even shopkeepers etc were robbed .   That was the sad part of GenZ protest. for a while the country became total anarchy. I feel lucky I survived that day, although I have no relation with politics or civil service.  Criminals took the advantage. May be police or forensic experts, I dont know should do proper investigation, find the criminals, put them in jail.

Please keep that in mind.|||Let me congratulate you for thinking ahead about retiring in Nepal.  Nepal is not right for retirement for folks from West at this time but I am very hopeful it will have   the infrastructure in next 2 decades.    Few peoples who I know have retired in Nepal are those who have started early in their life, mid 50s, they have been active there as well and have gelled well. Also know few who went there in there late 60s but ended up back: for them healthcare and difficulty navigating daily chores was a night mare.  Healthcare is catching up,   Kathmandu,Pokhara and Bharatpur will have great care.  Major issue will be the lack of like minded community. Mind you your friends back home would be different, may be you must have already noted when you go back home.  ideally, a retirement community for expat would be great. Imagine 55 plus uber retirement-adult retirement community in US.  I am a decade ahead of you folks and I am hoping to get retirement community started back home.|||We are also thinking about this and maybe on a similar timeline. There's not a lot of people returning to Nepal to retire now, but I think this will change in 15 years.  I think what you think is best for your child and what phase of life she is in will be a major determining factor in this. Will she have lived in Nepal at any point before this move?   I am hopeful that infrastructure, air quality, sanitation, etc will improve in the timeframe you are looking at.|||Yes, you can do it!  Sell the US property and put funds in high yield CDs for management headache. Stay far away from your close relatives as well as any friends in Nepal when it comes to financial transactions. They will come with every opportunities to ask for money.  We just came back from Nepal after living there for 2 years with 3 kids.|||Nepal is a perfect place for retirement. Healthcare is super cheap unlike states.  People are friendly and you can earn passive income here too by becoming teacher or other jobs that are focused for expats. I know few expats here in Nepal and they are enjoying their life.  It’s not a paradise there are some problems too.  But we don’t have gun violence and environment is perfect especially in outskirts of Kathmandu.  Try thinking settling in village rather than city to truly experience Nepal.  If you have further queries then you can contact me.|||Maybe selling the house and investing that in a broad-based index fund will make your financial lives easier rather than trying to be a remote landlord?  Please look up Boglehead 3 fund portfolio. You may want to compare the performance of the 3 fund portfolio with the returns you'd get from renting out your house.   Personal finance is personal. I'm personally sick of owning a house with the constant upkeep and annoying yard work. We will likely sell the house within a year or two and rent a house.|||I would not sell the house until I spend in Nepal for few years. You never know if you want to come back after spending some time there.   But, once you are comitted to stay in Nepal, sell the house. Managing rental is a PITA. Put miney it on maeket. Live off dividens or annunity. Start investing in Roth IRA.   I think its doable with that much of money. I am assuming you make 200K a year together. Thats more than enough to retire even in USA, let alone in Nepal. You just have to save and invest.  The reason most people dont retire in Nepal has a lot to do with kids. Their kids are born in US, grew up in US, they probably will get married in US. When people age goes up, people tend to stay together with their family, people they trust. Every immediate family in US and ony two people being in Nepal might be enough for you to re-consider this in future|||I'm 27M from Nepal, currently working here in US. a I've not run the numbers yet but I do plan to retire early and settle in India. I own land in Nepal and my mother is Indian, she is on board with my idea of turning the land she owns in India into a farm house. I chose India because of political stability, better infrastructure and easier access to import services.  I might be the wrong person for advice because you clearly have put much more though into it but good to know there are others with similar plans and worries.  currently I am single and enjoying my life but everything will depend on how things look if/when I get married.|||One of the most important thing that the would be  future retiring expat looking to retire in Nepal would be the lack of amenities / clean air and pollution free environment along with no nonsense politics that we are used to in the west.  Granted that most of the people living in the western world would  have home in Kathmandu/major cities, but we need to understand that there is a glaring lack of public spaces , park and recreational resources. We also need to understand that as we age, we would need those things within a walking distance. Now you know, this will never happen in Kathmandu and major cities. You would be lucky, if you can go for a decent walk in your Neighbourhood without having to pray for your dear life, and what about the God awful  pollution and terrible air quality index (AQI).  This is where, I see a real opportunity to have a dedicated retirement community somewhere in Nepal. Imagine having a good 5 km² space (that is about the size of good adult 55+ community in the US) with all the amenities, hiking trail, bike trail, swimming pools, restaurants, kitchen, sporting  facilities. It takes about an easy half 1 million dollars at the minimum to buy a home to get into this communities here in the US.  On top of that with all the cost included, the average expense per retirement to have a decent quality life in the US for a couple would be north of $5000 excluding in the medical cost.  In Nepal, this is very much doable with an investment of around $250,000 (that will get you nice well equipped does home within a community, all the amenities, and imagine having a personal home help and on site dining venue that is well stocked and served by professional staffs, I am talking about cooks/ chefs from 5 star resorts)  At the same time, there would be no dearth of lack of medical care. Qualified Nepali physicians would be lining up to serve the expats. And let us note further the fact that with 24 seven access to helicopter, air evacuation, Kathmandu/ Pokhara/ Bharatpur would be a mere half an hour away.  I do see a definite possibility of retiring in Nepal in next 15 to 20 years, if these things would come to fruition.|||Hi,  Its a good thought. A lot changes in 16 years. Personally I think your FIRE number is low. But again, with combined annual of 220k, if you live frugally, you should be able to save a lot more in 16 years than just 300k. What you are projecting here- $3500+ npr 50k is enough for a frugal retirement of 2+1 but may be difficult if you want travel and luxury.  General health cost in Nepal is peanuts. You will need a really good insurance however to cover for something more taxing- similar to USA. Add on inflation to your FIRE number. Add on the fact that your child will have more needs in 16 years, and will have her own opinions and choices where she would want to live.|||I can speak to healthcare - Nepal can be good if not sometimes better for healthcare if you have money. I got a chance to spend 8 months last year in Nepal and did a surgery at a top hospital by a very reputable surgeon - my surgery, rest, recovery was much better and cheaper in Nepal than it would have been in the US. The story might have been different if I didn’t have money though.|||10 family can retire with this sort of wealth|||[removed]|||Let me know how will it works out planning to retire at 45.|||I think healthcare is going to be your biggest challenge, especially as you age and start accumulating all that west and tear. Kathmandu is also not a healthy place to live. I would consider selling your Kathmandu house and buying somewhere outside of the valley where the air quality is different. You didn’t state but I assume you have Nepali citizenship?  If not then there are income requirements you need to look into in order to get a retirement visa.|||I dont think that is a good idea. It is not safe here. And it wont be safe for another 20 I think. But if you do not mind that for yourself then this is the heaven|||In a similar boat.. good luck OP|||So what I am getting at is you are planning to retire after 16yrs in Nepal? If so then it's too soon to think about that. If not then wait till we are done with our election.|||Why you are only Targeting 1m for retirement. You should at least try 2-3 M with that income. Try to max out 401k contributions or best is Roth IRA account for tax free withdrawal.|||It’s a good plan. Usually here in the US you follow the 4% rule. If you can withdraw 4% from your retirement pot and live off that comfortably then you can retire. It’s cuz the stock market usually replenishes your 4% and then some so you never run out.   I’d calculate costs for living in Nepal.   If you’re a US citizen then that 50k / month from rental is also taxed as income just keep in mind you have to declare all properties and assets under your name.   The US rental you can have property management take care of it and they charge 10% fee. Comes out to roughly one month rent. Not bad for a hands off approach.   Idk if your kid is okay with not living here. It’s a personal choice and some kids like it there while some don’t. Usually the older they get the harder it is to uproot and move.   All the best! It’s never too early to plan.|||First 3 years wud be hard but after that u will question yourself that why didnt i retire early?|||Hi,   Interesting that you have asked this publicly. This has always been in my mind and always opted to Nepal than western countries. Coming to living, Nepal has far more living standard in the case of belonginess than the USA, which you would appreciate only if you have a downtime. That downtime comes especially when you aged. But to understand that you have go beyond current education dogmas.   The other things I want to highlight so that you can make decision with more horizon in place is US government decision on 401k savings. Follow news but read in between lines and then you will understand what government wants to do with your money. Next, you have to know that American houses are trash and high chances that they mayn't give that amount of return in future with the current scenario of inflation, immigration, housing bubble and dedollarization. To put things easily, there should be population to have the demand which would ultimately increase the price.|||Doing the same and lovin ittt|||Are you Nepali living in USA or US born national? That will make a big difference in terms on how soon you can adapt to.|||yes totally doable. you can rent your property in the US. have a local mantainence guy to call up if anything is needed to be done. you make good extra cash from rent.   totally doable!! good luck. let me know if you have any questions. many people have returned from the US recently and they all admit their mental health is light years ahead than in the US.",

I’ve started exploring the basics of data analysis and visualization.  My ultimate goal is to work on real-world data science projects and eventually transition into a career in this field.  I’m looking for advice on:  1. Where to start – Are there beginner-friendly resources, courses, or books you’d recommend specifically for data science?  2. Structured learning path – How can I build a step-by-step roadmap (from Python and statistics to data wrangling, visualization, and advanced analysis)?  3. Practical application – What’s the best way to gain hands-on experience (e.g., datasets, Kaggle competitions, or personal projects)?  4. Consistency and motivation – Any tips for staying consistent and motivated throughout this journey?  I’d also love to hear about your own learning experiences in data science or how you navigated your path into the field. Thanks a lot for your guidance!",

The Entrepreneurial Engine, What Drives You?  2. Moving Beyond the Idea, Your Blueprint for Action  3. The Nepali Reality, Opportunities & Hurdles  This is what AI has to summarize the video, hope this gives you some idea on what's in there;  Success isn't just about having a brilliant idea. It's about how you **dynamically blend your resources with a sharp, strategic awareness of your unique context.** For us in Nepal, that means understanding both our limitations and our unique strengths.  If you're at the idea stage, or just looking for that spark, I hope this overview helps fuel your journey!  **Original Podcast (for those interested in a deeper dive):** [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVrcEdZSHZo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVrcEdZSHZo)",

It was after decades that I learned that bhaktapur, lalitpur and even Bungmati have their own Kumari.|||When people find out that Kumari pratha was started by Malla king as an attempt to do religious syncretism of Buddhism into Hinduism - do you know Kumari can only be from Shakya and Bajracharya - they were historically Buddhist communities.  Also if you read the story of why the king started Kumari pratha, it's the most stupidest story ever - no logic, no divinity, no ethics|||She is considered incarnation of Tajelu Bhawani. To be a Kumari you need to be Bajracharya, and follow strict guildlines (no blood lost in life, no scars, etc.). You have to then go through certain tests which I am unaware of. If passed with no change in mental state, considering you have faced all ailments, you will be taken to Kumari Bhawan? Idk but yes taken somewhere. Unless the Kumari has her menstural cycle, she can continue to be Kumari. For men, it is generally advised not to marry a Kumari. When taking blessings from Kumari, you arent supposed to show your back. Thats all I know. Search more on the internet. It is an important ceremony for people as people believe Kumari gets premonition of all things that are about to happen. Hence the nickname \"The Living Goddess of Nepal\". Reddit is not a good source to gain knowledge.|||Very bad practice -- people who dare to voice against the bad social practices of western Nepal should have courage to point out to this bad practice of abusing a kid to make her a goddess happening right in the capital - let her be a human!|||You have to be from certain Newar caste to be a Kumari. It is not a royal or political process and no there is not any special thing happening. It is just a religious duty the locals do.|||Poor child|||Nothing more than Child abuse by Core Area voter in the name of culture.  This Kumari type shiit should be abolished  Fatah muzi Jatra ko naam ma chatak garne jaad khane jantu haru|||We must acknowledge the fact that Nepal is a land of tantra and supernatural practices, spirits/energies manifest themselves in different human forms. This knowledge is a legacy that goes beyond science. History has repeated itself, whenever the patron goddess of Nepal has cried the country has faced a national level sorrowful news. Former Kumari of patan Ms. Chanira bajracharya on her entire tenure as Kumari, only time she cried (and for several days) was before the royal massacre occurred. Believe it or not her emotions are a testimony of something supernatural.   In contrast, the intensity of its importance is a topic that the western world will never be able to comprehend. Hence, it isn’t very logical to label this as child abuse. The child has a pretty normal childhood behind closed doors (just additional daily rituals).|||Kumari culture is child abuse!|||This is disgusting. She is a baby, how can you take away her childhood?|||u/MaleficentObject2440, can you remove the picture of a minor girl and the name also. This is against international laws and social norms. also what is the source of your information?|||Kati ramri nani or should I say holy goddess. Lol|||So yes the former kumari Trishna Shakya is being placed by new royal kumari Arya Tara Shakya. This is because our current kumari is now 12-13 years old ie the age of puberty. So according to the tradition and rules, the Kumari is set to be replaced before she steps into her puberty and starts her period.  Since Trishna Shakya is near to her teens, the election process of the new Kumari had started after the indra jatra. In this process the head priest calls out for candidates that is girls mostly aging from 3-4 years from Shakya family.   The candidates must not have chipped her tooth, fallen out her milk teeth, or bled from anywhere nor have any scars on her body just to enter the selection process. Then the selection community examines her and her 32 characters (Battis Lakhshyan). The priest then chooses few who fits right and does tick all the boxes. Among the chosen ones further, the wife of female priest examines her body. Then the girls are made to sit in a specific puja, and kept in a dark room full of sacrifices for a night i think. The one who shows no fear and doesnot have a change of mind is to be mostly selected as the kumari. Their birth chart is analyzed as who fits the best and who is suitable to reign for the betterment of the country. As far as i have heard somewhere in the process, the girls are displayed with jewelries and one who choose the right jewelry of that taleju bhawani that was hidden, shows the trait to be selected as royal kumari.  Then after the announcement of being chosen as the royal kumari, the former kumari is to step down of her reign on Kaalraatri, is MahaAsthami. So as Aaryatara Shakya is selected as the new kumari she is set to come to the palace on the day of Asthami leaving her home behind. The same day the current Kumari Trishna Shakya will be take to her family home with full respect on her palanquin for one last time. The New kumari will step on the Palace from the front door whereas the former Kumari will step out from the Back door of the Kumari Ghar.   So this Asthami, new Kumari is set to step in the Kumari Ghar, and on Mahanavami she would be taken to Taleju Bhawani Mandir, Basantapur.|||No other Nepali superstitious religious activities can top this bad practice in Newar community.|||Feri pukulu dekhe kati sano ammoi|||Yo outsiders haru lai kehi thaha xaina tesai birodh garxa.

They don't have this culture in india which is hindu (manusmriti based caste discrimination and misogynist - widow burning etc ) and you know how girls and women are treated there.

Without solid evidence and due legal process, arrests and punishments cannot simply be carried out.

These processes require patience, legal backing, and resources.  At the same time, we must be aware that many people will try to manipulate us using anger and frustration to weaken our unity. Let’s not allow that to happen. Instead, let’s stand strong together, remain patient, and keep faith in the legal process while applying constructive pressure where needed.

This was prior to e-sewa receiving a green light to go public. This also coincidentally occurred around the time F1 decided to move its office to Pulchowk, adjacent to M&S Tower, which is basically Sirohiya's Den. It was only recently that F1 changed its office address to the F1 Building, before which it was M&S Tower.   The ban was all about control. Let's ask ourselves, who benefits the most from this control? Who was suffering from not having control?   Media? Politicians? Oligarchs?   To everyone wondering about the extent of the control. Never forget how soon videos started to vanish from TikTok during and after the protest.   This is what this entire fiasco was all about. A plot, put in place to achieve total control to serve Mission 2084.  The elections might have been scheduled for 2084, but the election campaigns would have launched months ahead. Imagine them having total control of social media going into 2084?   Even though we've ridiculed them for being 8th standard, they had an ambition- that is total control under the cloak of democracy. The creation of a deep state that benefits those with power by controlling the poor.|||Why are all the narcissists in high up positions|||Just to let you know, he's also the co-founder of f1soft which owns various products like esewa, fonepay, and has made banking app for several banks and so much more.|||Yesle tah airport ko tyo immigration system ma ni international software use garna parney thau ma aafno ghusaunu khojeko ki k vanera yesko vid dekheko thiye many months ago|||Even in reddit I had raised this concern way before but some jholeys supported him.

Then, randomly some months ago saw the same name on social media and him selling his book for helping to build industry or research center.  Then, saw his post about how he will work more for young people so he will get more votes from younger generation if another such vote occurs in the future. I was so impressed by such a positive take by this man.  But today, like many others I got to see the video of his graduation speech on Nebraska University. I searched some more on YouTube and this man has been actively saying nothing but 'my home village' and 'my country Nepal'.  His love for this nation is second to none. Even after how he has been treated by everyone including myself. Even I never bother to search online about him.  Everyone in Nepal like me need to apologize to Dr.Mahabir Pun.  His quote,\"There comes a difficult time, unusual situation that people usually don't need to go through. In that situation it is necessary to have uncommon faith and uncommon approaches to face the uncommon odds of human life.\" from the same video of graduation speech. It will never leave my brain. This man said those words on 2007 and lived by it. His uncommon faith and uncommon approaches has definitely made huge impact on me today. And hoping Nepal will follow his will of uncommon faith and uncommon approaches to face the uncommon odds of human life.  This is not a time to be wasting on excel sheets, Facebook status, conspiracy theories and on egocentric people. We won't get any better person than him to lead the change on his sector.

They are just normal people who don't want to see more unemployment and rising prices due to an influx of people. The blame, however, should go directly to the bureaucrats and the big businesses of Australia who are exploiting the immigrants and its laws by hiring cheap wages.|||I am Australian and play tennis with some wonderful Nepalis. They are lovely people and one, a Sherpa from Salleri, has become a good friend.   I will visit Nepal in early March to do the Three Passes trek and enjoy the beauty of your country.|||Thanks for your kind words. Do visit when free.|||Thankyou so much(x5) for your kind and warm words. Do visit Nepal, it's beautiful and safe <333.  Much love to you all Aussies too.|||Appreciate it mate|||Thanks for your kind appreciation. Let me tell you our Nepalese perspective.  As a Nepalese, it's really tough for us to enter Australia, first you must pass at least high school with good marks, then get a really good English test score, then you must show a significant bank balance, so your immigration policy is already filtering only the best people from other countries.   I am a Engineer myself, it's relatively easy for someone like me to immegrate to Australia, but for students of other field, you're immigration policy already make sure only the best students come in your country, and it should be that way to be honest.   Regarding your immigration issue, well I believe any country should only allow immigration if there is net positive for the country, you don't want a bunch of liabilities to come in your country, right??  So, just look at the data, you can very easily find out what communities are contributing to Australia, and what communities are hampering the country, and simply adjust the policies that way, it's really that simple.   Regarding recent protests against Immigration, well I think that's just the coverup done by the rich and elites to brainwash common Aussies so that the blame is shifted towards immigration when in fact Australia has the best immigration compared to many Western countries.   My cousin recently returned back to Nepal, they lived in Melbourne for almost 10 years, they shared the economy isn't doing great compared to past years, and the blame is being shifted solely towards immigration.|||U will be welcomed here in Nepal. The situation is back to normal.|||G’day folks, I’m an Aussie, not Nepali, but just wanted to say how bloody grateful I am to have Nepali mates here in Australia. Every Nepali I’ve met has been so kind, hard-working and just top-notch people. The ladies at my kid’s daycare are absolute legends – such gentle, caring souls. Always up for a good yarn whenever I bump into someone from Nepal.  I know we’ve had a few grumpy old conservatives carrying on about immigration lately, but honestly, most young Aussies don’t reckon like that at all. From my point of view – and from any fair-dinkum Aussie – you’re more than welcome here. Nepalese folks add heaps of value to this country, and I hope that continues.  One day I’d love to visit Nepal once things settle down there. And mate, your food – wow! I could eat momos every day, no worries.|||Can y'all please recommend your fav momo place?

            "body": "My house was vandalized in the name of \"Gen z protest.\" My dad is a civil servant, and we live in a humble 3 story house (the third story was only recently built). It was a small house when we moved in, which was 17 years ago— few months after I was born.   After working for over 25+ years for the government, this country, and its public, my dad still has a very clear history. No bribery, no corruption, no money laundering— nothing. Rising high in status and the post, he is recognized for his diligent work and highly stable work ethic.  Now, back to the present. The protestors had reached our house. I had once thought, why would anyone target our house? It's a civil servant, not some minister or anything of that sort. My father rose high due to his hard work and competitiveness, not any connection or bribery. We can all see from how my parents lived rental first (he was already a civil servant then). Only after a few months of me being born did they buy a house, not without taking loans.  I don't know why it happened because our house was aba and definitely not supposed to be a part of whatever that was. The protestors were going to burn our house, but because of it being attached to other houses, the neighbours finally calmed them down into not burning our house. Instead, they burned our bikes, went into our house, and threw things out to burn them. What's worse? When the protestors left, all the people living nearby, went in and out for 2 days straight— morning, day and night, pickng whatever things they liked amd taking it home with them as if our house was some kind of thrift store giving away our stuff for free.  We were at our relative's house, and when we saw all the black smoke coming from the direction of our house, we were devastated. \"Our house got burnt.\" That's what we thought. As i was the oldest child in the family, i couldn't let myself break down. I can still hear those devastating gut-wrenching cries and sobs from my mom, haunting me like a ghost every time i close my eyes.   I am a college student. My uniform is gone, and so are my books and copies. My sister is in middle school. Her uniform and books and copies are nowhere to be found as well.   Our money and jewelries, of course, are gone too. The same money my father earned and mind you, a civil servant's earnings isn't much. Only enough to label us as a middle-class family. The same money my sister sent us, her hard-working money(which was in dollars at that).  Our clothes, bags, and even utensils are gone, and so are our food storage(stuff). My mom is someone who saves money. However, she can just like my dad because she knows she has experienced the hardships with my dad. Because they know. Because they have experienced hardships and complications in their life. Because they have faced obstacles.  We have never wore any designers, no luxury fashion brand. All are affordable and comfortable. The only designer my mom and dad ever even had is when my big sister from abroad visited us and surprised us with some designer bags (which she also got scolded for spending so much because she is still studying and working in between only).  Our guests'clothes, laptops, phones, everything is gone. Me and my sisters' savings and my mom's little spending for managing our household— nothing is left. Not even our puja ko thaan(a small place we had to worship and pray gods).   We have tons of debts. I am old enough to learn that by now. Now that our house was totally and utterly robbed and vandalized while my dad kept on working for the same public, we have nowhere to sleep on. No clothes to wear. There is no place to shower or bathe.  We had to hide away from our own house we once called home to keep ourselves alive. My father was lucky enough to be safe because if it was even a few seconds late, it would have all been over. We were fortunate to be alive, even though we had done nothing wrong to people.  Morality? Humanity? Conscience? Guilt? Remorse? None. The same people, the same public, that my dad is working so hard to serve with his whole heart, has done this to him, to his family.  Gen z, huh? Protest against corruption, huh? My dad, having the cleanest history— no corruption, bribery, connection, whatsoever. So why our house? Why? What had we ever done to them? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.   I have no hope left. None for this country, none for the people of this country. This is now a country full of robbers and thieves. Humans are jealous. Humans are greedy. People are full of themselves, full of greediness and selfishness. In my heart, humans are creatures who have ruined any hope for more in me and my family. My father, who once poured his heart for this country and the people in this country, is on the verge of giving up on it.  You people, opportunists, and robbers who call yourselves voice of justice— I'll be watching, watching who you are going to tame to pull this country back together. People like my dad who are so wronged will be out of all this mess soon, Who are you going to pull to patch this broken country? I'll be watching. I'll be happily watching everything crumble and fall apart with your \"justice.\" You have given the opportunists a sense of win. You've let them think anything is possible, and now, everything will fall apart while you watch everything crumble in front of your eyes.  Lastly, I'd like to be a little vulgar and uncensored. If you are uncomfortable, scroll away.  Whoever has participated in vandalizing my house and robbing it empty— You are going to see hell and worse. I hope you feel yourself rotting away. I hope you don't think it's over now because whatever you stole, it will haunt you for the rest of your life and afterwards. I will forever haunt you, even in your dreams, converting it into a disastrous nightmare. You'll see hell. You are going to suffer.  [Edit: I never expected this post to gain so many views. I’m very grateful to those who are wishing me and my family well, thank you very much for that. And I also understand those who might raise an eyebrow on this post and not believe in my words. It’s up to you, whether you want to believe me or not. I have no intention of forcing it on you.   I’d also like to request anyone who knows me through this post to maintain my privacy and not reveal anything about me or my family on the internet(please refrain any stalker behavior). I have never gone public like this and I also don’t like the attention this is getting(makes me uncomfortable) but I’m going to keep this post so other people who have experienced something like this can be open about it here. Let this be a safe space for those to speak up.]",

While this was an absolutely needed protest and it did bring much-needed attention and change, we also can’t deny the darker side of it. While the deaths of innocent people rightfully shook everyone and fueled the anger, more innocent lives were lost in the chaos that followed.  Gen Z cannot ignore the fact that others died in fires, or that people were looted and harmed during the unrest. It’s easy to say the movement was hijacked by goons, but the videos and reports show some protesters themselves vandalizing property and stealing from people who had nothing to do with the issue. Ironically, those who stood up against corruption ended up damaging the lives and livelihoods of ordinary citizens.   Those responsible should be held accountable for it!!!

Aafno garne kei aaukat chhaina, budhi chhaina, tesaile everyone who's more successful than them is automatically corrupt.  No one cares about justice or doing the right thing.

Yo sub ma ni I've been reading a lot of posts and \"Gen Z\" is no different. They're celebrating the lack of law and order for different reasons. The people celebrating it won't realize that even though their homes are safe today, there's no guarantee it'll stay safe - all it takes is some random person claiming you're corrupt and start throwing rocks for others to follow suit. Tes pachi chahi police marne, ghar jalaune kura support gareko sab niskinchha.  I'm glad you're at least safe and I hope it gets better for you. Malai ni yo desh ma kei hope chhaina.

I stood against violence, yet these people, boys and girls who enjoy burning houses and spreading chaos, are still among us. The moment I condemn their brutality, they rush to label me as “jholay,” as if that insult could erase their own guilt. Their selective outrage is sickening. And now, when things are finally settling down, looking back in retrospect, it is clear that we failed as a society. We do not deserve good leaders when, at the first sign of crisis, we loot, we vandalize, we burn homes, and then pretend we are pure. I am disgusted and angry at those who glorify violence and betray even the most basic sense of humanity.|||I remember reading a post asking folks to expose corrupt civil servants who are using \"iphone\" and having a home in Kathmandu.

I can tell you, they were criminals. Not GenZ. If I were you I would have  tried to find out who did it, be it with a handheld or surveillance  camera or something, then put each in jail one by one or tell to compensate. Those days were literal anarchy. And even shopkeepers etc were robbed .   That was the sad part of GenZ protest. for a while the country became total anarchy.

May be police or forensic experts, I dont know should do proper investigation, find the criminals, put them in jail.

With all due respect to Sumana, she's a much needed breath of fresh air in Nepali politics, I have to disagree with her on one major thing.  She says Rabi needs to step down as RSP leader because she thinks that the best interest of the party and that's what people/youths want. That's where I think she's misunderstood and wrong.  From genZ upto the aged ones, most of them want Rabi in the leadership. That's why he got the highest number of votes among all leaders in the last election.  What I think is that Sumana saw many youth social media activists, who doesn't know politics and are misinformed and those who doesn't represent the overall youths of Nepal at all, they made video saying \"we don't want Rabi\", \"he's same old, corrupt\" which led to Sumana thinking Rabi isn't wanted by current youths and she need to get out of that party to be the voice of the youths.|||Good going on",

Feudal legacy: Until very recently, we had a mostly feudal socio-economic system. With modernization, concepts such as meritocracy and individualism and state-guaranteed human rights came to the fore in the public psyche. Being wealthy in this context basically means you're going to be perceived as someone who's undeserving.  2. Limited philanthropy: Wealthy businesses and individuals rarely invest in public works. If they do, it's a token donation. If it's actually a big sum that really makes tangible impact, the media isn't too keen on spreading the word. As an adjacent point, media can also play a pretty decisive role in inspiring people to engage in wealth generating activities. Our media outlets appear to be forever locked into the sphere of politics and immaterial commentary.  3. Corrupt political class: Let's be real. Most rich people in Nepal are rich because they have somehow benefited from being involved in political (read partisan) affairs voluntarily or otherwise (e.g. most big businesses don't have a choice). This is most especially true for full-time politicians whose actual legitimate source of income is insignificant compared to the amount of wealth they are able to accrue out of seemingly nowhere. This breeds resentment in the minds of the general populace who have no political recourse.  4. Crony communism: This is connected to point 3 above. People have been sold the dream of an egalitarian society for as long as democracy has existed in this country. However, the leaders never deliver anything remotely close to it, instead enriching themselves and their cronies any chance they get - all the while pinning the blame on the bourgeoisie.  These are just the major factors I can think of. So, of course people are going to see the rich and the privileged as the enemy regardless of how they made their fortunes.|||This is such a pathetic video if you look at it from a different perspective.

            "comments": "This is an extraordinary circumstance. There is precedent of parliamentary procedures being bypassed after revolution.  There is a concept called doctorine of revolutionary legality. This is not a first time a revolution has happened and main demands of the revolution are contradictory to the provisions as per supreme law/constitution of that nation.  End of apartheid in South Africa, Independence of India, America these directly contradicted the constitution at that time. Panchayat system made parties illegal in Nepal revolution happened against that and Birendra accepted multiparty democracy. Bolsheviks revolution of Russia and french revolution both were against constitutional provisions of that time. Most revolution that overthrow authoritarian government like Philippines and Arab spring went against the provisions of then constitution.   Sovereignty of people ultimately supercedes constitutional provisions. People themselves are the ultimate source of law. Constitutions themselves can be scrapped if it contradicts popular sovereignty.   That being said the person speaking in the video raises good points and he doesn't seem to be spreading misinformation intentionally its just that the door he thinks are closed are not necessarily closed it is entirely possible that next election will choose directly elected PM but for that president has to support it. The provisions mentioned in the constitution can be bypassed because this is an extraordinary circumstance and legality of ignoring constitutional provision comes from revolution itself it's the will of people.   After election the courts can legitimize it after the fact on basis of doctorine of necessity as those procedure/unconstitutional changes although not allowed as per constitution were the needed to protect sovereignty vested in people and was the demand of people. There is precedent and this has been done.   The big problem there is obviously possible foreign interference.   Another strong point this person makes is that an agreement should have been made. even now with interim PM an agreement summarizing demand and demanded changes can be made that agreement will have legality by revolution.

I am not a constitutional expert and while I agree with part of what he said my question is, if the whole directly elected PM/President bill and the dissolution of state governments require a two-thirds majority in both the Upper and Lower House how would that even be possible? Why would the hon ones ever agree to that?  The voice reached there through the protests so can’t the President directly pass an ordinance or bill to amend these rules? Because the honorable members are never going to do that through the House and that has already become clear at this point. Does that mean the voice from the streets has no value?

Most Nepali parents, except financially secure ones, are human traffickers and they traffic what they love and cherish the most; THEIR CHILDREN.   Nepali parents push their kids to leave Nepal under the banner of a “better future.” Sure, it can lead to a more secure life, but it’s not the whole truth.  This prejudice eludes parents into FOMO , worried that their child—their future cash cow—might miss the golden ticket to success. In trying to break free from poverty, they end up chaining their children to a new kind of slavery. Some kids walk into it willingly. Most don’t even realize what’s happening until they’re already too deep to turn back.  A few break free with raw talent, hard work, or rare skills. But the rest? They’re stuck grinding in the rat race. Meanwhile the parents gets addicted to their children’s income to sustain the newfound luxury, they could never afford on their own.  While Nepali government stays in the background. Complicit. Systematically rotten.    P.S.: This is a skewed angle of observation. Pardon me.  Edit: Dont assume my personal life. Dont let this post hit home. People reading it and being defensive. Just chill, dont take it personally.   Come on man. Atleast be open minded.  Read it with detachment.   Edit II: I didnt consider the fact that people love to be on their moral high horse.   Also parents are humans and they can succumb to law of human nature especially who are living in survival mode. Stop acting like they’re a perfect beacon of virtue. You can love them better accepting the flaws not ignoring them.   And people preaching “bau ama le etro sacrifice garyo ani hurkayo badhayo..”. So, does that mean your love for parents is transactional? and if they were terrible parents would you not love them or take care of them?",

In Nepal, many parents encourage their children to seek opportunities abroad not out of greed or exploitation, but out of love and hope. For countless families, this is a sacrifice born of necessity. They send their children away with heavy hearts, praying for a future brighter than the one they themselves endured.  To label these parents as \"human traffickers\" is deeply painful and unfair. It disregards the emotional toll, the cultural values, and the economic hardships that shape such decisions. Yes, the system is flawed. Yes, the government must do more. But to reduce this complex reality to accusations of slavery and addiction to income is to ignore the dignity and struggle of ordinary Nepali families.  Let us not confuse desperation with malice. Let us not judge without walking in their shoes. Instead, let’s advocate for better policies, stronger support systems, and a future where no parent feels forced to choose between love and livelihood.|||[deleted]|||This is next level whining.

Please go educate yourself on the effects of human trafficking, how prevalent it is even in today's world and the stories from victims that have \"escaped\".

It doesnt happen only with those going abroad, but with those living in Nepal as well. I have seen it happen to teachers mainly. Majority of the secondary school teachers are a clear victim of such traps as majority of them wanted to do something else, be someone better like an engineer, doctor however since their parents forced them to earn money and not leave the sustainable source of income.   And obviously it happens to the lower manpower as well. Welp, whom can we blame for this though.

While writing this comment, I remember the video of this one mother crying when the social media banned happened saying \"sarkar ma Mero bachha haru sanga bolna payena vaney marchu\". I don't know what background you come from and I don't want to assume but I know for a fact that the parents just want the best for their kids and being poor, they know suffering better than the people who are well off and they don't want their kids to inherit their suffering.|||Kun insta influnecer ko gideo herera aeu LMAO..|||There is surely some truth to it. In my view the whole family structure we have, lack of education in our household and blindly leading the life causes parents to support the slavery you are describing here. Since parents devote all their life for kids to be able to afford a better education they rationalize the kids should be supporting them or their aspirations. While most Nepalese parents are just parents and poor people, they are definitely struggling with basic stuff and it’s humane for a kid to help them. However to kids I suggest them to do it in moderation and make sure they are not doing a lot and making their own life tougher.

Nepal is not right for retirement for folks from West at this time but I am very hopeful it will have   the infrastructure in next 2 decades.    Few peoples who I know have retired in Nepal are those who have started early in their life, mid 50s, they have been active there as well and have gelled well. Also know few who went there in there late 60s but ended up back: for them healthcare and difficulty navigating daily chores was a night mare.  Healthcare is catching up,   Kathmandu,Pokhara and Bharatpur will have great care.  Major issue will be the lack of like minded community. Mind you your friends back home would be different, may be you must have already noted when you go back home.  ideally, a retirement community for expat would be great. Imagine 55 plus uber retirement-adult retirement community in US.  I am a decade ahead of you folks and I am hoping to get retirement community started back home.|||We are also thinking about this and maybe on a similar timeline. There's not a lot of people returning to Nepal to retire now, but I think this will change in 15 years.  I think what you think is best for your child and what phase of life she is in will be a major determining factor in this. Will she have lived in Nepal at any point before this move?   I am hopeful that infrastructure, air quality, sanitation, etc will improve in the timeframe you are looking at.|||Yes, you can do it!  Sell the US property and put funds in high yield CDs for management headache. Stay far away from your close relatives as well as any friends in Nepal when it comes to financial transactions. They will come with every opportunities to ask for money.  We just came back from Nepal after living there for 2 years with 3 kids.|||Nepal is a perfect place for retirement. Healthcare is super cheap unlike states.  People are friendly and you can earn passive income here too by becoming teacher or other jobs that are focused for expats. I know few expats here in Nepal and they are enjoying their life.  It’s not a paradise there are some problems too.  But we don’t have gun violence and environment is perfect especially in outskirts of Kathmandu.  Try thinking settling in village rather than city to truly experience Nepal.  If you have further queries then you can contact me.|||Maybe selling the house and investing that in a broad-based index fund will make your financial lives easier rather than trying to be a remote landlord?  Please look up Boglehead 3 fund portfolio. You may want to compare the performance of the 3 fund portfolio with the returns you'd get from renting out your house.   Personal finance is personal. I'm personally sick of owning a house with the constant upkeep and annoying yard work. We will likely sell the house within a year or two and rent a house.|||I would not sell the house until I spend in Nepal for few years. You never know if you want to come back after spending some time there.   But, once you are comitted to stay in Nepal, sell the house. Managing rental is a PITA. Put miney it on maeket. Live off dividens or annunity. Start investing in Roth IRA.   I think its doable with that much of money. I am assuming you make 200K a year together. Thats more than enough to retire even in USA, let alone in Nepal. You just have to save and invest.  The reason most people dont retire in Nepal has a lot to do with kids. Their kids are born in US, grew up in US, they probably will get married in US. When people age goes up, people tend to stay together with their family, people they trust. Every immediate family in US and ony two people being in Nepal might be enough for you to re-consider this in future|||I'm 27M from Nepal, currently working here in US. a I've not run the numbers yet but I do plan to retire early and settle in India.

I chose India because of political stability, better infrastructure and easier access to import services.  I might be the wrong person for advice because you clearly have put much more though into it but good to know there are others with similar plans and worries.  currently I am single and enjoying my life but everything will depend on how things look if/when I get married.|||One of the most important thing that the would be  future retiring expat looking to retire in Nepal would be the lack of amenities / clean air and pollution free environment along with no nonsense politics that we are used to in the west.  Granted that most of the people living in the western world would  have home in Kathmandu/major cities, but we need to understand that there is a glaring lack of public spaces , park and recreational resources. We also need to understand that as we age, we would need those things within a walking distance. Now you know, this will never happen in Kathmandu and major cities. You would be lucky, if you can go for a decent walk in your Neighbourhood without having to pray for your dear life, and what about the God awful  pollution and terrible air quality index (AQI).  This is where, I see a real opportunity to have a dedicated retirement community somewhere in Nepal. Imagine having a good 5 km² space (that is about the size of good adult 55+ community in the US) with all the amenities, hiking trail, bike trail, swimming pools, restaurants, kitchen, sporting  facilities. It takes about an easy half 1 million dollars at the minimum to buy a home to get into this communities here in the US.  On top of that with all the cost included, the average expense per retirement to have a decent quality life in the US for a couple would be north of $5000 excluding in the medical cost.  In Nepal, this is very much doable with an investment of around $250,000 (that will get you nice well equipped does home within a community, all the amenities, and imagine having a personal home help and on site dining venue that is well stocked and served by professional staffs, I am talking about cooks/ chefs from 5 star resorts)  At the same time, there would be no dearth of lack of medical care. Qualified Nepali physicians would be lining up to serve the expats. And let us note further the fact that with 24 seven access to helicopter, air evacuation, Kathmandu/ Pokhara/ Bharatpur would be a mere half an hour away.  I do see a definite possibility of retiring in Nepal in next 15 to 20 years, if these things would come to fruition.|||Hi,  Its a good thought. A lot changes in 16 years. Personally I think your FIRE number is low. But again, with combined annual of 220k, if you live frugally, you should be able to save a lot more in 16 years than just 300k. What you are projecting here- $3500+ npr 50k is enough for a frugal retirement of 2+1 but may be difficult if you want travel and luxury.  General health cost in Nepal is peanuts. You will need a really good insurance however to cover for something more taxing- similar to USA. Add on inflation to your FIRE number. Add on the fact that your child will have more needs in 16 years, and will have her own opinions and choices where she would want to live.|||I can speak to healthcare - Nepal can be good if not sometimes better for healthcare if you have money. I got a chance to spend 8 months last year in Nepal and did a surgery at a top hospital by a very reputable surgeon - my surgery, rest, recovery was much better and cheaper in Nepal than it would have been in the US. The story might have been different if I didn’t have money though.|||10 family can retire with this sort of wealth|||[removed]|||Let me know how will it works out planning to retire at 45.|||I think healthcare is going to be your biggest challenge, especially as you age and start accumulating all that west and tear. Kathmandu is also not a healthy place to live. I would consider selling your Kathmandu house and buying somewhere outside of the valley where the air quality is different. You didn’t state but I assume you have Nepali citizenship?  If not then there are income requirements you need to look into in order to get a retirement visa.|||I dont think that is a good idea. It is not safe here. And it wont be safe for another 20 I think. But if you do not mind that for yourself then this is the heaven|||In a similar boat.. good luck OP|||So what I am getting at is you are planning to retire after 16yrs in Nepal? If so then it's too soon to think about that. If not then wait till we are done with our election.|||Why you are only Targeting 1m for retirement. You should at least try 2-3 M with that income. Try to max out 401k contributions or best is Roth IRA account for tax free withdrawal.|||It’s a good plan. Usually here in the US you follow the 4% rule. If you can withdraw 4% from your retirement pot and live off that comfortably then you can retire. It’s cuz the stock market usually replenishes your 4% and then some so you never run out.   I’d calculate costs for living in Nepal.   If you’re a US citizen then that 50k / month from rental is also taxed as income just keep in mind you have to declare all properties and assets under your name.   The US rental you can have property management take care of it and they charge 10% fee. Comes out to roughly one month rent. Not bad for a hands off approach.   Idk if your kid is okay with not living here. It’s a personal choice and some kids like it there while some don’t. Usually the older they get the harder it is to uproot and move.   All the best! It’s never too early to plan.|||First 3 years wud be hard but after that u will question yourself that why didnt i retire early?|||Hi,   Interesting that you have asked this publicly. This has always been in my mind and always opted to Nepal than western countries. Coming to living, Nepal has far more living standard in the case of belonginess than the USA, which you would appreciate only if you have a downtime. That downtime comes especially when you aged. But to understand that you have go beyond current education dogmas.   The other things I want to highlight so that you can make decision with more horizon in place is US government decision on 401k savings. Follow news but read in between lines and then you will understand what government wants to do with your money. Next, you have to know that American houses are trash and high chances that they mayn't give that amount of return in future with the current scenario of inflation, immigration, housing bubble and dedollarization. To put things easily, there should be population to have the demand which would ultimately increase the price.|||Doing the same and lovin ittt|||Are you Nepali living in USA or US born national? That will make a big difference in terms on how soon you can adapt to.|||yes totally doable. you can rent your property in the US. have a local mantainence guy to call up if anything is needed to be done. you make good extra cash from rent.   totally doable!! good luck. let me know if you have any questions. many people have returned from the US recently and they all admit their mental health is light years ahead than in the US.",

He's also finicky, easily agitated, set in his ways and maybe a bit off his prime to take a minister role.

If we simply follow who gains the most out of the social media ban:  -- Old political parties, against the voices and influence of *new* political forces  -- Mainstream media group like Kantipur, against decentralized and social reporting -- And Bichaulias like Asgar Ali  It's no brainer that all these 3 forces were together in banning tiktok a few years back, and recently, the entire social media",

Right after my final semester exams, I lost my job and haven’t been able to land another job or freelance project since.

Now, after not writing a single line of code for over two months and spending most of my days watching YouTube farm tours, learning about crops, livestock, and regenerative agriculture, I’m wondering if this is just burnout talking or a genuine calling.  Has anyone here actually made the leap from tech to farming (or any completely different field)? What was it like financially and mentally? Any lessons or regrets you’d share?  I’m trying to figure out whether I should push harder to stay in tech for a while or lean into this urge and start small with agriculture.

Are you sure you would want to do farming full time as a job/career? If you think you have a vision and can achieve a fulfilling life then sure why not, but you probably should talk to some experts and get an idea of what it entails. Or shadow someone in the business closely first.  Also if you really want to leave tech then you can choose any field I am assuming youre still young - be it farming or some other thing. If you feel you dont have enough experience to pull yourself a job at this point or just the market is saturated, try specializing in something in tech? like AI/ML? Data? then apply for jobs. It could be online certs or a short term degree (esp if you want to do in overseas.) Remember inexperience is much as an opportunity to learn/explore  more.  Or you could do 50/50 and spend some time researching on the farming business and also upskilling in tech.

The best investment I see as of right now is cold storage for fruits and vegetables. There are enough farmers who will work to produce but the hardship for them has been for timely rearing and storage during the season so this can be offloaded into the market during off season. This is how off season fruits are made available even during off season abroad. This concept is relatively new to Nepal, if you move into this market first, you will have competitive edge. I am engaged in poultry currently and my company does have cold chain system so I know how it works (specifically for chicken) and the model is very rewarding.|||I want and maybe ready to do it.

This isn't just about a bad interview, it feels like a deliberate strategy to exploit job seekers for free labor.  I went through **multiple** rounds of interviews over several weeks. Everything seemed promising. The conversations were positive, and they talked about a great fit for their team. Then came the \"final\" task: to design a comprehensive digital marketing campaign.  I spent days on this. I researched their brands, analysed their competitors, and built out a full strategy, complete with campaign ideas, target audiences, content plans, and performance metrics. I treated it like a real, paid project because I genuinely wanted the job and to show my capabilities.  I submitted the work, feeling confident. Then... nothing. Total radio silence. I followed up, but no response. The most infuriating part? The reason given was a flimsy, nonsensical excuse that had nothing to do with the work I submitted.  This isn't an isolated incident. I've heard from others who have gone through the exact same process with them. They get you to design a full campaign, which they can then use or adapt, and then they ghost you or reject you on some silly pretext. It's a blatant exploitation of job seekers' time and skills.  If you're a digital marketer in Nepal and you're considering applying to IMS Group, be warned. This is not a legitimate hiring process. It's a fishing expedition for free campaign ideas. Save your time and your work for a company that respects candidates and values their professional effort.  They were still hiring 2 days ago and I gave the interview 3 months ago.",

I’m curious about a few things:  * Is this actually true by law? Do Nepali tech companies really follow these rules? * How exactly is the allowance calculated? Is it a full extra month’s salary, or something else? * What if I haven’t completed a full year in the company, am I still eligible?",

In the case absent such a request, the festival expense shall be provided at the time of Dashain festival every year.  37(3): A labor who has not completed one year of service period on or before the day of payment of the festival expense shall be entitled to such expense in proportion to the period of service he or she has completed.   दफा ३७: चार्डपर्व खर्च पाउने  ३७(१): आफ्नो धर्म, संस्कृति तथा परम्परा अनुसार मनाइने चाडपर्वको लागि प्रत्येक श्रमिकले खाईपाई आएको एक महिनाको आधारभूत पारिश्रमिक बराबरको रकम प्रत्येक वर्ष चाडपर्व खर्चको रूपमा पाउनेछ ।  ३७(२): उपदफा (१) बमोजिमको चाडपर्व खर्च श्रमिकले एक आर्थिक वर्षमा एकपटक आफ्नो धर्म, संस्कृति, परम्परा अनुसार मनाइने मुख्य चाडपर्वको अवसरमा भुक्तानी लिन रोजगारदाता समक्ष लिखित अनुरोध गर्न सक्नेछ । त्यस्तो अनुरोध नगरेको अवस्थामा प्रत्येक वर्षको बडादशैंमा चाडपर्व खर्च भुक्तानी दिनु पर्नेछ ।  ३७(३): चाडपर्व खर्च भुक्तानी दिइने दिनसम्ममा एक वर्ष सेवा अवधि पूरा नभएको श्रमिकले निजले गरेको सेवा अवधिको अनुपातमा चाडपर्व खर्च पाउनेछ ।|||Yes it should be but muji conpany le regular monthy salary nai deko chaina.

Company/employee performance base ma chai company profit bonus ho dine which is not mandatory and depends on the prodfit.|||Even if you haven’t completed full year, the company should give as per the months you have worked well at least the companies I worked for used to give tesari but Nepal ko companies haru ali chor cha so na dina ni ber chaina|||Hamro ma chai 1 year complete vaye pachi matra paucha 1 month ko basic salary|||Yes it's mandatory as per Nepal Labor Act. All organizations must follow this rule else they will be fined and held liable. If your organization or others are not providing festival bonus, you can file a official complaint. Not sure how to do that but I am sure you can get that info very easily.|||It's not a bonus, it's an allowance. Bonus is dependent on company performance, allowance is not. All employees are entitled to the festival allowance. It's not specific to just Dashain and not even called Dashain allowance. If you are not a Hindu or do not celebrate Dashain you can ask the company to provide you the allowance at other times of the year.|||Practically chai  The rationality of giving Dashain bonus is not on projection of years you will work, rather than its on the duration you have worked, so if you have resigned from company and your last day is after festival disbursement, you are eligible to bonus. But if you have your last day before disbursement, sad but company usually don't provide you bonus, this might be due to legal hassle of disbursing after employee is no longer company's employee but anyways it saves company money so they won't. Whereas performance bonus or company bonus or project bonus is different, mostly they are used in reference to each other for disbursement calculation. eg. your performance can be used for calculating how much company's profit bonus you will get, or even for project bonus.  Yes, company do give festival allowance, but they do manage it in optimal way, instead of calling it bonus, they do 13 months of pay coz bonus will deduct flat tax (maybe 25%). With 13 months of pay, you will get it along your yearly tax bracket.  But things might change when employee worked less than 1 year, some company require you to work at least 6 months for any bonus eligibility, some based on number of months worked, some just gives you bonus despite your working month, or some of you can negotiate in advance to get bonus while joining which will override any rule otherwise. So, before you join, make sure you clear this eligibility as this is more based on company.  And some company does this bonus calculation based on basic salary rather than your regular salary, this also needs to be cleared in advance.  My experience so far has been good, it was either based on number of months or full bonus but never had calculation done based on basic salary rather than on regular salary, which I cleared it prior to joining. Also on one company, I did join 3 months prior to Dashain and asked for full bonus during negotiation which they agreed and received accordingly. The reason I put forward was, as I was eligible to Dashain bonus on company which I was leaving, I would either have joining date after Dashain or join earlier and receive bonus.|||Is this only for Nepali companies or foreign branches Nepali company too?|||Yess, dinai parchha.

            "body": "About fifteen years ago, many of us spent hours enjoying games on our Nokia keypad phones or other classic devices running Symbian OS (though brands like Samsung and Motorola were around, Nokia often ruled the roost!). We either frantically search the web for games or head to an electronics shop and ask, \"Dai Dai yesma(sd card) game haldinuna?\" before loading a ton of them onto our SD cards.  However, a major hassle was finding a game that actually matched our phone's screen resolution. Some games were half screen, some were overly zoomed, and the ones that fit perfectly often turned out to be, well, not so great. Despite the screen struggles, those original Java games were special many were unique, story focused, and almost entirely ad-free (Ads here, Ads there, Ads everywhere. We need nokia legacy back).  Recently, the nostalgia hit me hard, and I desperately wanted to replay them. The irony? I had exchange my old phones years ago (for indestructible chiya khaney glass that can survive metoriod strike and last for eternity). My other devices were either lost or simply not working anymore. I started searching the internet and found a great way to play these classic Symbian/Java games on Android. I am only going to share the first method because the other couple of methods I tried were quite laggy.  Some of you might already know this trick, but for others (like me until recently) who are still wondering how to play these games like back, this is for you. (Since I have an Android, this method might not work for Apple users).  Method I use:  Using J2ME Loader  Install J2ME Loader: This emulator is free and available on the Google Play Store. Download Your Java Games: Use Google to search for your favorite titles or visit dedicated sites. Some popular options are Dertz, Mobiles24, and Phoneky. Phoneky is my personal favorite because it makes browsing for the exact games you want simple and quick. (NOTE: PLEASE DOWNLOAD GAMES WITH 240×320 SCREEN RESOLUTION ONLY. IT WILL PERFECTLY STRETCH TO YOUR SMARTPHONE SCREEN)  Launch Games Using J2ME Loader:  Open the J2ME Loader app. Tap the \"+\" icon or the \"Add Game\" button. Navigate to the location where you downloaded the .jar file (this is the game file). Select the game to add it to your list in the app. Tap on the game's icon to start playing! (Pro-Tip: You can also go into the settings to configure the key mapping to suit your playing style.)",

For example, if you’re unhappy with Ncell’s network but don’t want the hassle of updating your number everywhere, you could port it to NTC.  **Benefits of SIM porting:**   - Keep the same number while moving to a better provider   - Choose based on network quality and cheaper plans   - Push telecoms to give better service through real competition    Right now, we face problems when one network provider fails to give proper service. They don’t listen to us, and we have no option but to stay stuck with them.    Many countries already have this system. Nepal has been talking about it for years, but nothing has happened.    We should **pressure the government and regulators** to make it a reality. Number portability protects users, not companies, and it’s time Nepal moved forward with it.",

Search for \" How to dual boot Windows and (your preferred linux distro)\". You can remove Windows once you are comfortable with Linux, if you want.  3. If you can spend a bit more, upgrade the RAM.

All the best.|||Here’s an example: while writing a \\`PUT\\` method in .NET, I relied on ChatGPT to get it working.  \\`\\`\\`csharp  public ValidationDTO UpdateUser(int id, UserDetail userDetail)  {  if (userDetail == null) return new ValidationDTO { Message = \"User data cannot be null.\" };  var entity = \\_unitOfWork.UserRepository  .GetQuerable(u => [u.Id](http://u.Id) == id)  .FirstOrDefault();  if (entity == null) return new ValidationDTO { Message = \"User not found.\" };  // Update allowed fields  entity.Username = (userDetail.Username ?? string.Empty).Trim();  entity.Password = (userDetail.Password ?? string.Empty).Trim();  entity.FullName = (userDetail.FullName ?? string.Empty).Trim();  entity.IsActive = userDetail.IsActive;  \\_unitOfWork.UserRepository.Update(entity);  \\_unitOfWork.Commit();  return new ValidationDTO { IsSuccess = true, Message = \"User updated successfully.\" };  }  \\`\\`\\`|||Here is how you can simple make your own input function like python in rust to avoid having to parse and trim multiple times:   ``` fn input<T: std::str::FromStr>(msg: &str) -> Result<T> {         print!(\"{msg}\");         std::io::stdout().flush().expect(\"error\");          let mut input_str = String::new();         std::io::stdin().readLine(&mut input_str).unwrap();          input_str.trim().parse().unwrap() } ```  You can use it then like ``` fn main() {        let num: i32 = input(\"enter number\");        let floatnum: f32 = input(\"enter float\");        let strings: String = input(\"enter strings\"); } ```  Though since our generic T has fromStr trait, only certain type that support conversion from string are supported.",

This was prior to e-sewa receiving a green light to go public. This also coincidentally occurred around the time F1 decided to move its office to Pulchowk, adjacent to M&S Tower, which is basically Sirohiya's Den. It was only recently that F1 changed its office address to the F1 Building, before which it was M&S Tower.   The ban was all about control. Let's ask ourselves, who benefits the most from this control? Who was suffering from not having control?   Media? Politicians? Oligarchs?   To everyone wondering about the extent of the control. Never forget how soon videos started to vanish from TikTok during and after the protest.   This is what this entire fiasco was all about. A plot, put in place to achieve total control to serve Mission 2084.  The elections might have been scheduled for 2084, but the election campaigns would have launched months ahead. Imagine them having total control of social media going into 2084?   Even though we've ridiculed them for being 8th standard, they had an ambition- that is total control under the cloak of democracy. The creation of a deep state that benefits those with power by controlling the poor.|||Why are all the narcissists in high up positions|||Just to let you know, he's also the co-founder of f1soft which owns various products like esewa, fonepay, and has made banking app for several banks and so much more.|||Yesle tah airport ko tyo immigration system ma ni international software use garna parney thau ma aafno ghusaunu khojeko ki k vanera yesko vid dekheko thiye many months ago|||Even in reddit I had raised this concern way before but some jholeys supported him.

So all her friends who worked with her who called her out were true. Engineering ma naam na niskeko ani Architecture ma 3rd list ma naam niskeko. Her Pulchowk project being paid and done by someone else, asking for help from classmates here and at Harvard, not a single thing was done by her and having the audacity to take credit for other’s teamwork.   Topper hoina one semester ko project ma aru ko kaam present garera winner bhaeko ho. Always knew she is faking being an intellectual but this is diabolical. Everyone needs to watch this! She emphasized she is a topper at Miss Nepal or Miss World platform. Unbelievably embarrassing!  Her entire family sees nothing wrong with recalculating board exam.

OR 2. Her family is CORRUPT enough for certain people to have a personal vendetta against her and deliberately tried to ensure her results are tempered with.

Lets share this video and see what does shrinkhala lovers has to say. She is so opportunistic and selfish and its so sad to see people actually believe her.|||This ability to re-total is a privilege.

If we continue to leg pull , gossip and stop questioning the system we are very much alike the generation you are pointing fingers at. There is a quote that states \" Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people\". I really hope Nepal does not end up being the country full of small minds. Come on guys, we are better than this.  And FYI,  Exam withheld doesnot necessarily mean person has failed the exam.  FYI, corruption stops via a good systemic change.

He is no less than Shrinkhala’s husband, who was indirectly engaging with his ex.

I am not in favor of anyone in particular, but if we look at things rationally, none of them are truly as good as they appear. We need to stop idolizing individuals blindly. We did the same with Shrinkhala, first lifting her up and later trying to bring her down. Similarly, let’s not put Sisan on a pedestal either. At this moment, these individuals are not important enough to deserve so much attention. Instead, we should be focusing on posts and discussions that demand transparency from the current government. Leaders like K.P. Oli and Sher Bahadur Deuba were once elected in a time when people were desperate for hope. Many believed that by collapsing the monarchy and restoring democracy, everything would improve. People trusted them blindly, thinking they would lead like one of us. But history shows us how that trust turned into disappointment, largely because nobody asked for accountability and transparency. Let’s not fall into the same trap again. Rather than getting distracted by opportunistic figures, let’s talk about the government, demand justice for the young martyrs, and focus on the truly important issues.|||Aba dear brother vanney response chahiyo, 😃😀|||He thinks she's the greatest minds!

His stories clearly reflect how miserable he has become as a person. A lot of this seems rooted in an inferiority complex—about his looks, his status—and he has milked his heartbreak for public sympathy. Shrinkhala and Sambhav may not be perfect either, but Sisan’s reactions clearly reveal the kind of person he is as well.|||People are defending him with lines like, *“Sisan is too innocent or naïve,”* *“Sisan dai lai taha tiyena hola,”* or *“How would Sisan dada know when Shrinkhala herself was speaking against corruption at that time?”* But honestly, this whole case of Sisan and Shrinkhala shows just how easy it is to fool Nepali people.  When it was time to enjoy the benefits (eat ghee), Sisan did so. But later, when someone else started eating the same ghee, he began criticising it. That’s exactly what you call being opportunistic.  In short, Sisan is nothing but an opportunistic person.|||This one time..way back in 2019. Sisan chahi Shrinkhala lai pick up garna domestic arrival ma aayeko thiyo.

It’s sad, in all this - the people still refuse to see what’s right in-front of them with proof. They still fight about their idols like their life depends on it. All these influencers, celebrities and loaded lowlifes are just parasites nothing more. No one should be put on a pedestal.  They all had agendas, their relationship is just business. All of them took advantage of one another yet talk like a saint. Common sense, integrity, empathy and conscience bhannay kura thaha bhae po. Des ma esto situation cha, all they can talk about is about themselves, their ego and vested interests. This holier than thou mindset despite their actions and words is just diabolical.

At least things are being called out no matter who it is so thats a good step ahead.|||Looking at the frustration level I bet this is directly comming from Shrinkhala Khatiwada.

The way he spoke — the tone, the dominance, the subtle undermining — made it obvious that Shrinkhala was often submissive in that dynamic.  No matter how popular a woman is, she wants to feel safe and loved. Shrinkhala stood by Sisan even when Michael Kobold came after him, but it’s clear Sisan has some deep resentment. His ego took a hit. Maybe if she had married someone self-made like him, it wouldn’t have stung so much. Instead, she married Sambhav — the “typical brat rich guy with a questionable past” — and that burned people even more because they actually looked genuinely happy together. And if you’ve worked with Sambhav, you’ll hear people say Shrinkhala got the best out of him.  Sisan, on the other hand, lacks self-confidence and thrives on external validation. He’s the one who kept the breakup alive in public while Shrinkhala stayed quiet. I’m sure she felt bad too, but because she moved on first, she looks like the villain and Sisan’s loyal fans went after her.  When Shrinkhala finally spoke out with excelshitzzz, yes, some of it came off bizarre, but you can’t deny there’s been a witch hunt against her. What’s wild is Sambhav didn’t even jump to share his wife’s side — he seemed more invested in his ex Niti Shah's narrative. Heard Niti gets called a drama queen too, but honestly… Sisan just needs to stop milking this. Bro really needs to move on.  If Michael Kobold ever decides to spill Sisan’s dirt all over again, things would get ugly real quick for him. Karma goes in the loop, BROTHER. And remember the Sambhav car incident? Nobody at KMG said a word, not because they couldn’t, but because everyone was scared of losing their jobs. This whole saga is just a power play.  At the end of the day: Shrinkhala needs mental health support, Sisan does too, and probably everyone else tangled in this drama. Sambhav and Shrinkhala may be show-offs or even corrupt in their own ways — but Sisan, you’re coming off as the real power-hungry manipulator here. BROTHER seriously needs to get laid. Don't milk this anymore and it's time we focus on Prachandey and where the fuck is Pratibhaa? Go catch the sharks now.|||That's why I avoid sons and daughters of corrupted and Indian nationals like Madhesi Bihari and Marwadi Indians. Its easier later to deport them back to India.|||Here is the thing you guys always forget. Sisan is a human. Timro ex timlai toxic and problem ho vanne kura first din maie tha hunxa?

NRNA has the money and influence to bring out the proof.  We know corruption is rampant in Nepal but we need proof; this finger pointing in the name of this movement without any legit proof causes more harm to this movement than it helps.   With proof this would have been way more legitimate, without it anyone can finger point anyone and old parties and their cronies will regard this as hearsay and nothing will happen.  No legit corruption will come to light because of finger pointing.   The rampant corruption is due to lack of transparency of the government (knowingly or unknowingly) and the enablers are still in government system (Civil Servants, Lawyers, Judges, Police, Army)  Focusing energy on getting proofs and publicly releasing them will have more effect than some finger pointing \"Bhasadn\"|||Average bahun when they get into power.|||wah|||He has been saying it since last year.

When Are we going to Stop this Communist/socialist ideas before it foster and becomes a cancer in Nepal.   WAKE UP NEPAL !!!

Anything you write remotely close against Maoist terrorist party or nice about 'Monarky', or say anything about the mod. Your post will be immediately banned. Something tells me this is done deliberately to not bring back 'Monarky' and promote anti religion and pro communistic sentiment among young minds by suppressing the Voice of the other/ Please be Mindful !!!! --- Hope this Post wont get banned after this update.  2nd Update- I just got warned by Reddit that my account might get banned. Like I suspected, There seems to be group of Maoist sympathizing insurgents in most of the nepalese subreddit with Communistic Ideologies who will get your post banned or Comment deleted by group reporting if it doesnt align with their thoughts and who will like their own comments to make it look like they are saying meaningful when they are not.",

He pushed Nepal towards democracy and republicanism.   He gave poor villagers and lower-caste groups a voice in national politics.   He increased women’s participation in politics and society, with many ex-fighters now active in leadership roles.   In western hills and Madhesh, state institutions were weak or absent. Villagers depended on landlords for loans, justice, and protection, which kept exploitation unchallenged (Kamaiya, Haruwa-Charuwa, Haliya systems). His movement gave villagers confidence to defy landlords for the first time.   Fighters who believed they sacrificed for justice and equality still respect him as the leader who turned their struggle into a new political order.  I believe that **Nepal is freer and more equal today because of the revolution**.|||I hope you are not GenZ|||When they hold Oli and Co. responsible for killing kids last week.|||Had the maoist were successful and stayed true to their philosophy, nepal would have been a lot better.

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not “revolution,” it’s not “justice,” and it sure as hell isn’t “the voice of the people.” It’s mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn’t make you brave—it makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that—surrounded by a wave of so-called “youths” who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let’s not sugarcoat it—the so-called Gen Z “warriors” hiding in the mob weren’t heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country’s social fabric. He still can’t step foot in certain countries because he’s internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he’s propped up as a “leader.”  Let’s be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn’t an accident—it was a setup. While Deuba’s family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don’t get it twisted—those sharpshooters in the crowd weren’t just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres—former insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let’s stop pretending this was “the people rising up.” It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist—the one who drowned this nation in blood—walks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don’t for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn’t that Deuba suffered humiliation—the real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn’t a flower; he’s a weed choking the soil of Nepal’s democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too naïve to realize they’re being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||Prachanda and Baburam are India's puppet. Baburam was trained in India's JNU which wiped out more than 10% of our population while Madhessi bihari and Marwadi have exponentially grown. At this rate, in next 5-8 years, we will lose our country. Wake up.|||Bro, they already had 12 bude samjauta !!

            "heading": "The Shrinkhala Khatiwada I knew at Harvard",
            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada’s classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.   We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking–much to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in  Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate - the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala’s approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.   Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn’t mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‘help’. One time, she even said airily, “I wash my own dishes, you know.” She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala–a beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth–lingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don’t intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‘nepo babies’ who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).   Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It’s a troubling idea to think that despite what’s happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

I never liked her naak ma singan adke jasto boli.. And always felt she has a cunning personality that clings over you until she can no more use you for her advantage..  Sisan literally dodged a  bullet.. all thanks to her greed though..|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn’t some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was “beneficial” for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake “beauty with brains” narrative. Do you guys remember Niti’s big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let’s not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala’s prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it’s her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let’s be real- Sisan wasn’t perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they’d known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn’t even exist. This just proves it- they weren’t just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can’t just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala’s career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav’s narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What’s the lesson we can learn from here ?

Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don’t even make sense to begin with. Don’t know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don’t even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It’s so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It’s astounding what the world has come to and it’s deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can’t be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn’t she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It’s better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has. It’s disheartening!|||[deleted]|||What do you expect from a pageant queen?

Every move, every word, every connection seems like part of a bigger calculation. While most people get dragged through the mud on social media, she somehow stays a step ahead.

She knows the bashing on Tiktok or Instagram doesn’t matter as long as her professional side stays spotless, especially where she might work with people internationally who will never know the side of her life in Nepal that’s been exposed and torn apart ever since the truth came out.

But I wouldn't be surprised if its true either or even worse. I would assume that she was in her best behavior since she was not in Nepal and probably wanted to portray the best of her image.  My moment of disdain for her came about when her father one of the members of the parliament who were on monthly housing allowance along with the monthly pay. The beinfit is probably meant for the MPs who had to move temprorarily to the capital or who didn't have their own residence. Iirc, they had to manually opt in to get that added housing allowance. When the news published, her father's reaction was something along the line of \"I didn't know, I was getting it. I am happy to return it.\"  Question for her, how come you dont know the source of wealth and your parent's ethics?

It highlights how Shrinkhala, despite her public image and privileges, was not as collaborative or hardworking in academic settings as she appeared to be. It also touches on the contrast between her image and reality, as well as some concerns about nepotism and entitlement.|||there was a podcast recently, shrinkhala & 3 other women sittng down to talk with, his name may be anil shah.

NO TF SHE DID NOT!!!! Like realistically speaking, a middle class Nepali \"HUMBLE FAMILY” who did not come from money can’t afford even the tuition at Harvard even with loans CYZ it’s so Dyaum expensive let alone living expenses, traveling, food and other necessities we might not know of. I’m saying this as a Nepali because there are so many kids that have the potential to study there and even get into the school but can’t even afford it.

These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!! And the way she's silent when the country is bleeding says alottt too!!!!!!  And about the Nepal's government scholarship for harvard,this is not true, she is telling an entire different story about harvard scholarsip & how she paid fees there. She said she got 30% scholarship at harvard and the remaining 70% is paid through her brand endorsements money as she is brand ambassador to few company. We didnt buy that story, she tried hardest to sell it though and still fools people with this shitty madeup script about harvard's 30% scholarship & 70% funding through brand endorsement's money lmao. And lately she's being questioned on 50,000USD she got during miss world competition after winning \"beauty with the purpose\" title. Her ex exposed & questioned her in a very shady way and because of him we all knew this new layer of truth and i highly doubt it went on harvard's funding rather than for actual purpose|||One buy Harvard degree with that 50K and another one became a MAKUSE owner .

Continue on --|||Thanks for sharing your raw and real experience, thoughts and opinion. This is valuable for those of us who were shocked and skeptical about her success right from the day she got into limelight. I watched her view on Youtube yesterday and couldn't get past a minute of that video, she is clearly playing victim and trying to play the game.  Nope! she doesn't deserve any chance at all.  The students that I know personally who went to Harvard, MIT and many other prestigious institutions had grit, determination, belief in hard-work, may be little bit of luck but most of all they had \"humility\". They NEVER used their \"Harvard degree\" or Ivy league label to show off. It's those who want to fame and fake pride that put up social media posts to show off their diplomas. Honestly, it was very very clear even before she went to Harvard that she was on the wrong side of fame game.  For the longest time I thought it was a generational difference, since there are many other Harvard students who have publicized themselves in several Youtube videos and they are all Gen Z, and as a Gen Y (Millennial) observing this trend seemed justifiable.  However, Shrinkhala was building a house of cards and the fact that she had the audacity to publicize and put Sambhav Sirohiya in the limelight using Harvard freebies was just laughable a few years ago.  Like you pointed out, the fact that she still has 900K followers is troubling for sure but let's hope those are just her fake followers (some % are bought/in-organic followers, some her closest elite allies like \"Other Miss Nepals/ Businessmen/political affiliates etc. and some her enemies) as they say, **keep your friends close and enemies closer.**|||I heard that B.arch is the easiest subject to get at Pulchowk and that too for a girl as they have separate reservations for women. Yes she must be smart because to get that you need to work hard.  But the image she tries to portray being you know the perfect, hardworking,real and independent girl always sounded fishy to me.  Miss World organization saw through her, so didn't let her go to the final round. There is no substance in her words and it  sounds exactly like a politician speech. Idealistic statements with no action. Look at the legacy of previous Miss Nepal winners. Most of them marry rich businessman and secure a rich, lavish life. Miss Nepal itself feels like a joke...|||First of all, there was no government scholarship. She lied to you guys so she could appear smart. She has now publicly claimed that she paid her tuition with her influencer income. But we all know where the money came from.|||I have a similar story like Shrinkhala’s on Nepal’s current president’s granddaughter (he has 4 and i’m talking about the one studying at the University of Texas in Austin). Its not easy to get in there and even if you do its one of the expensive schools there. Talking about her Nepal bachelor’s days, my friends studied with her in KU in nepal in b. arch, and so many said she cheated on exams (A LOT) just to pass. later she worked for the nepal government and came to US for conferences and presentations 🤡. now she has started her master’s at UT austin, funded by corrupted money. she removed her instagram posts about her prior foreign visits and her recent UT Austin orientation day, and even deactivated her linkedin account.  Now she’s posting on instagram and facebook, after the new PM was appointed, congratulating her and thanking the president grand dad for this revolution. it’s crazy how these unethical people still have the audacity to do all this.

In that case, even you since you studied in Harvard. How did you fund your education?  Just curious. A reply will be great since there are hundred of replies.|||Remember that education in Nepal is based on how well you do...based on your caste. I have heard that a lot of exams are predetermined by the ruling caste. This corruption is so bad that even well-educated people are falsely given a bad grade.

And there is nothing wrong with this. She was a title holder that’s why she could be getting benefited after that. Plus, getting into Harvard is not everyone’s cup of tea no matter how much money one wishes to spend. Frankly speaking, linking her Harvard degree with nepotism& corruption is making ordinary people like us into more likely believing her part of the story.

He is rather seen as a clown who has been trying to incite youth against the establishment since more than 7 years now but fails terribly at it. Most of his views on youtube are manipulated & paid (bots etc). & a chunk of his viewership is rather from Pakistan & Bangladesh.  Edit: Also he is lying.|||Most well informed Indians are aware that this dissent had been brewing for quite sometime. Wish my Nepali bros and sis the best of luck and kudos for taking back what is rightfully yours . Hopefully the guilty are brought to justice, order is restored and right representatives are assigned to take Nepal forward for all its wonderful people. As for our media, they sell whatever gets views from the masses, tomorrow if Sita maa has comeback to be the Queen of Nepal sells, they'll start posting that, organizing debate sessions with clown for cheap entertainment. 🤡 I pray the martry RIP, their families fairly and properly compensated , justice is fast tracked, and a votes held  new govt formation.  Goodspeed Nepalis. 🇳🇵|||This mf is just an islamist puppet. We don't need him.|||Dhruv Rathee is fucking sellout.  He is scam, biased and no body takes him seriously.  His startup was also a scam.|||Bruh, this guy is a charlatan.|||Broken clock moment for Agent Dhruv Rathee - do not fall for his propaganda. I am not sure which media is being blamed here but what I see is that the media channels are saying the “Anti corruption “ protests.   Low IQ news media doesn’t count as even Indians know that they are sensationalise everything|||I’m Indian! There is no propaganda. KP Oli is hated by India and Indians, so Infact we support it.  Indians think KP Oli has- 1) Ruined ties with India, keeps making claims that Ayodhya is actually in Nepal  2) CCP puppet, keeps insulting India and chooses china  3) Hasn’t visited India in 4 years he’s been PM, even though India and Nepal are very important partners.   Guys the Modi government is NOT a supporter of KP Oli, the news articles are misinformed and have low knowledge & context about the events in Nepal. I hope our Nepali brethren understand this on our behalf. Thank you 🙏|||Don't fall for him Nepali brothers , he has his own personal interests. Indians are with You 🇳🇵🇮🇳|||OP more than india he has more reach in pakistan and bangladesh 🤣|||Indian media is saying that this was a protest against corruption. dhruv rathee always has his agenda.

We only care about peace and tranquility in Nepal.|||[removed]|||He is late as always trying to prove his clowness , media already started to show the true reasons for the protest|||There seems to be no valid narrative. If it was against corruption then the protest should have stopped after government stepping down. But what happened after that - people are destroying and burning their country’s asset, their parliament, airports and banks etc - this is not the way it should have gone down if this was about corruption only.   Now instead of corruption in the office it’s anarchy on the streets.|||total international media is reporting it as social media but india ==godi  the reason i hate these nepalis|||Western media were reporting the same no?|||His favorite president Trump can't wait to start acting as president of Nepal. Definitely US is definitely behind this.|||Don't believe in this joker.|||Why nepalis are so obsessed with what indian and indian media is saying, why don't they focus on what chinese media is saying as they consider china as their friend so why worry or think about what indian are saying, they don't consider india as their friend so why so much focus on india?|||If you think Dhruv Rathee is telling the truth, then I have an Eiffel Tower to sell you. This person is a grade A propagandist of the anti-BJP front. All his tweets are made on the behest of his masters, and he has been called out multiple times for this.|||FYI—-> Social media isn’t just mirroring conflicts happening in schools and on streets – it’s triggering new ones!|||he is against modi gov only.|||Dhruv Rathee is one of the people who remains a part of opposition forever. That doesn’t mean he is wrong always but sometimes yes! It is not just Indian media it is international media but most of them are correcting themselves now which is good. Although his comments are still wrong in many ways. Social media ban was a ignition for this protest because corruption is going on from a longtime. But people should think what’s next? Youth leaders are going to step up and take positions to govern? Do they have that kind of unity? And do you think don’t they turn into corrupt due to powers? Great initiative by youth but think about what’s next |||All of us Indians know this. What are you saying?|||I don't know what are you talking about. Most coverage of Indian media is overtly positive.   This is because our love towards Nepal is same as our hate towards that Chinese puppet Oli.   If you see any doubt in our media or people, it is because we have a slight doubt if CIA or ISI will start using Nepal as a ground to disturb India.   Nepal can be a smaller country, but they are much more older nation state than us with full of brilliant souls and whatever Nepalis choose for their country, we respect that from core.  But never think this Rathee fellow has any love towards you guys. He's just putting gun over your shoulder to attack India. He is not even an Indian citizen. He is a compromised soul to the highest bidder.|||German shepherd....he only spreads propaganda...beware of him .... Nepal|||This dhruv rati guy is himself an idiot 🤣🤣|||If you consider German/US funded Dhruv Rathee as flag bearer of honest opinion then you have fallen for exactly the narrative that the 'west' wants you to believe.  Mental colonization happens much before the physical one, this has already happened in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Pakistan look where they are at this time  Beware whom you trust and what you believe.|||It's actually USA, they did the same to Bangladesh last year |||Yesterday I saw a nepali post on Instagram where an Indian mentioned in the comment that the same protest should be done in India and everyone was bashing that guy and calling him out for bringing India in the topic. I hope they see this post|||[removed]|||[removed]|||I'm from Bihar India idk about this situation so I'm here for reading what's going on|||India has (rightly) stayed out of this. It's an internal issue of Nepal and we wish them peace and prosperity. Let normalcy be restored soon.|||Why you even taking him seriously.|||It's quite obvious to everyone in India, except the media narrative. I doubt anyone here believes that our Nepali brothers were protesting to assert their right to doomscroll.  People don't go to extremes in protesting against social media.  And govts don't ban all social media apps, just because the companies didn't \"register with them\". they do it, because they see the narrative has gone against them, and they desperately want to gain back the control.|||This guy ain’t even an Indian citizen|||[https://youtu.be/CXEMBDjnoWU?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/CXEMBDjnoWU?feature=shared) watch this|||This guy has some personal beef with modi and his party .

We have civilization connect that exists for thousands of years. Far before countries as a concept existed. Seeing our people in pain hurts us. 2. Indian mainstream media is shit. Even we don't entertain them. Each passing day their credibility is decreasing in India. 3. Dhruv rathi is also shit. Even his credibility is decreasing each passing day. One hypocrisy at a time. 4. From the bottom of our hearts we hope things calm down there and change for the better for the people of Nepal. I am sure if Nepal wants, the govt in India would love to help however possible (No strings attached) not unlike the hand we gave to srilanka in their time of need Because we understand what it is like to go through a state of political unrest. India did not have the help it needed in our time of political unrest. We will make sure our friendly neighbors dont face the same.|||German Shepherd is here|||And here is the video I made on Nepal and it’s issue with Nepal government.

You don't need any validation from germany ka kukkur.|||Guys, I assume everyone here has someone in their family with some political ties. I too have. But that doesn't mean I have direct ties with them. JHOLEY and BHEDA is a noun that defines people who blindly believe in a person or a political party.      Talking about myself, I am already 36, a father and I am thinking of raising my family here in Nepal. I was totally against going abroad as a student when there was trend to do so. But the political system was never stable here. However, This current GenZ revolution happened against corruption. We indeed got a good progress against these corrupt leaders. But things turned out to be different and here is my roller coaster of emotions. Please let me know if you can relate to this.  Day 0: Social Media Ban - Mixed feelings. Hopeful that social medias will proceed further with registration.  Day 1: GenZ revolution and killing - Lots of anger. Disappointment and discontent.  Day 2: Revolution, excited and happy till 4 PM, until we destroyed the party system. Once the public started destroying Singha Durbar, I came to realize what I had done. I started a fire that I can't extinguish.  Day 3: Realization of the revolution being hijacked. We were just against corruption, regime change was not our motto. The revolution gradually turned into a COLOR REVOLUTION.  Day 4: Worried about who will lead the country. Started mentally supporting Balen/Rabi or any young leader. Furious, since the army asked GenZ to come up with a leader. Finally Hami Nepal, some guys funded by Deep state along with Sanduk Ruit and Swarnim Wagle came into light. They started talking about regime change and Constitution change. They said they directly want to select Zelensky as their prime minister.   Day 5: Much more disappointed as some kids who are aiming to go abroad for future study is electing prime minister through Discord. Sushila Karki elected as PM. Which is some sort of relief. I feared a autocrat.  Day 6 - Day 7: China is yet to acknowledge PM Sushila Karki. China is suspecting foul play as KP Oli had been to SCO and all of this happened just after that.      Now I am very much in distress. I feel that, Nepal is Ukraine. Balen is the new Zelensky and China is the new Russia. I dont want to think negatively but the situation ahead seems to be very dark and we will have to take steps cautiously. There are a lot of hatred here and Social medias are fueling it. None of the GenZ were born during the writing of the constitution. There were lots of revolution that was endured by current revolution Maoist Revolution, Madesh Revolution etc. But now it seems everything has gone to waste and there is no constitution here in the country. Is this PTSD?|||Its not true narrative this is all funded by cia|||Ye Media bik chuka hai|||[removed]|||Nepal, you are dealing with dangerous, insecure, violent crybullies who don't care about reasons and motives because they'll just come up with fake news and use that is their motive.

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not “revolution,” it’s not “justice,” and it sure as hell isn’t “the voice of the people.” It’s mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn’t make you brave—it makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that—surrounded by a wave of so-called “youths” who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let’s not sugarcoat it—the so-called Gen Z “warriors” hiding in the mob weren’t heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country’s social fabric. He still can’t step foot in certain countries because he’s internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he’s propped up as a “leader.”  Let’s be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn’t an accident—it was a setup. While Deuba’s family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don’t get it twisted—those sharpshooters in the crowd weren’t just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres—former insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let’s stop pretending this was “the people rising up.” It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist—the one who drowned this nation in blood—walks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don’t for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn’t that Deuba suffered humiliation—the real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn’t a flower; he’s a weed choking the soil of Nepal’s democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too naïve to realize they’re being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||CIA & India Agents involved in chaos!

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4. Retirement age and term limits: This is a must, we need a clear retirement age for the public positions just like other jobs.     These sort of things are fundamental of any country, without getting the fundamentals right we cannot expect our country to do better. We have a chance to make things better, lets take this chance.|||also i think! what lessons can be learned from Bangladesh last year?|||Garni nai ho vani presidency system lyauni.

Just wanted to express supreme respect to you from Ukraine.   You're really cool!   We had protests in 2014.   We made lot of mistakes after succeded in throwing down Yanukovich in 2014.

After five years people were tricked and during war elected complete scammers after watching \"servant of nation\" series with current president in main role.   Now we get kidnapping peoples on streets by police and conscripted forcely to war or you can get out for $10k until kidnapped next time.

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

I know that indian media is misreporting the revolution as silly protests to reinstate scrapy social media and belittle the ambition of GenZ. Media wants the status quo in India forever. They belittled the Bangladesh protests similarly and painted it as Muslims vs Hindus in Bangladesh. They paint a high opinion of the fugitive Shaik Hasina but curse Nobel laureate Mohammed Yunus. Indian media is the judge, jury and executioner of all the happenings in Nepal, Bangladesh, Srilanka and Pakistan. According to them, India is Ramarajya but others were Raavan rajya. India has become a dead democracy in the past decade. We have no jobs, extremely costly education and no health. We are just scrapping by but nothing to show as the media paints cooked up Indian GDP. Baba's have become politicians, industrialists and millionaires. Politicians just encourage the industry of religion. Their children reap the benefits and others' children subsist on rationed rice.  I hope our youth draws the inspirations from all the other countries' youth around us.|||ke ho yaar comments ma nepali bhnda bdi indians chn , ysri bolnu hola trnslate garna nsakos|||It's classic.

A shift to a fully directly elected system for every seat would ensure greater accountability and public representation. 2. **Establish a Directly Elected Executive Head:** Instead of the parliament choosing the Prime Minister, the call is for a directly elected President or Prime Minister with full executive powers. This would provide a stable government for a fixed term, preventing the \"share-the-power\" politics that have led to instability.|||Also follow what's in constitution, according to constitution of Nepal, people outside of Nepal should be able to vote through embassy, but in reality we can't.|||No regegnation, country out|||So y'all are asking for resignation after kids dead in their school uniform.

It’s tragic, because they also have families back home and face the same struggles as the rest of us. They should be victims of this system too, yet they show little compassion or critical thought about what’s happening around them. Why are there protests in the first place? I refuse to believe they're blind to people's frustration and the direction the country is heading.  I still remember when we joined a protest 14–15 years ago. The police confronted us aggressively, and as kids we were too confused to react. Fortunately, we just stood there processing and visibly confused, and they left — but I still shudder to think, *what if our reaction had been different?* Today’s young protestors are in the same position, pure in their intentions, simply voicing frustration without wanting harm.  And honestly, credit must go to these protestors. They know exactly what they are standing for, unlike us back then who needed adults to organise us. I don’t see how demonstrations could be any more peaceful than they already are — especially when the very leaders being protested against have blood on their hands from before this generation was even born.|||Yo bhatey haru kahi gayera sitcha holani|||randi baan machikne haru|||I mean this tracks, they only like when you're corrupt|||Its not andolan anymore its war|||We want death or at lease exile of KP Oli and other taukes.|||Randi haruko photo, name, address patta lagau.|||shamelss dogs of government|||Machikne radi harlai lakhetdai marnaparne|||Thuiyaa police vanauda haruuu|||you radiko ban harulai agolauno man xa|||ma sanga pani ganhune bhaye, kassam mardinthe radieekko ban|||Mathi bata aako order re ????

Just look at the way they incite violence like it’s nothing!! Talking about burning down houses and people is nothing!! This is not a right foundation.

What people expected him to do.  The man himself has said enough in his posts.   It’s what, he DIDN’T do that impresses me the most about him. Saying “No” is harder than saying “Yes”, when everyone wanted him to say “Yes”.  (Think about this.)  He put out only a couple of posts, which I think served as guide posts during the revolution.   1. He was the first widely known public figure (that I know) who defined who Gen Z was and gave his support to the protest. 2. When the tempo rose, he clarified that Gen Z should lead, he accepted Sushila even when all of his cultists were going crazy about making him the interim PM.  Removing himself from the picture, brought focus back on the revolution and the task ahead, rather than turn the confusion situation, even more confusing with a popularity contest as a side gig.   There is a lot of things to think about and I think in time we can all make sense of it all.   That’s my two paisa about him.|||Leading KTM municipality vs leading the nation are totally different. The followers of Balen urging and rushing him to lead 'right now' and come out by 2PM are the same people who will criticize him within one year if he were to be them PM someday. They don't have patience and want to see changes immediately.  Personally, I would like to see him running in the upcoming election as deputy/vice roles first and not immediate PM role...assuming how parties will be formed and if there are any good lead independent candidate who will run with him. He's one of those few worthy to be PM but this is not his peak yet. He just became a mayor like 3 years ago and he still has a lot to show to the general public. If and when he wins to the election, it will be his peak and he has high chances of being a two term PM...assuming two term limit will be in place hopefully.

Yes it is definitely an opportunistic behaviour by balen. But how is this behaviour wrong and how is taking over PM position now and securing interim govt now and not taking part in politics for next 5 years do any good to the country.    He is practicing patience to achieve the goal he desires and what people actually wants from a young leader like him.

That’s the reason I doubt him.  i think he is not completely responsible for being the Prime Minister. Sure, he is a great person. He’s doing such a great thing in the valley, but being a Prime Minister is very responsible post, his way up talking to seniors, saying I will put fire to SinghaDurbar, I will bury everyone if you’re in tudinkhel, getting carried away by emotions, being Prime Minister means you should not be carried away by any emotions and none of the factors should affect your judgment which you believe to be true and is lawful, Hopefully he will make such changes and we can finally see him in the top, as much as I want him to be the Prime Minister I do think he is inexperienced and immature in this field,|||We are so far behind that criticizing political leader sounds like a hater. We are not even to the point where we could say “This person is bad/clueless , country isn’t safe with them”. For the past decade, the corrupted 3 have been playing nothing but tato aloo with us so its natural to be sticking nail to current situation. Give it some time and our voices will get echoed.|||If there’s one thing old political leaders never learned, it was how to handle criticism. The moment anyone spoke up, they tried to shut it down and let’s not even start on the behavior of their hardcore supporters(jholey as we call them).  Even leaders like Balen need to address this with their own supporters, as do all the new representatives entering the upcoming elections. They must say publicly that they welcome criticism, will reflect on it, and use it as a tool for improvement. Leaders should make it clear to their base: don’t bully or silence people for simply asking questions or raising concerns. Do not perform character assassination against someone just for criticizing. After all, in a democracy, freedom of speech is our right.  At the same time, we the general public also carry responsibility. We need to recognize the difference between constructive criticism and defamation. What we must not do is fall for propaganda, spread rumors, or engage in baseless character assassination.  And if we realize that our criticism or questioning was wrong, we should have the courage to apologize in the same way we raised the question. After all, apologizing will never make you small. It’s just a simple five letter word: “Sorry.” A word that can and should be spoken from both sides.|||Just because you’re against the system, doesn’t make you Balen-Supporters. Balen has no experience. Balen should wait and gain some experience. Criticism is a backbone of democracy and one must welcome it.|||EXACTLY. They lack this ability to critically analyse any action of any leader. Like no one is perfect and no one is a good. Let's be honest. Let's criticize people for their actions. People should be held accountable for their actions. Most importantly, leaders who run our nation. If we don't point out their wrongdoings, will they ever stop? Nepalese have such a bheda mindset, istg. Let's be more aware and let's know how to discern leaders and their actions.   By criticizing these leaders, we aren't hating on them. We're trying to bring awareness so that they won't repeat the same thing again and can do things better for the country.|||They need to be aware party KO jhole become jhole because they were andabhakt of party leader ( just like they are blind follower of balen rn)|||I think holding politicians accountable is crucial. I hope people realize we don’t need  more devotees and followers. We need critical, educated thinkers. Support the good work, appreciate your favorite leader but don’t forget to question often. People change. Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Need to always stay cautious. |||Agreed|||Thanks man, you speaked my words. I see people thanking Balen for this movement and saying he was the reason this movement happened and succeeded and all after Sushila Karki became interim PM, and this made me very sad for actual people who started the movement and also faced the consequences and this was even more big realization for me for how blind youth and supporters these days are and this concerns me even more for future|||This. This is what I’ve been saying for some time. Like the post says, I’ve also been labeled as a party ko jhole and what not. Even here in this sub, people have called me jhole lol just because I questioned him.  I am a Balen supporter. I supported him and did my part by sharing about his campaign on social media and making everyone aware about it. And I was super happy when he won, I still am. But I’ve been criticizing him on various points that I find valid. The top one is communication.  During the election, he constantly criticized Bidya Sundar (the previous mayor) for not communicating publicly. He even said that once he became mayor, he wouldn’t be like that and would stay in constant touch. He proposed starting a ‘Mayor with the Public’ TV program and even set aside a budget for it, but nothing has happened. He hasn’t given a single interview.  And then come his jhole supporters who always argue with the same line: ‘Pailai kei chaieko ho.’ With that logic, we should never question anyone. Just look at how Balen has become now, he just posts one-sided, no-context Facebook statuses and nothing else.|||Balen is a hypocrite in my opinion, like he encouraged the protest and even promised to provide a safe and secure environment for the protest but when things turned south he vanished like horn from a donkeys head|||Finally someone spoke about this, belun has literally become a god complex among some people out there, which is kinda concerning, the only time he speaks is to not let his adhabhatka interfere in every other stuff out there.

I personally don't think he has the temperament (though if there's a choice between any big parties' leader and Balen, I'd choose Balen every time).|||Aru kura thik ho, but can’t say he abandoned. It’s not 100% sure he will be the next PM so can’t call him opportunist.|||Yes ,|||Very well said|||While I am unsure on balen and his move, yes! To select a leader, you do have to question. Even the one you support. That is transparency. That is the trust that has foundation|||You’re right. In Nepal, many people tend to follow leaders without much critical thought, even when those leaders don’t necessarily act in their favor. Unfortunately, this habit seems to persist across generations. If the younger generation continues with the same mindset, there’s a real risk that the country could end up facing the same challenges in the future that we are experiencing today.|||You can make your own assumptions and narratives. If Balen had taken the post of PM, you would have said that he is opportunistic, that he enraged protestors just to get the position. I saw somewhere on Facebook, even before Balen’s official post on sushila karki that balen played dirty game for the sake of pm position. As far as I know, Balen is a farsighted person. He only comes forward when he feels fully prepared.|||That's my whole point, but again..vanepachi manche lai jholey nai lagcha. 😅 Guy's, learn to ask questions yourself too.

But ever since I saw him become mayor, I have always seen him wearing Nepali dress most of the time and consistently working to conserve our heritage and culture.  You know what? He is still better than most of the people there. Whatever he does, he has never done anything wrong. Stop pretending to be so-called critics for useless reasons. What is your academic background, and what makes you think that way? Have you ever felt the difference between past and present Kathmandu? I have a friend from the core area of Kathmandu, do you know what his opinion about Balen Shah is? No!  Even Harka Sampang is a very good person. Moreover, Sagar Dhakal’s brother has been working actively to eradicate the dictatorship of these political parties. Maybe your parents are bootlicking those rotten political parties, so you only see what Balen has never done and will never do. Just because he supported the movement does not mean he said he wants to become prime minister. You must understand that he posts only a few things because his words are weapons. One word from him has many consequences in such a movement. He is very clever and very wise; unlike Harka Sampang, though I like Harka as a person. But you need to give Balen full power to unlock his full potential. He wants change, he wants revolution, and he wants to remove corrupt politicians.

If Balen had come out saying he’s ready to lead, a lot of people would’ve jumped in claiming he planned the whole movement and just used Gen Z for his own benefit. That’s probably why in his statements, he keeps stressing that this is Gen Z’s movement and that the government will be formed by them. imo, staying out of it was the smartest move he could have made.  I’m all for questioning and criticizing leaders. I agree that its a problem if you dont want to do it. But when someone has shown that they are dedicated, not corrupt, and actually get things done, you’ve got to give them some benefit of the doubt. Save the tough questions for real concerns. Dont critise just because you think no one can ever be good enough.|||Yes Balen has fallen badly as he didnt seem to care about the youths when they needed him the most. But, when we are talking about selection of interim PM, he did the right thing by not coming out. If he had come out, more number of the youngsters would have gone to Army Headquarters causing a ruckus. Thankfully, that didnt happen. It could have been worse than Harka dai case. It still remains a fact that he could have interacted with us when he we needed him the most.|||such simple world if it did exist why would so many intellects be in the world of politics.

Your country has been too kind to me whenever I visit. I literally started my export business with Nepal as my first destination  I have very sweet memories of Nepal and especially of its people: full of joy and compassion. Never bothered to give up to the boiling pace of life.   What the Genz achieved is a lesson to the whole world. An outstanding solidarity display. The revolution as your history will always call it has got its results. I know all is not done you need reforms you need an accountable government. But ask yourself aren't you going overboard now? Literally the whole government has given in and the most possible situation is the army going to take over. Please keep the situation such that the army or any other entity doesn't get the excuse to deny people of their right to rule themselves. This is not  new,  when a revolution with a purpose overshoots give the power mongerers an opportunity to come forward and exploit that. A mob when acting like this is too dangerous. You are now literally resorting to violence as enjoyment.  Keep your Nepali spirits intact. You are one of the most righteous people I have ever seen.   Make your beautiful nation great!|||public , live execution|||A moment that all nepali can share.|||While GenZ will rejoice at this, I just feel sad watching this.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):** The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):** If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):** If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):** If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

He pushed Nepal towards democracy and republicanism.   He gave poor villagers and lower-caste groups a voice in national politics.   He increased women’s participation in politics and society, with many ex-fighters now active in leadership roles.   In western hills and Madhesh, state institutions were weak or absent. Villagers depended on landlords for loans, justice, and protection, which kept exploitation unchallenged (Kamaiya, Haruwa-Charuwa, Haliya systems). His movement gave villagers confidence to defy landlords for the first time.

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not “revolution,” it’s not “justice,” and it sure as hell isn’t “the voice of the people.” It’s mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn’t make you brave—it makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that—surrounded by a wave of so-called “youths” who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let’s not sugarcoat it—the so-called Gen Z “warriors” hiding in the mob weren’t heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country’s social fabric. He still can’t step foot in certain countries because he’s internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he’s propped up as a “leader.”  Let’s be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn’t an accident—it was a setup. While Deuba’s family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don’t get it twisted—those sharpshooters in the crowd weren’t just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres—former insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let’s stop pretending this was “the people rising up.” It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist—the one who drowned this nation in blood—walks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don’t for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn’t that Deuba suffered humiliation—the real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn’t a flower; he’s a weed choking the soil of Nepal’s democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too naïve to realize they’re being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||Prachanda and Baburam are India's puppet.

This has been ongoing for more than two decades. Behind the few visible figures, there are countless others who have either assisted them or benefitted through their association—ranging from major brands in Nepal to traders. For example, Sher Bahadur Deuba’s son and his sanitary pad importing company stand as an illustration.  They have institutionalized corruption by appointing foreign ambassadors based on party loyalty and financial gains, extending even to the transfer of bureaucrats to preferred locations in exchange for bribes and other undue benefits. The problem is not limited to the political system alone; bureaucrats, too, require checks and balances. A mechanism must be established to regulate the power of bureaucrats over politicians. Since bureaucrats are permanent stakeholders, their influence is even greater. One effective way to mitigate this is to appoint domain experts as ministers—for instance, a professional civil engineer as a minister cannot be misled about the cost estimates of a construction project.  There remains much to be done. Moreover, these political parties will attempt to form alliances before elections, bringing forward the same candidates and restoring the same exploitative system. Therefore, the first and most meaningful reform must be a change in the electoral process, with the inclusion of a “NOTA” (None of the Above) option.  Further accountability can be ensured by eliminating political appointments to certain positions. At present, even temporary (karar) appointments are made based on party affiliation rather than merit. As a result, even highly qualified experts are compelled to seek political approval. The recent appointments of Vice-Chancellors at B.P. Koirala Institute in Dharan and Gangalal Hospital are prime examples.  In addition to these issues, several other structural flaws persist.

Their jobs are gone. Tonight, they sleep with fear of tomorrow.  2. Car Showroom, Thapathali: Destroyed for what? Cars will only get rarer and more expensive for us, the people. Did this really hurt the powerful?  3. National ID Center, Thamel: Every citizen needs an identity. Without it, how will people prove who they are, study, travel, or survive? We burned our own rights.  4. Supreme Court, Bar Council, Attorney Office: They were our chance, flawed but still a place for justice. We turned them into ashes with our own hands.  5. Singha Durbar : Not just offices, but history and architecture. A royal palace that carried Nepal’s story, gone in flames. Our history, our pride, our royal palace. We didn’t just burn walls, we burned our own heritage.  6. Hilton Hotel : A private property and why? A symbol of tourism and foreign trust. Now the world sees only chaos in Nepal.  7. 1500 Prisoners Freed:  Many were criminals. Now our own streets are less safe for our children.  8. Banks Looted:  Without banks, there is no savings, no loans, no economy. We set fire to our own future.  The List goes on......  The Truth: We did not hurt the leaders. We hurt ourselves. We burned jobs. We burned history. We burned our own tomorrow. If we want change, we must rise to build, not to burn.

If we stop now, we’ll only sink deeper into crisis and foreign powers like India, China, or the US will interfere. We can’t afford to become another failed state.

This is the time to seek the truth, like who let Rabi out, and who is really behind the chaos. And this is also the time to seriously research those stepping forward to lead, people like Sushila Karki and others.

People watched her speech where she said stuff like, “What’s my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?”  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still don’t have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we don’t have the right connections.  We don’t get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, it’s still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? That’s probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  We’re out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor people’s kids not boil?  On top of that, there’s already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent. Because this have  been suppressed for so long, and now the mindset is like — “If we can’t reach anywhere through the system, then we might as well destroy it.”  And even if some third party tries to trigger people, the truth is, it was already there deep down in their subconscious. This is just it coming out.

That drive inevitably brings with it shades of narcissism and opportunism. So rather than fixating on intentions, it makes more sense to judge politicians by their results. On that front, Harka has proven he can deliver. His rough almost mobster-like style may be off-putting to some but in a city like Dharan which is home to hotheaded Kirati / Hill Janajati majority that kind of toughness isn’t just useful, it’s necessary.  That said, he is neither qualified nor capable enough to be considered an ‘ideal’ Prime Minister.

If a person has done good work, both of them will be appreciated hands down. You have to look at the picture from both sides. Secondly, please ask your senior citizens or elders from a different generation. They have seen history and faced the consequences. The real issue is bringing change in the constitution, i.e., a representative should not be above a certain age and should be allowed to seek votes only for one term. Take that in writing from the concerned representative, live, and show it to the world clearly. Also, please do not discriminate by saying someone is from the “Stone Age,” as such remarks can hurt the sentiments of people who are not from cities.|||Yes, I don't know what to.

            "body": "What comes next? The only reason Nepal isn't going through a complete currency de-valuation and a bank run is because of the rupee peg. We need to tread water carefully. (**Bank run** is a situation where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a bank simultaneously, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or financial stability. This can lead to liquidity problems for the bank, as it may not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands. Bank runs can create a cycle of panic, potentially leading to the bank's failure.)  The real pain starts after the protests have calmed. Economic crash is certain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh both went through it. Stock market/real estate crash, inflation and what not.  Whoever takes charge next, likely Balen, will need to address the pointless 'Greater Nepal' rhetoric and become a moderate on this issue. Thanks to Trump, India-China relationship is stable for the first time in ages. The only way Nepal has a future is pledge allegiance to both neighbour's.  Bangladesh under Yunus has been a pain in the ass for India. Nepal cannot make the same mistake. Any wrong steps and a free floating Nepali rupee against the dollar would go from 140 now to 25,000 like similar countries in our GDP range. Probably worse since our economy is in much worse shape. ($1 = Lao Kip 21,631.66 LAK)  Nepal needs one stable leader for the next 40 yrs. No interim gov paving way for elections bullshit. Forget the democracy experiment.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.   Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.   Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||How credible is this info?|||Use bitchat for conversation.

            "comments": "We are living in a moment where anger is boiling over. People are tired of corruption, censorship, and being silenced. Many of us are ready to take to the streets on Sept 8. But before we move forward, we must stop and think carefully.  History has shown us what happens when we rush in without preparation. In Bangladesh last year, in Sri Lanka not long ago, ordinary people gave their lives while corrupt leaders fled the country with protection and comfort. Their deaths were forgotten within weeks, while the guilty walked free. If we are not careful, Nepal risks becoming the next chapter in that same tragic story.  That is why this movement must be different. We cannot afford to be reckless. We must protect our people, keep our voices peaceful, and make sure the world is watching every step so that accountability cannot be erased.  Here is what we need to do before Sept 8:  * Get international human rights groups, UN observers, and peace monitors involved beforehand so there are eyes on the ground. * Publish clear and peaceful agendas so nobody can label us as rioters or mobs. * Document everything with photos, videos, and testimonies. Every arrest and every injury must be recorded and shared. * Avoid following local leaders who are affiliated with political parties. Big parties will try to infiltrate, hijack, and twist this movement for their own gain. * Know who is truly standing beside you. Trust matters because infiltrators can turn peaceful protests into chaos.  This movement is about dignity, rights, and accountability. It is not about violence. It is not about revenge. If we lose focus, if we let anger replace strategy, then we risk repeating the same cycle where the powerful walk free and ordinary people pay with their lives.  Nepal deserves better. The world must see us not as mobs, but as citizens united for freedom and justice. If we do this right, our voices will be impossible to silence. If we do this wrong, we risk being forgotten like so many before us.  Stay safe. Stay peaceful. Stay smart.",

And the hotel was belonging of politicians son. So, they could have made fake protestor's to do it, to claim insurance?  Why are indian and nepalese are fighting here about this matter?? This isn't time for fighting.   And about destroying properties, there are theories that the protest were hijacked by other political parties. Like wise, about governments offices, they wanted to destroy the proofs of corruptions. And public building and properties was collateral damages for those fake protesters to look it real.   So stop blaming and fighting with each other. Please please please 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏.  And sudin gurung, if you are reading this in anyway, now i hope you have  understood how harka sampang had felt when he was coming forward to save the country and you didn't supported him because of your personal vendetta.

I am just a sincere, hardworking youth who remained silent because too many opinions create a ruckus. That's what I believed till September 8. When I went to the protest, it was all fine until they started firing. When you're in the battleground, all moralities go out the window. Yet, I did not throw a single stone at anyone and I am proud of that. I remained with the group who were peacefully protesting infront of the army van, I helped people with water to wash their face, tried picking up litters. The main point is I tried being a responsible person. But the moment I saw people being carried to the hospital with their blood spattering the streets, I fucking lost it. In retaliation, my protests became more louder. I came home late at night, tried my best to repost as many information I could. At one point, I felt like people should burn down the entire ministry down, all these nepo-babies should be brought to the streets to teach their parents how it feels to kill someone's child. I was furious, the word being an understatement. But seeing this people getting mob justice was what I never wanted. They don't deserve the least of anyone's sympathies, but we still have humanity in our hearts. That's what differs us from them.  I'm trying my best to control the narrative of why the protests happened, so that the opportunistic Indians, Chinese and the entire West may not take undue advantage of us.

            "subreddit": "NepalSocial",
            "heading": "The Shrinkhala Khatiwada I knew at Harvard",
            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada’s classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.   We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking–much to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in  Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate - the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala’s approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.   Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn’t mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‘help’. One time, she even said airily, “I wash my own dishes, you know.” She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala–a beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth–lingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don’t intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‘nepo babies’ who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).   Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It’s a troubling idea to think that despite what’s happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

And a few after she became miss nepal... I can somewhat vouch for the \"I'm busy with this and that... Can you help me with this\" part...

I never liked her naak ma singan adke jasto boli.. And always felt she has a cunning personality that clings over you until she can no more use you for her advantage..  Sisan literally dodged a  bullet.. all thanks to her greed though..|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn’t some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was “beneficial” for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake “beauty with brains” narrative. Do you guys remember Niti’s big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let’s not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala’s prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it’s her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let’s be real- Sisan wasn’t perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they’d known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn’t even exist. This just proves it- they weren’t just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can’t just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala’s career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav’s narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What’s the lesson we can learn from here ?

Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don’t even make sense to begin with. Don’t know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don’t even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It’s so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It’s astounding what the world has come to and it’s deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can’t be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn’t she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It’s better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has.

Every move, every word, every connection seems like part of a bigger calculation. While most people get dragged through the mud on social media, she somehow stays a step ahead.

She knows the bashing on Tiktok or Instagram doesn’t matter as long as her professional side stays spotless, especially where she might work with people internationally who will never know the side of her life in Nepal that’s been exposed and torn apart ever since the truth came out.  It’s like she’s playing this endless game of Ludo, always climbing the ladder, polishing her image as she goes. But at the same time, you can’t help but feel she’s only ever a roll away from hitting 98 and sliding right back down the snake.|||We wont know if what you claim is true.

These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!! And the way she's silent when the country is bleeding says alottt too!!!!!!  And about the Nepal's government scholarship for harvard,this is not true, she is telling an entire different story about harvard scholarsip & how she paid fees there. She said she got 30% scholarship at harvard and the remaining 70% is paid through her brand endorsements money as she is brand ambassador to few company.

Continue on --|||Thanks for sharing your raw and real experience, thoughts and opinion. This is valuable for those of us who were shocked and skeptical about her success right from the day she got into limelight. I watched her view on Youtube yesterday and couldn't get past a minute of that video, she is clearly playing victim and trying to play the game.  Nope! she doesn't deserve any chance at all.  The students that I know personally who went to Harvard, MIT and many other prestigious institutions had grit, determination, belief in hard-work, may be little bit of luck but most of all they had \"humility\". They NEVER used their \"Harvard degree\" or Ivy league label to show off. It's those who want to fame and fake pride that put up social media posts to show off their diplomas. Honestly, it was very very clear even before she went to Harvard that she was on the wrong side of fame game.  For the longest time I thought it was a generational difference, since there are many other Harvard students who have publicized themselves in several Youtube videos and they are all Gen Z, and as a Gen Y (Millennial) observing this trend seemed justifiable.  However, Shrinkhala was building a house of cards and the fact that she had the audacity to publicize and put Sambhav Sirohiya in the limelight using Harvard freebies was just laughable a few years ago.  Like you pointed out, the fact that she still has 900K followers is troubling for sure but let's hope those are just her fake followers (some % are bought/in-organic followers, some her closest elite allies like \"Other Miss Nepals/ Businessmen/political affiliates etc. and some her enemies) as they say, **keep your friends close and enemies closer.**|||I heard that B.arch is the easiest subject to get at Pulchowk and that too for a girl as they have separate reservations for women. Yes she must be smart because to get that you need to work hard.  But the image she tries to portray being you know the perfect, hardworking,real and independent girl always sounded fishy to me.  Miss World organization saw through her, so didn't let her go to the final round. There is no substance in her words and it  sounds exactly like a politician speech. Idealistic statements with no action. Look at the legacy of previous Miss Nepal winners. Most of them marry rich businessman and secure a rich, lavish life. Miss Nepal itself feels like a joke...|||First of all, there was no government scholarship. She lied to you guys so she could appear smart. She has now publicly claimed that she paid her tuition with her influencer income. But we all know where the money came from.|||I have a similar story like Shrinkhala’s on Nepal’s current president’s granddaughter (he has 4 and i’m talking about the one studying at the University of Texas in Austin). Its not easy to get in there and even if you do its one of the expensive schools there. Talking about her Nepal bachelor’s days, my friends studied with her in KU in nepal in b. arch, and so many said she cheated on exams (A LOT) just to pass. later she worked for the nepal government and came to US for conferences and presentations 🤡. now she has started her master’s at UT austin, funded by corrupted money. she removed her instagram posts about her prior foreign visits and her recent UT Austin orientation day, and even deactivated her linkedin account.  Now she’s posting on instagram and facebook, after the new PM was appointed, congratulating her and thanking the president grand dad for this revolution. it’s crazy how these unethical people still have the audacity to do all this.  (Source: from college friends and family members, and as those of us who are directly impacted by this revolution in nepal, we are not going to stay quiet against corruption and the unethical hypocrisy going on for a long time)|||Also the harvard blog lol|||What was her gpa?|||Most of her followers in isnt are fake and paid tho|||If you guys want social awareness of Nepal's issues, you should write fully in English.

Like I get it that she had 1M followers but she wasn't really like an influencer. How could she claim that she is the most influential person in Nepal. If she actually got 3 crore then maybe I should also be an influencer.|||Why isn’t anyone asking her this - how much taxes did you pay in 3 crore income? Income at this level is taxed at 39% in Nepal. Don't try to fool us - the taxes are supposed to be paid by you, not by the brands as you claimed. I want to see your tax returns. You claimed to be honest and talked about corporations evading taxes several times in your interviews. Can you show us that you paid income taxes for the money you claimed you earned as an influencer?|||Sisan dai dodged a bullet …|||Glad you shared this all.

She used to go around Harvard telling everyone that she received a prestigious Nepal government scholarship to fund her education. She lied about receiving the scholarship s she can appear smart amongst other students who got there on their own merit. She kept quiet for a long time when Nepali people asked her about her educational expenses. Now, all of a sudden, she is claiming she funded it with her own influencer money. |||My mom generation dont even know the name shrinkhala|||So I assume your story is true. I also studied in the states and I know how expensive it can get.   So how did she funded her education considering Harvard which is an ivy league school is extremely costly and on top of that, her lifestyle itself is on the high end. So..  In that case, even you since you studied in Harvard. How did you fund your education?  Just curious. A reply will be great since there are hundred of replies.|||Remember that education in Nepal is based on how well you do...based on your caste. I have heard that a lot of exams are predetermined by the ruling caste. This corruption is so bad that even well-educated people are falsely given a bad grade. While the latter is given a high passing grade. This type of discrimination is not only evil but can takes one's life. HK student commit suicide because of academic pressure.

They exude your bitterness towards her. I think you envy her followers ( which you have mentioned a lot) and her beauty, its common for ugly people to have this jealousy.

You creating a burner account to throw dirt at her shows your pettiness as well.|||So she was just like an ordinary college student like all of us, so what if she wasn’t a studious/intellectual kid, still she was an opportunist, many of us are & maybe that turned out in her favour. And there is nothing wrong with this. She was a title holder that’s why she could be getting benefited after that. Plus, getting into Harvard is not everyone’s cup of tea no matter how much money one wishes to spend. Frankly speaking, linking her Harvard degree with nepotism& corruption is making ordinary people like us into more likely believing her part of the story. Targeting her is only gonna make her more famous, still 900k+ followers believe her part. She is getting sympathy from people as people are still forgetting about the real agenda and getting jealous about her getting into Harvard.|||i mean knowing she did try to contribute to nepal rest of the thing was from the breakup scandal right , i don't know about the beauty though everyon is beautiful you try to find it !!!the system will surely benefit her , but a lot of people are unaware of transparecy can't connect the dot in larger scale if she can do great things with her face that has been blessed and for the achievement sh won once title ie miss nepal, she should do great things for the nation in upcoming years and time and hope she get equal value from the scandals!! and serve !!!|||[deleted]|||Still Beautiful though",

Gen z never planned to burn or destroy public property and jails. I believe this happened due to the presence of other opportunistic groups.  Gen z’s true motive was to overthrow the government and that was achieved. they never intended to take up guns or engage in vandalism and that was not their goal. but many other people, parties or elements took advantage of the moment to cause destruction for their own selfish interests like Looting, hiding behind the anonymity of the crowd.  Because of this, even their own people are now suffering from security issues like the release of 1200 prisoners due to prison breaks.

You say their work has benefited generations “like me” but what about the millions still without quality education, clean water, jobs, or justice? If that legacy was truly built for the people, then why does inequality keep growing? Why is access to opportunity still limited to a select few families like yours?  No one is attacking your elders for their hard work but using that work to claim political or social superiority today is exactly the kind of dynastic thinking that holds progress back. Legacies don’t entitle children to power. Competence, accountability, and public trust do.  You’re not being attacked, you’re being questioned. And if your only answer is to call others “small-minded” and “ungrateful,” then maybe you’re not as prepared to face criticism as you think. Respect is earned in every generation, not inherited like land or a business.  The days of hiding behind the achievements of the past are over. If you want respect for your family, prove it through your own actions, not by silencing criticism or demanding loyalty based on history.|||French revolution Bata sikna paryo kei|||I fwwww it.

I mean gross national happiness instead of gross national product. I believe every single country on this planet should take Bhutan as a role model a little bit more. Where else in the world are citizens asked what their main problems are and what they want from the government? And later, citizens are asked how satisfied they were with the government's performance. I know it's a bit naive of me to make such a suggestion from afar, as a sheltered European who is not really familiar with the form of government in Nepal. But it seems to be similar in many, many countries. Those in power often hold office and positions of honor for decades through their family ties. And they are similar in their decadence. The most expensive clothes, the biggest cars, houses, and palaces. Flying to New York for dinner in a private jet, or to Monaco for F1, or around the globe in a yacht as long as a soccer field. And in the media, they try to appear close to the people, to be there for them, to advance the country by investing in infrastructure or new hospitals, etc. But no, a large part of your taxes ends up with the rulers themselves. The rich and powerful acquire more wealth and more power. Money rules the world!

Experience isn’t a flaw, it’s literally the one thing that tells you someone can handle the chaos. You want to hand the country over to a rookie who has no clue how the system works, how politics works, or how to deal with the mess we’re already in? That’s not bravery, that’s stupidity.  We keep repeating the same mistakes because people get blinded by shiny new faces and ignore anyone who actually knows what they’re doing. Experience doesn’t mean someone is corrupt it means they’ve been in the trenches and survived. Throwing it away just to see if a “fresh face” can magically save everything is how you crash a country.  Nepal isn’t a playground. Leadership isn’t about hype, popularity, or being young and “green.” It’s about surviving the chaos, making tough decisions, and knowing where the landmines are. If you think a rookie can do that better than someone experienced, you’re dreaming and the whole nation will pay the price for it.",

He looked at me for a moment, and then his eyes filled with tears.  He whispered, “Dai malai ta manchhe jasto ko bhav nai diyeko dherai din bhayo\" (Brother, it’s been so long since anyone treated me like a human)  I didn’t know what to say.

When I left, my hands were empty, but my heart was heavy. That day I realized poverty is not only about money. The biggest poverty is being unseen, unloved, and forgotten.  Ratnapark overbridge will never look the same to me again. Today, that beggar gave me more than I gave him.

ALL OF THESE ASSHOLES!|||Fuck where is he now?|||CDO vagyo vaneni paxi farkida tesko Ghar chai Rahana vayena Hai. Jalaide|||Yes thus is TRUE LOOK AT MY MOST RECENT POST|||please do this email to UN and OHCHR   To: registry@ohchr.org        info@ihrcworld.org        petitions@ohchr.org   Subject: Urgent Appeal: Violation of Human Rights in Nepal – Police Shooting School Studentsj   Dear United Nations Human Rights Council, I am writing to raise an urgent appeal regarding the grave human rights violations currently occurring in Nepal. Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.   Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.   Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||Jaha Bhetyo tehi thok saley madarchod lai...|||Aaos na india ma ni nepali xan birsyo kya|||Bro timro yo pic use garey haii Tiktok ma vid halchu|||kun desh jala teta bebasta garnu parxa|||yo machikne lai samatna paryo jasari bhaye ni yellai bachne kunai adhikar xaina|||Bhagey ra canada nai ja la, canada ma nee xodnu hudaina.

This way we will have clean central government in which no one can capture state function and minimize corruption.    Since we don't have any functioning people in power, either let lower house to vote for temporary governor and magistrate. No minister, let bureaucracy handle them under strict scrutiny of Governor and Magistrate.    Then start a fresh election, 1 President, 7 Governors, 1 Premier, 7 Magistrates, Lower House or Province Parliament member, then from each Province send 10 representative in Upper House/Federal Parliament 3 voted by Lower House/Province Parliament, 5 directly elected in Upper House and 2 votes each from Province Governor and Province Magistrate. Let the bill for Upper House be registered by directly elected member of Upper House. Upper house will vote for foreign minister, ambassadors and diplomats.   For now, either make Mayor and Deputy Mayor of each capital of Province to be interim Governor and Magistrate to bring law and order in state-province security and function. After election they will go back to be Mayor and Deputy Mayor.     Why all this? So no dictator and political party can come in power to hijack this state again for their own gain.|||No not as PM, can rejoin as edu min tho|||Ahile lai.. interim prime minister Sushila Karki.. ahile Balen/Sumana ayo vaney interim PM le election ladna paudaina.. so ahile Sushila Karki is best and Elected PM Balen or Sumana Shrestha.  my opinion.|||WE DO NOT NEED A PARTY AFFILIATED REPRESENTATIVE.

I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both.

She is the one who has been abroad for so long and has so many foreign connections and relations that even if she  doesn't want interference, there will be far more foreign interference with her as a leader.

BTW, Gen Z doesn’t just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didn’t exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who weren’t even present for the protests claim we don’t know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldn’t even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, ‘We have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server you’re all listening to is just for public discussion’. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal. Now that it’s been confirmed everywhere and with Balen posting that the Gen Z’s choice former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Sushila Karki is the right choice for interim prime minister of Nepal, we look forward to what comes next.|||https://new-nepal-voting.vercel.app/  Vote here or suggest names I can add|||For interim formation CJ Sushila Karki would be the perfect choice.

It’s rotting because everything: government, institutions and society itself is rotten to the core. There is no genetic psychopathy; there’s generations of: neglect, corruption, and betrayal. People aren’t spreading hate for fun, they’re bleeding from a system that chews them up and spits them out.  Your little moral lectures about “empathy” and “fairness”? Irrelevant. The world doesn’t run on kindness. It runs on power, survival, and who’s willing to fight or cheat to stay alive. Sitting there whining online, hoping people will listen, makes you irrelevant. You aren’t warning anyone, you’re screaming into a void while real fkin problems eat the country alive.  Get over your illusions man. The country doesn’t owe you, me or anyone morality. If you want change just like everyone else, stop fantasizing about hearts and minds and start confronting the brutal, ugly reality of a system designed to crush idealists.|||Every revolution is messy!!|||it is just a coping mechanism for many. now many criminals are released|||rajabadis or any other parties might try to take over. we need to be aware.|||ma ta herda herda thakisake  k vako???? euta ko wife lai jiudai jalako xa... gagan thapa lai testari kutna parne ta thyena|||Meanwhile this person is posting from toilet or abroad|||People are setting a Narrative, GenZ should lead GenZ.

Nothing was going to change if things didn’t go south. Personally, I didn’t see the government making any changes with a peaceful protest. Even when we look at history of the world, majority of peaceful protest start peaceful and end violently. No entity in power ever gives it up easily.  Change was what we asked for and change is what we are getting. Not exactly the way we wanted things to go but seems clear from the comments that we all knew, in the back of our minds, it was never going to be a straight road to Rome.  So I believe it’s high time we look ahead and bring the same energy we did to the protests to ensure that we see the change we want to see happen and bring in leaders we believe in. Easier said than done but accountability starts from us now. Let’s not settle for less than what we envision Nepal to be.|||Who are you telling this?

They are hot blooded. They can do anything with teen minds.  Look at your genZ, destroying their own land...  GenZ is a popular word on the internet.  Now whenever you talk about GenZ people will remember this amount of brutalism and rage against their own land own assets.|||**What next? thoughts from a fellow Gen Z**    The motherland burns, my heart aches, my mind ponders, is all hope lost? My soul hurts to see violence, arson, anarchy, and the loot and burning of our national properties. We, Gen-Z, seem to have won, yet feel lost. Hope feels lost. Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? I’ve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we can’t let our nation fail.** We can’t let our nation burn. We can’t let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**     **1) We lay down our weapons.**   We came in peace, we protested in peace, and we’ve always wanted peace. We shall end this in peace. Be it known that anybody inciting violence isn’t part of our movement.     **2) We extend love.**   Love towards our brothers and sisters, love towards our nation, love towards our neighbours, our society, and the opposing side. The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.     **3) We wear white.**   White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that we’ve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.     **4) We have hope.**   Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.     Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.     Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.     Sincerely,   Pantji, a Gen-Z |||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Why not sagar Dhakal?|||Yesss|||Just promote it in your social media handle|||K bhairacha yarr discord ma pm choose bhairacha|||Ahile non political manxe thik huncha...her or Dr सन्दुक Ruit.

Unconstitutional action will hurt Nepal on the long run. Thus, to make it constitutional;  1. Make some MP elected from Proportionate Representation System resign, 2. Make the president declare her lawful member of parliament through Proportionate Representation System, 3. Declare her the interim prime minister, 4. The president on her cabinet's recommendation dissolves the house of Representatives, 5. Her cabinet carries forward the corruption investigation and reconstruction. 6. The elections will be declared immediately. 7. The new parliament decides the constitutional amendments. (directly elected prime minister etc. and others ) 8. Then, the prime ministerial election happens. 9. She resigns as the interim prime minister. 10. New prime minister and the cabinet are sworn in. 11. The current president resigns. 12.

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen.

Rather than looking outwards to pin 📌 the chaos, it's important that we self reflect. This movement was started to hold those who've wronged our nation accountable but if we ourselves don't hold us accountable for yesterday's actions then we've lost the cause.  I beg that we don't dilute the blood spent in the last 48 years to any conspiracy.  जे भयो, गलत भयो । हामीले हिजोको घटनाक्रबाट आम नेपाली नागरिकको मनस्थिति भुज्यौं, हामीमा अझै पनि सुझबुझ छैन भनेर प्रमाणित गर्यौ।  तर अब के गर्ने भन्ने प्रश्न महत्पूर्ण छ - अब को छलफल त्यसमा हुनु पर्छ जस्तो लाग्छ।  We need law and order to end this chaos otherwise opportunists will prevail.

Its grand architecture and historical importance make it a true pride of Nepal.The news of Singha Durbar burning yesterday is more than just the loss of a structure it feels like the loss of a piece of our soul. This tragedy is a blow to our heritage, to our economy, and to our sense of unity as a nation. The damage cannot be measured only in money, but also in the irreplaceable cultural and historical value that has been destroyed.  I feel deeply saddened by this loss. Singha Durbar was more than walls and pillars it was a living monument of Nepal’s journey, struggles, and achievements. Watching it go up in flames is heartbreaking for every Nepali who loves their country.",

The votes that party gets determine the remaining 110 members via proportional representation.  so aba either we need new political parties to replace the existing ones by Falgun 21, or we have to vote for the same parties again. This is more complicated because Nepal is not just Kathmandu. The political players which we have termed jholey will be active outside Kathmandu.
