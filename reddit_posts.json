With growth comes new challenges - balancing news with memes, helping travelers without cluttering the feed, and keeping discussions civil during heated times.  The Mod Team wants to make sure we aren’t just \"running\" the sub, but actually improving it for you. We are opening the floor for a community-wide audit.  # 📋 What we want to know:  **1. Content Balance & Quality**  * **The Repetitive Posts:** Are you tired of seeing the same \"Best ISP?\" or \"How to get a Passport?\" questions? Should we move these to a **Weekly FAQ Megathread** or a **Wiki**? * **The Content Mix:** Do we have too many memes? Not enough serious discussion? Do you want to see more OC (Original Content) like photography, local history, or art?  **2. Rules & Moderation**  * **Civil Discourse:** How should we handle \"Keyboard Warriors\" and toxic political arguments? Are we being too strict - or not strict enough - with bans? * **Low-Effort Posts:** Is the \"No Screenshots of Facebook/TikTok\" rule working for you, or is it too restrictive?  **3. Safety & Spam**  * **Scams:** Have you noticed an increase in \"DM me for work\" or shady financial posts? * **Privacy:** Do you feel safe sharing your opinions here, or do you feel targeted by \"doxxing\" or harassment?  **4. New Features & Events**  * **Community Events:** Would you participate in a \"Casual Friday\" talk thread or AMAs with experts (doctors, lawyers, historians)? * **User Flairs:** Do the current flairs represent you? Should we add more (e.g., specific districts, diaspora locations)?  # 💬 How to participate:  To keep this organized, please try to follow this format in your comments (copy/paste if you like):  * **Top Concern:** \\[Example: Repetitive traveler questions\\]  * **Suggested Solution:** \\[Example: Create a pinned travel guide\\]  * **One thing I love about this sub:** \\[Example: The helpfulness of users\\]  **Note:** We promise to read every single comment. We may not be able to fix everything overnight, but we will post a **\"Summary of Action\"** next week to let you know what we decided.  **Dhanyabaad for helping us make** r/Nepal better!",

I think laws absolutely needs to be amended so that we don't have these loopholes like for example, you can say in a law that certain approvals have to be either given in a certain time or rejected. Digitisation is another way to go and RSP is talking about it and I think we should ask candidates about this too.   Remember that all major parties except RSP have unions inside bureaucracy and many bureaucrats are politically connected and feel they can do anything they want. So it is a very serious situation and needs to be tackled.|||I did this a few months ago. They asked for some paperwork, as you mentioned, which I gathered, and I eventually got the registration.

So phone got switched off, then i went to repair it : 1. I went to a totally new place (Newroad), told the issue of phone, the guy told me, \"i will call you after 1 Hr\" , if the shock damaged the IC part of the phone then for  repairing you'll have to pay around 1500, i just got an call in 30 minutes that my IC was damaged and a wire was totally loosed. He told me that he opened the phone and the IC damaged is real. He would try to repair the iC, if phone wakes then okay, if not then 2500 is for sure for change.   I said, don't do anything I will be there around 15 minutes just don't do anything I will come and see.  Then i reached there, he showed me the Damaged IC and conditions, i called my friend, he told me to buy a new phone, so i made my mind not to repair but take the phone exactly at the condition.   So i didn't paid, walked away to the Actual store where i bought the phone.  2. Then i greeted the Dai, told the issue, he just said me you wait, i will just finish a quick Iphone repair then work on yours.  Thrn waited around 30 min, then i went near him, he somehow started charging the phone and it was working fr.   I thought he changed the IC without my consent and i though i have to pay around 2500 as i was just waiting.  After around 10 minutes, he called me to enter my password, he check every single function and told me that, The network hardware is Gone, added a replacement, a wire is loose only. No other issues.  I asked how much?  He replied : Give 500 Only...   Now you all can relate the feeling i am having after the phone is in my hand, fixed issue, paid no more than 500.  Biggest lesson : Always go to the known place 🙌  Any thoughts and comments, comment down i Will try to reply 🫡",

            "body": "Most election “analysis” in Nepal is still based on punditry. Not all, but a lot of it. Reporters rely on hunches, what they are seeing locally, and how they personally interpret events. That interpretation is often shaped by their own biases, whether they realize it or not. For regular readers, this usually does not line up with how they themselves are trying to understand or predict an election.  If you actually want to understand an election, you need to look at the data behind it and compare it across cycles.  Exit polls are banned in Nepal to preserve election integrity. Whatever one thinks about that, it is the rule. That leaves a gap between raw results and meaningful understanding.  So instead of relying on pundits, you can be your own election analyst.  I built [**275seat.com**](http://275seat.com), a data driven platform that gives a complete electoral picture of Nepal using current and past election data. It breaks down seat math, vote swings, margins, and coalition possibilities. Based on historical patterns and signals, it can also help you understand how elections might swing, without pretending to call results.  You can build your own electoral map and explore how the political landscape could evolve, using simple and transparent metrics.  Think FiveThirtyEight style analysis, but built specifically for the 275 seats of Nepal’s parliament.  Would love feedback, criticism, or ideas from this community.",

Try to see what kind of narrative UML is spreading.   The most likely candidate is Gagan. Old Congressis will vote for Gagan (2022's biggest party) and pull in the progressive vote also.|||A lot of assumptions but yeah I think the good thing after this Gen-z protests has been that the tauke haru are out or almost out of electoral politics. Deuba is gone, Prachanda went to the easiest constituency for Maobadi to win but even there he’s going up against the son of two Maobadi soldiers who lost their lives in the Maoist insurgency and KP Oli looks very likely to lose he is scrambling everywhere.   Honestly had Gagan not done his bisesh mahadivesh, the 3 parties already had plans to form a coalition and fight the election as one alliance. And it is his stance of not forming any coalition that we have such a strong competition now. But I’m not gonna lie, nothing is fundamentally going to change whoever comes to power. There doesn’t seem to be any proposal for institutional change in Nepal. RSP is basically running on “Out with the old and In with the new” but not new policies (case in point Balen’s Socialist tilt, his post about that cement factory etc).  It seems they just mean out with old people and in with the younger people. Gagan talks about institutional change, how he is going to be the Tony Blair of Nepal and bring about the “Third Way” and revise Nepal’s economy back to the 90’s era of liberalism. And that all sounds good but knowing Congress, a party that is so deeply entrenched in the status quo, I don’t buy it.   Atleast we will get new faces in parliament, some people seem to be very funny so we will get new contents to laugh at.|||Balen is a wrong choice, mark my comment|||The way Gagan led this time is history, natra pheri Oli ra Deuba milera paila kai khel khelthe|||Mark my words ,gagan will be pm after election.|||If gagan will be Pm then it is only possible from congress's alliance of rsp  So  Rsp won't be in opposition anyhow|||bro dont take oli lightly in jhapa he won there 5 time huu|||[removed]|||Balen might not win, jhapalis are not ready for change yet, sorry but the later is a fact ! I support balen !|||I honestly don’t know if people in this thread don’t want Balen to win or are just grossly overestimating old parties. Or whether I am delusional.  This election is the by-product of a major revolution which overthrew the government. The opposition has won every single election following revolutions - Jana Andolan I (Nepal Congress won the elections after the dissolution of Panchayat) - Jana Andolan II (CPN Maoist won the 2008 constituent assembly). RSP is the radical opposition as most of the influential figureheads of the revolution have now joined the party.  And you can clearly see the hype behind Balen and how RSP became a top 4 party in just 6 months of formation in the last election.   Oli might have won numerous elections in Jhapa-5, but I would put my money on Balen from a statistical perspective. Most importantly, he won with a 55.7% share in the 2022 elections.

I was hooked on it for two things. It had a monthly satirical column from Manoj Gajurel and childhood memoirs of Khagendra Sangraula. And their cover stories were also always interesting. On one issue, the cover story was a biography of \"Che Guevara\". I really liked him from then.   And when I was in college I used to dislike this one guy from our class. He low key used to irritate me. He was like ali dherai pose dekhauna parne, sir le padai rako bela taai na tui ko question sodhne, remarks dina parne. One day during a gap period we were talking with classmates and somehow the topic of Che Guevara came. Apparently he also admired Che Guevara. He told me about Che's book \"The motorcycle diaries\". He was also surprised that I knew about Che. From then on we got along quite well and became very good friends. He is one of my best friends now.   When I was 21 I got my first tattoo, this same photo of Che on my arm. When I turned 30, I did a world tour. I started in South America and spent 3 months there. And traveled further and made one circle around the world. If I hadn't read \"The motorcycle diaries\" then I wouldn't have got the inspiration to go to South America.  I think reading his biography had a really big impact on me. I like the guy a lot for what he fought for. He inspired me to make a courageous decision to travel around the world.

            "body": "I joined my bachelor’s degree when I was 17 in 2078. Now it’s 2082 and it’s about to be over. I’ve always been the youngest in my class, and only now am I fully realizing how much that affected me.   first and second year, I honestly felt like Dexter from the show, minus the extreme parts. I was constantly observing and thinking things like, is this how friendships work, is this how people normally act, why don’t I like the same things they like, am I even normal. I wasn’t unhappy, but I was not fully aware either. I was mostly just existing and trying to understand people.  I am introverted, shy, and I overthink a lot. I enjoy watching people be wild, dancing, laughing, enjoying themselves, but I am rarely the one doing it. I like the energy, just not participating in it the same way.. and I feel guilty for not participating in it even though thats just not me. It took me time to accept that this is just how I am.  In third year, I became more aware of myself and my surroundings...In fourth year, I finally felt adjusted. I felt like I understood people better, felt more confident, and knew how to exist socially in my own way. And now that feeling has come right when college is ending.  Age makes it worse. Many of my friends joined their bachelor’s when they were 20. I was 20 when I entered fourth year. When I look at my juniors now, many of them are closer to my age than my own classmates, and some are even older than me. Seeing them, It feels like I belonged more with them than with my own batch, a lot of FOMO... so much FOMO..  It feels like I entered college too early, before I was emotionally ready. Like I spent the first half figuring myself out, and just when I finally became normal and adjusted, it was time to leave. My juniors still have years ahead to enjoy college life with awareness, something I feel I missed. I am not saying my college life was bad. It just feels.... incomplete... I guess 'Incomplete' is the correct word here.... Like I arrived late to myself. Is this kind of delayed awareness and FOMO normal?",

I am now looking for practical ways to manage her internet usage without escalating conflict. I am also open to switching to another Wi-Fi provider if they offer better parental control or filtering features.

Here, you can share your craft, whether it’s something you’re building through code, writing, business, art or more.  Think of it as a place to connect, explore, make mistakes, and refine your work.  It’s your digital diary to pour out your thoughts and ideas.   You can also ask for suggestions to start your own side project.  We believe that many great things happen as side projects, and often spontaneously, this is your place to find them.  So many times, I myself have lots of thoughts and ideas to share. I post online here and there, but I realized: what if I posted these things among a community of like minded people where we can learn and grow together?  That’s why I just created this group. Here’s the link: https://facebook.com/groups/2368067140308810/  See you in the group!🙏",

And you know who these people are.  I mean, it’s their choice, and that’s fine. But be honest and say that you are pro-Gagan and that you believe he might be good, you want to give him a chance so you’re supporting him. Cool. That’s alright. Yati bhanda k jancha ra. But instead, they spend all their time attacking RSP and constantly shouting “Sachin, Sachin the Great,” lol.  Ani malai hasuthne kura, they are attacking RSP, which, by the way, is actually quite recent, but somehow, according to them, RSP is the old one and Congress is the new one? What kind of joke is this?  Yes RSP lai ni criticize garna parcha unharu ko ni kamjori cha, but how come Congress is getting titled as new one?  I was just using Twitter and there were tweets about the recent accident where a car used by RSP candidate hit a small child and the child died. That is tragic. But even that, they are turning into politics. Yes, Gagan’s core IT team supporters, **you know who they are,** ali famous nei chan jhan twitter ma ta and they are doing this.  What do they even want RSP to do? They have released a statement, they have said they will comply with the police for anything needed, and the driver is now in police custody. So why make it so political?  I know Harka Sampang is doing the same thing but Harka is a lost cause.  But even these so-called **aware youth Congress supporters** are acting in such a degenerate way and going this low. Damn.  It will be fun to see them losing as well, especially Sachin. Ugh.

Once back home, as he spent time in recovery, he decided to document online his near-death experience and post-protest life](https://nepalitimes.com/news/a-new-normal).  >Dhakal, 18, came home from college that day three months ago and then took the bus to Itahari to join some friends who were protesting in front of the sub-metropolitan city office. It was mid-afternoon, and the crowd was chanting anti-corruption slogans and holding up placards.  >Like most young Nepalis, Dhakal and his friends had been angered by videos on social media of the offspring of Nepal’s rich and powerful flaunting their lavish lifestyles.   >\"That was the trigger for me to join the protest, it opened my eyes to just how widespread nepotism and corruption was,\" Dhakal told Nepali Times.   >The police arrested a few students, angering the crowd even more. They massed at the gate of a nearby police station to demand their friends be released.    >Dhakal was standing across the street from the police station when the first shots rang out. The crowd scattered. As he ran for cover, there was a searing pain in his left jaw. Blood was streaming and it took some time for him to realise he had been shot.   >“I was bleeding profusely and couldn’t speak. My vision blurred, there was a ringing in my ears,” Dhakal recalls. “I collected myself and continued to run, fearing that I would be shot a second time.”  >Dhakal collapsed some distance away, and a fellow protestor took him to a nearby hospital, where doctors bandaged his jaw. He was referred to Birat Medical Teaching Hospital, where surgeons immediately performed an emergency operation.    >The bullet had torn through his left jaw, shattering the bone, teeth, and soft tissue. Blood had rushed into his throat, obstructing the airway so doctors first performed a tracheostomy, installing a tube in his throat to help him keep breathing. A week later, the doctors reconstructed his jaw with metallic plates, grafting skin from his chest and transplanting it to the lower left side of his face.   >Dhakal spent three weeks in hospital before being discharged. But the relief of being home was marred by disturbing thoughts. He says, “Just sitting there doing nothing began to take a toll on my mental health.”    >Since he was always interested in content creation and [producing short documentaries](https://www.youtube.com/@docsbyshantanu), he decided to document online his near-death experience and post-protest life.   >Shantanu Dhakal’s Instagram and TikTok [posts are simple, short videos](https://www.instagram.com/shantanu__dhakal/) every other day about his treatment process, dressing his wound and cleaning his tracheostomy tube, attending events with others injured during the protests, and scenes from everyday life in his family farm.   >The comment section has Nepalis and people from around the world reaching out to ask how he is doing and keeping his spirits up. Dhakal now has a caring social media community, and he uses the platforms to keep in touch with other injured protestors across the country.   >Life is returning to a new normal. This week, he returned to college to resume classes after more than two months and is making up for lost time. He has adjusted to speaking and eating with the tube, although the pain never quite goes away.   >“I can eat mostly fine, but it is still difficult to speak,” he says. Soon, he will go to hospital for his fortnightly follow-up, and doctors will determine when his tracheostomy tube can be removed.  >Like other young Nepalis, Dhakal is now even more politically engaged and actively reads the news of the interim government installed after the GenZ protests.   >With the 5 March elections only three months away, young Nepalis like Dhakal hope that the elections will throw out the old and bring in the new. He is among the more than 800,000 new voters who have registered.   >  [https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/live-ammunition-used-against-nepal-anti-graft-protesters-forensics-show-2025-09-26/](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/live-ammunition-used-against-nepal-anti-graft-protesters-forensics-show-2025-09-26/)  [How Nepalese police shot at protesters with ‘military-grade ammunition’](https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20250915-nepal-police-protests-violence-kathmandu)  >Our team spoke to an arms expert, who requested anonymity, and asked him to identify the weapon used here. He said it was a lightweight 7.62x51mm automatic rifle. Other images posted by protesters show munitions found at the site of the protests.  >We have not been able to independently verify these images, but our expert said they look like “7.62x51 mm calibre munitions to be used in assault rifles”. He added that this is a lethal munition. In his view, there is \"a serious risk of fragmentation in the victim’s body at distances of less than 100 to 200 metres.  >Using this ammunition to maintain public order will result in ‘disproportionate’ risk because this is military-grade ammunition.\"",

What if it's expensive😭 I don't want to do 50/50 and shit, i wanna pay the entire thing. And it seems like he's quite comfy with the 'man pays for the meal' shit tara noooioo. He's just a little baby like me! I don't want to burden him with that. Tyasaile i was kind of thinking of going on a date a few years paxi tara i think it'd be a bit sooner.

For us however, this is our first horrible man made mass scale event.    for example my mother told these are the events she witnessed, heard about ( there was no internet and reporters were getting chhopped up so source is her words and the fear and disgust in her eyes when talking about it)   i, maobadi kidnapped her school science teacher and tied him to the ground and they started nailing him with large and small nails from the legs and hands, slowly and all over his whole body,   ii. they kidnapped a man form his house at night, made him collect firewood from the forest , they started a fire, like a campfire, beside the fire they asked the kidnapped man to dig up a hole, he did exactly what they said. and after all that in the morning they invited many people from the village including his family members, and they burried him alive with his head sticking out form the  ground so that he could hear and see what was happening and finally they covered his head with the burning coals .    these are just examples and your and my parents have seen/ heard about a lot of similar killings kidnapping , public beheading etc  From their point of view, The old parties have maintained peace, ended such horrible war so they have gained a lot of trust. The old parties have shown their strength, in ending rana rule to ending civil war to ending king's direct rule and our parents know what the political paties gave them the rights and freedom which they have now.    So They're willing to bet one more time that These parties can and will always uphold our sovereignty, freedom and country as a whole.  So it is our duty to make them trust the newer political parties,    it is our duty to make them understand that we will not let the sacrifices and changes made by the old political parties Go to ruin ( the rights and freedom given by the constitution).    It is our duty to make them understand that the the political parties which ended rana rule and the kings rule  are themselves becomming similar elites.    It is our duty to make them understand that the old parties are using similar dictatorial practices which our parent and grand parents fought and ended.  And this is not going to be fast and easy, this is a long process will take years and years.   If you cannot convince your family members think how difficult it  is going to make a stranger understand.  And one more question, why would they listen to you. You are so short sighted and narrow minded. you want people to do exactly what you want them to do just because you said it. You start name calling your family members when they questioned choice which you made for them. They gave their reasons why they're voting. And they are damn right on questioning balen. Why should they trust him, just because he and the media said it.  Isn't that we all be doing, questioning . and They are questioning, You failed to give them answers. Its all on you. Have you asked yourself why should i vote balen?? What answer did you get Try answering without using the words like \"purano party\" \"yemale\" etc. does your answer focus more on old parties or the plans and policies for the country. If it is the first choice you're the veda.  One more thing, it is very sad, but the number of people you've killed does not really seem to matter in national level politics. Prachanda has claimed responsibility for 5000 killings. He became PM multiple times. He has sent kids of 13 and 14 years to the front lines to be used as a cannon fodder.   In short, your parents have seen very brutal violence and They know how bad things will be if old parties get elected but They do not know anything about the newer one. ( might be better or might be wayyy bad.) so they're picking certainity instead of incertainity.     |||vote waste garxa euta generation   dukha paauxa arko generation|||Balen haryo bhane, it's not the end of the world.

Testo hunthyo vane ta country dictatorship ma janxa ni ta. Jasle dherai manxe rijauxa tei jitxa. Not the best candidate. \"Democracy never selects the best leader, it always selects the best liar.\"  Janta ko nirasa is justifiable. But it doesn't mean sab janta niras xn, najeek ka jaslai that party favored, they'll definitely vote. And UML ma organizational structure is too better than any other party.  GenZ are immature in terms of voting cause we have probably voted once or this is the first time. We are new, expecting more. But our parents generation they already voted several times, they got Maoist, UML, Congress sabko sarkar whenever they needed. Everytime they had hope it got shattered.    It's not their problem, the problem is our country itself. We are landlocked, we can't manufacture anything at all. We have majority of human resources in another country. How can we expect our country to be developed?   With global power shifts too near, I'm afraid whichever party comes to power, if they can't be diplomatic it's gonna be more problematic.

            "body": "I’m a normal student from a well-known plus two college in Nepal. By some crazy luck, my friend and I got invited to a party full of kids from Ullens, Lincoln, and British Premier. We felt completely invisible. No one knew about us, no one acknowledged us, and it hit me how out of place we were. The whole venue was booked, underage drinking, cigarettes in everyone’s hands, champagne popping like it was nothing, and everyone acting completely normal.  We went to the bathroom to catch our breath and overheard a group of girls chatting. One said, “Oh my God, I love your flats.” Another replied, “They are from Chanel. You should get one too, they’re totally worth it.” Another girl showed her bag, “It’s a vintage Gucci. My grandma bought it in London back in the day. I’m so lucky she still kept it.” Everything felt casual for them but mind-blowing to me.  Luckily, we met the girl who invited us and she introduced us to her friends from Ullens. The first thing she asked was which college I went to. When I told her, she had never even heard of it. We started talking about colleges and I found out these IB kids spend almost thirty lakhs for just two years. If they go on the international school trips to Europe, it can exceed thirty lakhs which it probably does. Examination fees alone can be two to three lakhs and from the info she was giving I found their classes are tiny with highly qualified teachers from prestigious universities and foreign teachers like French teacher to teach French and same for Spanish. Everything is designed to give them the best advantage.  We talked about the future and she casually said that if her studies didn’t work out, her father would just hand her the family business. Everything is planned for them. No matter how wild their lives look with weed, parties, and hookups, their future is cushioned. They were talking about Harvard and Oxford like it was normal. I saw kids driving their own cars, Jaguars, convertibles, Hiluxes, Land Rovers, Mercedes, BMWs. Everyone has everything at sixteen or seventeen.  Honestly, I don’t even hate them because they were genuinely nice. This is just normal for them the same way our life is normal for us. I really hope that one day I can be as successful as their parents so I can afford to do the same for my kids.",

Of course, their lifestyle is bound to be different than us commoners.|||Never knew these thing existed|||Something similar happened to me years ago when I was in Plus 2 at a well-known college. I met a British School student through Instagram, and we became friends. She invited me to her house in Mandikatar. Her father was in the UK, her mother was in the US, and she mentioned they were only in Nepal 2-3 months a year. The house was looked after by two maids and a paley dai.   At first, I only knew that British was \"fancy\" and for wealthy families. I didn't really grasp how different her world was until I experienced it firsthand. Once, we went to watch a movie, she casually pulled out a bundle of 1 lakh in thousand-rupee notes from her tiny Gucci bag, which had even more cash inside. She was only 17.  I am a guy and we were just friends. She was genuinely kind—treating me to countless meals, movies, and outings. She was always loaded. She hooked me up with one of her seniors. After that, I became friends with a bunch of other British kids. I stayed at one girl's fancy ass hugeeeeeeeeeeee bungalow in Boudha for about a week. They were all genuinely nice people. |||Lol, I went to Lincoln, and one thing most kids don’t do is brag like that. Most do go to good colleges, but Harvard and Oxford? That’s like 1 out of 100, even for Lincoln and the British School. Also, not everyone has Land Rovers—the one I saw was related to the Royals in Nepal (through gyanendra or the late princess), and it was orange and pre 2008 model. Some of the kids even take public transportation.  Yes, they are rich, but the way you’re putting it has a lot of masala. I think you should just stick to facts and truths instead of adding so much exaggeration. Bottles of champagne? Lol, even the richest kid in Lincoln wouldn’t do that. Most of their parents work in embassies, so they know where to flaunt and where not to, knowing full well they live in a developing country that just had a Gen Z revolution partially based on nepotism.  I will say, you have lots of FACTS and also lots of LIES to make your story interesting. Expensive fees? 1000% TRUE. More than 5% going to Harvard and Cambridge? FALSE. Hookups at parties—2 out of 20—but the way you put it, it’s like everyone is making out with the opposite sex. LOL, if the reader doesn’t believe me, go to Lincoln School in Rabi Bawan and check in the morning how many Jaguars, Hiluxes, Land Rovers, Mercedes, and BMWs are there. Expensive school, expensive transportation bus costs—but the rest of what the person mentioned is just to incite hate, like movies where the poor are good and the rich are evil—black-and-white nonsense.  And the last touch—saying “I don’t hate them, they are genuinely nice.” Lol, you dish out some TRUTH AND FACTS TINKERED WITH LIES and then say they are nice—just like what happened with the Hilton Hotel (Sher Bahadur Deuba) and the British College scam stories. They spread pitiful, sad stories to indirectly incite hate. One thing I’ll give you: if Eric Cartman was a real person, he would be proud.|||im from ones these school and im suprised you managed to have a conversation 😭 everyones either drunk,high makin out passed out or passed out 💀|||which Nepal is this ?

His granddad gave him one of his standard charter bank card with $50k usd. This was 14 years ago. -_- . Yes, life was fun for me as a teenager 🤣|||Not all of them are like that, though. While it’s true that they live in an entirely different bubble, they’re still living in a third-world country under parents who aren’t all that different from ours, except when it comes to spoiling them. Even then, independence is encouraged. They’re taken care of until they graduate and after that, they work hard (obviously not as hard as your average jyami worker) to maintain the comfortable life they’re accustomed to.  Surprisingly, many of them look down on flashy designer stuff, as it reeks of “nouveau riche.” I’ve met more middle-class people who are flashy about wearing designer brands than upper-class people who went to nice schools like these.  Maybe I’m biased here, since I currently have two such people helping me financially every month (I’m disabled due to my illness and can’t afford my expenses), but they’re incredibly kind too. Not just money-wise, they’re genuinely pleasant to be around. They’re very welcoming and accommodating. I’ve felt more at home with them than I ever have around people from my own social class. Then again, the people I’m talking about are over 25, so that probably contributes to the difference.|||Thats TU (accepting all of us regardless of my financial condition, family background, status) vs KU/PU-Affiliated Colleges.   Do understand this angle as well|||Nepalese are rich only the country is poor.|||Fake|||I think i know which party you talking abt|||Which college are you from?|||The top private schools in ktm charge 3-4 lakhs MONTHLY.

So elite school students will also have to face ground reality once they graduate unless they immigrate. Whereas public school have seen the worst and they can adjust everywhere, survival of the fittest.|||CLASS series plot|||i like how you also observed instead of judging, i love knowing people's bg and what their daily or normal is to them. thanks for sharing this piece of experience. although i feel so much better about being a dental student that pays around 22 or more lakh for bachelors |||And people still think hardwork is what makes you rich🤣🤣🤣.

And don’t mistake me - those schools are insanely expensive but there are so many top 50ish good schools that provide scholarships, etc for deserving students. And its not like peple aren’t going to those. But they just aren’t getting the preparation help and grooming as the great elite schools.   Its not about the money its about access to information. To at least know there are those options out there. I meet many elite school kids who go to great schools abroad and I am happy for them. But not seeing kids from normal schools as often shows the stark disparity in information access. Elite schools - elite teachers, elite information. And of course even from there only a handful go to great global schools etc.   But I just also wish government schools and other private schools at least provided information to students to be able to dream.

Truly sad.|||[removed]|||True we have a huge tourism potential and we could be a destination for adventure sports. Besides trekking (but it's amazing what Nepal offers) we can offer lots of stuff like you mentioned but what we lack is infrastructure. How do you get to the trail head to start your mountain biking? Yes we have roads but how reliable are them. We have seen the safety records. If a rider gets into an accident how fast can medics reach him or her. How are they transferred to the nearest hospital safely.  We could be a destination for high altitude training camps like in Kenya or Colorado or Arizona but again what can we offer besides altitude. We have trails but do we have tracks for the work out ? Do we have a combination of flat and hilly lands around that altitude because Nepal's altitude rises rapidly in a very short distance. I know about a high altitude training program in Jumla. Hope that is a success. Training camp would need a good infra as well like basic PT, Gym, Recovery stuff etc.  We have the potential but we need to harness it. Harness in a sustainable way because if we are to increase the number of tourist sustainability is important, safety records are important because the majority of tourists consider everything, risk vs reward. I hope you succeed in your future endeavors but I suggest you to travel abroad to check the Tourism Sector before you venture on yours. Nearest is Thailand , you could see how they have harnessed their tourism potential. Their service industry compared to any other country in the region is miles ahead. Infrastructure, hospitality, transport etc they have it covered.   It's just my observations as I have traveled across Asia, Americas, Europe  when I can and I always think what Nepal could be.|||Do the cluster analysis of whatever feasible in nepal.

Amazing!|||Yea very high potential for top tourism.  besides the amazing nature, many people also speak English - which is an advantage compared to many Asian countries where majority of their populations can’t speak English.   But the infrastructure just isn’t there yet. Close neighbor who has done it well is Thailand - their tourism industry and volume are another level. Their roads, airports, hospitality, foods, entertainment, tourist police to ensure safety, etc. make it easy to attract tourists.|||Isn’t the lack of infrastructure in Nepal part of what makes it appealing? Difficulty getting to a destination creates meaning. When everything becomes easy, it turns into disposable content for a feed. You don’t get profound experiences, you get optimized tourism. Yes, infrastructure improves lives, and that matters. But if development is driven mainly by attention and clicks, we’re not building a future. We’re building a theme park.",

            "comments": "Much of what we call national Nepal today was shaped by the effort of King Mahendra. Before his time, even school textbooks were in Hindi, children literally had to read “हमारा देशका नाम नेपाल है”. That alone shows how fragile our national identity once was.  Ask yourself, why can’t we clearly distinguish Amar Singh Thapa from Bhimsen Thapa? Because most of the portraits we rely on were painted by the same court artists during King Mahendra’s era. The same question applies to Divya Upadesh, where was it for all those years? Why did it suddenly surface and gain prominence later?  Maybe some things were rediscovered, maybe some were reconstructed, we may never know for sure. But what is certain is this, King Mahendra played a decisive role in nationalising Nepal’s identity, language, history, and sense of self. Fabricated or rediscovered, those efforts unified a fragmented country. And that, undeniably, was a great deed.|||Because this painting was made during the reign of King Mahendra to show brave king Prithvi Narayan Shah as there was no proper art of King Prithvi Narayan.|||Well that's art not history.|||Glad you are exploring this topic. Feels like you are also curious about history and socio-political anthropology.  Mahendra was driven by political consolidation and a single national narrative. His reign coincided with serious regional instability. To the north, Mao’s Cultural Revolution was unfolding in China. To the down   East Pakistan was breaking away to form Bangladesh. In that context, there was a real fear that Nepal’s sovereignty and internal cohesion could be threatened.  As a result, many reforms and symbols were manufactured or standardized during his tenure to construct a unified national identity. This included the bringing of civil service  (bureaucracy, police, army), the national anthem, the national dress (daura suruwal and dakha topi), the national curriculum (mahendra mala), and the formalization of historical narratives and political doctrine.  Much of what is presented as *Divya Upadesh* guidence book from Prithvi Narayan Shah was entirely manufactured and institutionalized during Mahendra’s rule. From the iconic image of Prithvi Narayan Shah, including his gestures of index finger pointing upward direction (we are one unity symbolism), facial features, dress, and artistic representations, to the moral and political messages attributed to him, these were part of a deliberate political project rather than an untouched historical inheritance.  It is also important to remember that during Prithvi Narayan Shah’s time, there was no modern India or China as nation-states. Phrases like “dui dhunga ko tarul” were reframed as geopolitical doctrine. The *Divya Upadesh* attributed to him was manufactured, published, and promoted during Mahendra’s tenure, much like the Mahendra mala national curriculum that emphasizes narratives such as the Nepal–Anglo war was fought bravely and Nepal being “second richest in water resources.” These were not neutral historical facts but components of a deliberate nation-building strategy.|||It’s kind of a propaganda painting. It’s not that uncommon in the world . Look at that Khukuri thing next to his throne. What even is that lol 😂? Even that pose was created for the purpose of propaganda.

Honestly had Gagan not done his bisesh mahadivesh, the 3 parties already had plans to form a coalition and fight the election as one alliance. And it is his stance of not forming any coalition that we have such a strong competition now. But I’m not gonna lie, nothing is fundamentally going to change whoever comes to power. There doesn’t seem to be any proposal for institutional change in Nepal. RSP is basically running on “Out with the old and In with the new” but not new policies (case in point Balen’s Socialist tilt, his post about that cement factory etc).  It seems they just mean out with old people and in with the younger people. Gagan talks about institutional change, how he is going to be the Tony Blair of Nepal and bring about the “Third Way” and revise Nepal’s economy back to the 90’s era of liberalism.

This election is the by-product of a major revolution which overthrew the government. The opposition has won every single election following revolutions - Jana Andolan I (Nepal Congress won the elections after the dissolution of Panchayat) - Jana Andolan II (CPN Maoist won the 2008 constituent assembly). RSP is the radical opposition as most of the influential figureheads of the revolution have now joined the party.  And you can clearly see the hype behind Balen and how RSP became a top 4 party in just 6 months of formation in the last election.   Oli might have won numerous elections in Jhapa-5, but I would put my money on Balen from a statistical perspective. Most importantly, he won with a 55.7% share in the 2022 elections.

            "body": "I and two of my friends (they both abroad now) had once planned to open a Chhyang Factory in Nepal.   Before anything, I did thorough research, budget allocation, finding international markets, our cultural ties to the drink, even learnt to craft it with help of my Newar Friend circle and their families. For the extension of the project I went to Ilam in search of world class millet and spices. Got few leads, came back bought equipments and started making it. Everything was precise, the ferns and ferments, batch tested almost died drinking the first batch, created and recreated again to make a perfect batch. I had documented every single activity.   Now just to be sure, I first went to IRO, the main office of revenue, Lazimpat to check if the laws of Nepal permits Chhyang; and the officials were quite helpful about it, they turned the pages, pointed out Chhyang as rice beer and mentioned it was taxed 10/- NPR per liter as per the laws of Nepal.   Quite hopeful, we set up a meeting with the director of DOI for the next day, stayed all night to give final touch to our documentations, confident that we will be able to establish one.   Next day, both technical and general directors were in the room during our appointment. We presented our plan, applications and the available resources we had for the establishment.   “Bhanne bittikai tesari paincha?” The first words from the reputed officials. It might not be simple but we had our budget, the land lease requirements, technical scheme, and everything intact.   Our point was, “Nepal ko identity drink Korea bata import huncha, with hefty taxes, but if we do it here instead, we would be able to minimize import, provide employment opportunities and possibly export it too!”  I know Korea has it there as their drink as Makgeolli, but merely importing it instead of making chhyang here makes no sense.   After long discussion, the directors came to the conclusion that we submit our proposal with all the schemes, technicalities and budget and then have a meeting with the industry board lead by then minster for Industry, Mahesh Basnet.  We shook our heads, submitted our file, told that we will be called someday for this matter, could be tomorrow or 10 years from now.   We almost gave up at that point. Now both my friends are abroad, promising to return back if they call, but no one calls.   I don’t expect them to call, but sometimes I go to various chatpate stalls just to check if I find the pages of our documentation wrapping those 20/- or 50/- ko chatpate.   TL;DR  1. Nepal imports korean makgeolli as Chhyang, full of preservatives to keep it alive for a ling time.   2. Thoroughly researched-made documentations, technical schemes, budget allocations for establishing Chhyang as a well-lived Nepali Drink.  3. Visited IRO, the main revenue office and got a green flag from them for the establishment.   4. DOI doesn’t give a f\\*ck, instead implied that this is not possible as their books doesn’t recognize Chhyang, so asked us to submit the proposal documents and their classic “pachi aaunu”.  5. Friends gave up moved abroad. I still check if I can find the pages of the proposal wrapped in Chatpates or Badams.",

            "body": "I’ve been wanting to talk about something that’s been quietly frustrating me for a long time, and recent changes just pushed it over the edge.  I live abroad (Canada), and like many Nepalese here, I often get invited by friends to travel to the US for short trips, road trips, concerts, just normal things. Most of my friends have stronger passports, so for them it’s effortless. For me, it’s a completely different story.  Because I hold a Nepali passport, I have to apply for a US visa, wait years just for an interview, and now on top of that, new policies mean things like extremely short visa validity, single entry, and even deposit $15,000 financial bond. After waiting almost two years, it feels like the goalpost just keeps moving.      What makes it especially frustrating is knowing that many of these restrictions exist because of people who entered illegally, overstayed, or misrepresented their situation without considering the long-term consequences. Years later, those consequences don’t fall on them but on people who follow the rules, wait patiently, build legitimate lives abroad, and still get treated with suspicion simply because they share the same passport.  What hurts more than the logistics is the **emotional side** of it:  * The embarrassment of always having to say “I can’t, visa issues” * Feeling left out when friends travel freely * Carrying restrictions that are not because of *my* actions, but because of what *others* before me may have done  It’s frustrating that individual responsibility doesn’t seem to matter. You can be law-abiding, educated, settled, contributing to another country’s economy and still be treated as “high risk” purely because of where you were born.

I was hooked on it for two things. It had a monthly satirical column from Manoj Gajurel and childhood memoirs of Khagendra Sangraula. And their cover stories were also always interesting. On one issue, the cover story was a biography of \"Che Guevara\". I really liked him from then.   And when I was in college I used to dislike this one guy from our class. He low key used to irritate me. He was like ali dherai pose dekhauna parne, sir le padai rako bela taai na tui ko question sodhne, remarks dina parne. One day during a gap period we were talking with classmates and somehow the topic of Che Guevara came. Apparently he also admired Che Guevara. He told me about Che's book \"The motorcycle diaries\". He was also surprised that I knew about Che. From then on we got along quite well and became very good friends. He is one of my best friends now.   When I was 21 I got my first tattoo, this same photo of Che on my arm. When I turned 30, I did a world tour. I started in South America and spent 3 months there. And traveled further and made one circle around the world. If I hadn't read \"The motorcycle diaries\" then I wouldn't have got the inspiration to go to South America.  I think reading his biography had a really big impact on me. I like the guy a lot for what he fought for. He inspired me to make a courageous decision to travel around the world. That magazine \"Nawa Yuwa\" was really good. It changed/guided how I think and shaped me to the person that I am now.|||Yo dai clz ko canteen head hunu hunthyo mitho papdi cht banunu hunthyo rs20 per plate|||remember our own flavour?

One is the government and authorities trying to suppress our freedom of speech, which is a legitimate concern. Though have not seen much push from the government after the infamous social media bill proposed by the Oli Govt.  The second one is media, both legacy and new online-based, and influences censoring themselves lest it make them controversial or disrupt their monetization. Add to that media-people feeding their own biases, amplifying their own echo-chamber and downright peddling lies and deception for monetary gain. This is self-imposed and stems from human fear and greed, not directly government tyranny.   If you want the government yielding its power to silence critics, shamelessly promote the government propaganda and quell dissent, look now more than our neighbor.

            "body": "As someone who used to work at Tribhuvan University, I have closely seen and experienced what student unions stand for, so let me tell you something and share some events.  Most people in those student unions, except for very few, do not have any political ideology at all; all they are able to say is we need to develop the country, have better education, health, employment, infrastructure, and whatnot. So why are they putting so much time and effort into politics?  Simple answer: they get to experience some power and money.  Sometime ago, in our department, the student union of UML threatened the chief to sign documents for tender regarding the purchase of computer equipment. Everything was recorded in video by the chief and we can clearly hear the chief saying it hasn't gone through the process and he doesn't know the quality and details of the purchase, and the response from the student leader was \"Ahile sir yaha kurchi kurchi uthayera hannu naparos...maile vanesi mannu na...sign garnus...tapailai paxi kei man parena vani hami saman nai change garamla....kei farak pardaina...ahile sign garnus...garo banaunu vayo vani hamlai ni garo huna aauxa...tauko tauko ma chair le hannu naparos.\" The campus chief signed. The video became viral over social media in our campus groups, Tribhuvan University asked for clarification, and that is all - no other action taken. The reason for making him sign the document? So that they can purchase lower-quality equipment and put extra money in their pocket.  This other story is of few years back, a professor who worked in USA finally returned to Nepal and he wanted to make a lab at Trichandra campus. When he didn't agree to give commission to NSU (Congress student union) while purchasing spectrometers, they grabbed the old-aged professor from campus and beat him on the road with their legs. This happened less than 300 meters from KTM Police, Ratnapark. He had to be admitted in ICU. And of course, the students got away with no consequences. I think they later told that the cause for beating was increasing college fee.  They also do some good work like speaking for students and speaking against bad decisions of campus administration but doing the comparison, it just feels like they just do the good works to hide their actual intentions. If they get commissions regularly, they stay silent but when they don't get money, they start protesting. Most importantly, they are not hesitant to be violent as they know if they get arrested, it will be for a short period of time, and the police will release them after political pressure. I remember a few UML students even beat up police on dress while drunk a few months ago.  They also slowly transition to national politics and this is what they want to do later on. They want to show as if they are doing works but the only reason is to get commissions.  And this is true not only for these two student unions, it is also true for most of the political associations, including those of professors, students, and employees. Every group forms a political association, and in order for everyone on a committee to agree on something, they have to receive something, leaving not enough money for actual works. This is why we have low quality stuffs, and this is why things take so long to be done. This is why they are able to afford good lifestyle without job being student for decades. Remove the money and freedom to be 'gangster who doesn't get intervened by police' from equation and I wonder how many students will be left in those student unions",

I have had worst possible experience from those unions personally too, so I am not vouching for these activities and completely agree the lawlessness they tend to follow.  But in principle I do think that they have some good purpose to serve, if done properly. I think there are two ways about it:   1. Because they are bad, let's ban them willy nilly.   2. They are bad, but they serve  good purpose in general, so lets think about possibly improving them.  The first one seems easy way out, lets work to ban them altogether. But how? Do we ban students getting together and discussing? What if they don't explicitly say they are party association, the association isn't something that you can prove. Beause unionization, we think,  is something a democracy should allow, does banning them amount to restricting democratic right? This could be a slippery slope and we might never be able to pin point a boundary for them to unionize and associate with some political party, because in principle we can't ban having political viewpoint.     The second seems a bit more ideal. We want to weight in the possible cons compared to the pros that they offer. And, I think if done well, the pros have something good to offer. So in principle I wouldn't ban unionization (students or otherwise). If we have strong criminal prosecution and strong adherence to laws of campus (in case of student unions), we can improve situation a lot. I think that thuggery is not unique to unions but is prevalent in more areas of society and we can't ban them all. Its just the reflection of society and some campus can control  them more some don't.      I have also seen some very good deeds done by the student unions personally, across different student unions. And at times, I have been impressed by what can be achieved by the unionization of student, if done with correct motive.      And lets get real, no one is going to ever ban any sort of unionization be it students or workers or else in a democracy. I have some people think RSP would ban them; they won't.|||Thank you and this presence of student unions in our public education system is a huge problem and if any party can decrease their influence then it is RSP which has no student unions. Gagan led NC won’t do it because he believes in such unions.|||Nepal's Top Uni TU, nothing to be proud of. Poorest at every level.    Few blocks of very old building here and there without any safety and hygiene.    Most of the Professors don't care, they take orders from their parties, they are very arrogant of their degree and don't give time to students.|||Instead of banning them, making them face their consequences would do greater good, is what I think. Imagine if the students who beat the professor were charged with assault. Now that would be the consequence. This would stop evil. We need unionisation for the good things. For the bad things, there should be consequences.|||This so called student union died the day they kept quite when Students were dying in the streets.|||Bro, not just those students, Nepal maa kunai politician ko pani political ideology chainaa.   DO you think KP Oli knows about Stalin and Lelin perspective towards communism?  Do you think Prachanda knows about the Maoi views and his version of communism, and his mistakes as wel?  Do you think Gagan Thapa knows about th tradeoffs between the socialism and Capitalism.  With the sole exception of Baburam Bhattari, and the late BP Koirala, I don't think anyone even knows about any of the political ideologies.   Communism, Capitalism, Socialism, the tradeoffs between each of these, these are a very complex subjects of political and economical nature, people literally do PhD, and spend their whole life on these things, and you think these illiterates, and these corrupt politicians of our country know these ideologies?|||Vanna lai chai sabaile ban student unions vanxan tara sabai naramro hudainan some people actually help students and don't ask for money from the college .

            "body": "i work for a Nepali pharmaceutical company. For the first time in Nepal, we’ve launched locally made medicines for asthma and COPD.  For context: respiratory drugs are the **3rd highest-selling therapeutic segment in Nepal**. Asthma and COPD inhalers alone account for **\\~NPR 2 Arabs  in annual sales**. Historically, about **80% of this market was controlled by one Indian company (Cipla)**, and the remaining 20% was split between a few Indian and Bangladeshi companies.  This is only our **second fiscal year**, and somehow we managed to capture **5–6% market share in the first year itself**. That’s something we’re genuinely proud of.  But here’s the part that’s breaking my motivation: **doctors’ demands**.  Almost every doctor asks for money or “support.” It’s the market norm. Almost every company pays. Prescriptions are openly transactional. Ethics are just buzzwords for conferences.  Our CEO started this respiratory segment after the **2015 blockade**, with the idea of making Nepal at least a little more **self-reliant** in this very technical and critical category. DPI inhalers are not easy to make—there’s a reason very few companies here even attempt it.  Meanwhile:  * Indian pharma companies are **billion-dollar giants** * They have **multiple segments**, massive margins * They get **government subsidies** * Their **cost of production is far lower** * **1% of India’s pharma capacity can supply all of Nepal**  Despite all this, we price our products **lower**, so Nepali patients can save **a few hundred rupees every month**.   We supply huge volumes through **tenders at prices even lower than our own selling price**.   Our margins are thin.      BUT.Doctors don’t give a single shee  about any of this.  I’m honestly not even against paying (keeping gifts aside) . I’ve constantly paid for Direct cash ,Expensive dinners, Lunch packages ,flight tickets , holiday trips  ,even internet bills and  asics shoes ffs.   But at least let it make sense.  If I’m giving someone **1lakh**, I expect **10 lakh** in return. That’s the unspoken thumb rule in this system. But some doctors don’t even do that. They use us as leverage to blackmail bigger Indian companies into paying them more.  I don’t expect patriotism.   I don’t expect ideology.  But if you’re taking money, **at least be loyal**.  There *are* a few genuinely humble and ethical doctors who support us, and I respect them deeply.Some are actually even giving us a good return for our investments. But the majority? They’re just abusing us and companies like ours in the process.  How is a domestic pharmaceutical industry supposed to survive like this?   How do you build anything sustainable when ethics are optional and corruption is normalised?  Just needed to get this off my chest.",

            "body": "Hi everyone,   Sharing this so others don’t get fooled like I did.  I’m a Nepali girl working a 9–6 job. A few days ago around 7 pm, I was heading home on my scooter near Lagankhel. A girl suddenly crossed in front of me, so I slowed down. Then she started calling me and talking in English.  She said she is from China and had taken the wrong bus and needed to go to Banepa. She said she was alone in Nepal, had no money, and urgently needed around Rs. 4000 and asked me for Rs.1000 and said she will ask remaining money to others just as me to take a taxi. She fully convinced me. She kept saying she was scared and didn’t know what to do.  She even promised, “I will return your money tomorrow morning at 10 AM.”  At that moment, I felt bad and trusted her, so I gave her Rs. 1000.  I offered to book her a ride through Pathao/InDrive, but she refused and said she had bad experiences and needed to walk inside the highway area (around 50 meters), which sounded unsafe. I even offered to drop her on my scooter since I was going towards Bhaktapur (closer to Banepa/Dhulikhel side), but she refused that too.  Right after I gave the money, she asked for more, which already felt suspicious, so I refused.  Then something even weirder happened — she immediately took out a small paper and pen and asked me to write my name and phone number. The paper was tiny, just enough space for only my name and number, like it was already prepared. That honestly made it feel very planned and scripted.  Now I’m a bit scared thinking what if she misuses my name or number.  Two days later, I told my office dai about it. He said the **exact same girl (or same story)** approached him in Bhaisepati with the same dialogue, and he also gave her around Rs. 500. That’s when I realized it’s probably a scam.  This is honestly scary because they target kind people by acting helpless and alone.  Just sharing this so others don’t fall for the same thing:  * Don’t give cash to strangers with emotional stories * Offer to book a ride or help them contact authorities instead * If they refuse all practical help and only ask for cash, it’s likely a scam  Has anyone else experienced something similar around Lalitpur/Kathmandu?  Stay safe everyone 🙏",

There are many parliamentarian who diesnt get in those committees.  So what they do?  House of representatives means representatives of ur problem. Where the lawmaking responsibility is given. The local government arent all equal. Like my constituency which is rural cant sustain itself from the municipal budgets. Cause being rural means there will be low taxes. And essential infrastructure like pitch roads, water supply, and even construction of hospital infrastructure and major high school can only by done by federal and provincial budgets.   Now. What does ur representative do? He goes to ministry or NPC and bring ur problem. \"Khanne pani xaina... k? Mero constituency ko janta pani nakhai kina marney ho?????\"... then the ministry direct budget to ur constituency under the MP's jurisdiction or collective MPs project.   Thats how it works. Timi municipal budget ma matra focus gareu bhanney.. none of he municipal government beside ktm and pokhara and biratnagar will sustain itself. (Even bharatpur cant).  So dont look at them just as lawmakers but also representatives. Their work will determine if budget goes to ur constituency or not. Hope it shed some lights.  There is no equally distribution.... 165 constituency mai budget badyo bhanney.. it will not work. As in pugdaina... and there is no saving.. auta fiscal year ma nasakako budget gets returned back to treasury and redistributed again...

Just recently, around the time of Madhesh andolan, people still viewed the hill people of places like darjeeling as Nepali and the people of Madhesh as Indian. Oli's actions divided padadis and madhesis. But with the current GenZ uprising, I have noticed that it is no more madhesi vs pahadi in politics but its old parties vs new parties now. It is not a deep cultural bond yet but the bond gets stronger every day. I am sorry to have brought this political issue into something personal that you faced. I too hope people see beyond race for a better Nepal. Cheers.|||I don't hate or discriminate Madheshi because I'm also from Terai lol 😆. Jokes aside, I don't call myself Madhesi, I think we should call ourselves Maithili People or just Terai people.   The disdain people have towards us is because they don't like Indians (biharis and up and other Indians in general). And, people can't just seperate us from Indians by just looking at us, and that's the main reason.   As a matter of fact our terai people aren't also any less racist, it's just that Terai people go to Kathmandu or other places for work or studies so they have more stories of racism.   Last year my friends from Kathmandu visited Janakpurdham and they face racism there. I think most non Terai people don't travel to terai region and that's why they don't have much stories of racism.   I think people are just slightly racist and xenophobic to some extent. What makes me happy and love this country is this is decreasing over time not increasing, and that's enough for me.  We Terai people really need to differentiate ourselves from the Indians, that would be for the best.|||I got a friend who's an Bhagat by caste and I don't seem he getting offended by madesi word at all its just how u view how u act with others i call him Chaudhary ti mock him and he back fires at me if u act nice humble and don't overreact sometimes it doesn't matter who u are|||पहाडीहरूले मधेसीलाई हेप्दा अन्धोले कानोलाई हेपेझैँ लाग्छ।😂😂😂|||tanna paisa kamaunus , esto feelings sab hatxa pachi :)|||I am sorry bro.

I actually know 1 person who does not like this kind of momo, says it is too bland! If you want it even simpler, try without garlic. I also add onions, along with green onions, but if you do, need to remove as much water from raw onions as possible. Also try adding some veg oil and butter.  |||It's the achaar that is more important.|||I agree. Because we eat it with jhol or twakka pareko achaar. masala in the filling tends to overpower everything. Using only chicken breast can make the filling bland, but using different cuts of meat adds much more flavour, texture, umami and juiciness.    For veg momo, I use dried and soaked mushrooms, regular mushrooms, tofu, and cabbage + ginger and garlic and it tastes soo good! |||That's your opinion and that's perfectly fine. There's no right or wrong way to enjoy food. I like masala in my momo.|||Yes, like someone else said, Tibetan momos aren't spicy. They use yak or beef too, so it's got a supportive flavor profile for that.  Ones that originated out of the valley use buff though. And they use spices because it absolutely rocks your tastebuds, and at times are delicious even without the chutney/jhol. Places like shandar/narayan dai momo taste great just on themselves easily.  There's no proving you wrong if it's your choice/tastes. But the purbeli type momo you described, I find really bland.|||I see you are man with fine palate. Besides, maybe buff they really don't need masala.|||I don't know what they put it in, but I love shaandar, narayan dai, kiran dai style momo taste.

Mine is 2.75% per annum.   What i try to do with my salary is... Save 50% enjoy with 25% and invest 25%. I found this method on the internet long time ago and tried my best to stick to it. Most of it gets spend on my clg fees or when doing big purchase like phone, laptop etc which in a way i believe is an investment / what you deserve kind of thing.   Then i invest 25% or sometimes more on the share market. I hope you are already filling IPOs at least as that has made me good money which i started 4-5 years ago. With secondary market also i have got 3X 4X sometimes 5X the bank interest rates returns over these years. (Currently in loss haha:) So i recommend you to start investing by learning about it first..   With savings alone.. i think you are privileged and doing better than 90% lol. So i wouldn't say that's not the smartest move. That's the safest way there is if inflation is not that bad in the future.

            "body": "I used to always wonder how some people are smart. I couldn’t believe how simple it was. I’ll tell you the main tricks here so you can become one.  I love this tweet by Brian Norgard: “The smartest people in almost every field have a physics background.”  Aristotle, Newton, da Vinci, Richard Feynman, Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, Jim Simons, Geoffrey Hinton, the list goes on and on. If you actually check the background of smart people, most of them are good at logic, which comes from math and physics.  Physics teaches you what is true. It is simply the search for truth. For now, physics is the highest form of truth we have. It might be something else in the future, but that doesn’t matter. By studying physics, you’re basically studying how everything works.  Back to Jim Simons: “You can teach a physicist finance, but you cannot teach a finance person physics.”  After becoming good at physics, you can learn anything, because you’ve already tackled one of the hardest things.  Math teaches you how to think. If you want to learn physics, math becomes necessary, because without it you can’t learn physics. That’s where the importance of math comes in.  Other examples are engineering and computer science. These subjects revolve around the same ideas as well.  Basically, you build your foundation on science. These subjects teach you to think logically and critically, and most importantly, they force you to see the world from a different angle.  That’s it. You just learned the secret to become smart. You’re welcome.  Essay inspired by [Scott](https://share.google/ShBJhO7M70xdglnT4) Adam.

Hoping i won't have to work for such an ass company|||I run a software company in Nepal and we specialize in building custom SaaS solutions. Your math is spot on, paying $21,600/year (approx 30 Lakhs NPR) for standard time-tracking features is a massive leak in your OpEx.  Building this in-house is the correct move for a team of 300+, but you need the right architecture so you don't cripple your employees' computers.  **The Architecture I Recommend:**  * **Desktop Agent (The Tracker):** Built with **Tauri (Rust + JS)**. Unlike Electron apps which eat 200MB+ RAM, a Tauri app is tiny (<15MB) and uses negligible memory. It stays invisible until needed. * **Backend & Dashboard:** **Laravel + FilamentPHP**. This handles the multi-tenancy, employee management, and provides a clean admin panel for your screenshots and time logs. * **Storage: AWS S3 / Any s3 compatible provider of your choice:** critical when you are syncing thousands of screenshots daily.  **My Quote & Estimation:** We can build a production-ready version of \"Time Monitor\" (custom branded for you) for a **one-time fee**.  * **Development Cost:** **NPR 10 lakhs** (One-time). * **Timeline:** 4-6 Weeks (Dev + QA). * **Deliverables:** Windows/Mac/Linux agents + Web admin Dashboard + Source Code.  **Your New Recurring Costs (Infrastructure):** You move from paying $1,800/month to paying for raw server usage only:  * **VPS (Hetzner/DigitalOcean/Local provider in Nepal ( Datahub )):** \\~$30/month. * **Storage (Screenshots):** \\~$10-$20/month. * **Code Signing Cert (Required for Windows/Mac):** \\~$30/month (amortized). * **Total:** **\\~$80/month.** (You save \\~95% immediately).  **Why the quote range?** The complexity isn't in taking screenshots; it's in the edge cases. Handling offline syncing (when internet cuts out), idle time detection (keyboard/mouse hooks without false positives), and auto-updating 300 clients requires robust engineering, not just a script.  If you are serious about owning your infrastructure and cutting this cost permanently, let's chat.|||is it a time doctor ?|||I already have a laravel built project management with time tracking.

The other 20%, you can increase your luck surface area by applying to more remote friendly companies and building relationships with founders/teams of the company you want to work for (there are many ways to do this).   It takes time and an unmetered motivation. It can be done. Good luck bro.|||I myself have been doing remote jobs along with my Filipino partner, it's mostly about how you appeal the clients rather than just skills, i would say 80% of it is grabbing their attention and the rest is the actual work. There are people who are far above and beyond what I am in terms of skills but they suck at presenting their skills. If you want to know more about how you can land a client or employer listen to Pakistani and Filipino fellows out there, they are pretty good at this. Rather than targeting big companies, target small companies or even indie business people who are just starting out, you'll have a bigger chance. We have one doctor who's been paying us monthly for the last 3 years. It may certainly not be true to make about 3 to 5 thousand dollars from one employer but the good thing about is you can work for multiple ones simultaneously as long as it's not 9-5 or something like that.

Approach as many companies or businesses as you can and don't be limited to just Upwork or LinkedIn and see the magic happening.

PDF: Nepal is a landlocked country located in South Asia, bordered by China to the north and India to the south, east, and west. It is renowned for its dramatic geography, which ranges from the lowland Terai plains in the south to the towering Himalayan mountain range in the north, including Mount Everest, the highest peak in the world at 8,848.86 meters. Nepal has a rich cultural and historical heritage shaped by Hinduism and Buddhism, with ancient cities like Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, and Patan showcasing centuries-old temples, palaces, and intricate wood carvings. The country is the birthplace of Lord Buddha, who was born in Lumbini around the 6th century BCE. Nepal follows a federal democratic republic system and is divided into seven provinces after the constitution was adopted in 2015. Nepali is the official language, but the country is ethnically and linguistically diverse, with over 120 languages spoken. Agriculture remains a major part of the economy, employing a large portion of the population, while tourism is another vital sector due to trekking, mountaineering, and cultural tourism. Despite its natural beauty and cultural wealth, Nepal faces challenges such as political instability, economic dependency on remittances, natural disasters like earthquakes, and infrastructure limitations. The devastating earthquake of 2015 caused massive loss of life and heritage sites, but the country has shown resilience through reconstruction and social unity. Nepal maintains a unique identity through its traditions, festivals like Dashain and Tihar, and its ability to balance ancient customs with gradual modernization.  # Questions I tested in the video  **Single-Chunk Question**   • What countries border Nepal?  **Multi-Chunk Question**   • Why is Nepal considered geographically diverse?  **Complex / Reasoning Question**   • How do Nepal’s geography and economy influence each other?  **Cross-Context Question**   • Explain how Nepal’s religious history contributes to its tourism industry.  **Hallucination Test**   • Who was the first king of unified Nepal?  The knowledge base is intentionally small so retrieval behavior is easy to observe.  # Tech stack  * **Frontend:** React * **Backend:** Node.js + Express * **Database:** PostgreSQL ( for user data) * **Vector DB:** ChromaDB * **LLM:** Gemini * **Embeddings:** Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2  # Looking for feedback on  * Chunk size & overlap strategies * Better ways to handle hallucination detection * RAG evaluation ideas (precision/recall, answer grounding, etc.) * Any missing features you’d expect in a “real” RAG system  This is a learning project, not production — open to suggestions and critique",

We tend to reduce individuals into neat categories of \"good\" or \"bad,\" when in reality most human lives exist somewhere in a moral gray space.  The figures are indeed contributions to modern society, having shaped our understanding of the universe in the case of Stephen Hawking and the overwhelming propagation of personal computing that underpins everyday life, thanks to Bill Gates. Their contributions are objective in nature, measured, and historically significant.  The Epstein case has indeed cast a sinister shadow on the reputations and personal integrity of those associated with it. Any wrongdoing ought to be investigated, prosecuted, and judged on its merits. Accountability counts.  Yet, it is quite dangerous to erase or dismiss intellectual and scientific contributions on the basis of particular personal moral failures; by doing so, it is an effort to distort history. If we were to get rid of every successful idea that had come from flawed individuals, much of human progress would disappear along with those who themselves were flawed.  We can—and should—condemn bad behavior without discarding valuable, valid contributions to knowledge and society.  Scientists are more likely to value human progress, curiosity, and long-term thinking—but they are not immune to moral failure. Their work can be noble even when their personal lives are flawed. Judgment must be based on evidence, not archetypes.|||He did biggest contribution for science. Do you really believe that he did something with those minor girls? He can't even do anything.

            "body": "Lets not forget how shitty Nepali Congress can be when it comes to protecting their gunda student netas. Remember Prem Chalaune, the sociology prof at Tribhuvan University?  Back in Oct 2020, NSU thugs (that's NC's student wing) locked up his department over some political bullshit protest. When he tried to unlock the tala to get classes going, they jumped him with iron rods and sticks, beat him so bad he had a fractured leg, head wounds, and was left bleeding on the street. He said in interviews they only stopped when other people on the street showed up, otherwise, he'd be dead for sure.  And our so called Yuwa Neta **Gagan Thapa?** Dude was silent as a mouse until everyone started tagging him on Twitter and pressuring him hard. Only then he spoke a lil about it, tyo ni last moment ma, but come on, his own party's goons did this!   Now his IT cell is out here whitewashing NC's image, hiding crime like this to make them look clean for votes. But hey, Gagan fans, why cant you critisize your party where its wrong? Just yesterday, thier KTM 4 candiate Sachin was comparing Gagan to Ram lol, like he's some silent god, but wait, \"Ram\" was dead silent and didnt utter a word when his own predecessors from student union beat a teacher almost to death. Hypocrisy much?  This is the kinda impunity NC breeds, government even tried to drop the case in 2023, **forcing Chalaune to hunger strike for justice.** Yes, Hunger strike ma basnu pareko thyo, can you imagine?   Court finally convicted the 6 goons in 2023 (upheld 2025), but two fled abroad with fake docs. Yes fake docs. In December 2024, Professor Prem Chalaune wrote formal letters to the **US Ambassador** (Dean R. Thompson) and the **Australian Ambassador** (Leann Johnston). Chalaune specifically alleged in these letters that they used fraudulent documents to flee while their cases were still sub judice (under consideration by the court).  If NC wins again, expect more of this thug politics ruining our unis and lives. Vote smart, dont let them fool you.",

I used to follow lok dohori and I liked Samikshya back then. I didn't like Paul and still don't like him . Samikshya le case file garnu 2-3 month aghi there were rumours that she loved Paul . Later there were news that Samikshya demanded Paul to marry her and threatened that if he didn't then she would file a case against him. Later Durgesh Thapa didn't have good terms with Paul and then durgesh provoked samikshya to file case against Paul.  Samikshya was fine being with Paul but jaba Paul le ma bihey gardina vanyo and with the support of Durgesh , she filed the case. There are still some leaked audios in the youtube in which Durgesh is clearly telling Samikshya to use the \"women card\" to cause trouble to Paul. Also, she herself said \"Jay Nari\" indicating that if a women files a case , she would win that even if the girl is the culprit. Looking at all these, I don't think its fair. She was basically blackmailing him.  I don't want to get into grooming, minor and all sorts of stuff. I am not defending anyone here. F\\*\\*k paul , give him imprisonment and punish him whatever the law says.  Action should be taken  against those cyber bullies Samikshya on social media too.   I don't support any kind of hatred .  What I am saying here is Samikshya isn't that innocent either. I don't know if being minor lets her be free from all these things and file cases based on her mood .

At this point, if someone still thinks Harka is a genuine person, I honestly don’t know how big of a fool you have to be.  Now, about this, this incident is from years back right? f that’s the case, and Sudan already knew how Harka was, then why did he support bringing Harka into the government after the protest?  There’s literally an interview of Sudan Gurung, I think it was taken by OnlineKhabar, where he clearly said that his choice for Home Minister was actually Harka Sampang. Yes, he really said that. Initially, he wanted Harka Sampang to become Home Minister instead of Om Prakash Aryal.  So if Sudan already had past experience with Harka and knew what kind of person he was, then why would he see him as fit for Home Minister? Even someone naive could tell, that there’s no way this guy should be in any Ministry.  I honestly don’t understand this.  And look, I’m not saying Sudan is a bad person.

I'm still in confusition regarding courses and Being a \"mature\" student after a long break is one thing, but there are a few other things on my mind:  ​The Cost: It’s costing about 8-10 lakh for the 3 years, which is a big investment.   ​The Pattern: The course follows a trimester system and assignments based. I’ve never studied this way before—is it hard to keep up?  ​Future Master’s: Since it’s an 3 years of Bachelor degree which equivalent to TU but, I’m worried about whether foreign universities will accept this degree if I want to do a Master’s later.  ​I have no experience with this type of international college setup.  ​Is anyone else in a similar \"affiliate\" program?  How are you finding the trimester workload, and do you feel the degree is worth the high cost?  ​I'd love to hear from anyone who started their degree after a gap!",

Or if you are better at remembering then I suggest you stick to it though you can't get much farther by just remembering in maths but you can get up to 10-12 easily with it.|||practice hard questions, challenging section of DR Simkhada perhaps  Just do really hard questions, if you are able to do it, your brain will just adapt to easy questions and help you break it down more easily  during my prep, I used to spend several late night hours, if not days solving problems until I get something out of it (in 9th grade), and that helped a lot, even for 11th grade|||old is gold gokdeu sabai|||Mero  just pass to 72out of 75 ko journey ma 1 din ma 16 ghanta lagatar padeko matra yaad xa lol Maybe book ko sab question practice gara and dont hesitate to take some cheats.

Personal recommendation: read the topics thoroughly, understand the details and write every single detail you see, ask why shit happens and why it works, re-understand it and note it somewhere again and again until shit becomes natural and makes sense. Then go to questions, easy to hard and skip the filler ones, only the ones you find to be necessary and dont do it step by step, just get the answer and if the steps make sense, you have understood it, when if you dont have much time for exams (like 1-2 days before exam and want to score good)    If you do have time, solve some model sets, old is gold, just like in exam-style or format in a loose sheet preferably under time constraint. It allows you to see any sort of loopholes in the question, or possibly exam pattern you can use to your advantage (works for subs like english and nepali mainly) and ask your teachers to check it.",

For us however, this is our first horrible man made mass scale event.    for example my mother told these are the events she witnessed, heard about ( there was no internet and reporters were getting chhopped up so source is her words and the fear and disgust in her eyes when talking about it)   i, maobadi kidnapped her school science teacher and tied him to the ground and they started nailing him with large and small nails from the legs and hands, slowly and all over his whole body,   ii. they kidnapped a man form his house at night, made him collect firewood from the forest , they started a fire, like a campfire, beside the fire they asked the kidnapped man to dig up a hole, he did exactly what they said. and after all that in the morning they invited many people from the village including his family members, and they burried him alive with his head sticking out form the  ground so that he could hear and see what was happening and finally they covered his head with the burning coals .    these are just examples and your and my parents have seen/ heard about a lot of similar killings kidnapping , public beheading etc  From their point of view, The old parties have maintained peace, ended such horrible war so they have gained a lot of trust. The old parties have shown their strength, in ending rana rule to ending civil war to ending king's direct rule and our parents know what the political paties gave them the rights and freedom which they have now.    So They're willing to bet one more time that These parties can and will always uphold our sovereignty, freedom and country as a whole.  So it is our duty to make them trust the newer political parties,    it is our duty to make them understand that we will not let the sacrifices and changes made by the old political parties Go to ruin ( the rights and freedom given by the constitution).    It is our duty to make them understand that the the political parties which ended rana rule and the kings rule  are themselves becomming similar elites.    It is our duty to make them understand that the old parties are using similar dictatorial practices which our parent and grand parents fought and ended.  And this is not going to be fast and easy, this is a long process will take years and years.   If you cannot convince your family members think how difficult it  is going to make a stranger understand.  And one more question, why would they listen to you. You are so short sighted and narrow minded. you want people to do exactly what you want them to do just because you said it. You start name calling your family members when they questioned choice which you made for them. They gave their reasons why they're voting. And they are damn right on questioning balen. Why should they trust him, just because he and the media said it.  Isn't that we all be doing, questioning . and They are questioning, You failed to give them answers. Its all on you. Have you asked yourself why should i vote balen?? What answer did you get Try answering without using the words like \"purano party\" \"yemale\" etc. does your answer focus more on old parties or the plans and policies for the country. If it is the first choice you're the veda.  One more thing, it is very sad, but the number of people you've killed does not really seem to matter in national level politics. Prachanda has claimed responsibility for 5000 killings. He became PM multiple times. He has sent kids of 13 and 14 years to the front lines to be used as a cannon fodder.   In short, your parents have seen very brutal violence and They know how bad things will be if old parties get elected but They do not know anything about the newer one. ( might be better or might be wayyy bad.) so they're picking certainity instead of incertainity.     |||vote waste garxa euta generation   dukha paauxa arko generation|||Balen haryo bhane, it's not the end of the world.

            "body": "I’m a normal student from a well-known plus two college in Nepal. By some crazy luck, my friend and I got invited to a party full of kids from Ullens, Lincoln, and British Premier. We felt completely invisible. No one knew about us, no one acknowledged us, and it hit me how out of place we were. The whole venue was booked, underage drinking, cigarettes in everyone’s hands, champagne popping like it was nothing, and everyone acting completely normal.  We went to the bathroom to catch our breath and overheard a group of girls chatting. One said, “Oh my God, I love your flats.” Another replied, “They are from Chanel. You should get one too, they’re totally worth it.” Another girl showed her bag, “It’s a vintage Gucci. My grandma bought it in London back in the day. I’m so lucky she still kept it.” Everything felt casual for them but mind-blowing to me.  Luckily, we met the girl who invited us and she introduced us to her friends from Ullens. The first thing she asked was which college I went to. When I told her, she had never even heard of it. We started talking about colleges and I found out these IB kids spend almost thirty lakhs for just two years. If they go on the international school trips to Europe, it can exceed thirty lakhs which it probably does. Examination fees alone can be two to three lakhs and from the info she was giving I found their classes are tiny with highly qualified teachers from prestigious universities and foreign teachers like French teacher to teach French and same for Spanish. Everything is designed to give them the best advantage.  We talked about the future and she casually said that if her studies didn’t work out, her father would just hand her the family business. Everything is planned for them. No matter how wild their lives look with weed, parties, and hookups, their future is cushioned. They were talking about Harvard and Oxford like it was normal. I saw kids driving their own cars, Jaguars, convertibles, Hiluxes, Land Rovers, Mercedes, BMWs. Everyone has everything at sixteen or seventeen.  Honestly, I don’t even hate them because they were genuinely nice. This is just normal for them the same way our life is normal for us. I really hope that one day I can be as successful as their parents so I can afford to do the same for my kids.",

Of course, their lifestyle is bound to be different than us commoners.|||Never knew these thing existed|||Something similar happened to me years ago when I was in Plus 2 at a well-known college. I met a British School student through Instagram, and we became friends. She invited me to her house in Mandikatar. Her father was in the UK, her mother was in the US, and she mentioned they were only in Nepal 2-3 months a year. The house was looked after by two maids and a paley dai.   At first, I only knew that British was \"fancy\" and for wealthy families. I didn't really grasp how different her world was until I experienced it firsthand. Once, we went to watch a movie, she casually pulled out a bundle of 1 lakh in thousand-rupee notes from her tiny Gucci bag, which had even more cash inside. She was only 17.  I am a guy and we were just friends. She was genuinely kind—treating me to countless meals, movies, and outings. She was always loaded. She hooked me up with one of her seniors. After that, I became friends with a bunch of other British kids. I stayed at one girl's fancy ass hugeeeeeeeeeeee bungalow in Boudha for about a week. They were all genuinely nice people. |||Lol, I went to Lincoln, and one thing most kids don’t do is brag like that. Most do go to good colleges, but Harvard and Oxford? That’s like 1 out of 100, even for Lincoln and the British School. Also, not everyone has Land Rovers—the one I saw was related to the Royals in Nepal (through gyanendra or the late princess), and it was orange and pre 2008 model. Some of the kids even take public transportation.  Yes, they are rich, but the way you’re putting it has a lot of masala. I think you should just stick to facts and truths instead of adding so much exaggeration. Bottles of champagne? Lol, even the richest kid in Lincoln wouldn’t do that. Most of their parents work in embassies, so they know where to flaunt and where not to, knowing full well they live in a developing country that just had a Gen Z revolution partially based on nepotism.  I will say, you have lots of FACTS and also lots of LIES to make your story interesting. Expensive fees? 1000% TRUE. More than 5% going to Harvard and Cambridge? FALSE. Hookups at parties—2 out of 20—but the way you put it, it’s like everyone is making out with the opposite sex. LOL, if the reader doesn’t believe me, go to Lincoln School in Rabi Bawan and check in the morning how many Jaguars, Hiluxes, Land Rovers, Mercedes, and BMWs are there. Expensive school, expensive transportation bus costs—but the rest of what the person mentioned is just to incite hate, like movies where the poor are good and the rich are evil—black-and-white nonsense.  And the last touch—saying “I don’t hate them, they are genuinely nice.” Lol, you dish out some TRUTH AND FACTS TINKERED WITH LIES and then say they are nice—just like what happened with the Hilton Hotel (Sher Bahadur Deuba) and the British College scam stories. They spread pitiful, sad stories to indirectly incite hate.

While it’s true that they live in an entirely different bubble, they’re still living in a third-world country under parents who aren’t all that different from ours, except when it comes to spoiling them. Even then, independence is encouraged. They’re taken care of until they graduate and after that, they work hard (obviously not as hard as your average jyami worker) to maintain the comfortable life they’re accustomed to.  Surprisingly, many of them look down on flashy designer stuff, as it reeks of “nouveau riche.” I’ve met more middle-class people who are flashy about wearing designer brands than upper-class people who went to nice schools like these.  Maybe I’m biased here, since I currently have two such people helping me financially every month (I’m disabled due to my illness and can’t afford my expenses), but they’re incredibly kind too. Not just money-wise, they’re genuinely pleasant to be around. They’re very welcoming and accommodating. I’ve felt more at home with them than I ever have around people from my own social class. Then again, the people I’m talking about are over 25, so that probably contributes to the difference.|||Thats TU (accepting all of us regardless of my financial condition, family background, status) vs KU/PU-Affiliated Colleges.   Do understand this angle as well|||Nepalese are rich only the country is poor.|||Fake|||I think i know which party you talking abt|||Which college are you from?|||The top private schools in ktm charge 3-4 lakhs MONTHLY.

And don’t mistake me - those schools are insanely expensive but there are so many top 50ish good schools that provide scholarships, etc for deserving students. And its not like peple aren’t going to those. But they just aren’t getting the preparation help and grooming as the great elite schools.   Its not about the money its about access to information. To at least know there are those options out there. I meet many elite school kids who go to great schools abroad and I am happy for them. But not seeing kids from normal schools as often shows the stark disparity in information access. Elite schools - elite teachers, elite information. And of course even from there only a handful go to great global schools etc.   But I just also wish government schools and other private schools at least provided information to students to be able to dream.

Mountain biking through villages, high trails, suspension bridges, ancient trade routes, with some of the biggest mountains on Earth looming in the background.  Why does this feel niche  instead of world-famous? Because that article could just as easily have been about: Trail running Ultra-marathons Spiritual retreats High-altitude training camps Wildlife + jungle + mountain combo trips Culture + adventure hybrids  Nepal has all of this. Nepal's own USP.  Yet Nepal gets ~1 million tourists a year. Countries with far less diversity get 5–10x more. The problem isn’t that Nepal lacks attractions  The problem is that Nepal’s tourism often exists as: “Something travelers discover on their own”  Nepal isn’t just a trekking destination. It’s an: Adventure sports destination Slow travel destination Culture-plus-nature destination Year-round destination (if positioned properly)  I am personally planning to venture into Tourism.

Decent food  Cons: 1. Awful international airport 2. Terrible roads 3. Eating local food and drinking local water will make travelers sick 4. Polluted, cramped, chaotic, dirty cities 5. Garbage everywhere 6. No direct flights to Europe, US, or Australia  Futute vision should be something like:  Travelers arrive at one of Nepal's many modern, spacious international airports, from where they'd take easy metro to the nearest cities, all of which provide an easy access to adventures that fill the entire spectrum of bare-bones to ultra luxury. Eating street food and drinking any water causes no stomach issues.  That's just my quick brainstorming.|||What Nepal needs is a good PR team too|||You are right mate.. but due to political instability and corruption makes country backwards..Nepal has big potential to get developed which lays between big giants neighbors.|||So true. I have so many friends abroad who've told me they want to do the ABC trek in the last year, but they've always changed their minds when they've seen what's been going on in the country. Truly sad.|||[removed]|||True we have a huge tourism potential and we could be a destination for adventure sports. Besides trekking (but it's amazing what Nepal offers) we can offer lots of stuff like you mentioned but what we lack is infrastructure. How do you get to the trail head to start your mountain biking? Yes we have roads but how reliable are them. We have seen the safety records. If a rider gets into an accident how fast can medics reach him or her. How are they transferred to the nearest hospital safely.  We could be a destination for high altitude training camps like in Kenya or Colorado or Arizona but again what can we offer besides altitude. We have trails but do we have tracks for the work out ? Do we have a combination of flat and hilly lands around that altitude because Nepal's altitude rises rapidly in a very short distance. I know about a high altitude training program in Jumla. Hope that is a success. Training camp would need a good infra as well like basic PT, Gym, Recovery stuff etc.  We have the potential but we need to harness it. Harness in a sustainable way because if we are to increase the number of tourist sustainability is important, safety records are important because the majority of tourists consider everything, risk vs reward. I hope you succeed in your future endeavors but I suggest you to travel abroad to check the Tourism Sector before you venture on yours. Nearest is Thailand , you could see how they have harnessed their tourism potential. Their service industry compared to any other country in the region is miles ahead. Infrastructure, hospitality, transport etc they have it covered.   It's just my observations as I have traveled across Asia, Americas, Europe  when I can and I always think what Nepal could be.|||Do the cluster analysis of whatever feasible in nepal.

But the infrastructure just isn’t there yet. Close neighbor who has done it well is Thailand - their tourism industry and volume are another level. Their roads, airports, hospitality, foods, entertainment, tourist police to ensure safety, etc. make it easy to attract tourists.|||Isn’t the lack of infrastructure in Nepal part of what makes it appealing? Difficulty getting to a destination creates meaning. When everything becomes easy, it turns into disposable content for a feed. You don’t get profound experiences, you get optimized tourism. Yes, infrastructure improves lives, and that matters. But if development is driven mainly by attention and clicks, we’re not building a future. We’re building a theme park.",

Before his time, even school textbooks were in Hindi, children literally had to read “हमारा देशका नाम नेपाल है”. That alone shows how fragile our national identity once was.  Ask yourself, why can’t we clearly distinguish Amar Singh Thapa from Bhimsen Thapa? Because most of the portraits we rely on were painted by the same court artists during King Mahendra’s era. The same question applies to Divya Upadesh, where was it for all those years? Why did it suddenly surface and gain prominence later?  Maybe some things were rediscovered, maybe some were reconstructed, we may never know for sure. But what is certain is this, King Mahendra played a decisive role in nationalising Nepal’s identity, language, history, and sense of self. Fabricated or rediscovered, those efforts unified a fragmented country. And that, undeniably, was a great deed.|||Because this painting was made during the reign of King Mahendra to show brave king Prithvi Narayan Shah as there was no proper art of King Prithvi Narayan.|||Well that's art not history.|||Glad you are exploring this topic. Feels like you are also curious about history and socio-political anthropology.  Mahendra was driven by political consolidation and a single national narrative. His reign coincided with serious regional instability. To the north, Mao’s Cultural Revolution was unfolding in China. To the down   East Pakistan was breaking away to form Bangladesh. In that context, there was a real fear that Nepal’s sovereignty and internal cohesion could be threatened.  As a result, many reforms and symbols were manufactured or standardized during his tenure to construct a unified national identity. This included the bringing of civil service  (bureaucracy, police, army), the national anthem, the national dress (daura suruwal and dakha topi), the national curriculum (mahendra mala), and the formalization of historical narratives and political doctrine.  Much of what is presented as *Divya Upadesh* guidence book from Prithvi Narayan Shah was entirely manufactured and institutionalized during Mahendra’s rule. From the iconic image of Prithvi Narayan Shah, including his gestures of index finger pointing upward direction (we are one unity symbolism), facial features, dress, and artistic representations, to the moral and political messages attributed to him, these were part of a deliberate political project rather than an untouched historical inheritance.  It is also important to remember that during Prithvi Narayan Shah’s time, there was no modern India or China as nation-states. Phrases like “dui dhunga ko tarul” were reframed as geopolitical doctrine. The *Divya Upadesh* attributed to him was manufactured, published, and promoted during Mahendra’s tenure, much like the Mahendra mala national curriculum that emphasizes narratives such as the Nepal–Anglo war was fought bravely and Nepal being “second richest in water resources.” These were not neutral historical facts but components of a deliberate nation-building strategy.|||It’s kind of a propaganda painting. It’s not that uncommon in the world . Look at that Khukuri thing next to his throne. What even is that lol 😂? Even that pose was created for the purpose of propaganda.

It doesn’t feel like tourism anymore it feels careless.On top of that, the local leadership has also disappointed me.

And it is his stance of not forming any coalition that we have such a strong competition now. But I’m not gonna lie, nothing is fundamentally going to change whoever comes to power. There doesn’t seem to be any proposal for institutional change in Nepal. RSP is basically running on “Out with the old and In with the new” but not new policies (case in point Balen’s Socialist tilt, his post about that cement factory etc).  It seems they just mean out with old people and in with the younger people. Gagan talks about institutional change, how he is going to be the Tony Blair of Nepal and bring about the “Third Way” and revise Nepal’s economy back to the 90’s era of liberalism.

The opposition has won every single election following revolutions - Jana Andolan I (Nepal Congress won the elections after the dissolution of Panchayat) - Jana Andolan II (CPN Maoist won the 2008 constituent assembly). RSP is the radical opposition as most of the influential figureheads of the revolution have now joined the party.  And you can clearly see the hype behind Balen and how RSP became a top 4 party in just 6 months of formation in the last election.   Oli might have won numerous elections in Jhapa-5, but I would put my money on Balen from a statistical perspective. Most importantly, he won with a 55.7% share in the 2022 elections.

            "body": "I and two of my friends (they both abroad now) had once planned to open a Chhyang Factory in Nepal.   Before anything, I did thorough research, budget allocation, finding international markets, our cultural ties to the drink, even learnt to craft it with help of my Newar Friend circle and their families. For the extension of the project I went to Ilam in search of world class millet and spices. Got few leads, came back bought equipments and started making it. Everything was precise, the ferns and ferments, batch tested almost died drinking the first batch, created and recreated again to make a perfect batch. I had documented every single activity.   Now just to be sure, I first went to IRO, the main office of revenue, Lazimpat to check if the laws of Nepal permits Chhyang; and the officials were quite helpful about it, they turned the pages, pointed out Chhyang as rice beer and mentioned it was taxed 10/- NPR per liter as per the laws of Nepal.   Quite hopeful, we set up a meeting with the director of DOI for the next day, stayed all night to give final touch to our documentations, confident that we will be able to establish one.   Next day, both technical and general directors were in the room during our appointment. We presented our plan, applications and the available resources we had for the establishment.   “Bhanne bittikai tesari paincha?” The first words from the reputed officials. It might not be simple but we had our budget, the land lease requirements, technical scheme, and everything intact.   Our point was, “Nepal ko identity drink Korea bata import huncha, with hefty taxes, but if we do it here instead, we would be able to minimize import, provide employment opportunities and possibly export it too!”  I know Korea has it there as their drink as Makgeolli, but merely importing it instead of making chhyang here makes no sense.   After long discussion, the directors came to the conclusion that we submit our proposal with all the schemes, technicalities and budget and then have a meeting with the industry board lead by then minster for Industry, Mahesh Basnet.  We shook our heads, submitted our file, told that we will be called someday for this matter, could be tomorrow or 10 years from now.   We almost gave up at that point. Now both my friends are abroad, promising to return back if they call, but no one calls.   I don’t expect them to call, but sometimes I go to various chatpate stalls just to check if I find the pages of our documentation wrapping those 20/- or 50/- ko chatpate.   TL;DR  1. Nepal imports korean makgeolli as Chhyang, full of preservatives to keep it alive for a ling time.   2. Thoroughly researched-made documentations, technical schemes, budget allocations for establishing Chhyang as a well-lived Nepali Drink.  3. Visited IRO, the main revenue office and got a green flag from them for the establishment.   4. DOI doesn’t give a f\\*ck, instead implied that this is not possible as their books doesn’t recognize Chhyang, so asked us to submit the proposal documents and their classic “pachi aaunu”.  5. Friends gave up moved abroad. I still check if I can find the pages of the proposal wrapped in Chatpates or Badams.",

            "body": "I’ve been wanting to talk about something that’s been quietly frustrating me for a long time, and recent changes just pushed it over the edge.  I live abroad (Canada), and like many Nepalese here, I often get invited by friends to travel to the US for short trips, road trips, concerts, just normal things. Most of my friends have stronger passports, so for them it’s effortless. For me, it’s a completely different story.  Because I hold a Nepali passport, I have to apply for a US visa, wait years just for an interview, and now on top of that, new policies mean things like extremely short visa validity, single entry, and even deposit $15,000 financial bond. After waiting almost two years, it feels like the goalpost just keeps moving.      What makes it especially frustrating is knowing that many of these restrictions exist because of people who entered illegally, overstayed, or misrepresented their situation without considering the long-term consequences. Years later, those consequences don’t fall on them but on people who follow the rules, wait patiently, build legitimate lives abroad, and still get treated with suspicion simply because they share the same passport.  What hurts more than the logistics is the **emotional side** of it:  * The embarrassment of always having to say “I can’t, visa issues” * Feeling left out when friends travel freely * Carrying restrictions that are not because of *my* actions, but because of what *others* before me may have done  It’s frustrating that individual responsibility doesn’t seem to matter. You can be law-abiding, educated, settled, contributing to another country’s economy and still be treated as “high risk” purely because of where you were born.

The company is still early-stage, and a lot of the system and technical decisions currently depend on me.  Recently, I received a full-time remote offer from a foreign company offering more than **double my current salary** (paid in USD).  Current situation:  * Current net salary: \\~NPR 90,000/month ( Gross 115000) * New offer: \\~$1800/month (2lakhs46thousands) * No equity in current company * Contract notice period: 2 months * New role: same level (Tech Lead), full-time remote  I feel conflicted because:  * It’s only been 4 months since I joined * The startup relies heavily on me * But the financial jump is significant * The new job starts in about 40 days, I cant complete my full notice period here.  I didn’t actively plan to leave; this opportunity came unexpectedly.  For people working in tech in Nepal:  * Is leaving after 4 months a bad move? * Would you prioritize the salary jump and international exposure? * How would you handle this situation professionally?  Looking for honest opinions and personal experiences. Thanks!",

OR      2) If no equity, just leave ASAP!!! you don't have to feel bad for your boss / seniors / company / friends who don't value your labour and contribution (assuming you are the tech lead taking big decisions that make or break the company's future)     DM me if you or the company or both want to negotiate an equity vesting plan that justifies the contribution for both parties.

It looks a bit like academic practice. Swap 2 of them for something else (like Finance or E-commerce) to show you can handle different types of data. Flex that MLOps project: Move the ICU Deterioration one to the top! It’s your best flex because it mentions monitoring and drift (Prometheus/Grafana). That’s exactly what remote MLOps recruiters are looking for. Make Demos \"One-Click\": Make sure those [Demo] links go to a live site (Streamlit/Hugging Face). For remote jobs, if they can't see it working in 5 seconds, they might skip it.

The ‘other skills’ and very beginner projects can go or be merged so the focus stays on the work you’re most proud of.

Like wtf is wrong with you guys?|||People usually miscalculate the complexity of human beings, even if those people are globe-renowned scientists or thinkers. We tend to reduce individuals into neat categories of \"good\" or \"bad,\" when in reality most human lives exist somewhere in a moral gray space.  The figures are indeed contributions to modern society, having shaped our understanding of the universe in the case of Stephen Hawking and the overwhelming propagation of personal computing that underpins everyday life, thanks to Bill Gates. Their contributions are objective in nature, measured, and historically significant.  The Epstein case has indeed cast a sinister shadow on the reputations and personal integrity of those associated with it. Any wrongdoing ought to be investigated, prosecuted, and judged on its merits. Accountability counts.  Yet, it is quite dangerous to erase or dismiss intellectual and scientific contributions on the basis of particular personal moral failures; by doing so, it is an effort to distort history. If we were to get rid of every successful idea that had come from flawed individuals, much of human progress would disappear along with those who themselves were flawed.  We can—and should—condemn bad behavior without discarding valuable, valid contributions to knowledge and society.  Scientists are more likely to value human progress, curiosity, and long-term thinking—but they are not immune to moral failure. Their work can be noble even when their personal lives are flawed. Judgment must be based on evidence, not archetypes.|||He did biggest contribution for science. Do you really believe that he did something with those minor girls? He can't even do anything.

For us however, this is our first horrible man made mass scale event.    for example my mother told these are the events she witnessed, heard about ( there was no internet and reporters were getting chhopped up so source is her words and the fear and disgust in her eyes when talking about it)   i, maobadi kidnapped her school science teacher and tied him to the ground and they started nailing him with large and small nails from the legs and hands, slowly and all over his whole body,   ii. they kidnapped a man form his house at night, made him collect firewood from the forest , they started a fire, like a campfire, beside the fire they asked the kidnapped man to dig up a hole, he did exactly what they said. and after all that in the morning they invited many people from the village including his family members, and they burried him alive with his head sticking out form the  ground so that he could hear and see what was happening and finally they covered his head with the burning coals .    these are just examples and your and my parents have seen/ heard about a lot of similar killings kidnapping , public beheading etc  From their point of view, The old parties have maintained peace, ended such horrible war so they have gained a lot of trust. The old parties have shown their strength, in ending rana rule to ending civil war to ending king's direct rule and our parents know what the political paties gave them the rights and freedom which they have now.    So They're willing to bet one more time that These parties can and will always uphold our sovereignty, freedom and country as a whole.  So it is our duty to make them trust the newer political parties,    it is our duty to make them understand that we will not let the sacrifices and changes made by the old political parties Go to ruin ( the rights and freedom given by the constitution).    It is our duty to make them understand that the the political parties which ended rana rule and the kings rule  are themselves becomming similar elites.    It is our duty to make them understand that the old parties are using similar dictatorial practices which our parent and grand parents fought and ended.  And this is not going to be fast and easy, this is a long process will take years and years.   If you cannot convince your family members think how difficult it  is going to make a stranger understand.  And one more question, why would they listen to you. You are so short sighted and narrow minded. you want people to do exactly what you want them to do just because you said it. You start name calling your family members when they questioned choice which you made for them. They gave their reasons why they're voting. And they are damn right on questioning balen. Why should they trust him, just because he and the media said it.  Isn't that we all be doing, questioning . and They are questioning, You failed to give them answers. Its all on you. Have you asked yourself why should i vote balen?? What answer did you get Try answering without using the words like \"purano party\" \"yemale\" etc. does your answer focus more on old parties or the plans and policies for the country. If it is the first choice you're the veda.  One more thing, it is very sad, but the number of people you've killed does not really seem to matter in national level politics. Prachanda has claimed responsibility for 5000 killings. He became PM multiple times. He has sent kids of 13 and 14 years to the front lines to be used as a cannon fodder.   In short, your parents have seen very brutal violence and They know how bad things will be if old parties get elected but They do not know anything about the newer one. ( might be better or might be wayyy bad.) so they're picking certainity instead of incertainity.     |||vote waste garxa euta generation   dukha paauxa arko generation|||Balen haryo bhane, it's not the end of the world.

My dad brought quite a few for me from KTM every few months, and I used to colour, solve crosswords etc. I event sent crossword solutions (never got published). This is where I knew about sudoku and still love sudoku to this day. I have read a lot of stories in this magazine and some of them  have been life changing for me. I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.  Few years later, through sheer luck (and a bit of reputation in my Nepali class), I got to be the guest editor of one edition of this magazine. Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र). I still absolutely vividly remember that letter, the paper, the handwriting, almost the content (almost 20 years later). The sender had found my information from the guest editor section. We had a few exchanges through postmail.  https://preview.redd.it/tfj91e7zb1dg1.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=129a8de5a073704752f011cebed54e0499c69c11|||Muna, Sunkesra, and kopila defined my childhood.

There are a few who do but there’s always an exception.   Now many, including myself, do support some level of checks and restrictions on immigration. Those who didn’t get in take that as being opportunistic or slamming the door after I got in. Far from it.   What I don’t support is people coming through illegal means. What I don’t support is people cheating and providing 100% false representation while applying. Then once they get in, they try to game the system and just be a leech sucking in the benefits without contributing. They are making it harder for the legitimate immigrants and that’s exactly what we hate.  Now I don’t support the current position of not granting any immigration visa indefinitely to Nepal. But you know why this happened? Because almost 40% of Nepalis, about 70-80k take welfare benefits from the US government. You don’t need it if you are a contributing member of the society (except for in some disability/age related case).   There are people coming to US to get free medical treatment. One performer got the treatment and left the Us without paying the medical bills- that person is now banned from coming. Another famous pair got the DV and justified their entry by saying they get free medical for their kid (their case may be legit, but I am just giving an example of what people have been doing).   The administration is going to the other extreme to curb this- but some of it is because the past administration didn’t do anything to prevent it from happening.|||I seriously doubt the accuracy of this sentiment. Nepalis who have settled in America invariably work to bring other family members here. The effort is long and hard, and many are still in process, meaning that spouses, siblings, and others are now cut off from coming over. My brother in-law was able to finally secure his wife's visa a few weeks ago, after working on it for 2 years.  a few weeks later and she wouldn't get to come, so no, Nepali uncles and aunties aren't supportive, and there is no indication that most nepalis voted for trump.  The other thing to consider is the message behind the visa suspensions.  The trump administration is basically saying that immigrants who have come here have not improved conditions, but rather they have made it worse by taking advantage of government programs that they are not entitled to. In other words immigrants are lazy, and thieves. Not a lot to take pride in about that.|||Let me know what you are smoking..seems like good stuff.|||Just like the viral trend chori manchey ko khutta tanney chori manchey naai huncha.

I was a little nervous since it was only a few weeks after the Gen Z protest, but everything seemed pretty calm. I thought to myself, wow it'd sure be cool if we could overthrow our government, get rid of trump and be back to normal in a few weeks.   The Nepali living in the us would not feel happy or safe if they lived in my city I guarantee it.

It is completely white supremacist Nazi shit. It's horrible and I'm ashamed to be an American. These are my friends and neighbors, I don't ask people what their immigration status is, I could care less.   It's usually portrayed that undocumented immigrants are a drain on government services, but that is a lie. They pay taxes since it's automatically deducted from the paycheck to a social security number that doesn't belong to them. If they try to use the services they're caught and deported  We're fighting back but our leaders are ineffective, the police are working with ICE and if we call in the military we're unsure of whose side they'll take.

There’s no need to portray this as some kind of good vs evil thing. Those guys are looking out for their own interests just like you are. No country is required to keep its borders open to outsiders. Nepali people don’t want any immigrants in Nepal and are super racist, but when they face similar treatment abroad, they’re first to complain. They’ve already gotten their citizenship, why should they care about you or any other future immigrant?|||2 types of people 1.

Why would anyone be happy about the current situation ? All of you who agree with the statement are in Nepal who couldn’t make it to the US.|||May I dare present a different perspective?   Not everyone who votes Republican is \"hiding the ladder since they've made it\". That claim is lazy, false, and ignores basic economic reality.  Some of us vote based on numbers, not slogans. When you are paying over $100,000 a year in taxes (household)—income tax, state tax, property tax, sales tax—and you don’t see proportional benefits in return, fiscal policy starts to matter a lot. At that level, voting conservative isn’t ideological—it’s rational. Lower taxes, limited government, and accountability in spending simply align better with that reality.  Paying six figures into the system and being told you’re “privileged,” “selfish,” or morally inferior for questioning where that money goes is not persuasive—it’s alienating. Wanting to keep more of what you earn does not make you hateful. It makes you financially literate.  Many Republican voters reject racism and extremism outright. What they do reject is runaway taxation, bloated government, and being constantly generalized or morally lectured by people whose policies they fundamentally can’t relate to. The same way not all Democrats are extremists, not all Republicans are villains.  And yes—we are also tired of being lumped together with fringe elements just because we don’t align with extreme progressive ideology. Disagreeing with activist politics, identity absolutism, or ideological purity tests does not make someone anti-human. It means they prioritize practicality over performative outrage.  People vote based on lived experience. For households paying $100k+ in taxes every year, conservative policies often make more sense. That’s not hate. That’s math.",

            "body": "I’m a normal student from a well-known plus two college in Nepal. By some crazy luck, my friend and I got invited to a party full of kids from Ullens, Lincoln, and British Premier. We felt completely invisible. No one knew about us, no one acknowledged us, and it hit me how out of place we were. The whole venue was booked, underage drinking, cigarettes in everyone’s hands, champagne popping like it was nothing, and everyone acting completely normal.  We went to the bathroom to catch our breath and overheard a group of girls chatting. One said, “Oh my God, I love your flats.” Another replied, “They are from Chanel. You should get one too, they’re totally worth it.” Another girl showed her bag, “It’s a vintage Gucci. My grandma bought it in London back in the day. I’m so lucky she still kept it.” Everything felt casual for them but mind-blowing to me.  Luckily, we met the girl who invited us and she introduced us to her friends from Ullens. The first thing she asked was which college I went to. When I told her, she had never even heard of it. We started talking about colleges and I found out these IB kids spend almost thirty lakhs for just two years. If they go on the international school trips to Europe, it can exceed thirty lakhs which it probably does. Examination fees alone can be two to three lakhs and from the info she was giving I found their classes are tiny with highly qualified teachers from prestigious universities and foreign teachers like French teacher to teach French and same for Spanish. Everything is designed to give them the best advantage.  We talked about the future and she casually said that if her studies didn’t work out, her father would just hand her the family business. Everything is planned for them. No matter how wild their lives look with weed, parties, and hookups, their future is cushioned. They were talking about Harvard and Oxford like it was normal. I saw kids driving their own cars, Jaguars, convertibles, Hiluxes, Land Rovers, Mercedes, BMWs. Everyone has everything at sixteen or seventeen.  Honestly, I don’t even hate them because they were genuinely nice. This is just normal for them the same way our life is normal for us. I really hope that one day I can be as successful as their parents so I can afford to do the same for my kids.",

Of course, their lifestyle is bound to be different than us commoners.|||Never knew these thing existed|||Something similar happened to me years ago when I was in Plus 2 at a well-known college. I met a British School student through Instagram, and we became friends. She invited me to her house in Mandikatar. Her father was in the UK, her mother was in the US, and she mentioned they were only in Nepal 2-3 months a year. The house was looked after by two maids and a paley dai.   At first, I only knew that British was \"fancy\" and for wealthy families. I didn't really grasp how different her world was until I experienced it firsthand. Once, we went to watch a movie, she casually pulled out a bundle of 1 lakh in thousand-rupee notes from her tiny Gucci bag, which had even more cash inside. She was only 17.  I am a guy and we were just friends. She was genuinely kind—treating me to countless meals, movies, and outings. She was always loaded. She hooked me up with one of her seniors. After that, I became friends with a bunch of other British kids. I stayed at one girl's fancy ass hugeeeeeeeeeeee bungalow in Boudha for about a week. They were all genuinely nice people. |||Lol, I went to Lincoln, and one thing most kids don’t do is brag like that. Most do go to good colleges, but Harvard and Oxford? That’s like 1 out of 100, even for Lincoln and the British School. Also, not everyone has Land Rovers—the one I saw was related to the Royals in Nepal (through gyanendra or the late princess), and it was orange and pre 2008 model. Some of the kids even take public transportation.  Yes, they are rich, but the way you’re putting it has a lot of masala. I think you should just stick to facts and truths instead of adding so much exaggeration. Bottles of champagne? Lol, even the richest kid in Lincoln wouldn’t do that. Most of their parents work in embassies, so they know where to flaunt and where not to, knowing full well they live in a developing country that just had a Gen Z revolution partially based on nepotism.  I will say, you have lots of FACTS and also lots of LIES to make your story interesting. Expensive fees? 1000% TRUE. More than 5% going to Harvard and Cambridge? FALSE. Hookups at parties—2 out of 20—but the way you put it, it’s like everyone is making out with the opposite sex. LOL, if the reader doesn’t believe me, go to Lincoln School in Rabi Bawan and check in the morning how many Jaguars, Hiluxes, Land Rovers, Mercedes, and BMWs are there. Expensive school, expensive transportation bus costs—but the rest of what the person mentioned is just to incite hate, like movies where the poor are good and the rich are evil—black-and-white nonsense.  And the last touch—saying “I don’t hate them, they are genuinely nice.” Lol, you dish out some TRUTH AND FACTS TINKERED WITH LIES and then say they are nice—just like what happened with the Hilton Hotel (Sher Bahadur Deuba) and the British College scam stories. They spread pitiful, sad stories to indirectly incite hate.

While it’s true that they live in an entirely different bubble, they’re still living in a third-world country under parents who aren’t all that different from ours, except when it comes to spoiling them. Even then, independence is encouraged. They’re taken care of until they graduate and after that, they work hard (obviously not as hard as your average jyami worker) to maintain the comfortable life they’re accustomed to.  Surprisingly, many of them look down on flashy designer stuff, as it reeks of “nouveau riche.” I’ve met more middle-class people who are flashy about wearing designer brands than upper-class people who went to nice schools like these.  Maybe I’m biased here, since I currently have two such people helping me financially every month (I’m disabled due to my illness and can’t afford my expenses), but they’re incredibly kind too. Not just money-wise, they’re genuinely pleasant to be around. They’re very welcoming and accommodating. I’ve felt more at home with them than I ever have around people from my own social class. Then again, the people I’m talking about are over 25, so that probably contributes to the difference.|||Thats TU (accepting all of us regardless of my financial condition, family background, status) vs KU/PU-Affiliated Colleges.   Do understand this angle as well|||Nepalese are rich only the country is poor.|||Fake|||I think i know which party you talking abt|||Which college are you from?|||The top private schools in ktm charge 3-4 lakhs MONTHLY.

And don’t mistake me - those schools are insanely expensive but there are so many top 50ish good schools that provide scholarships, etc for deserving students. And its not like peple aren’t going to those. But they just aren’t getting the preparation help and grooming as the great elite schools.   Its not about the money its about access to information. To at least know there are those options out there. I meet many elite school kids who go to great schools abroad and I am happy for them. But not seeing kids from normal schools as often shows the stark disparity in information access. Elite schools - elite teachers, elite information. And of course even from there only a handful go to great global schools etc.   But I just also wish government schools and other private schools at least provided information to students to be able to dream.

Truly sad.|||[removed]|||True we have a huge tourism potential and we could be a destination for adventure sports. Besides trekking (but it's amazing what Nepal offers) we can offer lots of stuff like you mentioned but what we lack is infrastructure. How do you get to the trail head to start your mountain biking? Yes we have roads but how reliable are them. We have seen the safety records. If a rider gets into an accident how fast can medics reach him or her. How are they transferred to the nearest hospital safely.  We could be a destination for high altitude training camps like in Kenya or Colorado or Arizona but again what can we offer besides altitude. We have trails but do we have tracks for the work out ? Do we have a combination of flat and hilly lands around that altitude because Nepal's altitude rises rapidly in a very short distance. I know about a high altitude training program in Jumla. Hope that is a success. Training camp would need a good infra as well like basic PT, Gym, Recovery stuff etc.  We have the potential but we need to harness it. Harness in a sustainable way because if we are to increase the number of tourist sustainability is important, safety records are important because the majority of tourists consider everything, risk vs reward. I hope you succeed in your future endeavors but I suggest you to travel abroad to check the Tourism Sector before you venture on yours. Nearest is Thailand , you could see how they have harnessed their tourism potential. Their service industry compared to any other country in the region is miles ahead. Infrastructure, hospitality, transport etc they have it covered.   It's just my observations as I have traveled across Asia, Americas, Europe  when I can and I always think what Nepal could be.|||Do the cluster analysis of whatever feasible in nepal.

But the infrastructure just isn’t there yet. Close neighbor who has done it well is Thailand - their tourism industry and volume are another level. Their roads, airports, hospitality, foods, entertainment, tourist police to ensure safety, etc. make it easy to attract tourists.|||Isn’t the lack of infrastructure in Nepal part of what makes it appealing? Difficulty getting to a destination creates meaning. When everything becomes easy, it turns into disposable content for a feed. You don’t get profound experiences, you get optimized tourism. Yes, infrastructure improves lives, and that matters. But if development is driven mainly by attention and clicks, we’re not building a future. We’re building a theme park.",

Were those AI-generated, as your party president and many party leaders were claiming?  - You have raised the Sahakari Kanda involving Rabi Lamichhane, but when will you raise the same question about your own party member, Maya Rai, who was also a member of the same sahakari in Kathmandu (I’ve forgotten the name)? What about the Dhanraj Gurung sahakari case?  - You were part of the Government Efficiency team when the recent UML–Congress coalition government was formed. Will you question or take responsibility for the recent GenZ killings? Your party member Ramesh Lekhak was also the Home Minister at that time—have you questioned him about this?  - You have been a Member of Parliament four times, and during your tenure, the Congress has formed the government multiple times. Can you point to any concrete, policy-level achievements you delivered during your party’s time in government?  - What about Aftab Alam case during your party's government was he rightfully being prosecuted or your party's government have him impunity from jail, what about that case?",

And somehow Congress will be saved.|||The real answer is Bises Mahadibesan. That itself was a bidroha against the entrenched cult politics that the Deuba gang has practiced throughout its history. Deuba, as an individual, may once have been a true leader—but over time, the gang culture around him is what turned everything rotten and made him look bhrasta.  From this point onward, Gagan is free.  Free from:  All blame linked to Arzu  All accusations about money in Deuba’s house  All baggage related to Bhutani saranarthi  All the kandas, Teramox, and backroom deals  All blame connected to Lekhaks and their networks  These were never Gagan’s sins to carry.  So why should he keep answering for other people’s cults? Why should a reformist voice be held hostage by the corruption, compromises, and power games of an old guard that refuses to let go?  If anyone needs to answer, it’s the system that protected those networks for decades—not the one who finally challenged them.  Gagan doesn’t need to answer anymore. The Mahadibesan already did.|||He can give you wai wai, not sure about answers.

Don't get me wrong there are shortcomings from him and nobody is perfect but most of the questions you raised here are poor attempt to make him look bad.  You have to realize that even though Gagan is a prominient member of Nepali Congress, he was never the executive. Every decision the party makes as a whole, the chairman (Deuba) has the supreme authority and he is little to no say in any of the decisions.  Even then, he has clearly spoken against all wrongdoings. And you say \"just speak\". But that's the problem of not being in executive power, he can only speak.  You trying to  make the money burnt in Deuba's house somehow a crime by Gagan Thapa clearly tells me that you are just trying to hate. Otherwise as everyone else has said, there is a special probe commission formed to specifically study the burnt money case and all we can do is wait for their report and the government will file the case if there is wrongdoing (which we all believe there is). And Gagan has clearly affirmed this, as any sane person would. You should read him and listen his many public interviews/videos and not just assume he didn't say anything.  He has clearly said multiple times that any and all involved in sahakari kanda should be investigated including naming people from his own party by name, again multiple times in multiple of his public appearences and writings, you should read/watch/listen those. The government should file cases. I don't understand how this would be his fault.  If you again watch his comments in good faith and listen to his parliament speeches, he as said multiple times that  the public is angry, they need delivery. He said he opposed the coalition and publicly opposed it multiple times. But he is not the executive, deuba is. When there is coaliation, he has the moral responsibility to make the government successful. He was indeed in the efficiency team and he said he tried is best to make the government successful because he knew people needed delivery even though he opposed the coalition. He publicly told long before the Gen-Z protest that he couldn't get the government to do what the efficiency team was supposed to do, and he left it. So I don't think that makes him culpable for the massacre during gen-z protest.  But still he has taken moral responsibility for what happened during the protest. He has apologized multiple times for any moral culpability he has. He said he immediately asked the party leadership to break coaliation in the first day of protest and asked Lekhak to resign. Lekhak did resign but the party didn't leave coalition because again Deuba is executive and makes the decision.  He has been parliament member four times. The first time and he failed to deliver the constitution as promised which he was elected for. The second tenure was again the CA election, which delivered the constitution and you can't deny he played crucial role in making the constitution, and he (among all others) delivered the constitution. The next term he went to the parliament again and became health minister and people say he delivered some reforms in health sector (again refer to public catalogues of his works during this tenure). And you have to grant that he has been constant voice in the parliament on various issues, which the MP is sent for. This last time was a short tenure, but as everyone he has played crucial role in voicing concerns in the parliament. Ironically he strongly demanded there be independent probe in sahakari case and there have been multiple arrests and cases filed against some major fraudsters. You should grant that this was successfull. But we can always demand more. I am not his prabakta but to me seems like he could have definitely done more here and I am sure he agrees.  Yeah what about the case? Alam was a proven convict. But congress did dirty by lobbying to release him. I haven't seen him support Alam's release. Again, I am not sure the details of his release but how is Gagan culpable for the crime Alam committed?  Again I am not his prabakta. I try to speak with reason. You could certainly question that he didn't do enough at policy level as MP to propose new laws and pass them. You could ask him that he could not do enough to break Deuba stronghold. But he precisely did that recently.  Now I am watching him closely, he is now in the position to deliver at least from his party level. Make him accountable ask him tough questions. But the aforementioned questions seemed more like an attempt to make him bad (except may be how many policy changed did he make in 1 1/2 tenure as MP except CA MP which they delivered constitution).

At home, my bags were 23 + 22 kg, and my carry-on was 20 kg.  At the check-in counter, the agent told me to move some items from my carry-on into one checked bag so I’d only have to pay excess for one bag. I did exactly that and reduced my carry-on to 12 kg.  Magically, after this:  •\tChecked bags became 32 kg and 25 kg    •\tCarry-on became 13 kg  Somehow, between weighing the bags at home, weighing them again at the counter, and then re-weighing them a third time, my bags gained weight out of nowhere.  I was exhausted and didn’t have the energy to argue, so they charged me for two excess bags — $80 each. No leeway, no consideration.  To make things worse, the agent openly suggested that if I paid cash and didn’t need a receipt, they could lower the price. At that point it was obvious they were trying to pocket the money. Absolutely shameless.  I paid by card, waited until they gave me a proper Turkish Airlines receipt, and made sure everything was legit.  If you’re flying Turkish Airlines out of Tribhuvan International Airport, I strongly suggest avoiding the chubby girl working at the Turkish Airlines check-in counter. She was incompetent from the start — struggling to even open the computer system and issue a boarding pass, while agents at nearby counters were processing passengers with ease.  Extremely bad service and blatant attempts at corruption. This kind of experience is one of the many reasons I seriously hesitate to visit Nepal anymore.",

Happened to me in airport outside nepal as well.  The main difference is that airport scales are \"trade-legal\" industrial devices required by law to be regularly calibrated for high precision, whereas home scales are consumer-grade gadgets that use cheaper sensors and are almost never recalibrated. Additionally, the environment distorts the numbers; weighing a bag on a soft home carpet or trying to balance a large suitcase on a small bathroom scale often creates a \"lighter\" reading than reality, unlike the airport's large, stable platforms embedded in hard concrete. Because of this, the airport scale is generally accurate, while your home scale is just an estimate that tends to drift.|||[removed]|||Are we allowed to video record our interactions there?

            "comments": "Much of what we call national Nepal today was shaped by the effort of King Mahendra. Before his time, even school textbooks were in Hindi, children literally had to read “हमारा देशका नाम नेपाल है”. That alone shows how fragile our national identity once was.  Ask yourself, why can’t we clearly distinguish Amar Singh Thapa from Bhimsen Thapa? Because most of the portraits we rely on were painted by the same court artists during King Mahendra’s era. The same question applies to Divya Upadesh, where was it for all those years? Why did it suddenly surface and gain prominence later?  Maybe some things were rediscovered, maybe some were reconstructed, we may never know for sure. But what is certain is this, King Mahendra played a decisive role in nationalising Nepal’s identity, language, history, and sense of self. Fabricated or rediscovered, those efforts unified a fragmented country. And that, undeniably, was a great deed.|||Because this painting was made during the reign of King Mahendra to show brave king Prithvi Narayan Shah as there was no proper art of King Prithvi Narayan.|||Well that's art not history.|||Glad you are exploring this topic. Feels like you are also curious about history and socio-political anthropology.  Mahendra was driven by political consolidation and a single national narrative. His reign coincided with serious regional instability. To the north, Mao’s Cultural Revolution was unfolding in China. To the down   East Pakistan was breaking away to form Bangladesh. In that context, there was a real fear that Nepal’s sovereignty and internal cohesion could be threatened.  As a result, many reforms and symbols were manufactured or standardized during his tenure to construct a unified national identity. This included the bringing of civil service  (bureaucracy, police, army), the national anthem, the national dress (daura suruwal and dakha topi), the national curriculum (mahendra mala), and the formalization of historical narratives and political doctrine.  Much of what is presented as *Divya Upadesh* guidence book from Prithvi Narayan Shah was entirely manufactured and institutionalized during Mahendra’s rule. From the iconic image of Prithvi Narayan Shah, including his gestures of index finger pointing upward direction (we are one unity symbolism), facial features, dress, and artistic representations, to the moral and political messages attributed to him, these were part of a deliberate political project rather than an untouched historical inheritance.  It is also important to remember that during Prithvi Narayan Shah’s time, there was no modern India or China as nation-states. Phrases like “dui dhunga ko tarul” were reframed as geopolitical doctrine. The *Divya Upadesh* attributed to him was manufactured, published, and promoted during Mahendra’s tenure, much like the Mahendra mala national curriculum that emphasizes narratives such as the Nepal–Anglo war was fought bravely and Nepal being “second richest in water resources.” These were not neutral historical facts but components of a deliberate nation-building strategy.|||It’s kind of a propaganda painting. It’s not that uncommon in the world . Look at that Khukuri thing next to his throne. What even is that lol 😂? Even that pose was created for the purpose of propaganda. That one finger pointing upwards saying we are one ☝️. We don’t even know what he actually looked like. No description even exists. It was all created during Mahendra’s reign. Most people before probably didn’t even know who he was except for the people of Kirtipur who have had a grudge against him for a long time.|||The painting was commissioned by Kind Mahendra and was done by Amar Chitrakar in the 60s. I find this essay quite informative on the modern retelling of the Shah dynasty’s history.   https://www.tasveergharindia.net/essay/nepal-visual-prithvinarayan.html|||This makes sense because it is not a photo but a painting.|||yeslai art bhanxa|||The hand gesture showing unity is also made during mahendra period.

There was a discussion on Twitter some time ago and some one posted a Mithila style portait if PNS and said thats the only known portrait of him from his time.|||\"who rules the present, rules the past.\"|||Doesnt Prithvi Narayan Shah looks like Mahendra even though they are 7 generations apart.

You are going through trauma bonding with him . Best solution is reporting to police as a civil citizen or initiate divorce on DV (domestic violence) but make sure you are backed up financially. Remember as a 3rd person we are suggesting you only based on what you have posted. And this is a clear case of Domestic violence which has been allowed by your emotional attachment with him.|||This is projection.  He's projecting his own cheating behaviour onto you. You said he goes for night outs as well, it's pretty obvious he cheats and when you are late, he automatically assumes you did the same.  Hire a private detective and make your case strong and confront him with evidence.  But if you're actually cheating, that's a completely different scenario.|||It seems like there is more to this story, we heard your side only.

As you have mentioned that even you use to hit him back , you need to understand that if the thing he did was domestic violence than you hitting him back too is a violence, self defence is protecting oneself.  And you have also said ma pani farkauthe ani maan santa parera basthe, if you make him deport or complain about it , it would be hypocrisy.  Either separate with him just never look his face back again or go to a couple therapist.  He have anger issues and he is patriarchal you both guys need therapy and a proper communication.   Seeing people with fake feminism and trusting one side of the coin made me realise what would be your husband's perspective on the topic .  I just you to look for a good therapist because you guys have been together for a long time as you have mentioned that it had been 1.5 years that he had not raised his hands on you    What he did was wrong but don't be hypocrite be  mature and deal with everything maturely|||Domestic violence (yes just one incident counts too) and cheating should be absolute non-negotiable and grounds for divorce.

The next steps depend on what you want the outcome to be.   1. If you want mediation and your relationship to continue, have a serious discussion with your husband and let him know what the stakes are, either to work on the relationship together, or to end it. Couples therapy is also helpful for many. There's no point fighting forever. Has anyone else witness the violence, do you have kids? Does your husband drink? Does he have his own social life? Does he have any mental health issues? Many things factor. But a discussion with your husband should be your first thing to do and let him know boundaries and also reflect on yourself too.   2. If you want to end it, depends on where you are. Think through everything and then only decide. If you have kids or not. You need to contact a lawyer as well. What is your financial situation. Do you have any social support nearby as things can get stressful and messy.|||You work so it seems you're independent. Report him to the police. After that live your life as you wish.|||Poila gaideu|||Divorce, police report.|||My suggestion is to leave his ass and file for divorce as well as file a police case for domestic abuse. This is 21st century to be that barbaric; it is normal to be jealous or to have fights as couple but it is never okay to raise hand against each other; and not many functional partners raise hand.   Having someone my close family member go through similar situation before, never believe that abusers will change, kukurko puchhar 12 barsa dhungro ma rakhne ukhan estai manxe lai banaeko ho. Assuming you are in 20s/30s, do you want to spend next 40 or so years of your life with such abuse?    Many people will try to convince you to stay and tell you that he will change but ask to yourself do you truly believe that?  Also you mentioned that “maile pani farkauthe”, if he hits you don’t hit back but report it to police (unless it is life threatening) and also talk to your parents/relatives/friends about it don’t bottle up till too late.  I know sometimes it is difficult to let go because of many reasons (eg. visa issues or money issues) but what if in the heat of the moment he hits you and you get a lifetime disability or even die; so for your own safety, i suggest to dump his ass.|||Leave before its too late|||Hi OP, garo huncha thulo decision lina divorce jastai.

Men are not like this..... Your partner is mentally sick, and you cannot fix him..... Please save yourself.... If he had good soul he'll understand with time, but for now please leave him...... Please find ways to get out from there..... Even if your parents don't support trust me and many others, this is not normal..... For the love of yourself, you should leave asap.|||I just realized you said tmle pani haat haltheu, hmmm.... If you both truly want to work it out.... Now I'm thinking about it after reading your comments that you really love him....   In that case, talk to him what is bothering him, if he has had lot of childhood trauma, stress, unprocessed emotions, it really does affect a person, they become like time bomb and a small trigger can make them very angry ..... Now note that I'm saying this in hopes that you both truly want to work it out..... Talk to him, let him know anger at this level is not normal and he can gently start a talk therapy or men's circles, or somatic healing sessions, emdr therapy (if it's a part trauma), etc. there are so many options in today's time to start a healing journey. I'm in full support for people to move this route, even if you are violent in the past. It's not easy being human and I get it. Please consider, I hope this helps. But please remember, if you are going to lead this journey for both of you, remember to be patient, kind, and loving. Sometimes you will have to let the other person be so angry and be able to watch them (it's a specific emotional release session) without you absorbing their emotions. For him, and for you too probably, when emotions come, you both have to remember it's NEVER about the other person. If you would like each other to do something, you can request but nobody is obliged to follow, just having this much boundary will help you both to process your emotions on your own. Start therapy or just start writing on your own, you will notice you stress or anger is often coming from something else within yourself, not from people around you.   I hope this help a little bit. Take care, pass love to each other. If it's easier, bring serious talk when you are getting romantic, I think that helps you both absorb and understand better. Take care please. It's not impossible to change yourself and your relationships in this time, especially with so much options, start meditation, therapy, dance, especially moving body helps move your emotions too. Take care.|||Just have a conversation with your husband. Ask him why is he is acting like that? IS he insecure about you or what? make everything clear. Why is he acting in that manner? Also, clearly state what you feel about his behaviour. You both will get a chance to understand each other. Make sure he is not going to do it again or what you think will be better. If it get repeated what action will be taken? Let him know. Its either reporting to police or having converstaion with both of your parents or divorce.|||Leave him ask for divorce report to police dont stay|||This is what an emotional vampire is. You've not given any details about his social life, but from your post it can be seen he isn't pleased with you having a social life and is sucking all the joy you've had with your social interactions.  Basically I think he is insecure with himself, but this shouldn't justify him hurting you. It is a whole new country, you might be more scared and feeling like you're in a dark place.

Honestly had Gagan not done his bisesh mahadivesh, the 3 parties already had plans to form a coalition and fight the election as one alliance. And it is his stance of not forming any coalition that we have such a strong competition now. But I’m not gonna lie, nothing is fundamentally going to change whoever comes to power. There doesn’t seem to be any proposal for institutional change in Nepal. RSP is basically running on “Out with the old and In with the new” but not new policies (case in point Balen’s Socialist tilt, his post about that cement factory etc).  It seems they just mean out with old people and in with the younger people. Gagan talks about institutional change, how he is going to be the Tony Blair of Nepal and bring about the “Third Way” and revise Nepal’s economy back to the 90’s era of liberalism. And that all sounds good but knowing Congress, a party that is so deeply entrenched in the status quo, I don’t buy it.

This election is the by-product of a major revolution which overthrew the government. The opposition has won every single election following revolutions - Jana Andolan I (Nepal Congress won the elections after the dissolution of Panchayat) - Jana Andolan II (CPN Maoist won the 2008 constituent assembly). RSP is the radical opposition as most of the influential figureheads of the revolution have now joined the party.  And you can clearly see the hype behind Balen and how RSP became a top 4 party in just 6 months of formation in the last election.   Oli might have won numerous elections in Jhapa-5, but I would put my money on Balen from a statistical perspective. Most importantly, he won with a 55.7% share in the 2022 elections.

            "body": "I and two of my friends (they both abroad now) had once planned to open a Chhyang Factory in Nepal.   Before anything, I did thorough research, budget allocation, finding international markets, our cultural ties to the drink, even learnt to craft it with help of my Newar Friend circle and their families. For the extension of the project I went to Ilam in search of world class millet and spices. Got few leads, came back bought equipments and started making it. Everything was precise, the ferns and ferments, batch tested almost died drinking the first batch, created and recreated again to make a perfect batch. I had documented every single activity.   Now just to be sure, I first went to IRO, the main office of revenue, Lazimpat to check if the laws of Nepal permits Chhyang; and the officials were quite helpful about it, they turned the pages, pointed out Chhyang as rice beer and mentioned it was taxed 10/- NPR per liter as per the laws of Nepal.   Quite hopeful, we set up a meeting with the director of DOI for the next day, stayed all night to give final touch to our documentations, confident that we will be able to establish one.   Next day, both technical and general directors were in the room during our appointment. We presented our plan, applications and the available resources we had for the establishment.   “Bhanne bittikai tesari paincha?” The first words from the reputed officials. It might not be simple but we had our budget, the land lease requirements, technical scheme, and everything intact.   Our point was, “Nepal ko identity drink Korea bata import huncha, with hefty taxes, but if we do it here instead, we would be able to minimize import, provide employment opportunities and possibly export it too!”  I know Korea has it there as their drink as Makgeolli, but merely importing it instead of making chhyang here makes no sense.   After long discussion, the directors came to the conclusion that we submit our proposal with all the schemes, technicalities and budget and then have a meeting with the industry board lead by then minster for Industry, Mahesh Basnet.  We shook our heads, submitted our file, told that we will be called someday for this matter, could be tomorrow or 10 years from now.   We almost gave up at that point. Now both my friends are abroad, promising to return back if they call, but no one calls.   I don’t expect them to call, but sometimes I go to various chatpate stalls just to check if I find the pages of our documentation wrapping those 20/- or 50/- ko chatpate.   TL;DR  1. Nepal imports korean makgeolli as Chhyang, full of preservatives to keep it alive for a ling time.   2. Thoroughly researched-made documentations, technical schemes, budget allocations for establishing Chhyang as a well-lived Nepali Drink.  3. Visited IRO, the main revenue office and got a green flag from them for the establishment.   4. DOI doesn’t give a f\\*ck, instead implied that this is not possible as their books doesn’t recognize Chhyang, so asked us to submit the proposal documents and their classic “pachi aaunu”.  5. Friends gave up moved abroad. I still check if I can find the pages of the proposal wrapped in Chatpates or Badams.",

No matter what work you have, you somehow have to come to Kathmandu for it. So yeah, I understand his situation.  The one thing I really criticize him for is his lack of communication. That is something I am very disappointed about. During his entire campaign, he kept saying that he wouldn’t be like previous mayors and that he would stay in constant communication with the public. But after winning, he almost completely stopped connecting with people. There is no proper accountability, just one-sided Facebook status updates.

            "body": "I’ve been wanting to talk about something that’s been quietly frustrating me for a long time, and recent changes just pushed it over the edge.  I live abroad (Canada), and like many Nepalese here, I often get invited by friends to travel to the US for short trips, road trips, concerts, just normal things. Most of my friends have stronger passports, so for them it’s effortless. For me, it’s a completely different story.  Because I hold a Nepali passport, I have to apply for a US visa, wait years just for an interview, and now on top of that, new policies mean things like extremely short visa validity, single entry, and even deposit $15,000 financial bond. After waiting almost two years, it feels like the goalpost just keeps moving.      What makes it especially frustrating is knowing that many of these restrictions exist because of people who entered illegally, overstayed, or misrepresented their situation without considering the long-term consequences. Years later, those consequences don’t fall on them but on people who follow the rules, wait patiently, build legitimate lives abroad, and still get treated with suspicion simply because they share the same passport.  What hurts more than the logistics is the **emotional side** of it:  * The embarrassment of always having to say “I can’t, visa issues” * Feeling left out when friends travel freely * Carrying restrictions that are not because of *my* actions, but because of what *others* before me may have done  It’s frustrating that individual responsibility doesn’t seem to matter. You can be law-abiding, educated, settled, contributing to another country’s economy and still be treated as “high risk” purely because of where you were born.  Do you think this will ever change, or is it something we just have to accept?  Would really like to hear others’ experiences and thoughts",

But my experience tells me having multiple clients is safe and secure for the long run. The more financially secure thing you can do is make a sensible investment inside Nepal.

Also if work load from abroad dries up, so does your dollar flow so better keep your spending habits checked and make a better investment now so that you are financially secure even without the jobs that will pay you in dollars.|||Should I improve english first or just applying for a remote job and then improving it while working?

(Should I personally ask them to deduct 5% TDS?)  I also receive USD payments from an EU-based company. In that case, tax is deducted twice: first by the platform itself (approximately 3.5%), and then another 5% TDS is deducted here. When the funds arrive, my bank automatically converts the USD to NPR based on the prevailing exchange rate and credits it to my account in Npr.  I opened a USD account (dollar card) using my PAN. The annual limit is USD 500, but as far as I understand, this limit is only for payments/spending. Is it possible to increase this limit or ask the bank to keep incoming USD directly in that USD account instead of converting it to NPR?  Another question is that, if i’am to receive payments from a subscription based service from a platform apps i made, i basically can’t from nepal, for that i either need the LLC or C-Corp registered in US banks that accepts remote workers no ?  Up to how much extent can nepal banks provide services to be able to pay and receive payments internationally ? Or which banks ? That can win over the limitation of dollar cards ?

Cant see both.|||if its real whatdo you do  ??? can you give some info or context|||I can see the angle of “look what you can get even from Nepal,” and yeah, that part can actually be motivating because a lot of people still assume they need to leave the country to reach certain compensation levels. But motivation usually comes from showing the path, not just the end result. A screenshot shows where you landed, not how you got there.  People here asked genuine questions about niche, stack, timeline, experience, etc because that’s the part that actually helps others move in that direction. That’s where the value would have been. Without that context, the post ends up reading more like a soft flex than mentorship. Nothing wrong with flexing, just don’t call it motivation if you’re not giving people anything they can learn from or replicate.  With 5+ years of experience you’ve seen enough of the field to know that the “how” matters more than the “what,” especially for people in Nepal who are trying to break into the global market. If the goal was to motivate, sharing the path would have done it way better than just the screenshot.|||Chyya kasto salty manche haru comments ma.

There aren’t many good options in my country to receive international payments, so I used Binance P2P to convert USDT to local currency and send it to my bank account. This money is my salary, not trading profits or third-party funds.  This morning my bank froze my account without warning. These were my hard-earned savings that I was slowly building to someday build a home, so this hit me really hard mentally.  Tomorrow I’m going to the bank in person, but I’m unsure:  What exactly should I say to them?  What should I not say?  What documents usually help in these cases?  Has anyone here gone through something similar and successfully unfrozen their account?  Is there a real risk of losing the money, or is this usually just a compliance review?  I’m not trying to avoid laws or do anything shady. I just didn’t have a better way to receive my income.  Any advice or shared experiences would really help right now. Thanks for reading.",

That’s what I suggest.   Decent apps can be build in a day if you know the requirements, understand system design and  logic needed. You need to understand things like how apps are build, deployed etc.  At least in US, Ai replacing engineerings is not exactly false.   With Automated workflows and Ai agents, team needing 100 members could only need couple members. That does mean Ai replaced 98 people among 100. That’s how I see.",

            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

If I have the time, I might join if I'm free. If they were inviting Harvard professors, it'd cost you 10x more to attend. Events take time and effort. Many costs. Let's switch the focus to you. Have you organized an event? Was it easy? Who did you invite as a speaker?   If you're a student, why care about an enterprise AI event? I fail to see your criticisms. Not everybody needs to start a business to prove their credibility. It literally takes <20k.  I don't expect them to cover hf peft best practices. It's an event for enterprises. I don't have expectations for food. If I meet somebody interesting, that's good enough for me.  I think you're being confused between training courses and networking events. Plenty of events if you want to learn. ANAIS, NAAMII charged 12k for students this year. Was fine. Good stuff. Made many friends.  I dislike AI non-profits that claim to do research and fail to have any publications or research projects, yet say they're open to collaborations. But the AI association isn't a research body, probably does just events. Executives don't open up VS code and grind all day. That's a very small minority. They're skilled, just not in a way that appeals to you. They bring in investors, organize events, lots of things. If you ask me, there's a lot more to a product than PRs and merges. If you're not already the Lead for some MNC, some humility helps. It's dumb to say a CEO doesn't have skills because they don't code like you do, don't you think?  I'm not affiliated with naamii or any non-profits.|||On one hand, I can see the low effort poster with multiple mistakes and the fluffy pointless nonsense that is the main paragraph probably written by ChatGPT with a 6 word prompt. There's no mention of the \"Experts\" that are supposed to lead the thing.  On the other hand, your post has offered no genuine criticism of the event. It is just as pointless as the poster. Maybe offer anecdotes? Some tangible verifiable reason to justify your \"nrs 350 for 2.5 hours is a massive waste\".  Organizing an event comes with some cost, and some of that must be passed to the visitor. NRS 350 is some money, it is definitely not a lot of money. It is most definitely not \"expensive\" for an event in any sense of the word.   Justify your claims. Why is this a \"scam\"? What other way can a person \"use nrs 350 to learn by yourself\" (your words)? Who are the speakers and why are they unqualified to speak on this program?  *disclaimer: not affilaited to this org or event*, *just a random angry redditor*",

I was working for one of the renowned company.. they made us use the cursor. They kept telling us to have 2x productivity. We also able to burn the tickets more that we used to do in non AI days.. cursor was able to grasp a project context and was able to finish our 5 sp task as of 1 sp task 😅😅.  we work in micro service architecture and we need to constantly give cursor the context about other services and there was also dependency with others team and well cursor cannot communicate with other team like a actual human do 😁 So the point is that if the system is complex cursor/AI won't be able to do all things on its own.   But recently I switched company. Here we are now building smaller smaller project and sending it to the mass to get subscriptions as fast as possible.. and guess what we are using lovable to build the system. Lovable + supabase + stripe = boom product.   So in this case the point is that if the system you are building is simpler and you have clean vision even people from marketing can now build the system. And believe me marketing head from my company had done that in 2 weeks.    I don't know what future holds.. but guys sakney belaa paisaa shorna sakey shorum hai 😅😅|||The thing to contemplate on is : \"The job was never to write code it was to think in that case it's only the typing long lines with a keyboard that has replaced been replaced\".

So then I realized what I have in hand that an inexperienced ones have - already useful skill, product knowledge and codebase knowledge. That is helping me in productivity. But the real growth and survival will happen if I gain the skills of a lead like a team lead, a manager, a product owner, or solution architect or any kind of lead is fine. And you won’t see many leads in a team. Leads are already out standing. So You have to figure out how you can be the lead.|||All|||AI will **replace a significant portion of developers**, and not in some distant future. This is already happening, and it will accelerate rapidly over the next 12–24 months as AI tools get mass-adopted inside companies.  That said, the outcome isn’t as simple as “developers are done.”  What’s actually happening is a restructuring of value.  As companies begin laying off junior and mid-level developers, they won’t eliminate development teams entirely. Instead, they’ll rely on fewer, highly reliable developers who can handle much more work with the help of AI. This creates a paradoxical situation: layoffs on one side, high demand on the other, but only for the right people.    If you come from a development background, the smartest move right now is simple:  * Become exceptional at using AI as a force multiplier. * Just knowing how to code won’t be enough anymore. That used to be the differentiator; now it’s table stakes.    **What matters now is:**  * Knowing how to think in systems * Translating vague requirements into clear specs * Using AI to generate, refactor, test, debug, and ship faster * Understanding architecture well enough to spot what AI gets wrong * Owning a specific niche deeply enough to solve high-value problems quickly    Companies won’t pay top dollar for someone who can “do everything moderately well.”  They will pay very well for someone who can fix a very specific, painful problem reliably.  And let’s be honest: saying “AI won’t replace humans” is already outdated. It has started replacing roles; not because AI is perfect, but because it’s good enough when paired with the right person.  If a non-technical person, like myself, someone who loves tech but never formally learned coding, can now build a full-fledged system using tools like ChatGPT and Replit, then the competitive bar has fundamentally shifted.  AI isn’t coming for jobs.   It’s coming for generic skill sets.    **So the choice is clear:**  * Either level up into a top-tier senior developer who designs systems, makes decisions, and leads execution * Or become a highly specialized mid-level developer with deep expertise in one niche and excellent AI leverage  Anything in between is the danger zone.  This isn’t a threat, it’s an opportunity.  But only for those who adapt early and intentionally.  Cheers!|||Lmao CRUD/landing page ta garihaalxa ni.

After +2, I applied to Canada and the USA for further studies, but my visa got rejected. Instead of wasting a year, I joined BBS , and now I’m in my 3rd year.  When the visa didn’t work out, I decided to take responsibility for my own future. I started learning about AI, automation, and new technologies. Over time, I picked up practical skills, experimented a lot, and eventually started freelancing. Right now, I work as an AI Developer on Upwork, and even in the early stage, I’m earning more than 1 lakh NPR per month.  I’m not an expert and I still have a lot to learn but I know my strengths. I’m good at managing things, people, sales, content, and marketing, and I can execute fast. I have learned most of this by consuming real-world information online and applying it through actual work.  I have big plans in the AI space, but I also know that building something great alone is very difficult. That’s why I am looking for a technical co-founder, someone strong on the engineering side so we can build, learn, and grow together.  The idea is to:  * Start very small and lean * No heavy investment * Focus on AI services / automation / agency-style work * Only basic costs like hosting or APIs * Aim to generate revenue within 2–3 months  I currently live with my parents in Butwal, but I want to move to Kathmandu, take a small flat, and fully focus on building. I also plan to start creating content alongside the business.  I’m looking for someone who:  * Is disciplined and focused * Serious about long-term growth * Not into unhealthy habits * Wants a simple lifestyle with deep work * Has strong technical skills or is deeply committed to developing them  Most importantly, I want a co-founder who understands that things won’t always work. There will be hard times, failures, and uncertainty. During those phases, we should push and motivate each other, stay consistent, and keep moving forward. Even if something fails, we should come out smarter, stronger, and more experienced than before.  We don’t need much money to start just enough for basic living expenses. I have savings that allow me to manage accommodation and food for a long time, and I strongly believe we can make this sustainable within a few months.  The goal is simple:   Live together. Build together. Learn together. Grow together.  If you’re technically strong, disciplined, and serious about building a real AI business from Nepal, let’s connect.",

This has now gotten out of hand, and this type of behavior will surely spread to other tourist areas, especially those closer to the border like Sauraha and others. I have seen these 'tourists' in Thars and other SUVs riding recklessly on our highways, mocking our rules and laws. In my local area in the Terai, there have been a couple of incidents where such SUVs have hit locals, including traffic police, and fled to India.  Let's continue to do what we can from our end - I have reported the videos and his channel, and let's keep reporting those videos wherever we find them, and from any other Indian 'YouTubers'. Influencers from Pokhara need to raise their voices collectively on other popular social media channels like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Local influencers need to unite and raise this issue from their platforms in their individual capacities. Otherwise, we might be just one incident away from breaking news.  I will share this thread with a popular Indian YouTube journalist-The Deshbhakt. I have been following him, and he has made videos on such stupidity by Indian tourists. I will leave his Instagram link here so that everyone with evidence can share information.

We talk about decentralization, Federal system, we claim to have provincial capitals, yet when it comes to real power, real identity, and real rights, we are still forced to knock on Kathmandu’s doors. Why should that be? Kathmandu should be a place we visit by choice to walk its Streets, to bow our heads at Pashupatinath, Swayambhnath... not a place we are compelled to go just to be heard.|||I have seen his public speeches, they have never sounded as good as he does here.

Minor improvements to streets and basic municipal actions are being celebrated as extraordinary achievements, while far more serious national issues are at stake.  Nepal is a country with a deep-rooted identity, culture, and values that have existed for centuries. Yet today, we seem to be losing our sense of judgment, influenced heavily by social media popularity rather than thoughtful evaluation. In the process, we are slowly drifting away from our ethics, integrity, and understanding of how we should act as citizens and how we should choose to be governed.  Governance should not be reduced to visibility and viral moments. Appreciation must be based on substance, responsibility, and long-term impact, not hype. Otherwise, we risk mistaking short-term popularity for genuine leadership|||Balen will win for sure |||सबका सब हामीलाई वेवकुफ बनाईरहेछ… बाले भाईले पनि बनायो।|||Isnt RSP against provincial system.|||But wtf is he saying ? 😭",

Padhe lekheko anpad haru. Stephen Hawking ko contribution kati xa physics ma bujya xau? Like wtf is wrong with you guys?|||People usually miscalculate the complexity of human beings, even if those people are globe-renowned scientists or thinkers. We tend to reduce individuals into neat categories of \"good\" or \"bad,\" when in reality most human lives exist somewhere in a moral gray space.  The figures are indeed contributions to modern society, having shaped our understanding of the universe in the case of Stephen Hawking and the overwhelming propagation of personal computing that underpins everyday life, thanks to Bill Gates. Their contributions are objective in nature, measured, and historically significant.  The Epstein case has indeed cast a sinister shadow on the reputations and personal integrity of those associated with it. Any wrongdoing ought to be investigated, prosecuted, and judged on its merits. Accountability counts.  Yet, it is quite dangerous to erase or dismiss intellectual and scientific contributions on the basis of particular personal moral failures; by doing so, it is an effort to distort history. If we were to get rid of every successful idea that had come from flawed individuals, much of human progress would disappear along with those who themselves were flawed.  We can—and should—condemn bad behavior without discarding valuable, valid contributions to knowledge and society.  Scientists are more likely to value human progress, curiosity, and long-term thinking—but they are not immune to moral failure. Their work can be noble even when their personal lives are flawed. Judgment must be based on evidence, not archetypes.|||He did biggest contribution for science. Do you really believe that he did something with those minor girls? He can't even do anything.

Communism is really stupid if you look back at humanity now.|||This should be categorised as fictional book|||some deep shit ! ... op is not asking for superficial answer|||Technically, yes, he wrote the manual. But, Marx was a man who saw a disease but prescribed a medicine that was more toxic than the sickness. He wanted to fix the world by changing who owns the \"stuff\" without changing the \"human being\" who uses the stuff.  ​When you try to enforce \"equality\" through a state, you don't get a paradise; you get a prison. This is why Marxism has failed wherever it was tried as a rigid political tool.  ​Why \"Harkabad\" is the Antidote TODAY:  ​The reason we look toward a philosophy like Harkabad (Prakriti, Samskriti, Pravidhi) instead of Marxism or Western Capitalism is because it addresses the foundation, not just the \"economics.\" Harka Smapang has time and again said it has nothing to do with his name. He is suggesting a solution that isn't a western copy but suitable to the soil we stand on.   ​Marxism says: \"Who owns the factory?\" ​Capitalism says: \"How much can the factory produce?\" ​Harkabad says: \"Do we even need the factory if it kills the river (Prakriti) and destroys the community's soul (Samskriti)?\"  If you ask me if we need \"Harkabad,\" I would say we need Consciousness.  ​Harka Sampang is essentially bringing consciousness to governance. When he goes out and carries stones with his own hands (Shramadaan), he is moving from the \"ugly\" socialism (taking from others) to the \"wonderful\" socialism (giving of oneself).  ​We don't need a \"Communist\" revolution where blood is spilled to change the law. We need a \"Harkabad\" style evolution where sweat is spilled to restore the land. ​You don't need a book from 19th-century Germany to tell you how to live. You just need to look at the earth beneath your feet and the people around you.",

The feeling of lying in the bed with inherent thoughts of disperse happiness and the want to be able to understand if that happiness is as true as it seems is not new and it's also not wholly mine   I look at all these motion picture hoping to find something. And what that might be is as ananomus to me as it is to you. I look at these things, listen as they talk, but the existence of this feeling of watching doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm lying on this virgin earth, unmolested and untouched, devoid of any feeling of any sort except for one; consciousness. The consciousness reigns supreme within and without all within the vicinity of my existence.  At this point, life as you call it feels not a moments passing by or time flowing like my thoughts.  My head feels particularly heavy, as if I'm thinking but a thought is yet to process. But how can this be? Without a thought, how can you think? How can one live, without knowing the value of death? But that's not right either. For one to know the value of death,.one must first know of its qualities, it's feature in all it's dimensions. The inherent idea of a thought being, and to think not sounds stupid as if not funny enough. But you can't overlook the idea behind such ponder.   I take very long breaths as I think. My heart beats loud enough for me to hear it. And all my bodily functions seems very much obvious to me. This isn't new but it's not wholly mine.   Ahh now my head hurts a little to. But this shall too pass.   Theres this lingering feeling of solitude that I feel very sensationally. For solitude has been my friend far longer then any. The silence that made me feel alone after some years felt not pleasing but good enough to make me feel a bit stingy if it got disturbed.  But now this solitude engulfs me, strangles me so that I choke these thoughts out of me which are yet to be. But it was this very solitude that made me form a thought but now it want it back. Like how death waits right Infront of you, lingers above you with it's hands around neck, and then takes you through the stairs of lifelessness while you climb oblivious. Similar is the solitude that I experience right now, but instead of lifelessness, I climb and climb but towards nothing, I climb and climb but climb on empty thoughts.   My agitated muscles ache in the silence of my breath while my breath gets shorter and heavier each micro instant.",

So yeah.  But girls bias that exists mostly coz of pedos I assume.

Ofc sapna bokechau hola voliparsi kehi garni and u gotta work hard. But dont push yourself too hard , enjoy your life a little . Your life wont end due to a damn exam there is much more to do in life. Aba parents haru ta karai rahanchan . What even can we do lol? Ani btw you are pretty damn good in maths . You will improve in other subjects too . Dont stress out|||I am in 12 now. 11 ko first term was best for me all 60 above (except that damn physics) chem ma ta 64 aathyo but i didn't think that much and tried to do good in physics.   2nd term ma physics ma 49 aayo but chemistry ma 45 that drop of 19 marks made my mental health go blind. I gave up on chemistry and physics, I didn't even want to study these two anymore tara after 3rd term 11 final 12 pre term, finally 12 ko 1st term ma physics and chem ma 52 and 53 aathyo respectively. I was satisfied enough. Ani 2nd term ma ahile physics dhostai xa, chem chain tight teacher parexa k huni ho thaxaina.   So to explain what happened here: 1. Course ko amount badhepaxi the marks drastically drop as you and I both faced.  2. The amount of stuff you have to remember is always more than you remember.  3. For mcq and reasoning questions you must read books cuz teachers don't cover everything.  At last, 11 doesn't matter that much as marks and grades, 11 class is just about the memories you build that 12 might not give you.  You look like a study kinda guy so you might have friends like that too, so i am telling you the reality here. The friends you have might not have that chill attitude later in 12th so enjoy the memories you are building cuz in 12 everyone around you will suddenly start focusing on studying and you might fall behind so 12 ma jani bittikai start learning concepts especially physics ko.   Tips for you in 11  1. Grab any opportunity you have become CR club member Host of program sing or whatever you are good at cuz you will be remembered by that more. Also being a CR or club member will benefit your bidesh ko lagi.  2. Try understanding concepts of everything. Science is all about logic if you don't understand the logic behind it you can't understand the science behind it.  3. Feel free to ask to teachers, they are not your enemies. Friends might suppress your curiosity but it doesn't mean teachers won't listen to you. Concepts bujhdainau bhane teachers lai gayera sodha If you are shy to ask them in public. Go to the teachers in the staff room or meet them in the corridor, hallways and question them. Doing this, some of your friends might call you teacher ko chatne or something like that ignore them cuz you are the one who is gonna stand in that interview after 12th not them.  4. Chill.  Tips for 12 Doing 1 will help you be a face that everyone recognizes in 12. If you don't do 1 you might regret it in 12 so go for it.  Keep doing 2 and 3. After a few months into 12, you will realize that its all about what you understand. If you can understand the concept you will remember the formulae. Like physics ko nai kura garda, concept bujhexa bhane timle mathematically k garne yaad hunxa tespaxi dimaag ma or paper mai tyo derive garera formula lekhna sakxau.   This is all about the tips rant and motivation i have for you|||dm me",
