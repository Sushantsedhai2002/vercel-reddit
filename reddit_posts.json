            "body": "I’m(21 M) a university student and today I finally left my father after years of emotional damage, and I don’t know if I did the right thing.  My mom passed away long ago, so my “family” has always been just me and my father. He used to work abroad, but he returned about 4 years ago and has been unemployed since. He has no savings left from years of working abroad. The only source of money he has now is ancestral property.  Two years ago he sold some of our land for a large amount of money, but he wasted all of it within a year on alcohol, gambling, and other self-destructive habits. He’s now trying to sell more land, and when I tried to stop him, we ended up arguing.  What truly broke me is that we shared the same room, and every single night he would get heavily drunk, shout at me, verbally abuse me for things I never did, and talk loudly to his friends on the phone until 2 AM. I couldn’t sleep, couldn’t study, couldn’t live normally. My grades dropped, my motivation collapsed, and I started developing depression and even suicidal thoughts at night.  I stayed for years hoping he would improve. I kept telling myself it’s just a phase, or that I should wait, or that maybe I’m overreacting. But nothing changed. Instead, things kept getting worse. I felt like I was slowly dying inside.  Few days ago I shared my disappointment regarding father recklessness to my maternal grandmother and she called my father and called him out. Yesterday I experienced the most brutal verbal abuse from my father (he was heavily drunk) at mid night and told me to leave his house. So today morning I packed my things and went to my maternal uncle’s place. Uncle said he’s willing to support me until I finish my college.  Right now I feel a mix of guilt, sadness, anger, and relief. Part of me feels like I abandoned my father. Another part of me feels like I finally escaped a toxic, abusive environment. I’m confused and emotionally exhausted.  I don’t know if I made the right decision. I don’t know if I should feel guilty or proud for finally standing up for myself.  Has anyone else gone through something like this? Did I do the right thing by leaving?",

Thinking about the future and trying to make life better is good but when you over think the same thing over and over, that thought is what making you demotivated not the situation. If you can’t change the situation, don’t over think it.  I know its hard, but don’t loose the hope.  Stay calm, plan and proceed and will be a matter of time you see the changes.

It really helps to see where your money goes. If you have any debts, create a small, steady repayment plan so they don’t keep snowballing.      Separate essential and non-essential expenses, even small adjustments can make a difference. And try to save at least a tiny amount each month. Even a symbolic sum gives a bit of control and stability.      Look at how much free time you have outside of work and try to set aside a small, consistent window to learn skills that are in demand. Little steps add up and can help you increase your income over time.      I’ve been in a similar situation myself, and I know how heavy it can feel. But it is possible to climb out of it slowly, with small steady actions. You’re already doing an incredible amount, don’t be too hard on yourself. You’re stronger than you think, and you’re not alone.|||what job u do?|||You are a legend for doing that, god will bless you and open your path|||I hear you can make more with pathao or similar ride services as a rider.",

They gave me love, care, and a good life, but deep inside I always felt something was missing.  I lived in the village with my grandparents, and I was happy there. When I was sent to Kathmandu for school, I missed them so much that I came back. Later I went again and changed schools many times. Even though my life moved from village to city and from one uncle’s home to another, I always tried to adjust and stay strong.  I completed my schooling and always dreamed of going abroad. I worked hard, made my passport, prepared for IELTS, joined many Telegram groups, and became well known among students applying to the U.S. Even when I failed many times, I didn’t stop. I applied to the U.S. five times. Every time I arranged the money myself, except once when I asked my uncle. I tried again and again because I believed in myself.  Later I joined Tri Chandra and studied BSc Physics for two years. But I still wanted to study abroad. I got accepted by a college in the U.S. but was refused the visa again. After that I applied to South Korea and came here. Life here has been difficult the language, the loneliness, the pressure. But I survived for 2.5 years.  One month ago, I found out that my father tried to take his own life by drinking poison. My family hide it from me because they didn’t want to give me stress. It broke me. It made me question everything.my journey, my dreams, and what I was chasing.  Still, I didn’t give up. I applied again to transfer to the U.S. and now my visa interview is in 10 days. I don’t know what will happen. But I know one thing: I have struggled, I have fallen, and I have stood up again. My life has not been easy, but I have always tried my best.

            "comments": "You won't \"save\" a lot at first because you won't immediately have a job, but it will help immensely when you're starting out. I don't know if you still have to pay back the 9 months fee to bank loan, and that really factors in your savings.  Lets say you get a part time casual job wotking 24 hrs a week. You will earn about 700-900 aud per week on average depending on your shifts. You can either use that to buy stuff for yourself or save it to pay back the loan later. Consider saving as much as you can as if yoy don't have a job in future for even a month or two, you will have the money to survive.  If you were to live alone in a sharehouse, weekly expenses would be  250$ rent 100$ groceries 60$ extras like mobile plan, subscriptions, eating out, etc  So lets say you spend 450$ per week on expenses, you can save the rest for future fees or loan repayments. Or if you're staying rent free, thats like saving 350-400 on regular expenses.  Of course if you have to move out, you will need to buy stuff as well. Depending on your living situation, it might be necessary to purchase bedding stuff, utensils, etc. Remember, you earn more but stuff also cost more.  So even if you are staying with your sister, save as much as you can. Don't overspend on nice things like new phone, expensive clothes etc unless necessary.|||Only advise if you want to maintain relationship with any family members in Australia or anywhere else, don't stay more than 2 weeks maxxx, move out immediately. Ask anyone, they will tell u their story.|||No relatives, no friends, not even distant-relative or friend-of-a-friend. My initial contact was a complete stranger who found out that I even existed just 3 days before I stepped foot in Australia. It was arranged through my distant-relative's very-distant college friend's lil brother.  First 15 months: worked my ass off and aggressively saved \\~26k total. With that, paid off 100% of the student debt + returned the total approx interest payments to my parents (they were paying it so... had to). Remaining went to paying for the tuition.  YTD, 14months in, I have, in total \\~9k liquid (6.5k for final tuition fees, \\~2.5k contingency fund), \\~5k on ETFs (Stock), put 2.1k on BTC when it was USD 84-86k (recent dip just made me see potential \\^30% so risked what I could afford losing, but ended up losing $300 regardless due to on-ramp fees alone. my dumb-ass wanted to avoid full-KYC). Anyways, \\~17k is what I am worth as of now.  Still need to pay \\~4k to the people my family borrowed money from when sending me here (they never told me, idiots)  Worked as a casual employee just until 1 month ago when I transitioned to part-time.  Was a casual Kitchen Hand for the first 15 months and better half of the subsequent 14 months. Kitchen hand paid off the loan so I got into aged care (-3k on certs, feels shitty but there was no other way). Still eying IT-field but it's tough even though I am more than capable skill-wise (comparing with the average \"IT student\", I am well aware that I am nothing compared to Linus Torvalds or King Terry The Terrible, if ykyk).  Only did a little less than 2k worth of cash-in-hand until now, mostly because lack of connections/know-how on how to connect itself. I despise socializing, am extremely anti-outgoing, and anti-fun in general. I have very few friends who I honestly just see as \"people who sit in the same class as me\". For me this is normal and I can't be more happy being on my own.  Also, I think my nature of having zero friends/relatives to rely upon saved me from financial trouble for the most part. With friends, you spend shit load of money due to peer-pressure and overall idiocy regarding everything. With relatives, you refuse to push yourself and learn to become financially-smart because \"falano hununxa kei vaihalo vane\". That's just my opinion though.  Still wasting 8hr/day average watching YouTube and even more in various corners of the internet lmao. And fuck everyone who said \"YouTube herera k garxas\" \"Internet ma time waste na gar\"  Canberra  \\~30-40hr/week during semester breaks  I try to reach 48hr/fortnight when classes are going on but can be anywhere between 15-24 hr/week.  Almost went bankrupt one time (dented/scratched an expensive car, got lucky -- the owner was understanding; still had to pay but just 1k).  Every bill paid, I personally never gave/borrowed money to/from anyone.  This is the best advice anyone will ever get btw -- do not be afraid to invest aggressively when you are young. Do not distract yourself with anything. Set a goal, make plan A, and follow that plan A because there is no Plan B. You get one shot in life, you either lock-in, smarten up, and make it or die trying. I am halfway through my 20s and all I can do is cope saying \"i still got time, I am young\". Even allow your superannuation to be invested into stocks (there's an option in every Superfund. They will manage it themselves no need to keep an eye on it). It will take time but anyone can get there with discipline. The only fast way to get \"rich\" is getting lucky with the spawn or getting lucky with BTC; both of which most will miss-out on. Be patient and invest (always keep some contingency fund though). good luck.",

Given my science background, which one might be a better fit?  Best Colleges near Lalitpur? Could anyone recommend the top-tier management colleges located near Lalitpur/Patan?  Am I too late for admissions? I just passed out in 2025. Have admission cycles already closed for this intake?  The Abroad Factor: My primary reason for joining a local college immediately is to avoid a gap year, just in case my visa application for abroad studies gets rejected down the line. I want to have a safety net and continue my education smoothly. Any insights, recommendations for colleges, or general advice on navigating admissions timelines would be incredibly helpful right now!!",

Most of them were saying no vacancy and some asked to send them mail. One of them said that they will contact me later and after an hour one of them contacted me on WhatsApp with another number. They were seeking someone with TS/JS/React/Laravel but I didn't know much of these as I mostly work in Python and C++. Then without any interview, he gave me a simple task to do in React/Laravel and submit the next day and I did it. Then he didn't respond for 4 days and when I again messaged on WhatsApp and asked him, he said me to come tomorrow to their office.  I went there looking at Google Maps. In Google Maps there was an image of a building next to their basement office lol. I went there, and there was no sign, no company name, nothing. I went to that building and called that number and he came outside of the basement and waved his hand. Then he took me to the basement office.  There were like 2 rooms, one was like a small office area and in the other area there were 2 people. There were just 3 people at that time and I thought everyone was outside for lunch because it was 12:30. Then they started talking to me, within the first minutes they asked me what my salary expectation was. Then they asked me how I came here and if I had a bike or not (probably looking for overtime). Then they asked what my future plans were, if I had plans to go to a foreign country or not. Then one of the guys came and said about their product and they were apparently making some “revolutionary” POS device which he literally said “is not some normal product like others make here.”  Then another guy came and wrote something in his phone and showed it to the other guy and he agreed and then asked me to come to another room and gave me a to-do task. It was related to Laravel/React/MySQL about some session stuff. They gave me that task when they explicitly knew that I didn't know much about React/Laravel which they would monitor while I did the work and would see my level.  Then they literally said to not use too much AI. At that point, I was sure that this job was not for me. They had connected WiFi to my laptop and initially I started coding for real but at the same time they were vibe coding using Copilot to code themselves! Then I was sure it’s not for me. If I wanted I could have easily done that with any coding agent. So, I opened Claude/ChatGPT/Gemini side by side and started chatting with them telling them about my situation. And all of them said the same, “Leave now!” They gave me the task to see my skill and work but they barely looked at me the whole time. They probably looked at me 2 times the whole time.  I wanted to leave but I didn’t know how to escape. Then I suddenly shut down my laptop and then opened the bag chain silently and suddenly stood up and said, “I can’t do this, I’ll go home.” Then they said, “What happened?” Then I said, “Nothing, I just wanna go home.” and ran away. I was there for like over 1 hour. Then I went to the nearest hotel and took a cup of tea. I was laughing and smiling the whole time. So, I bought a mask to hide me smiling the whole time and walked for about 30 minutes instead of taking the bus. Then again after arriving RNAC, I went to another hotel for a cup of tea and at that time they called me thrice, once on WhatsApp, and two from different numbers and I blocked all of them.",

At last a real fix was found and now it's launched as part of recent kernel update.

            "body": "Got forced into an arranged marriage, husband is shyer than a scared kitten, and now we’re 8 months deep with zero conversations lmao.  So after my +2, my family started going full \"bihe gar, bihe gar\" mode. Every morning felt like a marriage proposal interview. I kept saying I wanted to study bachelor’s first, but nobody took me seriously. Typical Nepali parent combo attack.  Then one day, boom they tell me, “We found a good boy.” I hadn't even seen his face; they were like, “Ramro chhora ho.” Girl, I didn’t even know his name.  Fast-forward to the wedding day: Whole gaun dancing, kids running everywhere, DJ blasting Sani Nani. Everyone vibing except me, the bride, who’s just like “ what is happening.”  I finally saw my husband at mandap and yeah, he looked decent but BRO DIDN’T EVEN LOOK at me properly. I swear he stared at the floor more than my face.  Then suhagraat… I was in the room crying like an idiot because I was stressed and scared. But instead of comforting me, man walked in, looked shocked like he saw a ghost, and LEFT. NO WORDS. ZERO. ZILCH.  For the next few days, our communication level = Bluetooth off.  After that, he escaped to KTM faster than a last bench student during assembly. I thought maybe he’d text? Call? Smoke signal? ANYTHING? Nope. Silence.  Dashain time comes, he returns home. I tried walking near him; man literally walked behind us like we're bodyguards. Even then, no talking. I don’t think he even knew my name until his mom spilled it   And the chocolate incident… His sister gave me a packet, so I ate it (obviously). Later I found out it was for gifting the village kids. Bro looked at me like I ate their future   Months passed. Not a single conversation. I started avoiding him too because at this point it's just awkward both sides.  Then post-Dashain, he shows up at my maita to take me back. Whole family treating him like king jwai. He looked scared of the respect   My little sister tagged along with us, thank god, because otherwise we’d walk one hour in complete silence. My man STILL didn’t talk directly to me. He literally whispered to my sister, “Ask what didi wants to eat.” SIR??? HELLO??? I CAN HEAR YOU???  8 months married. 0 conversations. 0 eye contact. 0 progress.  We communicate through: • my sister • awkward glances • chowmein orders • pure telepathy failure  Anyway, idk what this relationship is but at this point we’re basically two NPCs living separately but married by system default 😭",

Kasto hola achamma chha j kura ni mazak lagne. Timro love naparos||| Husband’s POV:  I knew my parents were looking for a girl for me, but I didn’t think they’d actually find one. I thought I had at least 5–7 years to mentally prepare… apparently not.  One random Tuesday, Ama goes, “Babu, we found a girl for you.” I nearly dropped my phone. Girl? For ME? Why?  I saw one tiny photo of you for 0.3 seconds before my dad covered it like it was a government secret. I was like, “Wait— but— who—?” Too late. Wedding prep started.  Wedding Day  Everyone’s dancing, drinking, screaming, having the time of their lives. Meanwhile me = statue mode.  Then I saw you at the mandap.  My brain: “She’s… pretty.” Also my brain: “Don’t look. If you look she’ll know you exist.”  So yes, I stared at the floor like it owed me money. I was SO nervous I forgot how to blink.  Suhagraat  I walked into the room and saw you crying and my entire soul left my body.  I panicked so hard I thought I’d faint. My mind went: “What do I do?? Comfort??? Talk??? DIE???”  So I did the only thing my socially anxious caveman instincts allowed: I LEFT.  First Few Days  Every time I tried to say something, my throat said, “Haha no.” You looked as scared as I felt.  So… Bluetooth off.  Then I got sent to Kathmandu for work and honestly I was relieved because I had no idea how to function around you. I rehearsed texting you like 20 times but never sent anything. If silence was a sport, I was winning gold.  Dashain  I came home thinking, “Okay, this time I’ll talk.” Then I saw you.  Brain: buffering…  I wanted to walk next to you but I didn't want to be creepy or weird, so I walked behind. Like a bodyguard with performance issues.  Then the chocolate incident— I gave that packet to my sister to distribute to kids. When I saw you eating it I didn’t get mad— I got SCARED. Because I didn’t know if I should tell you or just pretend gifting chocolate to villagers was never my plan in life.  After Dashain  My parents forced me to go pick you up from your maita. I was SO nervous I practiced “Let’s go” in front of the mirror like 14 times.  Your family treated me like royalty and I had no idea how to respond except freeze.  Your little sister tagging along was the best thing ever because if it was just us two… That hour of walking would’ve sent me to the hospital.  I DID want to talk to you. Genuinely. But my voice refused to come out whenever I faced you directly.  That’s why I whispered through your sister. “Ask what didi wants to eat” = the bravest sentence I said that day.  Now  8 months married. I still haven’t had the courage to properly talk to you.  Not because I don’t like you— I actually really like you.  I’m just… Terrified. Awkward. Zero experience. And overwhelmed by the fact that I suddenly have a whole wife.  Every day I think: “Tomorrow, I’ll talk to her.” Then you walk into the room and my brain blue-screens.  So yes, we are two NPCs married by system auto-fill. But trust me— I’m trying.  My heart is ready. My mouth is not.|||I saw post from the husband side too 💔🥀|||Arrange marriage garxu vanne lai ta yo post le saato udayo ta|||I will post the DJ pov later.|||Xya yesto lamo kasle padhxa ho|||Yeutai manxey le made up scenario post garira cha yo ta.

            "body": "Might be a bit dramatical but whatever happened today will live well within me for this lifetime.   TLDR:- Random 60 ish y/o uncle asked me for help of busfare to get to his wife cremation at Pashupati. After i helped him he hugged me tight and that was my first ever hug in 18 years of my life.   This morning i was running late to catch bus to college, but i was stopped by a 60 ish looking uncle. And i stopped even tho i was running late, he said \"babu ma timlai yeauta kura sunauxu.....\" i thought he was one of those 'parmeshwor' ka chela and was trying to brush it off but i'm glad i listened everything.  He said that his wife died by suicide and that she drank poison. Then he continues to say, that his phone is dead (it actually was) and has no bus fare to travel to Pashupati for cremation so he asked me to help him 50rs.   Midway through i thought it was just a story to ask for money but his phone was actually dead and he was really sobbing, he even told me to keep his phone in exchange of the money.  But i didn't have any cash at that moment and only exact bus fare i needed to get to college and return. So i went to a nearby shop, bought happydent of 10rs and paid 60 from online and asked for 50 back. Which i gave it to that uncle.  He was sitting by roadside crying, while all this happened. I got to him and he got up and hugged me really tight. I hugged him back. And that was my first ever actual hug in my whole life😭 i had bad morning prior but that really lifted my mood up. I left him on busstop Then he really thanked me and fetched me goodbye while still sobbing. Made my whole day.  I really hope he's doing all okay now and may his wife rest in peace.",

But my parents always go on and on about how I will need friends in life and I should at least invite them on my birthday but I was persistent on celebrating it alone.  The day before, I told them I won't like to be home in my birthday (I was lowkey scared my friends were gonna show up at my house as they have done that despite my refusal to celebrate birthday in past years) so I said I will go out alone roaming Kathmandu. I had the google map open on my phone and was looking at some potential places I could go.  My baba was right there but I didn't mind him and I, internally in my mind thought maybe I should go to Narayanhiti Palace Museum because I find the garden there so peaceful and serene, I fucking love that place so I was going through the visiting hours and fees and internally decided that I would go there (mind you I didn't tell my decision to anyone) and I made plan for entire day looking at maps the distances between the places as I was walking and so on.  And yesterday I woke up, there was a small hand made bouquet from my younger brother and my parents wished me happy birthday and I had lunch and started getting ready to leave. Baba knocked on my door and he said, \"I haven't been to Narayanhiti Durbar ever, do you wanna go there?\" And oh my, my heart!! I said of course and my eyes were filled with tears as he knew I am always sort of sad on my birthday and he decided to be my buddy for the day.  And we, dad and daughter went on the trip, went to Narayanhiti sat in the garden for longest time, took our sweet time explore all of the museum and we then went to tiptop (he insisted to go there as he saw me going through tiptop location on the map yesterday) and he bought me a jacket in New Road as well. On the way home he said to take frozen momo (as I love momo with homemade achar), made momo's achar and devoured it.  And as I was about to sleep my brother asked me for my help for his homework so I went to living room and there was a mini chocolate cake. And I didn't even expected any surprise. Turns out after we came home and ate momo, my dad went out and bought this cutest mini cake. And I cut the cake, wished for all of my days to be filled with the joy I felt all day along and we enjoyed the cake.  This has to be my BEST BIRTHDAY EVER!! I know you won't see this, baba and I know I won't ever tell you this to you face but I LOVE YOU SO MUCH BABA! THANK YOU for celebrating my birthday just the way I like it, peaceful and private.",

That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.

I want to promote my own culture, not get mistaken as part of another country.  I don’t want foreigners thinking Nepal = India just because we speak Hindi in movies or daily life.

Also most of my Indian colleagues are South Indian and they don’t understand Hindi either.|||Why’d we speak a language we don’t even know well? Just because we can understand some of it, doesn’t mean we have learnt it in the right way. We’ve learnt Nepali and English since childhood and those are the only languages we feel confident in.|||Bro, why did you even start speaking hindi ????   Your language is your weapon. Since hindi is not your identity, you have a disadvantage. They look down on you if you speak their language with them. That’s literally saying: you are my master, i will follow you.   You will only be a sidekick on someone else’s story.   You have more control and power over your own language. You can say anything in Nepali and no one can correct you cus you are the native speaker. You are fluent and can express yourself better. That gives you the leverage to take a stand for yourself.   I am surprised, that you used to speak hindi man. You compromised your language for their convenience. Ofcourse they will treat you like their follower.   But i am glad you realised your mistake.|||Agree completely. I never entertain anyone who assumes I speak Hindi and doesn't see a difference between our cultures and languages. I never willingly consume Indian media and always try to give Nepali content more of my attention. I think it's high time we did something about the rampant encroachment of not just Indian but also Western culture into our collective psyche.|||Lived in the states for 18 yrs, never responded in Hindi. In fact, respond them with English, which for most Nepalese, is better in terms pronunciation than theirs.|||I have true blooded Nepali family (I am also true blooded Nepali myself) and they say it’s the same thing. I say why wouldn’t you speak Hindi to communicate with these guys and they say it’s an identity thing. We are not Hindi, we are Nepali. it’s like a kinda stand on business kinda thing. “we are not just an offshoot of India we are better” kinda thing, and I get it lol|||Well most Indians don't speak Hindi anyway. I live in Delhi and even I speak more English than Hindi. Anyway, like some guy here said language is just a medium of exchange. I doubt the people who are making you feel inferior will automatically stop doing so if you stop communicating in Hindi. You should search other remedies.|||Exactly.  Most Nepalis think it shows intelligence or something by speaking Hindi or broken hindi.  Speaking hindi as a Nepali is the best way to show that we are somehow part of India.   I have also seen firsthand that that some Indians will treat you shittier if you speak their language. Its not all indians, but there are too many.   Cmon people have some self respect. |||I've faced the same at an apple care Tokyo. Seeing us the technician request another to guide us. One indian man arrived with loud tone \"Kya Problem hai Bhaiya ?\". I said I don't understand Hindi can we communicate in English ? He went back and the previous technician came to guide us again. The problem with my iPad remain unsolved though.  But if somebody (Normally senior citizens) asks for help in Hindi, I help them with my broken hindi.|||Agreed. Indian haru Nepal ma aauda ni I talk to them in English. I am kinda confused as to why do Indians talk in Hindi in Nepal. I mean aafai aafai kura garda ta bhayo but tourist thau haru, mandir haru ma Indian aayera Hindi ma questions sodhda chai ma English mai reply dinchu.|||wtf even talk in hindi|||It's unfortunate you had that experience, but Hindi is the 3rd most spoken language in the world, right behind English and Mandarin.   To tell someone to stop speaking that language isn't going to fix the issue. You should be confident and talk to the people who make you feel this way that Hindi is not your native language and you can only converse in a limited way. Any person who insults you by considering you \"inferior\" is stupid and arrogant. You have to call them out on it.   Since you are in Canada, there are many people who speak French. And French is the 6th most spoken language in the world. If you can learn it and speak, that'd give you a boost in talking to more people. It doesn't always have to be English.   Language is just a medium to communicate. It doesn't belong to any particular nation or a group of people. Don't be afraid to speak out your thoughts.   In Nepal, if you can't speak English well, the people consider you illiterate. It doesn't matter how good you can speak Nepali or a native language.  It's the behaviour and expectations of people in language that's judged.|||this should be the way, mero bhutani sathi lai ni \"Hindi to ati hogi\" bhanchan everytime, i hate it.|||Bruh you need job application|||It’s been 10 years since I watched Indian movies or listened to hindi songs. I can’t even name a single post 2015 actor, singer or celebrity. I haven’t seen Indian content except for a few educational or academic contents and even that is rare.|||Yes, either speak Nepali or English, no other language|||I dont think hindi is the problem here,instead that emploer.|||We should tell that to Nepali wanna be Bollywood’s artists also.|||This but speaking in hindi for indian tourist, why do we do that?|||It always depends on personal experience.  But having to know more than 1 language is always good.|||I don’t really hang around Indians that much and whenever I do I just say I don’t understand Hindi at all. Which forces them to talk to me in English. Also whenever I mention I’m Hindu they’re like we have the same religion and all. I like to tell them that even tho we have the same religion our practices are different and I am not familiar with their practices and beliefs. I just try to separate myself and our country from them as much as I can, cause we’re not the same. I don’t like those who try to be like them in terms of everything. Like please have your own identity.|||I went to an Indian Restaurant here in Finland. I was talking to the owner he asked me where are you from? I told him I’m from Nepal. He then said Toh Phir Hindi Bolo Na Ek Hi toh bhasa hai. I told him do you speak Nepali cuz I don’t speak Hindi. So from that day I have stopped speaking in Hindi to Indians and other people I only speak in English.|||Balla buddhi palyexa jasto kura aayo tw!!!|||yeah fk hindi only newari|||i don't know hindi https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalNP/comments/1pgcdh3/i_dont_know_%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%A6/     |||In Nepal I've never spoken Hindi, and I don't watch hindi movies or listen to hindi songs either.

They show a very strange and confused face. They won't even dare to utter any hindi, just english.|||I am in Canada as soon as I say I am Nepali, Indian people automatically start speaking in hindi like we are supposed to know the language. I always reply in English some are consistently speaking in hindi maybe because their english is not as good or just ignorant. But once you say \"what?\" like 5 times they usually stop. Had an amazing Indian co worker she respected me enough to never speak to me in hindi even tho she knew I could.|||I'm sorry you experience this, Nepal is beautiful and wonderful and you should be encouraged to speak Nepali or Hindi without racism.

I just pretend like i don't understand Hindi whenever an Indian tries to yap in Hindi|||I NEVER speak Hindi and never will, I say I can understand but cannot speak Hindi so I reply in English. Don’t let these Indians think they can go around speaking Hindi to every South Asia, it’s time they learn to respect other South Asians.  Also I’m Mongolian so they think I’m Chinese or Filipino when they meet me and talk to me in English but when they find out I’m Nepali they start talking to me in Hindi out of nowhere and treat me VERY different. Hell with these Indians.|||If we look at the Fact,  Nepali language is derived from Hindi and Urdu. We use same devnagiri script. Whereas many local languages are marginalised.|||Whenever I’ve switched from English and then spoken to someone in Hindi, I’ve felt a commonness and even respect. Being tri-lingual is a skill, not a downgrade.   I go to small family owned grocery store, I greet them in Hindi and they say namastey, and my usual the liquor store guy asks me how I’ve been doing and gives me discount.   Language was invented by humans to make connections. Rather than saying dont speak a particular language, maybe saying something about how to develop relationships would have been better.|||I speak Hindi to my Nepali family for fun. but with exaggeration|||This post and the comments just reek of inferiority complex.|||bakchodi band 2 chicken plate momo laga or pyaaz rakh dio thode se",

The average Nepali is busy surviving, working, studying, or trying to get that visa. No one has the energy to fight strangers every time they say “Same thing hai na?”   2. We’re used to being ignored. Globally, Nepal = Everest + Gautam Buddha + trekking. That’s it. Our language barely enters the conversation.   3. Nepali people learn Hindi without even trying. Bollywood, TV serials, Indian YouTube, cross-border trade, songs, memes  Hindi is everywhere. Even if you never sat in a classroom for it, you’ll magically understand 80% of Hindi just by growing up Nepali.   4. Hindi influenced us… but we also influenced Hindi. Half the words are cross-shared across Sanskrit roots. It’s natural for South Asian languages to overlap. But overlap ≠ identical.   5. We’re too chill about our identity. We love our nationality, but we rarely assert it the way other countries do. We quietly adapt instead of loudly correcting people.  Meanwhile Indians think… “Nepali? Isn’t that just Hindi?”  Not all, but many Indians:  Have never heard Nepali spoken properly  Don’t know it’s the official national language of an entire country  Think it’s a dialect because it’s written in Devanagari  Assume everyone around the subcontinent speaks Hindi because Bollywood is huge   And because Nepalis speak Hindi fluently, Indians assume we learned their language, not realizing we absorbed it out of necessity, media exposure, and proximity.  Why this triggers our nationality (my pov):  Because to us:  Nepali isn't “small.” It’s our identity.  It's the language of our moms yelling at us, our jokes, our culture, our songs, our poems.  When someone reduces it to “Hindi but different,” it feels like our whole culture gets downgraded.   We’re not against Hindi. We’re not against Indians. We’re just tired of Nepali being treated like background noise.   Lastly  Nepali is not Hindi.  Nepalese know Hindi because of exposure, not because it’s taught.  Indians often don’t recognize Nepali as a separate language.  Nepalese rarely complain, but deep down, it does poke our sense of nationality.  It’s a hate in my pov.  Drop your statement if you have kinda same feeling.",

I was one of the \"Back off India\", \"boycott bollywood\" and \"down with big-brother\" kind of person. But when I moved abroad, I realised that most of these statements from the Indian people doesn't come out of malice, but out of pure ignorance. Of course, there are a few assholes who will reduce us to a certain profession and an accent, but 99 out of 100 times it's because they don't know any better.  We as Nepali people feel strongly about our language, our culture and our identity as anyone would do, but it's not that people go out of way to demean Nepal and Nepali. Everybody is trying to communicate, get shit done, or just socialize and not everyone is out to get us.   I suggest we assume people do something (potentially wrong / objectionable) out of ignorance rather than malice. That simplifies it a lot.|||you need job application bruh|||Pls dont do this to your country.

The polarizing conditions here in India and the language divide is not something anyone needs. And I am not a native hindi speaker either but the enforcement of regional languages with people getting violent to get their way is just the starting of extremism, please just let people be|||Lmao|||so language war in our country too like the language war that's happening in neighboring country's different states? why isn't language treated as means for conversation and not an identity?  also you do know that Nepali isn't used by everyone's mom's to yell? Nepal is also multi-lingual and multi cultural country. Nepali might be national language but we as a Nepali citizen aren't forced to speak it at all times.|||It’s not even really Nepali technically it’s Khas bhasa that got rebranded when the country was named Nepal after the Valley. Nepal Bhasa used to mean newari not that long ago. And the language we now called Nepali was Khas bhasa or Gorkha bhasa. Basically Nepali is cultural appropriation of Newari language 😂. And on the other hand the language we call Hindi is just Sanskritized sibling of urdu that was created during the British Raj. Both Hindi and Nepali don’t even have that long of a heritage. I find this hilarious. 🙌🏽 They both just got a makeover pretty recently.|||Since I don't consume Indian media, I am unable to speak Hindi, I can understand the language  in movies, tv etc. but when listening to someone talk in front of me I don't understand half of what they are saying. If I travel to India I generally use English the same as in any other foreign country.|||Nice like japan|||Finally someone posted. What the hell. A boy who even can't speak nepali is talking in hindi. I have also listened a group ko kids saying jay hind to nep officer. What the hell is happening. Everyone consumes Indian content. For diversity for little fun it's okey. But forgetting our on country our own songs our culture damm. . everything is messed up. This thing has came to such a extent which I don't think will be reversed. We should have to serious about this right now....|||As someone who grew up abroad but born Nepali, I’ve been so proud to know that many other Nepali who have come abroad have brought the culture of hospitality and respect and committed it to their new environment. I’ve never heard of anyone in Australia bad mouthing Nepali people, in fact they remember that 1 staff member from a couple of jobs ago, and how kind, considerate and hard working they were.   I can’t say my disdain for Indian people/culture/behaviour has been known from visiting India or interacting with Indian tourists in Nepal but rather, the Indians in Australia who have created a negative sentiment to the Australian people because they are not willing to assimilate.   I guess it is the same notion that Indians see themselves and their culture/language as superior, regardless of the perception of Nepali people or the way they are perceived in Australian society. The Indians in Australia don’t integrate themselves well into society because they don’t really get what it means to be Australian, as opposed to just obtaining PR/citizenship. (Maybe someone can comment from a Canadian perspective)  Nepali people have that general enthusiasm to share and have intercultural exchange because of the diversity in language, ethnicity, drinks and food we have and the cultural traditions/events that occur almost every day of the week.. heck, the Indians who visit Nepal, come for these very reasons!   I’m just incredibly proud that real human interactions with my dajus/didis in Australia has made it easy to be forward with my heritage and culture because many Aussies have had nothing but those glowing things to say. Nepali people abroad have truly represented Nepal well despite the 3rd world experience in the country where most locals will do anything to make an extra buck and have given tourists some negative experiences.   Overall, absolutely love being a part of this Nepali generation, I don’t think I’ve ever met a Nepali person and not befriended them. Jai Nepal!🇳🇵|||I find it kinda funny whenever someone paints the Nepali language as something that every Nepali should have affinity for. Though I understand the power dynamic behind Nepalis being spoken to Hindi in Nepal by the Indians, which in my opinion kinda problematic in that context, I don't actually see any problem in people speaking in whatever language they feel comfortable with. Personally, I reply in English or use broken Hindi without putting much effort in those situations.         I am a newari guy. I don't actually care much about Nepali language aside from using it as a communication tool with fellow Nepalis. Yes, it's one of the languages spoken in Nepal, hence there's a general obligation to say that we should preserve the national langauges just like any other non-newari person will say about Newari language.      And, strictly speaking about my personal attachment or pride associated with Nepali language, it's practically zero.    So, please stop enforcing the narrative that (all) Nepalis have similar feeling towards Nepali language as the ones whose mother tongue is Nepali language.|||RELAX lmao|||It's just indian mentality i think. They got colonized but in the process they themselves have developed the same mindset. So I think it'll take some time before they realize thier own persona.  Tbh i don't give a shit about this. If somebody behaves to me like that whether they are indian or not, i speak up about it and just go about my day.   At the same time, I think we both indians and nepalese are kind of same ( like in a human character way ).|||It’s always north Indians who start speaking Hindi after knowing I’m Nepali. Then when I reply in Nepali, they ask, “Why are you speaking that?” And I’m like, how the f* do you think I understood whatever bullshit you were mumbling? That’s all. But South Indians are actually good…they don’t do this",

If you're going on a trek, I'd strongly advise getting a guide for any number of reasons.  A solo female traveler from Germany died just last week, apparently because she followed a route that was on a map but had been abandoned in favor of a less dangerous route.

It doesn't apply to tier 1-2 cities in nepal as people have majorly accepted modernism. Beside scammers I barely feel any threat for female travellers. Nepal is much safer country comparatively and more safer compared to South Asian countries.|||Yep quite safe actually, you might be scam at some places. Remeber you don’t need to hire guides for a lot of places. Also foreigners usually get charged more so only go to a pkace after checking the review. Also use ride sharing app: indrive, pathao etc etc which will cost you lot less than just hiring taxi from the road. Please avoid public transportation if possible. And no streed food. Incase of diarrhea eats lots of water mix with ORS and not antibiotics or anti diarrhea stuff. Seek medical help if you feel sick.|||Avoid bordering towns with india.    Rest of Nepal is safe.

That said, it’s always wise to stay cautious especially in tourist areas near temples since a few people may try to sell cheap items at inflated prices.  Occasionally, someone might offer help in a friendly way but later expect money, though this is rare. Younger Nepalese, in particular, are usually genuinely friendly and happy to help without expecting anything in return, so don’t hesitate to approach them. Some older or poorer individuals might expect a small tip, but that’s not the norm. Most Nepalese are incredibly warm and welcoming win their heart, and they might even offer you food.

I had applied for some position at United Distributors Nepal (UDN). During the first round of the interview, the HR straight-up told me:  * “You must come in formal dress for the next round of the interview if you are selected,” * “Long hair is strictly against our policy,” * “If you get hired you *must* cut your hair,” * and also, “For the second round you *have* to come with your hair cut & in formal dress”  I had been growing my hair for almost **2 years**.

It stings.

I was just there a few days ago. My observations:  - There’s no decorum or order - absolute chaos. - Don’t know how to sugarcoat this, but it smells like feet everywhere. Need air flow and ventilation. - Limited cafe/restaurants in the int’l terminal - don’t know why they wouldn’t open up nicer places. People are willing to spend $ - Grateful they have chargers, but it’s placed in the middle of the walkways. How about next to the seats? - Only one water station after security - I’d add another one - Bathrooms are disgusting and totally unusable  After being back in KTM after 7 years, the city itself has grown so much.

They are the reason airport is messed up. Here is why:  1. They have no incentive to perform or change and fix what is not working. If they change anything or make things more lenient or easier they actually risk being ostracized. 2. Rules and processes are added for a really tight system and  for reducing false negatives. So need 2-3 means of verification for smallest of the procedure.  3. There is some unwarranted fear if the rules are not strict Indians and Americans will eat the country alive :p. Therefore they feel it is justified to make everything manual and cumbersome. 4. They are paid low and use any slight deviation to seek bribe.  5. They are too many of them. If things are automated we wouldn't need most of them. Why do you need to put passengers through 5 different lines and 5-10 staffs in each line. 6. Least travelled and least visionary people end up joining the service and are given a lot of power. Power trip makes them even worse. 7. They can't be fired.

Gagan thapa from what I see was always fighting within the party and was always corned because he didn't have grab on the party like deuba did. in party system, you've got to be a party leader before you can have a chance to get executive role and walk the talk. but finally he has the chance to lead the party. i really hope he does.  Gagan thapa who once used to be beacon of hope doesn't have that flair anymore. Nepali society has that tendency to make someone hero every once in a while. 2063 was Prachande, 2072 was Oli, 2080 was Rabi. Gagan Thapa was somewhere there all along as youth face until Nepali society got another hero in face of Rabi. People these days criticize Gagan Thapa for failing to deliver and not meeting the expectations. I remember people wanting Gagan Thapa to be Prime Minister back then but there's no hope from him anymore.  I personally think Gagan Thapa wasn't ready to be PM back then. Yes, his speeches sounded good, yes he had that craze , yes he was a young face in politics but he didn't have experience. Politics isn't as easy as populists think. It needs understanding of how government actually functions. If you've followed gagan thapa for past 6-7 years, he's finally being a mature political face.   after 2074, though congress lost the elections badly against NCP (oli+prachande) , Gagan thapa was constantly saying that party was going to break down on their own.  Later when Congress decided to form coalition with maobadi for 2079 elections, Gagan Thapa constatly stood against that decision and look how that turned out to be. Though Congress became first party, not a single chance to be PM.   Gagan Thapa stood against giving vote of confidence to Prachande when Oli and prachande formed government after elections. Later Prachande betrayed congress and went back to Oli.  Gagan thapa focused that congress should then be a strong opposition until next elections and shouldn't play to form government but deuba didn't listen and supported oli to form government. How that worked out for him - exit from politics by getting pun\\*ched by bunch of gen Zs and public humiliation.  When congress was in government, Gagan Thapa worked relentlessly for a couple of months on few ordinances - the one to let nepali companies invest abroad was significant one and welcomed. but soon the government started losing track and gagan thapa started criticizing the government his party was part of. just a couple of weeks before bhadra 23 happened, gagan thapa was there criticizing government by speaking in parliament. only if government had listened to him lol.  only if deuba had listened to gagan when he was suggesting deuba to take support out from government when oli decided the social media ban, thing would've turned differently.  gagan gets a lot of hate from RSP supporters for being critical about rabi's sahakari case - well, if there was no substantial proof, all 3 tiers of courts wouldn't have put him in custody. I'll say let court decide the case (and thats going to take lots of years , thats how court works in nepal).",

Dad transferred all the property except one which is called (rokka). Still took 25% of the land's value upfront to give up that land. We paid some loans off and bought another land near where we rent.  Got a big loan on our head now. My elder brother regrets studying expensive college like Islington where the money was gone for almost nothing. Didnt even get job related to the subject. Just took another huge loan to send him abroad. Still not able to send money back. Many other loans still on us.  I kind of saw this coming so I went for the cheaper college for bachelors. Started working from 1st semester. Almost 3 years later, I have a good income where I can atleast sustain my mom and myself while paying rent. But ya the loan is still there and we can barely manage to pay the interest.  Forgive that background. My point is you need to study no matter what. College jau. I suggest 12 samma majale padha.

Most of them were saying no vacancy and some asked to send them mail. One of them said that they will contact me later and after an hour one of them contacted me on WhatsApp with another number. They were seeking someone with TS/JS/React/Laravel but I didn't know much of these as I mostly work in Python and C++. Then without any interview, he gave me a simple task to do in React/Laravel and submit the next day and I did it. Then he didn't respond for 4 days and when I again messaged on WhatsApp and asked him, he said me to come tomorrow to their office.  I went there looking at Google Maps. In Google Maps there was an image of a building next to their basement office lol. I went there, and there was no sign, no company name, nothing. I went to that building and called that number and he came outside of the basement and waved his hand. Then he took me to the basement office.  There were like 2 rooms, one was like a small office area and in the other area there were 2 people. There were just 3 people at that time and I thought everyone was outside for lunch because it was 12:30. Then they started talking to me, within the first minutes they asked me what my salary expectation was. Then they asked me how I came here and if I had a bike or not (probably looking for overtime). Then they asked what my future plans were, if I had plans to go to a foreign country or not. Then one of the guys came and said about their product and they were apparently making some “revolutionary” POS device which he literally said “is not some normal product like others make here.”  Then another guy came and wrote something in his phone and showed it to the other guy and he agreed and then asked me to come to another room and gave me a to-do task. It was related to Laravel/React/MySQL about some session stuff. They gave me that task when they explicitly knew that I didn't know much about React/Laravel which they would monitor while I did the work and would see my level.  Then they literally said to not use too much AI. At that point, I was sure that this job was not for me. They had connected WiFi to my laptop and initially I started coding for real but at the same time they were vibe coding using Copilot to code themselves! Then I was sure it’s not for me. If I wanted I could have easily done that with any coding agent. So, I opened Claude/ChatGPT/Gemini side by side and started chatting with them telling them about my situation. And all of them said the same, “Leave now!” They gave me the task to see my skill and work but they barely looked at me the whole time. They probably looked at me 2 times the whole time.  I wanted to leave but I didn’t know how to escape. Then I suddenly shut down my laptop and then opened the bag chain silently and suddenly stood up and said, “I can’t do this, I’ll go home.” Then they said, “What happened?” Then I said, “Nothing, I just wanna go home.” and ran away. I was there for like over 1 hour. Then I went to the nearest hotel and took a cup of tea. I was laughing and smiling the whole time. So, I bought a mask to hide me smiling the whole time and walked for about 30 minutes instead of taking the bus. Then again after arriving RNAC, I went to another hotel for a cup of tea and at that time they called me thrice, once on WhatsApp, and two from different numbers and I blocked all of them.",

The story: A while ago, I was going through one of the lowest phases of my life. My mind was overflowing, and to cope, I created a small Instagram page where I posted random thoughts and videos. Those little expressions slowly grew into something much bigger — a website, and now an app that I’ve poured my entire soul into. It might not relate to everyone, but it’s something born straight from emotion, honesty, and healing.  The website is already live, and I’m preparing to launch the app on the Play Store. But before approval, Google requires internal testing, where real users try the app for a few days. They may check your activity numbers or even ask a few basic questions about your experience — that’s all. So I’m looking for a small group of genuine testers.  About the app: It’s an anonymous letting-go platform — a safe emotional space where you can write whatever you’re feeling, post little journal entries, and express thoughts without identity or pressure. It also lets you download beautiful universe-style images created from those messages, so every emotion becomes something artistic.  I genuinely couldn’t think of a better community than this one to support this phase. If anyone wants to be a tester for 14 days, I’d be incredibly grateful. And as a tiny thank-you — I’ll buy a plate of momo for every registered tester. ❤️  Please let me know if you’d like to join. Your support would truly mean a lot.

I agree.|||First thing I do is I ask them if they can speak English. It will hurt their little ego and they’ll switch immediately.|||You do you and I'll do me, I guess.    I spoke Hindi with a bunch of Bangladeshi tourists, because I don't understand Bangla, they don't understand Nepali, and they were more comfortable with Hindi than English.    I spoke Hindi with some Indian tourists because they were more comfortable with it than with English.    I continued to speak in English with an Indian visiting Nepal when I and a friend were interacting with him. The thing was, he switched code. I understood him and could have communicated well in Hindi with him, but my friend doesn't really understand Hindi, so I had to keep it in a language everyone understood, and I just told him I am not very good in Hindi.    I would happily speak Nepali in places like Darjeeling, where they speak Nepali, because I am most comfortable in it, and I know most people there would be more than comfortable in that. I assume that it is a comfort thing for them as well.  They're just more comfortable with Hindi than English, and I am accommodating, and fluent enough in Hindi, to extend the courtesy of speaking in their language.    I have come across Indians who look down on Nepal and Nepalis, and unfortunately, that attitude is more common among Indians than it should've been. It is not a pleasant experience, I admit. But, I refrain from putting all of them in a single box. I've met some wonderful Indians as well.   What I have to say is, we are individuals first, I, you, and anyone else, regardless of our nationality, or the languages we speak. Treat each individual on their merit, not their national identity. In fact, the shittiest person I've ever met is a fellow Nepali, and for obvious reasons—I live in Nepal.   The people who treated you bad were shitty people. The same attitude could very well be found in an Englishman, a Frenchman, or even a Nepali. That doesn't mean every Nepali, or Englishman, or Frenchman, is like that.    We are individuals first, in our lived experiences, not just a nationality, and in essence, expressions of existence, far greater than just a nationality. Treat people for who they are in that moment, not a label attached to them.    This is exactly the kind of subtle hate and/or prejudice I am against, whether it is based on lived experiences or influenced by rhetoric.   Use all the languages you know, as much as possible, I say. It is much better to open one's horizons than be insular. And no, I am not just a Nepali. My nationality is just one aspect of who I am, one which is more happenstance than chosen and curated with careful thought. So is yours, if you are actually willing to see it, along with anyone else's. |||Why were you speaking in Hindi in the first place instead of English.  Glad you found your self respect after a humiliating ritual. |||yes i agree. i mean totally agree. 100%  yes sir no nepali should be speaking in hindi in any situation ever.

I am from Nepal and I prefer English to communicate.|||Language is a powerful tool. I’m here in the US and I speak Spanish with folks who speak Spanish and obviously when there is a language barrier people will banter by saying things that can feel personal. Even greetings come down to culture like cunado (sala) in Nepali.  Most of our generation I am 27 years old watches anime Korean series and picks up words the same way we grew up with Hindi serials. It’s not about speaking Hindi being inappropriate but about the mindset and stigma attached to it. While speaking Japanese Spanish Korean Chinese or French gives you brownie points Hindi often doesn’t and that’s a failure in how Indian people and Hindi have been framed.  I relate to your concern and I have seen firsthand what you’re saying where it can make someone feel inferior and I believe that comes from perception not the language itself.  I say use language in your favor when you can. Draw your boundaries when needed and if something feels insulting say it clearly in English and they usually won’t repeat it. This applies to all languages.  Cheers!|||It’s always north Indians who start speaking Hindi after knowing I’m Nepali.

You can speak Hindi and still set boundaries if they treat you like shit. I don't see why speaking any other language will make you inferior. I did my Bachelors in India and never had a problem putting people in their places in their own language. I think uneducated illiterate and entitled people are everywhere including India and Nepal, I have had similar experiences with different ethnic communities within Nepal. I actually have problems speaking to Nepali people in Australia as they'll cross every boundary and think I'm liable for them just because we're from the same country.. Its a regional issue.  I watched a interview of Sonam Wangchuk in Nepal and he speaks Nepali throughout the interview. I think as reasonable people we should use whatever language we want depending on the circumstances. Having Hindi in our language arsenal is honestly a superpower as we get access to soo much resources and forms of art that otherwise we wouldn't have been exposed to and as someone from Nepal where we already have a lack of such resources, I'd be sad if I hadn't known Hindi.  So, maybe lets practice putting people in their places if they behave rudely to us and not blame the language. I have many friends from India who I am very close with and many that I had to tell them to show their entitlement elsewhere. It can be the same with English very soon with sentiments of immigration shifting alot and will be with Nepali within Nepal as well.

They are too busy with their own lives and the immediate world around them to specifically think anything about Nepal. India is a country of 1.3 billion people. And even in India, many people don't speak Hindi. Yeah, many in older generation are more racist, but they are racist to each other too. Many people fight over language in different Indian states, and discriminate with people of different states. But as I said, there are 1.3 billion people and a large majority will be as friendly to Nepali people. No, they don't think of Nepal as their little bro, but if asked, would actually hold some affinity towards Nepal in comparison to what they think of other nations.  Feel free to learn Hindi, feel free to forget, it's every one's personal choice. I honestly almost never need to learn it, but I like Nepali songs so much that I'm picking up on Nepali words now. (Kasari Bhanu, Bardali, Sarangi, Timi ra ma are among my favourite)  Lastly, this sub is quite Anti Indian, just saying,  generalizing India and Indians is ridiculous as the population is much more than most people can think of. And bad will always be highlighted more than good.|||It's not just Nepalis. North Indians act like this towards south Indians too.

I openly say that I understand it but don’t speak it, and I’ve never been treated like garbage because of that. I’m guessing you’re a man, because Nepalese men constantly put themselves in an inferior position, always with the “bhai, bhai” nonsense. That alone tells people how to treat you. I’m a 22-year-old woman in Canada, and there are two other Nepalese girls where I work. We carry ourselves with confidence. Our Indian manager can’t talk down to us, and neither can any coworker. But the Nepalese guys? They’re always talked down to like kids. They’re 27 and 28 years old and still get called “sala Nepali.” That never happens to us and it’s not a coincidence. We have more filipino co workers than Indians but they always hangout with Indians and say sh like , “ chalo bhai daru pitey hai aj “ in worse hindi accent possible.  This has nothing to do with language. It’s about presence. It’s about how you carry yourself. When you look unsure, dress badly, and act small, people treat you that way. Respect isn’t begged for , it’s taken.|||Guys why so much hatred for India..

And Have deicided to tell everyone that I can understand Hindi(little little) but I don't know how to speak because of much grammatical and syntax differences between my mother tongue and hindi. So, Indians in my class talk in hindi and think I don't know but in reality I know but am hiding the stuff|||India supported Nepal a lot and now these Nepali trying to think they are better than us wow.India should stop free aids immediately.No need to throw food at dog that bite it's own feeding hands|||What kind of delusion are some Nepalese living in?

You literally heard “ghar renovate bhairacha” and your smooth brain went: “Aww baby, aaile mero room ma aaija na, teacher lai ni bolau, ma ta class ma hunchu, disturb pani hudaina.” Bro you didn’t just hand over your room, you handed over your entire bed for their afternoon fuck-session like a 5-star hotel receptionist. You set the mood, locked the door from outside and paid the electricity bill while that randi was getting railed on your own pillow.  You’re not a “nice boyfriend”, you’re a walking doormat with Wi-Fi. The moment she said “home tuition” alarm bells should’ve rung, but no, timi ta “disturb nahos” bhanera uniharulai honeymoon suite diyau. Teacher le timro girlfriend ko “syllabus” cover gardai thiyo ani timi bahira “nice guy” badge polish gardai basyo.  You came home early and still had to play detective like some Bollywood hero, peeking through the window because your own room was locked from inside. Bro even Nepali serials don’t have this level of chutiya plot.  And the cherry on top? You threw the blankets and rugs instead of throwing hands. Blanket jalaunu parne thiyo, timi chai “winter aaucha, kasari sutne” bhanera Daraz ma fluffy white rug khojdai chau. Bro your girlfriend got piped on your bed and your biggest concern is staying warm?? Priority thik cha baba.  You didn’t just get cheated on, you got professionally scammed by a third-class tutor and a third-rate girlfriend. Block her, delete everything burn the mattress and never ever say “disturb nahos” to a girl again.  You’re not heartbroken, you’re brain-dead.

Here are a few from my side:  1. Does RSP view kulman's party as a threat to their voter base as there seems to be a significant overlap between RSP and Kulman’s supporters. Are there any discussions or considerations about forming a coalition with them or other emerging political forces? 2. Sumana leaving brought a lot of negative light on RSP, her exit made it seem like the party was becoming more of a “Rabi supporters’ club.” Has her departure brought any internal changes within the party, or has everything remained largely the same? 3. If an opportunity arises  where you can form a coalition government together with one of the old parties are you willing to take it, for example if UML and RSP together have the numbers to form a government, would you take that opportunity? Or would the party prefer to stay in opposition rather than partner with any of the traditional major parties?

In this context, what does RSP feels about new alternative forces that have emerged after the gen z Andolan? Do you see them as a threat since they too will be contesting for the same voter base? Any internal discussions going on to work with them?  I think a good percentage of people are confused and unsure about where RSP stands on many burning issues in Nepal which has pushed Nepal into instability time and again. I’m sure you know what I’m talking about. RSP seems to tip toe around those issues and avoid discussing it overtly.   Could we see RSP take a vocal stand on those issues and make their ideological stance clear before this election? Perhaps this would help RSP clarify its position to unsure but potential voters, and strengthen its presence in villages, small towns and far districts.|||Do you think the current FPTP voting system should be replaced by Instant-runoff / Alternative voting?

I get it Rabi ko party ho but when I/we voted to RSP, it wasn’t because of Rabi but rather the young people like Sumana, Toshima, Ganesh, Sobita who joined Rabi.   Swarnim Wagle isn’t the face of alternative politics. He went to media and started saying shit about Kulman when Kulman has just stayed silent about RSP-Kulman merger. What is that if not a media trial? He is just a sad Congress member who couldn’t get ticket due to bhauju so jumped ship to RSP. Why does he get more say in RSP ko internal matters than other young faces?  So my question again - why is RSP so Rabi centric? Why should we vote for RSP when the whole party philosophy revolves around Rabi? And when Rabi retires, there’s basically no one to lead because the party has been so focused on Rabi and doing media trial against other young leaders.|||What is RSP stance in privatizing Nepal Oil Corporation, Nepal Airlines, and other state owned companies?

Why not make Kulman Ghising as face of RSP and future PM.|||Why did you go in alliance with CPN-Maoist(formerly), if we look at politicians with big ambitions like Pierre Pollierrve(Canadian LoP currrently), the far-right of germany, the far right of France, all of them have chosen to not form an alliance with the one whom they claim they're fighting against. For example, Pierre Pollierve despite my hatred for him I can agree that he trruly opposed the policies and was there for a change which is why respecting the mandate in previous elections he chose not to form a gov despite having an opportunity to come in power via alliance with NDP, and Qubec. Why did you not stick with the principles and chose an alliance with the two heads whom Nepalese hate?  Second question, what's your party ideology, is it left wing or right wing? Based on following factors;Economics, Culture.  Third Question, the census data reveals that there's been 100% increase in the number of Christian population which clearly shows that our demographics is being destroyed, in the vietnam the missionaries have been converting the indegenous people to have a claim over the land, similar thing has happened with the Naga community of India, so its likely that Kiranti people are next, what will you do to stop this manipulative conversion, if you were in position of power?

I have some critical questions. I would be more than happy if Rabi reads these as well.  1.Why aren't you popular? ..at least upto your actual work?  Why are you guys in the shade while there's only talk of Rabi , Gagan, prasai , balen , sumana in the town. Your name is only taken collectively as \"a raswopa neta\". What are your biggest works and achievements as a member of parliament and rsp central member?  2.Why 45 lakhs signature for Rabi but 8.2 lakhs only voter id? Why can't I say that rsp prioritized a personality cult over connecting to new voters. Why is this not a catastrophic failure? Why did you guys fail to pressurize gov and commission to enable diaspora voting and even voter id registration from abroad. Nid was enabled for a brief period of time only. How can you guys exercise democracy with that slow and buggy registration process and 25 lakhs eligible citizens still unregistered?  3.Why is RSP scared to run elections independently on their own?Any plans to help gagan thapa win again?  4.Why is RSP vulnerable to propaganda by gagan thapa IT cell and 12 bhai fake news?  5.Why is rsp's communication and convincing skills so poor ? Couldn't onboard prominent figures and even chase Sumana away, how will you guarantee this doesn't deter similar newcomers again? I know it's important but is it that only the loyalist shall survive in rsp?   6. How many seats is the bibeksheel party contributing to the rsp in the upcoming election? Any projections? Or is it just a symbol?  7.Why is RSP not popular among genz , heavy backslash to Rabi and rsp being labeled as the same old parties, it being too person centric? Why do genz and youngsters hate political parties? What has rsp done and doing to make rsp popular among youngsters? Why is it so lost?   8.Why is RSP activities limited to Kathmandu valley and Chitwan only? I saw rsp doing some program recently AGAIN in chitwan instead of some new place. By being such limited to two districts how are you gonna secure the majority of seats across the country? Why are you preventing RSP from becoming big? We had hopes and still have some. Who's deciding all these?   9. Who's the youths face in rsp ? And how are they representing us? Where?   10. Why does RSP lack someone who's clear about his stance like what Mahesh basnet is for uml? Who's the spokesperson and why is he/she operating in a clinical and limited periphery.   11. Rabi Lamichhane publicly in a speech told that he lost many seats in 2079 election because he wasted his time trying to onboard popular faces instead of fostering new leadership and win more seats, but you guys seem to entertain this notion of onboarding popular faces more , forgetting the fact that you yourself aren't there due to popularity background. Why? Why can't you do something on your own rather than over-depending upon kulman or balen? I mean if you can't onboard them why waste an excessive amount of energy for that? Why such a weak mindset?  RSP central committee representatives feels incomplete and still need to cater many audiences, why don't you onboard brilliant and sharpest minds rather than just someone based on popularity or old connections? |||What are the things that you've done for Nepal?|||RSP stands for Rabi Swatantra Party?|||Remindme! 1 day|||Whats the ideology of rsp|||In reddit you are supposed to be anonymous sir.",

            "body": "So I was in Kathmandu for a week and was frequently using Indrive because I had to go fast, or you could say I was too lazy to catch a bus. I had to go to Gwarko (which was a new location for me), so I decided to use Indrive. The fare was way too high, so I dropped it down to a rate that I thought was okayiish. Smhow, I found a guy who accepted the proposed fare. He was an 18 yr old student living with his brother, doing +2/Indrive side by side with his Honda Shine. He’d only been doing it for 2 weeks because his brother had fractured his leg while riding for Indrive. Bro was so unfamiliar with the roads (as in, he didn’t know how to use G-Map and reach specific locations), and the old Honda Shine kept stalling itself in the middle of the road. After 30 minutes of riding, he said, Paisa pardaina, ma arko Indrive khojdinchu hajur ko lagi, but I insisted, Dhilo bhaye ni chalcha. He kept taking longer routes for shorter ones (I actually had fun, tho). After 1:30 hours, with traffic jams and his longer routes fetish, we somehow made it to the destination. I was the victim here, but I felt bad for the guy since he was new to the job, trying to be a responsible brother, and helping his brother out in need. Sometimes, it’s important to read the environment. You don’t really know what someone else is going through. I gave him an extra 100, and he thanked me four times lol.  Tldr:- Took an Indrive to Gwarko with a new rider, an 18 yr old student. The ride was chaotic, he didn’t know the roads, his bike kept stalling, and he took longer routes. After 1:30 hours, we finally reached the destination. I was the victim here, but felt bad for him since he was just trying to help his brother(injured). Gave him an extra 100, and he thanked me four times.",

Nothing will change even if we do. The same thing will happen to whatever new capital gets announced. Instead, we should focus on decentralization. Even though we technically have Pradesh Sarkar now, it is only in name. Everything is still Kathmandu-centric. Most colleges are in Kathmandu, hospitals are the same, job opportunities are the same, and even the main international airport is here, despite billions being spent on two other airports that turned out to be useless.  So yes, we should work on decentralization. Make other cities better too.

Dai got married to a girl(arranged marriage). Just two days after the wedding, the girl’s bf came to Dai’s house drunk. He cried in front of the house, created a scene and begged to return his gf. After half an hour of his tantrum, the girl also broke into tears and begged Dai to let her go with him. She too started showing tantrum. Being a gentleman, Dai let her go with him in the presence of the ward chairperson and police.  That Dai married her with her consent, and they had even talked for a few months before the marriage. I wish she and her boyfriend had thrown such tantrums at her parents’ house before the marriage, if it was forced.|||haha dhanna masu pulau khana chai bhyaechau.|||I think the bride didn't have the money to marry her bf so she arranged|||Marriage is scary☹️|||inspired by gen z revolution fata fat no time waste|||Kati lacs hawa mai gayo re??? tyo ta kt ko family or jo kta sanga gai tyo kta ko fam le behorna paryo ni; kasari hawa mai janxa? 10 charcha vako xa vane 12 aasulne ho|||i hate this meme format can't be that bad   me after reading : holy hell|||Hahahaha|||Hahahaha😂😭|||Suhagrat chai manayo ki manayena?🤣",

            "body": "TLDR; girl i have been speaking to for over a year is going around in reddit cheating on me behind my back.     I went to meet her a couple of days back, she and I have been speaking for a year now, we were thinking of being official soon as well. It was me, her and 2 more friends, it was a double date situation. she and another girl went to washroom and they were taking a while. i saw some notification popping up in her phone. i dont really use anyone's phone so i was not trying to check but the other friend started saying how he wants to check that notification since he does the same of his girl. i thought if it was from my parents maybe i should inform her so let me just glance at it. turns out it was a text of her from a guy in reddit. i scrolled slighty and found that they had been talking for like 4 days.  my heart sank when i saw that she was calling him daddy, baby and whatever. (mind you, she doesnt still know his name at this point,), she was making very sexual comments and this time, all of this was happening without the boy bringing it up. I scrolled a bit down, it was conversation from Sunday. That day when we were on call, she said she was not feeling well and wanted to sleep soon around 10, turns out she texted him at 10:10 saying \"i am super horny right now, send me your shirtless pic\", the boy does it, she follows up with \"send me your d\\*ck pic and i will send you my nudes.\" again the boy has done it. she follows up with \"i like how you look, lets meet up.\"  i was devastated. That time when i checked her phone, turns out the boy was texting her to meet this friday. she came back from washroom and i just informed her that she got a text, for the first time, she opened her phone while hiding it from me. she chose to angle the phone in such a way that i cant view it at all.  i asked if everything is ok, she asked did you see kasko text thiyo, i just said \"not really, I didnt check, is everything fine?\" she replies \"ahh sathi ko thiyo\"  and the more devastating thing here is the fact that there are multiple other DMs there, so dont think its her first time. But i see you now woman. i see what you want to do. During initial month of us talking, you went to every chats and DM i had to make sure i was not someone who would DM anyone or just hoeing around. Turns out, you are the one who is hoeing right now. I remember her talking about how her friend cheating was justified because everyone should have options, you tried to cover it saying that you werenot like that. but look at you now.   I know you are going to read this post since you are always active here. And so i say this to you, you are I are done. F\\*ck this shet. If you were open to me about not wanting me and looking to find new people, I would have been fine with it but going behind my back, its unacceptable.  Yours truly.",

I make $7500/m which equates to 10 lakh+ per month.   Land prices seem to have peaked.   Fixed Deposit gives peanut returns.   Gold is at all time high, so better not to put on gold right now.   Stock market is too weak and fragile of Nepal.   Buying and renting a house doesnt give much return.   3 crore house gives 2 lakh per month income in US, in Nepal 50k or less.   People know I make good money, they dont know how much exactly, so people solicit me to invest in their hotels, goat farms, poultry farm, which i dont trust them unless im actively involved.   I dont invest in US markets, 401k, S&P, indexes, I have it all but I want to invest in Nepal as I plan to live in Nepal forever.   I'm here in Kathmandu, with just cash in bank not knowing what would be the best use of it or where to invest properly so the wealth grows overtime.   I am not necessarily seeking risk free investments, I know every investment carries risk.   But I want to put you in my shoes to crowdsource opinion.   1. Where would you invest 1 crore a year disposable income?   2. If you're already a high income earner, where are you investing your money?   3. What areas or industries you think will do in the next 20 years.   Also, if you think im lying, just move on with other posts and keep the thread to people who are here to drop genuine opinions.",

But, now I am here, it makes sense🤣🤣.|||Every time I read post like this, I get very curious. And you keep adding more information in your comments, which don’t add up at all.   Only way you can do US job while in Nepal is if you are USC or GC holder (up to 6 months remote). Either way, job market in US is going downhill, why company will pay you extra if they can get same skill or better, lot cheaper by outsourcing your job. If their policy already allows doing their financial tasks from Nepal. I am sure there are tons of people dying to get those jobs in 1/4th of your pay.  Second, If you are USC, then forget about investing in Nepal, it will be really hard (from Nepal Gov side). And also, you will still pay all taxes in US, including federal, state (with some conditions and California is aggressive about that), social security and Medicare, which comes close to 25-30% depending on state.   Third, you keep saying you went to top 20 University here, which means you have spent fortune there unless you got majority as grants. Which means, either you are very smart or rich. In both case you are deeply vested here in US and there is no way you can forget all that and go back to Nepal. If you have enough wealth to pay top 20 Universities then why bother working late night, if you have received grants then you already saw greater opportunities in US.  Fourth, you said, you don’t invest in 401k, and you said your major is finance. A person with finance degree doesn’t want to invest free money they get from company? Most companies do 3 to 6% match, why you’ll leave money on the table? Especially you can choose if you want to invest it in volatile or stable options.  There are tons of red flags, which I can keep adding and make my comment longer but in short your own comments disagree with what you are saying.  Why I am writing this long comment? Coz you are disturbing fake dream to Nepali youths, trying to prove that life is so easy once you go abroad. Which is not. Where is your story about your struggle? How did you come to US? What did you do before you get financial job? How did you pay for your college? Is there any struggle your parents did to send you to one of the top 20 University?|||7 month agadi silver ma paisa haleko vaya ahile double hunthyo.

I told one of my friend to buy that trump meme coin, and dump it all the next day, he earned some good cash that time lol. That's just how it it, I would say the dip in crypto is pretty heart breaking though, but I would still do it if I had access like you. * **Franchising / Business Investments**: Invest in established franchises for a reliable income stream or use your capital to start a business in high-demand sectors like food or retail.  One question:   I too work in a US based company, it's good, but not as good as 10 Lakh per month, if you don't mind could you share what sector you work??

Also, what tech stack do you work with, and do you have any certifications? It would really help people in Nepal who want to follow a similar career path understand the roadmap. Any advice for someone here trying to enter your field?  Now, about your investment plans. Since you’re planning to settle in Nepal, here’s my honest suggestion based on the market situation.  This is actually a good time for Nepse. The market looks weak from the surface, but fundamentally many companies are undervalued. Elections seem to be approaching, and historically the market shows positive movement during election periods. My advice is not to invest your entire amount at once. Invest slowly in percentages and average your positions. Focus on companies with solid fundamentals and reliable dividends. Prioritize dividend stability first, then gradually move toward growth-oriented stocks.  Silver looks extremely strong long-term. EV production, semiconductors, and renewable energy manufacturing are driving global demand, and many countries are hoarding silver. In the next five to eight years, the price is expected to move significantly. Accumulating silver now could turn out to be one of the smartest decisions.  If I were in your position, I would place around ten lakh in each major sector of Nepse such as hydropower, banking, insurance, hotels, development banks, manufacturing, and others. Put ten lakh in gold but only after the price corrects. Put ten lakh in silver now. Ten lakh in bitcoin as a long-term hold, not for trading.  Instead of investing in random hotels or farms that people pitch to you, invest through investment companies. They handle multiple projects, spreading risk for you. Your stake remains lower but diversified, and you don’t have to be involved in day-to-day operations.  Hydropower promoter shares are still one of the best five-year opportunities in Nepal. Promoter-level investment can give returns in a one to five ratio depending on the project timeline and IPO stage. Investing a crore has the realistic potential to become several crores in a few years if chosen wisely.  You can also partner with serious investors, realtors, or investment companies. Pooling funds with others opens access to opportunities like land pooling, apartment developments, and commercial real estate projects that individuals cannot enter alone.  At the end of the day, money grows when deployed with patience and discipline. Nepal has a lot of noise and distractions, but if you diversify properly, invest gradually, and stick to fundamentals, you’ll outperform most people who follow hype.  May God give this kind of problem to all of us.|||oho rich kid. go on a world tour. money is temporary but memories are permanent|||invest in me pls|||Mutual funds do have average returns of 8-12%/year.|||Invest in education sector it's peak|||You can also invest in india if you want your choice, our stock market is booming, for example  LG electronics india just has the biggest ipo opening of 15 billion dollars on day one.|||u/SafetyPrestigious354  Wait why would you not invest in S&P or Roth or even 401k??

TLDR:- Random 60 ish y/o uncle asked me for help of busfare to get to his wife cremation at Pashupati. After i helped him he hugged me tight and that was my first ever hug in 18 years of my life.   This morning i was running late to catch bus to college, but i was stopped by a 60 ish looking uncle. And i stopped even tho i was running late, he said \"babu ma timlai yeauta kura sunauxu.....\" i thought he was one of those 'parmeshwor' ka chela and was trying to brush it off but i'm glad i listened everything.  He said that his wife died by suicide and that she drank poison. Then he continues to say, that his phone is dead (it actually was) and has no bus fare to travel to Pashupati for cremation so he asked me to help him 50rs.   Midway through i thought it was just a story to ask for money but his phone was actually dead and he was really sobbing, he even told me to keep his phone in exchange of the money.  But i didn't have any cash at that moment and only exact bus fare i needed to get to college and return. So i went to a nearby shop, bought happydent of 10rs and paid 60 from online and asked for 50 back. Which i gave it to that uncle.  He was sitting by roadside crying, while all this happened. I got to him and he got up and hugged me really tight. I hugged him back. And that was my first ever actual hug in my whole life😭 i had bad morning prior but that really lifted my mood up. I left him on busstop Then he really thanked me and fetched me goodbye while still sobbing. Made my whole day.  I really hope he's doing all okay now and may his wife rest in peace.",

So after my +2, my family started going full \"bihe gar, bihe gar\" mode. Every morning felt like a marriage proposal interview. I kept saying I wanted to study bachelor’s first, but nobody took me seriously. Typical Nepali parent combo attack.  Then one day, boom they tell me, “We found a good boy.” I hadn't even seen his face; they were like, “Ramro chhora ho.” Girl, I didn’t even know his name.  Fast-forward to the wedding day: Whole gaun dancing, kids running everywhere, DJ blasting Sani Nani. Everyone vibing except me, the bride, who’s just like “ what is happening.”  I finally saw my husband at mandap and yeah, he looked decent but BRO DIDN’T EVEN LOOK at me properly. I swear he stared at the floor more than my face.  Then suhagraat… I was in the room crying like an idiot because I was stressed and scared. But instead of comforting me, man walked in, looked shocked like he saw a ghost, and LEFT. NO WORDS. ZERO. ZILCH.  For the next few days, our communication level = Bluetooth off.  After that, he escaped to KTM faster than a last bench student during assembly. I thought maybe he’d text? Call? Smoke signal? ANYTHING? Nope. Silence.  Dashain time comes, he returns home. I tried walking near him; man literally walked behind us like we're bodyguards. Even then, no talking. I don’t think he even knew my name until his mom spilled it   And the chocolate incident… His sister gave me a packet, so I ate it (obviously). Later I found out it was for gifting the village kids. Bro looked at me like I ate their future   Months passed. Not a single conversation. I started avoiding him too because at this point it's just awkward both sides.  Then post-Dashain, he shows up at my maita to take me back. Whole family treating him like king jwai. He looked scared of the respect   My little sister tagged along with us, thank god, because otherwise we’d walk one hour in complete silence. My man STILL didn’t talk directly to me. He literally whispered to my sister, “Ask what didi wants to eat.” SIR??? HELLO??? I CAN HEAR YOU???  8 months married. 0 conversations. 0 eye contact. 0 progress.  We communicate through: • my sister • awkward glances • chowmein orders • pure telepathy failure  Anyway, idk what this relationship is but at this point we’re basically two NPCs living separately but married by system default 😭",

Kasto hola achamma chha j kura ni mazak lagne. Timro love naparos||| Husband’s POV:  I knew my parents were looking for a girl for me, but I didn’t think they’d actually find one. I thought I had at least 5–7 years to mentally prepare… apparently not.  One random Tuesday, Ama goes, “Babu, we found a girl for you.” I nearly dropped my phone. Girl? For ME? Why?  I saw one tiny photo of you for 0.3 seconds before my dad covered it like it was a government secret. I was like, “Wait— but— who—?” Too late. Wedding prep started.  Wedding Day  Everyone’s dancing, drinking, screaming, having the time of their lives. Meanwhile me = statue mode.  Then I saw you at the mandap.  My brain: “She’s… pretty.” Also my brain: “Don’t look. If you look she’ll know you exist.”  So yes, I stared at the floor like it owed me money. I was SO nervous I forgot how to blink.  Suhagraat  I walked into the room and saw you crying and my entire soul left my body.  I panicked so hard I thought I’d faint. My mind went: “What do I do?? Comfort??? Talk??? DIE???”  So I did the only thing my socially anxious caveman instincts allowed: I LEFT.  First Few Days  Every time I tried to say something, my throat said, “Haha no.” You looked as scared as I felt.  So… Bluetooth off.  Then I got sent to Kathmandu for work and honestly I was relieved because I had no idea how to function around you. I rehearsed texting you like 20 times but never sent anything. If silence was a sport, I was winning gold.  Dashain  I came home thinking, “Okay, this time I’ll talk.” Then I saw you.  Brain: buffering…  I wanted to walk next to you but I didn't want to be creepy or weird, so I walked behind. Like a bodyguard with performance issues.  Then the chocolate incident— I gave that packet to my sister to distribute to kids. When I saw you eating it I didn’t get mad— I got SCARED. Because I didn’t know if I should tell you or just pretend gifting chocolate to villagers was never my plan in life.  After Dashain  My parents forced me to go pick you up from your maita. I was SO nervous I practiced “Let’s go” in front of the mirror like 14 times.  Your family treated me like royalty and I had no idea how to respond except freeze.  Your little sister tagging along was the best thing ever because if it was just us two… That hour of walking would’ve sent me to the hospital.  I DID want to talk to you. Genuinely. But my voice refused to come out whenever I faced you directly.  That’s why I whispered through your sister. “Ask what didi wants to eat” = the bravest sentence I said that day.  Now  8 months married. I still haven’t had the courage to properly talk to you.  Not because I don’t like you— I actually really like you.  I’m just… Terrified. Awkward. Zero experience. And overwhelmed by the fact that I suddenly have a whole wife.  Every day I think: “Tomorrow, I’ll talk to her.” Then you walk into the room and my brain blue-screens.  So yes, we are two NPCs married by system auto-fill. But trust me— I’m trying.  My heart is ready. My mouth is not.|||I saw post from the husband side too 💔🥀|||Arrange marriage garxu vanne lai ta yo post le saato udayo ta|||I will post the DJ pov later.|||Xya yesto lamo kasle padhxa ho|||Yeutai manxey le made up scenario post garira cha yo ta.

Get the degree, get nmc and you are equivalent to Nepal MBBS. There is some sort of discrimination against fmg but if you are competent enough that should not affect you much.

Additionally, if I fully understand all the theory and concepts, but even after studying them, I still struggle with solving MCQs. It's been 4 months since I started studying for the 11th grade, yet even the old question papers,OLD IS GOLD feel tough, despite having studied the concepts.

            "body": "Namaste rNepal,  My name is Mahendra. I wanted to share an update about my father’s health and the situation my family is currently facing.  My father has been diagnosed with metastatic gallbladder cancer, which is a very aggressive form of cancer. Since the diagnosis, our days have been filled with hospital visits, tests, medicines and treatment plans. On 30 November, he completed another round of chemotherapy. He is fighting bravely, but the side effects and the emotional strain have been extremely difficult for him and for all of us.  we come from very lower middle class family but with a dream to make me engineer and a good human my dad put all his life and sacrificed everything. He worked as a security guard in india din vari ubhiyar kaam garnu vo , hamro sapna pura garna lai and  i still  wonder \"why us\" ? He never consumed alcohol,cigarette, tombakhu or anything that is said to cause cancer now when he is admitted at hospital the main head of the family and i have to lookafter all the expenses i understand why all it happen. the burden of money to manage for studies, run family and survive was really hard for us but he never show us. That dherai chintaa about managing money became the cause for the cancer ig , chintaa le ni cancer hudo raicha. My dad is now ,, he's a cancer patient god!! I was a guy learning and doing everything to pass exams nthg more than that and still use to feel sometime \"life kati garo cha yrr,, Yo sem  ma pass vaidiana and all,,  and suddenly life put me in a place where I had to become the pillar of the family. being student and not even earning it's being extremly hard for us.  I am doing everything possible  via writing, reaching out, asking for help — because I don't want to lose my father. He is still hopeful. He still smiles even on the hardest days.  We have already used all our savings and borrowed money to continue his treatment. The cost of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, scans, tests and medicines has become overwhelming for our family. With the help of kind people, we have managed to raise a little over NPR 3 Lakhs so far, which helped cover the initial cycles, but we still have many more ahead.  I am sharing this post to provide a clear and honest update about our situation. I am not asking anyone to do work on my behalf. Anyone who wishes to support us in any form may do so if they feel comfortable. Even reading this and keeping my father in your thoughts means a lot to us.

Cholangiocarcinoma aka gall bladder cancer. He was 3rd stage when we received the diagnosis. Fortunately, the treatments worked and he's in total remission. He's recovered and cancer free for 4th year running.   He had lesions best the duct, with initial spread to lymph nodes.   We got treatment at Nepal Cancer Research Hospital, Chemo and radiation. And surgery at Teaching Hospital.   I don't remember the exact chemo meds, the radiation was about 17 18 cycles and the surgery went decently well.   There is hope brother, the financial strain was absolutely tough. I don't know if you can it lucky or not but my old man was a civil servant and this was right during COVID-19. I was studying, so had free time and he also didn't have to go to work. Everyone was supportive. I guess we spent close to 15 20 lakhs over all, some of which were covered by insurance and some were donations collected by kins and friends.  So, don't lose hope man. And idk but I would like to suggest consulting Dr Sudip at NCHRC hattiban if you decide to continue here in Nepal since it worked in my case. And it's a specialized facility, and they have a lotta data and experience with this stuff. Also, state of the art equipment.|||I don’t know how you’ll take this advice, because most people only follow mainstream chemo treatment for cancer. But I’ve read many testimonies on X about treating cancer with protocol using ivermectin, fenbendazole and other medicines. Which in most cases treated completely 4th stage cancer after following through the medications for 6 months +. Just letting you know these aren’t that expensive medicines, may be available in Nepal as well if not they’re easily available in India. And can be taken parallel to the current treatment. Found this guy on X “Dr William Makis”. Just sharing what I came across, it’s upto you to make the judgement though. Do your own research. Best Wishes.|||Commenting for better reach and boost to this.. wishing for his speedy recovery 🙏|||Recently, my big sister passed away because of aml (acute myeloid leukemia). I know how hard it is to face all those problems at once and especially, if you are the only hope of the family handling everything.

Please please stay strong, that’s the main thing you have to do for your family.|||Thank you so much each and everyone feeling grayeful for the love and support you guys been providing thank you have now words to say... Thank you 🙏|||If only I wasn't jobless and broke.   Sorry, I could only afford a small amount.   Remember you need to be well enough as well and any other carers.

That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.  Growing up in Nepal, almost all TV channels were in Hindi. Indian serials and movies basically forced Hindi onto us. Now I’m choosing to learn Newari and other Nepali ethnic languages instead. I want to promote my own culture, not get mistaken as part of another country.  I don’t want foreigners thinking Nepal = India just because we speak Hindi in movies or daily life. We have our own languages, our own culture, our own identity.  Speaking English abroad and promoting our own languages at home feels like the right direction",

What really gets me is the fact them Indians start speaking in Hindi with fellow south Asians. I see that as them being arrogant and ignorant.|||Never reply in hindi always answer in English, tell them you can understand hindi but cannot speak.|||I tell them I understand but don’t speak. Also most of my Indian colleagues are South Indian and they don’t understand Hindi either.|||Why’d we speak a language we don’t even know well? Just because we can understand some of it, doesn’t mean we have learnt it in the right way. We’ve learnt Nepali and English since childhood and those are the only languages we feel confident in.|||Bro, why did you even start speaking hindi ????   Your language is your weapon. Since hindi is not your identity, you have a disadvantage. They look down on you if you speak their language with them. That’s literally saying: you are my master, i will follow you.   You will only be a sidekick on someone else’s story.   You have more control and power over your own language. You can say anything in Nepali and no one can correct you cus you are the native speaker. You are fluent and can express yourself better. That gives you the leverage to take a stand for yourself.   I am surprised, that you used to speak hindi man. You compromised your language for their convenience. Ofcourse they will treat you like their follower.   But i am glad you realised your mistake.|||Agree completely. I never entertain anyone who assumes I speak Hindi and doesn't see a difference between our cultures and languages. I never willingly consume Indian media and always try to give Nepali content more of my attention. I think it's high time we did something about the rampant encroachment of not just Indian but also Western culture into our collective psyche.|||Lived in the states for 18 yrs, never responded in Hindi. In fact, respond them with English, which for most Nepalese, is better in terms pronunciation than theirs.|||I have true blooded Nepali family (I am also true blooded Nepali myself) and they say it’s the same thing. I say why wouldn’t you speak Hindi to communicate with these guys and they say it’s an identity thing. We are not Hindi, we are Nepali. it’s like a kinda stand on business kinda thing. “we are not just an offshoot of India we are better” kinda thing, and I get it lol|||Well most Indians don't speak Hindi anyway. I live in Delhi and even I speak more English than Hindi. Anyway, like some guy here said language is just a medium of exchange. I doubt the people who are making you feel inferior will automatically stop doing so if you stop communicating in Hindi. You should search other remedies.|||Exactly.  Most Nepalis think it shows intelligence or something by speaking Hindi or broken hindi.  Speaking hindi as a Nepali is the best way to show that we are somehow part of India.   I have also seen firsthand that that some Indians will treat you shittier if you speak their language. Its not all indians, but there are too many.   Cmon people have some self respect. |||I've faced the same at an apple care Tokyo. Seeing us the technician request another to guide us. One indian man arrived with loud tone \"Kya Problem hai Bhaiya ?\". I said I don't understand Hindi can we communicate in English ? He went back and the previous technician came to guide us again. The problem with my iPad remain unsolved though.  But if somebody (Normally senior citizens) asks for help in Hindi, I help them with my broken hindi.|||Agreed. Indian haru Nepal ma aauda ni I talk to them in English. I am kinda confused as to why do Indians talk in Hindi in Nepal. I mean aafai aafai kura garda ta bhayo but tourist thau haru, mandir haru ma Indian aayera Hindi ma questions sodhda chai ma English mai reply dinchu.|||wtf even talk in hindi|||It's unfortunate you had that experience, but Hindi is the 3rd most spoken language in the world, right behind English and Mandarin.   To tell someone to stop speaking that language isn't going to fix the issue. You should be confident and talk to the people who make you feel this way that Hindi is not your native language and you can only converse in a limited way. Any person who insults you by considering you \"inferior\" is stupid and arrogant. You have to call them out on it.   Since you are in Canada, there are many people who speak French. And French is the 6th most spoken language in the world. If you can learn it and speak, that'd give you a boost in talking to more people. It doesn't always have to be English.   Language is just a medium to communicate. It doesn't belong to any particular nation or a group of people. Don't be afraid to speak out your thoughts.   In Nepal, if you can't speak English well, the people consider you illiterate. It doesn't matter how good you can speak Nepali or a native language.  It's the behaviour and expectations of people in language that's judged.|||this should be the way, mero bhutani sathi lai ni \"Hindi to ati hogi\" bhanchan everytime, i hate it.|||Bruh you need job application|||It’s been 10 years since I watched Indian movies or listened to hindi songs. I can’t even name a single post 2015 actor, singer or celebrity.

But having to know more than 1 language is always good.|||I don’t really hang around Indians that much and whenever I do I just say I don’t understand Hindi at all. Which forces them to talk to me in English. Also whenever I mention I’m Hindu they’re like we have the same religion and all. I like to tell them that even tho we have the same religion our practices are different and I am not familiar with their practices and beliefs. I just try to separate myself and our country from them as much as I can, cause we’re not the same. I don’t like those who try to be like them in terms of everything. Like please have your own identity.|||I went to an Indian Restaurant here in Finland. I was talking to the owner he asked me where are you from? I told him I’m from Nepal. He then said Toh Phir Hindi Bolo Na Ek Hi toh bhasa hai. I told him do you speak Nepali cuz I don’t speak Hindi.

If you ain't paying large bills or rent, you're just an irresponsible spender. 40-50K should be more than enough for an individual to sustain even with paying rent and bills. With your circumstances, you should be able to save atleast 20-25K a month even after spending A LOT.|||30k samma thikai ho. Fd ma rakhna suru gara money you can start as low as from 10k.

I mean I look after my parents and myself with that money in a month. How I wish I could be you.|||I'm sorry to say this but you're bad at managing money bro.   For a single life that does not have to pay rent and stuff, 40-50k is more than enough in kathmandu. I know things are getting expensive but even when you spend 1k per day, you'll spend 30k tops. Anything remaining is saved.   Start by keeping track of each one of your purchase/expense, even 5rs, and at the end of the month mark expenses that you feel were useless. Try to reduce those for a start and make this a habit.   Also try to limit yourself to a maximum you can spend each day. This might not work everyday, and say you spend 3k on a weekend day out. Try to cover it up in the next few days and spend less.   Another thing you can try is to invest regularly on something, like a SIP or CIT, or even stocks if you have knowledge in this|||Control on your expenses bro, 40K is crazy amount if you dont have to spend it in rent & family.   I came across a post few hours ago where a guy was sharing how he is in debt even tho he earns good amount and almost all of the comments were agreeing and accepting that its the same for them.   You are bad at managing expenses, escape it.   I make 2L+ and I spend no more than 20% of my earning each month (rent, family, food, travel, education).

None of the companies I’ve worked with ever asked about my educational title; only some uncreative Nepali companies did, and they couldn’t even afford my salary.  My 6 years of experience have taught me a lot. I’ve worked with foreign clients, accepted low pay in the beginning just to learn more, and over time those skills paid off. I was even offered a position at a major tech company in Nepal, but I chose to join an AI company with a bigger vision and at double the salary.

That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.

I agree.|||First thing I do is I ask them if they can speak English. It will hurt their little ego and they’ll switch immediately.|||You do you and I'll do me, I guess.    I spoke Hindi with a bunch of Bangladeshi tourists, because I don't understand Bangla, they don't understand Nepali, and they were more comfortable with Hindi than English.    I spoke Hindi with some Indian tourists because they were more comfortable with it than with English.    I continued to speak in English with an Indian visiting Nepal when I and a friend were interacting with him. The thing was, he switched code. I understood him and could have communicated well in Hindi with him, but my friend doesn't really understand Hindi, so I had to keep it in a language everyone understood, and I just told him I am not very good in Hindi.    I would happily speak Nepali in places like Darjeeling, where they speak Nepali, because I am most comfortable in it, and I know most people there would be more than comfortable in that. I assume that it is a comfort thing for them as well.  They're just more comfortable with Hindi than English, and I am accommodating, and fluent enough in Hindi, to extend the courtesy of speaking in their language.    I have come across Indians who look down on Nepal and Nepalis, and unfortunately, that attitude is more common among Indians than it should've been. It is not a pleasant experience, I admit. But, I refrain from putting all of them in a single box. I've met some wonderful Indians as well.   What I have to say is, we are individuals first, I, you, and anyone else, regardless of our nationality, or the languages we speak. Treat each individual on their merit, not their national identity. In fact, the shittiest person I've ever met is a fellow Nepali, and for obvious reasons—I live in Nepal.   The people who treated you bad were shitty people. The same attitude could very well be found in an Englishman, a Frenchman, or even a Nepali. That doesn't mean every Nepali, or Englishman, or Frenchman, is like that.    We are individuals first, in our lived experiences, not just a nationality, and in essence, expressions of existence, far greater than just a nationality. Treat people for who they are in that moment, not a label attached to them.    This is exactly the kind of subtle hate and/or prejudice I am against, whether it is based on lived experiences or influenced by rhetoric.   Use all the languages you know, as much as possible, I say. It is much better to open one's horizons than be insular. And no, I am not just a Nepali. My nationality is just one aspect of who I am, one which is more happenstance than chosen and curated with careful thought. So is yours, if you are actually willing to see it, along with anyone else's. |||Why were you speaking in Hindi in the first place instead of English.  Glad you found your self respect after a humiliating ritual. |||yes i agree. i mean totally agree. 100%  yes sir no nepali should be speaking in hindi in any situation ever.

I am from Nepal and I prefer English to communicate.|||Language is a powerful tool. I’m here in the US and I speak Spanish with folks who speak Spanish and obviously when there is a language barrier people will banter by saying things that can feel personal. Even greetings come down to culture like cunado (sala) in Nepali.  Most of our generation I am 27 years old watches anime Korean series and picks up words the same way we grew up with Hindi serials. It’s not about speaking Hindi being inappropriate but about the mindset and stigma attached to it. While speaking Japanese Spanish Korean Chinese or French gives you brownie points Hindi often doesn’t and that’s a failure in how Indian people and Hindi have been framed.  I relate to your concern and I have seen firsthand what you’re saying where it can make someone feel inferior and I believe that comes from perception not the language itself.  I say use language in your favor when you can. Draw your boundaries when needed and if something feels insulting say it clearly in English and they usually won’t repeat it. This applies to all languages.  Cheers!|||It’s always north Indians who start speaking Hindi after knowing I’m Nepali.

You can speak Hindi and still set boundaries if they treat you like shit. I don't see why speaking any other language will make you inferior. I did my Bachelors in India and never had a problem putting people in their places in their own language. I think uneducated illiterate and entitled people are everywhere including India and Nepal, I have had similar experiences with different ethnic communities within Nepal. I actually have problems speaking to Nepali people in Australia as they'll cross every boundary and think I'm liable for them just because we're from the same country.. Its a regional issue.  I watched a interview of Sonam Wangchuk in Nepal and he speaks Nepali throughout the interview. I think as reasonable people we should use whatever language we want depending on the circumstances. Having Hindi in our language arsenal is honestly a superpower as we get access to soo much resources and forms of art that otherwise we wouldn't have been exposed to and as someone from Nepal where we already have a lack of such resources, I'd be sad if I hadn't known Hindi.  So, maybe lets practice putting people in their places if they behave rudely to us and not blame the language. I have many friends from India who I am very close with and many that I had to tell them to show their entitlement elsewhere. It can be the same with English very soon with sentiments of immigration shifting alot and will be with Nepali within Nepal as well.

They are too busy with their own lives and the immediate world around them to specifically think anything about Nepal. India is a country of 1.3 billion people. And even in India, many people don't speak Hindi. Yeah, many in older generation are more racist, but they are racist to each other too. Many people fight over language in different Indian states, and discriminate with people of different states. But as I said, there are 1.3 billion people and a large majority will be as friendly to Nepali people. No, they don't think of Nepal as their little bro, but if asked, would actually hold some affinity towards Nepal in comparison to what they think of other nations.  Feel free to learn Hindi, feel free to forget, it's every one's personal choice. I honestly almost never need to learn it, but I like Nepali songs so much that I'm picking up on Nepali words now. (Kasari Bhanu, Bardali, Sarangi, Timi ra ma are among my favourite)  Lastly, this sub is quite Anti Indian, just saying,  generalizing India and Indians is ridiculous as the population is much more than most people can think of.

I’m guessing you’re a man, because Nepalese men constantly put themselves in an inferior position, always with the “bhai, bhai” nonsense. That alone tells people how to treat you. I’m a 22-year-old woman in Canada, and there are two other Nepalese girls where I work. We carry ourselves with confidence. Our Indian manager can’t talk down to us, and neither can any coworker. But the Nepalese guys? They’re always talked down to like kids. They’re 27 and 28 years old and still get called “sala Nepali.” That never happens to us and it’s not a coincidence. We have more filipino co workers than Indians but they always hangout with Indians and say sh like , “ chalo bhai daru pitey hai aj “ in worse hindi accent possible.  This has nothing to do with language. It’s about presence. It’s about how you carry yourself. When you look unsure, dress badly, and act small, people treat you that way. Respect isn’t begged for , it’s taken.|||Guys why so much hatred for India.. I'm unable to understand...saw three post of similar kind..we indians treat or consider Nepalis as our brothers..what has happened to Nepal...we don't have any issues rather connected through religion, culture and tourism too... it's perfectly fine to save ur indigenous culture and languages but there should be no hate ...|||I agree. As a Bangladeshi growing up i also learned hindi. After coming aboard I realised whenever i spoke hindi with Indian they started behaving differently. Then I completely stopped talking in hindi and still continue to do so. I only speak hindi to my close Indian friend and no one else.   Also from my experiences I don’t consider people from punjab indian. They’re very different and welcoming people. I love them. Also i have friends from south india and they literally hate hindi or never tells they’re from india. If you ask them where are they from, they will tell the name of the state|||learn sanskrit the civilizational language of all the hindus, buddhists and even kirants. And even I faced such situation where I was in Hong Kong intl airport and an Indian lady mistook me for an Indian and started conversation in hindi(she was one of the staff members), so I tried correcting her and said that I'm from Nepal my blood boiled when she said that which is why I'm talking to you in Hindi(LOL, how did this sterotype of Nepalese knowing hindi develop) which is why I said I don't know. And Have deicided to tell everyone that I can understand Hindi(little little) but I don't know how to speak because of much grammatical and syntax differences between my mother tongue and hindi. So, Indians in my class talk in hindi and think I don't know but in reality I know but am hiding the stuff|||India supported Nepal a lot and now these Nepali trying to think they are better than us wow.India should stop free aids immediately.No need to throw food at dog that bite it's own feeding hands|||What kind of delusion are some Nepalese living in? It's laughable. Nobody even gives a shit about Nepal anyway. If not for Himalayas, you're just a meal for China to eat. What can you expect from the lowest-IQ people on earth, living in delusion, thinking the world gives a shit about them?",

I would be all day in my classes as well so disturb ni hunthena(she has morning classes I have day classes)  So for few hours a day, she was getting tuition from the teacher in my room. Or so I thought. Ekdin chai mero classes haru chito sakkiyo and I went home about an hour early. Room jada it was locked from the inside so I thought bahira bata noise aayera room lock gareko hola bhanera. Tei ni I got curious and went around the window to see what was going on.  My gf was on her my bed with her teacher cuddling inside the blankets and what not like wtfff bhaira ma ta. I couldn't believe my eyes I thought I was having a nightmare. I got really furious, told her to open the door and we had a huge fight I was really heartbroken. Riss ma aayera I threw the damn blankets, comforter, duvet, even the rug.

You are the biggest fucking cuck Nepal has ever produced, bar none.  You literally heard “ghar renovate bhairacha” and your smooth brain went: “Aww baby, aaile mero room ma aaija na, teacher lai ni bolau, ma ta class ma hunchu, disturb pani hudaina.” Bro you didn’t just hand over your room, you handed over your entire bed for their afternoon fuck-session like a 5-star hotel receptionist. You set the mood, locked the door from outside and paid the electricity bill while that randi was getting railed on your own pillow.  You’re not a “nice boyfriend”, you’re a walking doormat with Wi-Fi. The moment she said “home tuition” alarm bells should’ve rung, but no, timi ta “disturb nahos” bhanera uniharulai honeymoon suite diyau. Teacher le timro girlfriend ko “syllabus” cover gardai thiyo ani timi bahira “nice guy” badge polish gardai basyo.  You came home early and still had to play detective like some Bollywood hero, peeking through the window because your own room was locked from inside. Bro even Nepali serials don’t have this level of chutiya plot.  And the cherry on top? You threw the blankets and rugs instead of throwing hands. Blanket jalaunu parne thiyo, timi chai “winter aaucha, kasari sutne” bhanera Daraz ma fluffy white rug khojdai chau. Bro your girlfriend got piped on your bed and your biggest concern is staying warm?? Priority thik cha baba.  You didn’t just get cheated on, you got professionally scammed by a third-class tutor and a third-rate girlfriend. Block her, delete everything burn the mattress and never ever say “disturb nahos” to a girl again.  You’re not heartbroken, you’re brain-dead. Wake the fuck up king, your crown’s on fire and you’re still asking for new rugs. 😂😂😂|||Japa hari ram lai Maya jaal ma nabhula|||Bhina bhina k padhnu parxa go to jamal bajar teha pauxa babbal blankets|||7/10 rage bait.

I wanted to take a moment to share something from the heart, especially for the Gen Z community here. I’m not here to lecture, judge, or pretend that I “know better.” In fact, it’s the opposite—I’m here because I genuinely admire a lot about Gen Z, and I’d love to learn from you if you’re open to talking or sharing your perspectives.  What I really respect about your generation is the honesty. The courage to say things out loud that older generations kept buried. The way you call out what doesn’t feel right, whether it’s in society, culture, work, or even in yourselves. The world is changing fast, and you all seem to face it with a unique blend of humor, vulnerability, and resilience. And honestly, that’s inspiring.  I’m not perfect, and I don’t pretend to fully understand everything about today’s trends, language, mindset, or struggles. But I’m here with an open mind. If any Gen Z member is willing to talk—to enlighten me, challenge me, laugh with me, or even correct me—I’d sincerely appreciate it.  I’m reaching out with respect and humility. I’m here to listen, not impose. Thank you to anyone who takes a moment to respond. 🙏🏽|||yesto sanskar vaka le kasto desh banauxan hola?

Here are a few from my side:  1. Does RSP view kulman's party as a threat to their voter base as there seems to be a significant overlap between RSP and Kulman’s supporters. Are there any discussions or considerations about forming a coalition with them or other emerging political forces? 2. Sumana leaving brought a lot of negative light on RSP, her exit made it seem like the party was becoming more of a “Rabi supporters’ club.” Has her departure brought any internal changes within the party, or has everything remained largely the same? 3. If an opportunity arises  where you can form a coalition government together with one of the old parties are you willing to take it, for example if UML and RSP together have the numbers to form a government, would you take that opportunity? Or would the party prefer to stay in opposition rather than partner with any of the traditional major parties?

In this context, what does RSP feels about new alternative forces that have emerged after the gen z Andolan? Do you see them as a threat since they too will be contesting for the same voter base? Any internal discussions going on to work with them?  I think a good percentage of people are confused and unsure about where RSP stands on many burning issues in Nepal which has pushed Nepal into instability time and again. I’m sure you know what I’m talking about. RSP seems to tip toe around those issues and avoid discussing it overtly.   Could we see RSP take a vocal stand on those issues and make their ideological stance clear before this election? Perhaps this would help RSP clarify its position to unsure but potential voters, and strengthen its presence in villages, small towns and far districts.|||Do you think the current FPTP voting system should be replaced by Instant-runoff / Alternative voting?

I get it Rabi ko party ho but when I/we voted to RSP, it wasn’t because of Rabi but rather the young people like Sumana, Toshima, Ganesh, Sobita who joined Rabi.   Swarnim Wagle isn’t the face of alternative politics. He went to media and started saying shit about Kulman when Kulman has just stayed silent about RSP-Kulman merger. What is that if not a media trial? He is just a sad Congress member who couldn’t get ticket due to bhauju so jumped ship to RSP. Why does he get more say in RSP ko internal matters than other young faces?  So my question again - why is RSP so Rabi centric? Why should we vote for RSP when the whole party philosophy revolves around Rabi? And when Rabi retires, there’s basically no one to lead because the party has been so focused on Rabi and doing media trial against other young leaders.|||What is RSP stance in privatizing Nepal Oil Corporation, Nepal Airlines, and other state owned companies?

Why not make Kulman Ghising as face of RSP and future PM.|||Why did you go in alliance with CPN-Maoist(formerly), if we look at politicians with big ambitions like Pierre Pollierrve(Canadian LoP currrently), the far-right of germany, the far right of France, all of them have chosen to not form an alliance with the one whom they claim they're fighting against. For example, Pierre Pollierve despite my hatred for him I can agree that he trruly opposed the policies and was there for a change which is why respecting the mandate in previous elections he chose not to form a gov despite having an opportunity to come in power via alliance with NDP, and Qubec. Why did you not stick with the principles and chose an alliance with the two heads whom Nepalese hate?  Second question, what's your party ideology, is it left wing or right wing? Based on following factors;Economics, Culture.  Third Question, the census data reveals that there's been 100% increase in the number of Christian population which clearly shows that our demographics is being destroyed, in the vietnam the missionaries have been converting the indegenous people to have a claim over the land, similar thing has happened with the Naga community of India, so its likely that Kiranti people are next, what will you do to stop this manipulative conversion, if you were in position of power?

I have some critical questions. I would be more than happy if Rabi reads these as well.  1.Why aren't you popular? ..at least upto your actual work?  Why are you guys in the shade while there's only talk of Rabi , Gagan, prasai , balen , sumana in the town. Your name is only taken collectively as \"a raswopa neta\". What are your biggest works and achievements as a member of parliament and rsp central member?  2.Why 45 lakhs signature for Rabi but 8.2 lakhs only voter id? Why can't I say that rsp prioritized a personality cult over connecting to new voters. Why is this not a catastrophic failure? Why did you guys fail to pressurize gov and commission to enable diaspora voting and even voter id registration from abroad. Nid was enabled for a brief period of time only. How can you guys exercise democracy with that slow and buggy registration process and 25 lakhs eligible citizens still unregistered?  3.Why is RSP scared to run elections independently on their own?Any plans to help gagan thapa win again?  4.Why is RSP vulnerable to propaganda by gagan thapa IT cell and 12 bhai fake news?  5.Why is rsp's communication and convincing skills so poor ? Couldn't onboard prominent figures and even chase Sumana away, how will you guarantee this doesn't deter similar newcomers again? I know it's important but is it that only the loyalist shall survive in rsp?   6. How many seats is the bibeksheel party contributing to the rsp in the upcoming election? Any projections? Or is it just a symbol?  7.Why is RSP not popular among genz , heavy backslash to Rabi and rsp being labeled as the same old parties, it being too person centric? Why do genz and youngsters hate political parties? What has rsp done and doing to make rsp popular among youngsters? Why is it so lost?   8.Why is RSP activities limited to Kathmandu valley and Chitwan only? I saw rsp doing some program recently AGAIN in chitwan instead of some new place. By being such limited to two districts how are you gonna secure the majority of seats across the country? Why are you preventing RSP from becoming big? We had hopes and still have some. Who's deciding all these?   9. Who's the youths face in rsp ? And how are they representing us? Where?   10. Why does RSP lack someone who's clear about his stance like what Mahesh basnet is for uml? Who's the spokesperson and why is he/she operating in a clinical and limited periphery.   11. Rabi Lamichhane publicly in a speech told that he lost many seats in 2079 election because he wasted his time trying to onboard popular faces instead of fostering new leadership and win more seats, but you guys seem to entertain this notion of onboarding popular faces more , forgetting the fact that you yourself aren't there due to popularity background. Why? Why can't you do something on your own rather than over-depending upon kulman or balen? I mean if you can't onboard them why waste an excessive amount of energy for that? Why such a weak mindset?  RSP central committee representatives feels incomplete and still need to cater many audiences, why don't you onboard brilliant and sharpest minds rather than just someone based on popularity or old connections? |||What are the things that you've done for Nepal?|||RSP stands for Rabi Swatantra Party?|||Remindme! 1 day|||Whats the ideology of rsp|||In reddit you are supposed to be anonymous sir.",

Muslims of Nepal posted about their happiness when Taliban came back to power, they side with muslims be it anywhere in the world, buddhist burmese vs rohingya muslims they will take sides with muslims, indian hindus va muslims, they will pick muslims, syrian Christians vw muslimw they will pick muslims and so on… When Palestinians atatcked israel , Many musims living in Nepal celebrated it but then they never condemned the murders of 11 innocent Nepali citizens by Hamas.  They will always make reasons like we are Nepali muslims and we are different but their genetics, history is the same as that of Indian muslims as majority of musilmw living in Nepal migrated from Kashmir, UP, Bihar and Bangladesh .  For Muslims, religion comes first before nationality. Many groups within nepal have differences between them but for them the nation comes first, you will see a hindu nepali protesting against India and Buddhist protesting about illegal citizenship to Tibetan refugees. But a muslim will never say anything about illegal migration of Rohingyas .   Also, these people are real fanatics and radicals . ApM ssaid something that’s true, many arab nations don’t provide equal opportunities to women. Saudi just maid it legal for women yo obtain driver’s licenses just a year ago, many of the women can’t travel alone, islam allows mens to have multiple wives but why isn’t the same applied towards women?  Also, PM mentioned that in the past muslims women in muslims nation faced far much difficulties and there was no reason to be triggered about it.  They literally made movies about Sati practices withng some community but no one came put to protest against the release, had it been something about muslims they will flood the streets .  At the end, its upto nepali to believe that muslims of Nepal are different from rest of south asian muslims. I wonder when most of the madarsas, mosques have bangaldeshi, paksitani imams and scholars how will the teachings be any different?   I thank the Muslims tho, atleast bheda nepali got to see a hint of what’s to come when muslims make up a considerable percentage of the demographics.|||\"Ashamed of nothing, offended by everything \" community for a reason|||She ciritcized Hindus too.

He is fighting bravely, but the side effects and the emotional strain have been extremely difficult for him and for all of us.  we come from very lower middle class family but with a dream to make me engineer and a good human my dad put all his life and sacrificed everything. He worked as a security guard in india din vari ubhiyar kaam garnu vo , hamro sapna pura garna lai and  i still  wonder \"why us\" ?

I am doing everything possible  via writing, reaching out, asking for help — because I don't want to lose my father. He is still hopeful. He still smiles even on the hardest days.  We have already used all our savings and borrowed money to continue his treatment. The cost of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, scans, tests and medicines has become overwhelming for our family. With the help of kind people, we have managed to raise a little over NPR 3 Lakhs so far, which helped cover the initial cycles, but we still have many more ahead.  I am sharing this post to provide a clear and honest update about our situation. I am not asking anyone to do work on my behalf. Anyone who wishes to support us in any form may do so if they feel comfortable. Even reading this and keeping my father in your thoughts means a lot to us.

Cholangiocarcinoma aka gall bladder cancer. He was 3rd stage when we received the diagnosis. Fortunately, the treatments worked and he's in total remission. He's recovered and cancer free for 4th year running.   He had lesions best the duct, with initial spread to lymph nodes.   We got treatment at Nepal Cancer Research Hospital, Chemo and radiation. And surgery at Teaching Hospital.   I don't remember the exact chemo meds, the radiation was about 17 18 cycles and the surgery went decently well.   There is hope brother, the financial strain was absolutely tough. I don't know if you can it lucky or not but my old man was a civil servant and this was right during COVID-19. I was studying, so had free time and he also didn't have to go to work. Everyone was supportive. I guess we spent close to 15 20 lakhs over all, some of which were covered by insurance and some were donations collected by kins and friends.  So, don't lose hope man. And idk but I would like to suggest consulting Dr Sudip at NCHRC hattiban if you decide to continue here in Nepal since it worked in my case. And it's a specialized facility, and they have a lotta data and experience with this stuff. Also, state of the art equipment.|||I don’t know how you’ll take this advice, because most people only follow mainstream chemo treatment for cancer. But I’ve read many testimonies on X about treating cancer with protocol using ivermectin, fenbendazole and other medicines. Which in most cases treated completely 4th stage cancer after following through the medications for 6 months +. Just letting you know these aren’t that expensive medicines, may be available in Nepal as well if not they’re easily available in India. And can be taken parallel to the current treatment. Found this guy on X “Dr William Makis”. Just sharing what I came across, it’s upto you to make the judgement though. Do your own research. Best Wishes.|||Commenting for better reach and boost to this.. wishing for his speedy recovery 🙏|||Recently, my big sister passed away because of aml (acute myeloid leukemia).

And being north of these countries, well , you get plenty of emissions carried by the wind which dissipates in our mountain ranges.

Also most of my Indian colleagues are South Indian and they don’t understand Hindi either.|||Why’d we speak a language we don’t even know well? Just because we can understand some of it, doesn’t mean we have learnt it in the right way. We’ve learnt Nepali and English since childhood and those are the only languages we feel confident in.|||Bro, why did you even start speaking hindi ????   Your language is your weapon. Since hindi is not your identity, you have a disadvantage. They look down on you if you speak their language with them. That’s literally saying: you are my master, i will follow you.   You will only be a sidekick on someone else’s story.   You have more control and power over your own language. You can say anything in Nepali and no one can correct you cus you are the native speaker. You are fluent and can express yourself better. That gives you the leverage to take a stand for yourself.   I am surprised, that you used to speak hindi man. You compromised your language for their convenience. Ofcourse they will treat you like their follower.   But i am glad you realised your mistake.|||Agree completely. I never entertain anyone who assumes I speak Hindi and doesn't see a difference between our cultures and languages. I never willingly consume Indian media and always try to give Nepali content more of my attention. I think it's high time we did something about the rampant encroachment of not just Indian but also Western culture into our collective psyche.|||Lived in the states for 18 yrs, never responded in Hindi. In fact, respond them with English, which for most Nepalese, is better in terms pronunciation than theirs.|||I have true blooded Nepali family (I am also true blooded Nepali myself) and they say it’s the same thing.

I live in Delhi and even I speak more English than Hindi. Anyway, like some guy here said language is just a medium of exchange. I doubt the people who are making you feel inferior will automatically stop doing so if you stop communicating in Hindi. You should search other remedies.|||Exactly.  Most Nepalis think it shows intelligence or something by speaking Hindi or broken hindi.  Speaking hindi as a Nepali is the best way to show that we are somehow part of India.   I have also seen firsthand that that some Indians will treat you shittier if you speak their language. Its not all indians, but there are too many.   Cmon people have some self respect. |||I've faced the same at an apple care Tokyo. Seeing us the technician request another to guide us. One indian man arrived with loud tone \"Kya Problem hai Bhaiya ?\". I said I don't understand Hindi can we communicate in English ? He went back and the previous technician came to guide us again. The problem with my iPad remain unsolved though.  But if somebody (Normally senior citizens) asks for help in Hindi, I help them with my broken hindi.|||Agreed.

I mean aafai aafai kura garda ta bhayo but tourist thau haru, mandir haru ma Indian aayera Hindi ma questions sodhda chai ma English mai reply dinchu.|||wtf even talk in hindi|||It's unfortunate you had that experience, but Hindi is the 3rd most spoken language in the world, right behind English and Mandarin.   To tell someone to stop speaking that language isn't going to fix the issue. You should be confident and talk to the people who make you feel this way that Hindi is not your native language and you can only converse in a limited way. Any person who insults you by considering you \"inferior\" is stupid and arrogant. You have to call them out on it.   Since you are in Canada, there are many people who speak French. And French is the 6th most spoken language in the world. If you can learn it and speak, that'd give you a boost in talking to more people. It doesn't always have to be English.   Language is just a medium to communicate. It doesn't belong to any particular nation or a group of people. Don't be afraid to speak out your thoughts.   In Nepal, if you can't speak English well, the people consider you illiterate. It doesn't matter how good you can speak Nepali or a native language.  It's the behaviour and expectations of people in language that's judged.|||this should be the way, mero bhutani sathi lai ni \"Hindi to ati hogi\" bhanchan everytime, i hate it.|||Bruh you need job application|||It’s been 10 years since I watched Indian movies or listened to hindi songs.

Hell with these Indians.|||If we look at the Fact,  Nepali language is derived from Hindi and Urdu. We use same devnagiri script. Whereas many local languages are marginalised.|||Whenever I’ve switched from English and then spoken to someone in Hindi, I’ve felt a commonness and even respect. Being tri-lingual is a skill, not a downgrade.   I go to small family owned grocery store, I greet them in Hindi and they say namastey, and my usual the liquor store guy asks me how I’ve been doing and gives me discount.   Language was invented by humans to make connections. Rather than saying dont speak a particular language, maybe saying something about how to develop relationships would have been better.|||I speak Hindi to my Nepali family for fun. but with exaggeration|||This post and the comments just reek of inferiority complex.|||bakchodi band 2 chicken plate momo laga or pyaaz rakh dio thode se",

Same civilization, same geography same economy. A border got created a few hundred years back doesn't make us special, if anything this attitude is the problem.  In winter the cold air keeps pollution trapped, neither blowing away nor washing down. Everything contributes here - India contributes according to its size and population, and so does Nepal. We can't even manage the few thousands of vehicles we have in Nepal. If we could at least stop the black smoke gushing from exhausts in Kathmandu maybe we could act noble, but we can't even do that due to corruption. So with what moral superiority can we look down on the chaos in India? We could act superior if we weren't dependent on the same polluting industries and agriculture of India. We depend without limits upon food grains, vegetables, medicines, fuel, vehicles, appliances that same polluting India creates. Just because your mom or wife is in a smoky kitchen doesn't mean you can act smug and call them polluters while you are still eating the food they cooked.

Awareness 2. Bans, stronger rules 3. Traffic police checks  What has worked and what will work is pricing. Get rid of rules that promote cartelling and let capitalism solve the issue.   If you had the choice to pay 20 rupees more but travel with slightly more comfort, and with a nice seat, maybe 30-40% of people would be willing to pay, which in result means more businesses willing to invest in public transport as they seek profit, more competition, better services. Those who offer neither good service nor good pricing then deserve go out of business.  This weird government backed cartelling with fixed artifical prices will never work.|||We should implement a metro-style system for local transport in Kathmandu. Currently many buses operate within the ring road but cannot travel beyond it due to narrow and congested lanes. Even when they do it only results in traffic jams.  What if we introduced autos in the valley that follow the same routes as local transport and carry 3–4 passengers per ride? Buses and vans could be restricted to the ring road and every bus stop along the ring road could have designated autos and rickshaws to drop passengers to their destinations at the same fare.  If implemented all the microbuses and hiaces could be replaced with standard buses which would likely cause less congestion than the current smaller vehicles.|||The metropolitan and the yatayat syndicate are the problems. There should be a limit on the number of passengers each vehicle can carry. For large buses, it should not be more than 110% of the number of seats. And for microbuses, it should not be more than 100% of the seating capacity. The limit rule should be enforced by the traffic police.   It's a systemic problem and requires a systemic solution.|||Nepal yatayat ma gundruk khade vanda namajale khadiyeko yaad ayo|||nonchalant khalasi dai|||Ajhai 3 Jana atne thau cha.|||Khalasi be like pachadi sarnus na tetro khali cha|||aghii pakhai ho ni..khalashi haru huncha micro ra yatayaat ko bhadaa karcha.

The land already belongs to a government body, in this case, TU, it made things easy.  But elsewhere in larger projects, main reason this is difficult is because of people. For example, the nagdhunga project was stalled for 6 months because of local demands of alternative water supply, compensation money, jobs for the locals, etc. Without this, it would have already been completed last year.  Now, significant amount of taxpayer money in infrastructure projects are spent in land acquisition. The only way for Nepal to develop fast is i. stop people needlessly stopping projects and either ii. significant land reform, or complete land price collapse and people to stop seeing land as investment.|||This was a dream for cricket fan like me!!

            "body": "People I’ve known for 24 years turned out to be completely different when it comes to caste.  Today I was invited to my friend’s house for lunch. She recently had a baby, so I was genuinely happy to visit her and meet her newborn. I was meeting her in person after 2 years.  We cooked together, washed the dishes, gossiped a lot, and I came home with a full heart.  Then at the dinner table, my parents asked what caste she is. I told them… and they immediately started talking about caste differences and how I shouldn’t visit her house for meals, and how she shouldn’t come to ours. Hearing them talk about her caste that way absolutely broke my heart. I couldn’t control my tears, and my mom said, “kina yesto chitta dukhako. Pitri farak farak hunxa, manxe yeutai matra vayerw hunna. Hamlai ni aaru le yesto garxan, hamle ni garnu parxa. Paxi tha pauxau, etc etc.”  We never had serious caste conversations before. In fact, I remember them teaching us that these things shouldn’t exist, that we’re all equal. And they’ve never shown this kind of behavior toward others who visit our home or toward our tenants who are the same caste as my friend? I'm confused and upset with this interaction with my parents.",

Our parents grew up in a time where extreme casteism was normal. They didn’t create it, but they were raised inside that system, taught to follow it, and warned about the consequences of not doing so. Education shapes the mind, and the education they received reinforced these beliefs regardless of religion, culture, or society. So they’re not entirely wrong, and we’re not entirely right either.  The real problem is that we often fail to understand the environment they grew up in and the fears they carried. Instead of trying to see their side, we sometimes blame them or play the victim because it’s the easier option. But change takes understanding from both generations—not just criticism. 🙏|||This will just go with this generation or maybe next or next but you just forget what they said and forget about the cast system as well and just focus on people's behavior and if nobody talks about it next generation is not even going to know such a thing and it will just go away. But if we keep saying we're all equal frequently children are going to think they are saying this because  we're all not equal. Indirectly they'll learn that cast is a big deal. that's my point of view. And forget my English as well ☺|||This is really heartbreaking. It’s painful when people who taught us about equality show a different side. Caste ideas came through shared history and influence from India, but we don’t have to carry them forward.

He was waiting for RSP meeting held in chitwan of central committee and when it was certain that none of them wants him as a president before Rabi either gets convicted of charges from court or finish his two tenure if not found guilty, then why won’t he accept any other role? Rabi and other made the RSP  from dust and he wants a free dinner with zero contribution. I cannot see any other reason other then his aim to bring destabilization in party and finally end this party as Ganesh kakrki revealed that in one recent interviews which also aligns with Balen too plans.  Why they desperately wants to end RSP just like congress and yemale has been trying so far?? Everyone is demanding to form coalition between RSP, Kulman and Balen to get more seats and can justice be given to family of martyrs. Why they are putting their ego first before country interest ??

His work is visible, but he is corrupt.  Balen is the only person whom I can say with confidence is not corrupt, yet. But he is no politician, and I don't think he will ever be. It is also very hard for him to open party with individual who is not involved in any scandal, and keep his non-corrupt image intact.  Rabi has his own problems. However, he is the only person at the moment who is a politician, and not involved with old goons. Only his party could have defeated the old goons, but since he is in jail, RSP will not get majority seats this time.  So, the new alternative forces combined will still not have majority in present scenario. Only way the alternative forces can have majority is if Balen and Kulman would have join RSP with Rabi still as head of RSP. But this scenario was simply not possible from start. Balen cannot associate himself with people with scandals, and Kulman is not really an alternative force, but rather the produce of the old goons who is not as bad as the old goons.|||Chup machikney tyo purano vanda yei thiq , reddit ma aayera na vuk|||One thing I will suggest if new party is contesting In some constituency just don't contest in that area.

After plugging in the charger, the laptop didn’t respond at all for hours.  Assuming the charger was faulty, I took it to the Mudita service center. Later, they informed me that the **motherboard was damaged (“shot”)** and needed to be replaced, costing **about 60% of the laptop’s original price**. To make things worse, the laptop had just exceeded its 12 month warranty by around one month, so they refused to cover the repair under warranty.  It feels extremely strange and concerning that a motherboard or CPU would get damaged simply while charging normally. If there had been a high-voltage surge, then **all devices connected at the same time should have been affected**, including my colleagues’ laptops and chargers — but none of them faced any issue.  For a device to fail like this right after warranty expiry raises doubts about **product durability and quality assurance**. Very disappointed with this experience.",

            "body": "As an Computer Engineering/IT graduate in Nepal, there are various pathways.  Option A) You stay in Nepal  Option B) You move abroad   Let's discuss about Option A first.  There are two realistic pathways you could take if you stayed in Nepal.  - work at private  - work at government   I have tried working at private. But the amount of discrimination being done in private companies really blew me up. As someone who was also preparing for government jobs, I had noticed lots of underprivileged folks participating in government jobs exam(for computer engineer as well). I used to ponder what made them do this since this is not a very lucrative job compared to what a \"certain community\" person makes at private or \"certain community\" person grows at private job. But later realized that private companies are not interested to hire these \"underprivileged\" folks.   Lots of people might argue (although they know it is not true) private jobs hire on merit. No they do not do so in Nepal. It is completely based off connections. It does not matter your knowledge. It is about who you know 100%. I am not ignorant that this might be the case outside, but I swear to god everyday, esto garera USA ma jasto innovative companies cha tyo ta pakkai hudainthyo..   The reason for such favoritism is mainly because the work they do is so shit. Leaving few companies who developer softwares that Nepalese use on daily basis(Not ludo), other jobs are not very interesting to do either. It is the same low quality menial job with meagre pay.   The companies who have a business are handful already. Investor ko money burn garne jasto nepal ma kei hudaina as there are no investors. So you see these bitchy ass companies hiring full stack developer every day for the salary of an intern.     I could not really be bothered with working under someone and taking all nonsense blames for 30,000 per month on hand. With no future and no growth and dismissing my self esteem. My aviman is and was huge.   The second pathway is to work at government corporations. I looked at the salary of computer engineer at Nepal Army, Nijamati and it is decent. But the upwards mobility is just not there. What I mean by that is salary is not growing when you grow your experience. Aba ta government employee specially nijamati lai dekhne bittikai yo bhrastachari raicha bhanne lagcha. Kinaki bhrastachar nagari ta khana basnai napugne. Pradhan Sena Pati ko talab cha 67000. Social security benefits cha good and all but cash in hand ni aileko market rate anusar ta dinu paryo ni. 67000 ma kam garne pradhansenapati le ghus nakhaye k garera palne? lol.  I looked at corporations salary. And it seems that if you manage to get a handle at a corporation(Sansthans), you can make be sure to make average of 60-70 thousands per month even as a 6th level officer. At this point of my career, this seems fair enough. But it will not be enough after 5 years, if my increment is just 1 thousand per year.    A huge reform is required in government services. Government services (specially nijamati) are the core to how people feel about the government. If we cannot make it attractive and lucrative, it does not matter how rich we are saving on their salary.  Next option is moving abroad.  Aba ko market ma abroad ma PR paune/GC paune biswas ta chaina. Unless you do the jobs that Americans do not want to do (or foreigners) like teaching for 60k/year, nursing old people etc.  15 years bidesh ma basna jane. Kam garne and coming back to Nepal. It seems the most plausible way forward. Nepal ma ayepachi k garne bhanne hunasakcha however.  The countries in option to stay for so long are Japan, India. Do not want to surrender my passport to Dubai sheikh. Also middle east is terror and war prone so do not want to end up there.   Europe tira padna gaye matra ho. It seems bleak for immigrants nowadays. And I do not think they earn that much in Europe (for someone planning to return back to Nepal and not stay there). Teta nabasne bhayepachi social security ko teti matlab bhayena.   How about USA? USA seems fine and all. but I do not think getting a work permit after Masters degree is going to be easy. Or that you are going to make big bucks and save big bucks as an immigrant in this economy. Since PR/GC is not guaranteed, you are basically playing a zero sum game. The experience that you get in abroad and education bla bla is huge investment however.",

            "body": "Hi everyone👋 I’m 23, living in Nepal, only a high-school degree, and I’m broke (only have 100 dollars in savings rn). I want to build a real career in IT so I can eventually work remotely or move abroad. I want something realistic that I can learn in about a year and turn into a stable, good-paying job.  Honestly, I’m not interested in freelancing or full-stack because (personally) it feels oversaturated and too creative (for each project) and portfolio-heavy, but I’m still open if I’m wrong. I don’t wanna sound picky, and desperate, like “I only want X, not Y.” Please don't get me wrong. I'm willing to learn and work. I’m flexible - I just want something that's worth my time and effort.  I’m looking for an IT path that:  • isn’t super saturated   • is easier for beginners   • hires freshers from Nepal (South Asia)   • has a stable monthly salary (4 digits)   • has a clear roadmap   • doesn’t require a uni degree   • reliable - won’t be replaced by AI soon   • can help me find jobs abroad  If you were in my shoes - 23, broke, no degree, living in Nepal, trying to break into tech in 2025/2026 - what would you realistically choose?  I’m open to anything: front-end, app dev, full stack, IT support, cloud, DevOps, QA, cybersecurity, networking, data, MySQL - anything that actually works for someone starting with almost nothing. Coz, I don't wanna end up being homeless. Seriously, I am so sick of my current lifestyle, I wanna make a change and take some right action that will lead me to my goal. I literally don't care if it's hard or impossible, coz now it's a necessity.. I am ready to sacrifice my time. I wanna invest in myself (my skills).  So, please, I need your help to choose the right direction.  I’d really appreciate any honest suggestions, roadmaps, or personal stories from people who started in a similar place.  Thanks a lot.",

            "comments": "timle vaneko anusar networking best hola. ccna chai garnu paryo. paxi bistarai ccnp gare vayo|||f I were 23, broke, living in Nepal, and trying to start an IT career without a degree, I would choose one of three realistic paths: QA testing, IT support, or cybersecurity. QA is the easiest and fastest way to get a job because it’s not too saturated, Nepal hires many freshers, and you don’t need a portfolio or degree. IT support is the most stable long-term option because it’s beginner friendly, companies always need support staff, and it naturally leads to higher-paying roles like SysAdmin or Cloud Engineer. Cybersecurity is the most future-proof, global, and high-demand field, but it requires more effort in the first few months.  Things like frontend, full-stack, and freelancing are not the best starting point when you’re broke and need stability fast; they take longer and require portfolios or creativity. A simple one-year plan would look like this: for QA, learn manual testing first, then SQL/API testing, and later basic automation. For IT support, learn computer basics, networking, and ticketing tools, then move towards cloud platforms. For cybersecurity, start with networking and Linux, then learn security basics and practice SOC labs.  If you want something fast, choose QA. If you want something stable and practical, go for IT support. If you want long-term growth and international opportunities, choose cybersecurity. Any of these three can realistically change your life within a year if you stay focused|||You’re only 23, so you have time on your side. While I understand you want quick results, consider exploring online degree programs. Many are flexible and work-friendly. A degree can make a huge difference when applying for jobs abroad and competing for better positions - it might be worth the investment alongside building your skills. 🙂🙂|||If I were you, I’d start with IT support → networking → cloud. It’s cheap to learn, beginner-friendly, hires freshers in South Asia, and leads to real stable jobs. Once you get basic support skills, aim for CCNA, then AWS. It’s the most realistic path to a solid career without a degree.|||look for QA, devrel, dev advocate, project manager, sre/devops etc. what's the tech skill that u already know? |||Garo nai cha aile ko situation ma ta.

First Salary was Rs. 16,000 (at Javra on 2019). After 3 months of internship, I joined another MNC company for Rs. 45,000. By Dec, 2023 my salary had increased to Rs. 1,44,000. I worked as Software Engineer in one MNC in Kathmandu. Were all of my classmates able to get similar jobs / salary? No. Were few earning even more than me? Yes.

I think its a huge mistake personally. I know there are many people who have done great in their lives. but I feel like (in the context of Japan) its a huge mistake to move after +2 because the cultural and language barrier is so high that even people with masters degree are working in convenient stores and other low paying jobs that need no academics. after +2 you just are so young and confused that you don't even know what you want in life and what are your options. at least after Bachelor's I'd guess you get what you should expect from life in general. also after Bachelor's its far easier to apply and get approved as opposed to after +2. also Bachelor's is very cheap compared to bidesh. Leaving the country as a teenager and growing up throughout my early 20s in bides has had me plant a doubt of growth in me. i feel like i have wasted my potential in Japan. I did 2 years of language and 4 years of graphic design and am currently studying 3d designing (1st year) as soon as i complete my study i wanna try and leave this country for good.   but I can also give a reason why you should move. 1. exposure at a young age. you get to experience things for the first time which is a doorway to learn many things about yourself and everything else. you see things that you have never even imagined. different languages and different cultures are important to live outside the bubble and see the world a little differently   2. privacy. in Nepal we have zero privacy. you do get total privacy and you can enjoy your alone time in solitude. this also comes with loneliness so be prepared to live a lonely life for the most part. loneliness also comes with anxiety and depression so try to keep yourself busy and in a circle.   3. life lessons. you start earning and learn to budget your expenses. you realize earning is easy and how much your parents had to sacrifice for you to be where you are. you also start getting very confident because now you are king of your own decisions.  4. You understand where you and your country lacks and how you can improve it. In Nepal there are many areas where change is necessary and if you never see it from others POV you will never know that it needs fixing. for example, i never cooked while i was in Nepal because mom did it all the time. but after coming here i have learned to cook some good food and also learned communication skills because of my work. also you see what exactly is not good in nepal and get the idea how you can fix it. for example lines in hospitals and other businesses like ward offices and banks. this can easily be fixed with a simple token and display. also supermarket like bhat bhateni can be improved with better staff training for efficiency  5.You can finally buy the things you couldn't afford as a kid. and you can buy the gifts for your family without having to worry about money so much. the face they make when you hand them the gifts is just priceless.  6. quality of life increases because you learn to keep yourself healthy and hygienic all the time. wearing nice clothes and with better styles uplifts your life by folds.   7. BAD SIDE  : you might also start drinking and smoking very often leading to sickness in the future when you are in your 30s and 40s|||I think it's the personal choice.

            "body": "Hello everyone,  I never thought I’d be writing this again. I wish our situation had gotten better since my last post… but reality has been harsher than I ever imagined.  My father is battling Stage 3 Gall Bladder Cancer, and his treatment at RGCI, Delhi is ongoing. We somehow managed to complete 5 chemo cycles , by selling whatever little we had, taking loans, borrowing from friends and relatives, and emptying every bit of savings. But now, we are completely drained .. emotionally, mentally, and financially.  The doctors say the next few chemo cycles are critical . If we stop now, everything we’ve fought for so far might go in vain. But the treatment cost has now gone beyond ₹20 lakhs, and we have nothing left to continue.  My father is a simple, hardworking man a small farmer and shopkeeper from a middle-class family. He spent his entire life making sure we never felt our struggles,have some good education. Only now do I truly see how much he silently sacrificed for us. I’m still in college, trying to study, trying to stay strong, but watching him in pain and feeling helpless is tearing me apart. i feel cancer is the worst thing you can ever deal with .  I’ve seen my mother cry silently in the corner every night, and my sisters trying to smile despite knowing how close we are to losing everything. I keep telling them we’ll make it that I’ll find a way but right now, I don’t know how much longer we can hold on without help.  In my last post, so many kind souls came forward. I’m truly, deeply grateful — we managed to raise about ₹1.5 lakh, which helped us cover chemotherapy and hospital bills. Every rupee meant the world to us. 🙏  But the journey is far from over. We still need around ₹20 lakhs more to continue his treatment and give him a real chance at life.  If you’re reading this please, help us if you can. Even a small amount, even a share, even a prayer it all counts.   I’m not asking for sympathy; I’m asking for humanity.

I realized that whenever I spoke Hindi around some Indians, they treated me differently. One employer even started talking to me like I was some “inferior Indian” they could insult anytime. That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.  Growing up in Nepal, almost all TV channels were in Hindi. Indian serials and movies basically forced Hindi onto us. Now I’m choosing to learn Newari and other Nepali ethnic languages instead. I want to promote my own culture, not get mistaken as part of another country.  I don’t want foreigners thinking Nepal = India just because we speak Hindi in movies or daily life. We have our own languages, our own culture, our own identity.  Speaking English abroad and promoting our own languages at home feels like the right direction.",

I agree.|||First thing I do is I ask them if they can speak English. It will hurt their little ego and they’ll switch immediately.|||You do you and I'll do me, I guess.    I spoke Hindi with a bunch of Bangladeshi tourists, because I don't understand Bangla, they don't understand Nepali, and they were more comfortable with Hindi than English.    I spoke Hindi with some Indian tourists because they were more comfortable with it than with English.    I continued to speak in English with an Indian visiting Nepal when I and a friend were interacting with him. The thing was, he switched code. I understood him and could have communicated well in Hindi with him, but my friend doesn't really understand Hindi, so I had to keep it in a language everyone understood, and I just told him I am not very good in Hindi.    I would happily speak Nepali in places like Darjeeling, where they speak Nepali, because I am most comfortable in it, and I know most people there would be more than comfortable in that. I assume that it is a comfort thing for them as well.  They're just more comfortable with Hindi than English, and I am accommodating, and fluent enough in Hindi, to extend the courtesy of speaking in their language.    I have come across Indians who look down on Nepal and Nepalis, and unfortunately, that attitude is more common among Indians than it should've been. It is not a pleasant experience, I admit. But, I refrain from putting all of them in a single box. I've met some wonderful Indians as well.   What I have to say is, we are individuals first, I, you, and anyone else, regardless of our nationality, or the languages we speak. Treat each individual on their merit, not their national identity. In fact, the shittiest person I've ever met is a fellow Nepali, and for obvious reasons—I live in Nepal.   The people who treated you bad were shitty people. The same attitude could very well be found in an Englishman, a Frenchman, or even a Nepali. That doesn't mean every Nepali, or Englishman, or Frenchman, is like that.    We are individuals first, in our lived experiences, not just a nationality, and in essence, expressions of existence, far greater than just a nationality. Treat people for who they are in that moment, not a label attached to them.    This is exactly the kind of subtle hate and/or prejudice I am against, whether it is based on lived experiences or influenced by rhetoric.   Use all the languages you know, as much as possible, I say. It is much better to open one's horizons than be insular. And no, I am not just a Nepali. My nationality is just one aspect of who I am, one which is more happenstance than chosen and curated with careful thought. So is yours, if you are actually willing to see it, along with anyone else's. |||Why were you speaking in Hindi in the first place instead of English.  Glad you found your self respect after a humiliating ritual. |||yes i agree. i mean totally agree. 100%  yes sir no nepali should be speaking in hindi in any situation ever.   This makes us look inferior infront of them.|||agreed|||I am in Dubai and I speak fluent hindi except for friends if someone asks I just say I understand but can’t speak. I am from Nepal and I prefer English to communicate.|||Language is a powerful tool. I’m here in the US and I speak Spanish with folks who speak Spanish and obviously when there is a language barrier people will banter by saying things that can feel personal. Even greetings come down to culture like cunado (sala) in Nepali.  Most of our generation I am 27 years old watches anime Korean series and picks up words the same way we grew up with Hindi serials. It’s not about speaking Hindi being inappropriate but about the mindset and stigma attached to it. While speaking Japanese Spanish Korean Chinese or French gives you brownie points Hindi often doesn’t and that’s a failure in how Indian people and Hindi have been framed.  I relate to your concern and I have seen firsthand what you’re saying where it can make someone feel inferior and I believe that comes from perception not the language itself.  I say use language in your favor when you can. Draw your boundaries when needed and if something feels insulting say it clearly in English and they usually won’t repeat it. This applies to all languages.  Cheers!|||It’s always north Indians who start speaking Hindi after knowing I’m Nepali.

You need to speak a few languages to be able to travel.

You can speak Hindi and still set boundaries if they treat you like shit. I don't see why speaking any other language will make you inferior. I did my Bachelors in India and never had a problem putting people in their places in their own language. I think uneducated illiterate and entitled people are everywhere including India and Nepal, I have had similar experiences with different ethnic communities within Nepal. I actually have problems speaking to Nepali people in Australia as they'll cross every boundary and think I'm liable for them just because we're from the same country.. Its a regional issue.  I watched a interview of Sonam Wangchuk in Nepal and he speaks Nepali throughout the interview. I think as reasonable people we should use whatever language we want depending on the circumstances. Having Hindi in our language arsenal is honestly a superpower as we get access to soo much resources and forms of art that otherwise we wouldn't have been exposed to and as someone from Nepal where we already have a lack of such resources, I'd be sad if I hadn't known Hindi.  So, maybe lets practice putting people in their places if they behave rudely to us and not blame the language. I have many friends from India who I am very close with and many that I had to tell them to show their entitlement elsewhere. It can be the same with English very soon with sentiments of immigration shifting alot and will be with Nepali within Nepal as well. So yea.. lets just enrich our lives with our knowledge of the language.|||yeah ban bollywood they force hindi on us|||indians are coming into kathmandu in large number we should do something they all force hindi|||i feel good that i never talked in hindi with anyone here.

I used to directly reply to them that I do know a little but I prefer not to because there’s no reason to and want to make my English speaking skills better.|||Bro, most Indians do not care about Nepal particularly in their day to day life. They are too busy with their own lives and the immediate world around them to specifically think anything about Nepal. India is a country of 1.3 billion people. And even in India, many people don't speak Hindi. Yeah, many in older generation are more racist, but they are racist to each other too. Many people fight over language in different Indian states, and discriminate with people of different states. But as I said, there are 1.3 billion people and a large majority will be as friendly to Nepali people. No, they don't think of Nepal as their little bro, but if asked, would actually hold some affinity towards Nepal in comparison to what they think of other nations.  Feel free to learn Hindi, feel free to forget, it's every one's personal choice. I honestly almost never need to learn it, but I like Nepali songs so much that I'm picking up on Nepali words now. (Kasari Bhanu, Bardali, Sarangi, Timi ra ma are among my favourite)  Lastly, this sub is quite Anti Indian, just saying,  generalizing India and Indians is ridiculous as the population is much more than most people can think of. And bad will always be highlighted more than good.|||It's not just Nepalis. North Indians act like this towards south Indians too.

I openly say that I understand it but don’t speak it, and I’ve never been treated like garbage because of that. I’m guessing you’re a man, because Nepalese men constantly put themselves in an inferior position, always with the “bhai, bhai” nonsense. That alone tells people how to treat you. I’m a 22-year-old woman in Canada, and there are two other Nepalese girls where I work. We carry ourselves with confidence. Our Indian manager can’t talk down to us, and neither can any coworker. But the Nepalese guys? They’re always talked down to like kids. They’re 27 and 28 years old and still get called “sala Nepali.” That never happens to us and it’s not a coincidence. We have more filipino co workers than Indians but they always hangout with Indians and say sh like , “ chalo bhai daru pitey hai aj “ in worse hindi accent possible.  This has nothing to do with language. It’s about presence. It’s about how you carry yourself. When you look unsure, dress badly, and act small, people treat you that way. Respect isn’t begged for , it’s taken.|||Guys why so much hatred for India..

And Have deicided to tell everyone that I can understand Hindi(little little) but I don't know how to speak because of much grammatical and syntax differences between my mother tongue and hindi.

Bahrut stup - 2300 years old.   Buddha's story is  sculpted in this Stup. Mahamaya (Buddha's mother) is seen protected by Elephant. Another art shows her dreaming an elephant. There is also a story where buddha tamed Mad Elephant. So elephant holds importance in buddhism. You can google it.   As the time fly, scholars began their own narration and interpretation.  Mahavairocana tantra -7th/8th century. One of the foundational texts of esoteric buddhism. Here Ganesha appears as Vinayaka, often portrayed as an obstacle creating diety sub dued by the buddha's mantra. Yet once pacified. He becomes a protector.  Kanguyar - the tibetan buddhism canon, preserves several tantric texts where Ganapati is invoked. Toh 666, Toh 665 heart of mantra appears here.  Sadhanmala -a vast collection of tantric sadhanas compiled between 10th to 11th centuries include detailed rituals of Maha rakta Ganapati and other ganesha forms. These practice invoke Ganesha as a wealth bestowing and obstacle clearing diety.  In buddhism, the ganapati hridaya sutra also known as the arya maha ganapati hridaya dharani, is a sacred mantra given by shakyamuni buddha to his desciple Ananda.  Mostly Ganesha is seen in Tibetan and Vajryan with more than 4 hands.  All the buddhist countries as Japan, Thailand , indonesia (former), China see elephant head diety as buddhist god.  Ganesha images in China occur between 6th to 7th century.  Lets see where Ganesha appears in Brahmin religion (hindu).  Rigveda - 1464AD is the oldest surviving manuscripts (30 pages or folios of birch bark) submitted by Indian Governmet to UNESCO.  Ganesha does not appear in it.  And in later rigveda version also, Ganesha vagueley appears. In short, hindu Ganesha does not exist.  They may claim Veda is million years old, but we must stick with history not theories.  Ganesha Purana - 13 to 17 th century. It explains the story of Ganesha.  However , it seems the ganesha cult started form 9th/11th century.|||“Kaaaaa yesto Kura gareko hera,   Yo tah hamro Saan ani dharma ho ni ,  Hami ajhai every tourist destination ma religious sites banau parcha ,  Nepal and its natural beauty jawos Kholai khola .tyo ek dui Jana tourist naayera k huncha Hami Lai.”|||Desh tikekai India ra Indian tourists le ho ta saathi.

Or even Cambodian people won't, the key dispute between the Thailand and Cambodia is the Priya Bihar Temple of Shiva regarding its ownership. People from swornabhumi will come and that's enough.

Most of the tourists that these places receive are mostly internal tourist, which is Nepalese, and majority of Indians, and buddhist. These places aren't attracting any secular tourists as such, plus just because they suddenly declared Nepal is a secular country, doesn't erase it's civilizational history, any western tourist when he thinks of Nepal, the things that comes in his mind are mountains, buddha, temples, monastries and stuffs, that's what they expect.  So, when there is already enough reason, Temples are automatically going to be built.  Plus, we have more and enough evidences that after building temples or statues in such places, the tourism has actually gone up.  So, it makes no sense why you are mad here.  Regarding the shoes, except the main area of Temple, it's wrong to just dictate to open shoes, that's something we all can raise voice.  Regarding Bhajan, that's definitely wrong, no one can just blast any Bhajan in such open place whenever they like it. And, this issue is also solvable.  It's sad that just because of these two issue of shoes and Bhajan, you went on to attack the existence of Mandir and statues themselves without actually understanding the overall context.|||I was there this summer, they never said to take off my shoes and there wasn't any bhajan and stuff.|||What’s the meaning behind this is Pokhara not Janakpur?|||keta keti haru jun thau pani romanticize garne lul.

It had been a month since she's been taking home tuition from this one teacher. He comes to her house and teaches her. Usko chai aahiley renovation chali rako cha ghar ma so me being the nice bf that I am, told her she could come over to my house and ask the teacher to come there to teach. I would be all day in my classes as well so disturb ni hunthena(she has morning classes I have day classes)  So for few hours a day, she was getting tuition from the teacher in my room. Or so I thought. Ekdin chai mero classes haru chito sakkiyo and I went home about an hour early. Room jada it was locked from the inside so I thought bahira bata noise aayera room lock gareko hola bhanera. Tei ni I got curious and went around the window to see what was going on.  My gf was on her my bed with her teacher cuddling inside the blankets and what not like wtfff bhaira ma ta. I couldn't believe my eyes I thought I was having a nightmare. I got really furious, told her to open the door and we had a huge fight I was really heartbroken. Riss ma aayera I threw the damn blankets, comforter, duvet, even the rug. Ghar bata sabai faldiye and told them to leave.  So can you guys please tell me where can I get some good rugs and comforters in Nepal? Its winter and I cant sleep without the blankets yk. Especially Im looking for a warm fluffy white/creamy type of rug tyo fur wala. Online shops testo kei cause im not from valley. Help guyss!!",

You are the biggest fucking cuck Nepal has ever produced, bar none.  You literally heard “ghar renovate bhairacha” and your smooth brain went: “Aww baby, aaile mero room ma aaija na, teacher lai ni bolau, ma ta class ma hunchu, disturb pani hudaina.” Bro you didn’t just hand over your room, you handed over your entire bed for their afternoon fuck-session like a 5-star hotel receptionist. You set the mood, locked the door from outside and paid the electricity bill while that randi was getting railed on your own pillow.  You’re not a “nice boyfriend”, you’re a walking doormat with Wi-Fi. The moment she said “home tuition” alarm bells should’ve rung, but no, timi ta “disturb nahos” bhanera uniharulai honeymoon suite diyau. Teacher le timro girlfriend ko “syllabus” cover gardai thiyo ani timi bahira “nice guy” badge polish gardai basyo.  You came home early and still had to play detective like some Bollywood hero, peeking through the window because your own room was locked from inside. Bro even Nepali serials don’t have this level of chutiya plot.  And the cherry on top? You threw the blankets and rugs instead of throwing hands. Blanket jalaunu parne thiyo, timi chai “winter aaucha, kasari sutne” bhanera Daraz ma fluffy white rug khojdai chau. Bro your girlfriend got piped on your bed and your biggest concern is staying warm?? Priority thik cha baba.  You didn’t just get cheated on, you got professionally scammed by a third-class tutor and a third-rate girlfriend. Block her, delete everything burn the mattress and never ever say “disturb nahos” to a girl again.  You’re not heartbroken, you’re brain-dead. Wake the fuck up king, your crown’s on fire and you’re still asking for new rugs. 😂😂😂|||Japa hari ram lai Maya jaal ma nabhula|||Bhina bhina k padhnu parxa go to jamal bajar teha pauxa babbal blankets|||7/10 rage bait.

Trendy: they're brainwashed, selfish, came for masubhat  Reality: UML has strong foundation and institutions in every sectors, from education to workers, farmers, employees, businesses.   These organizations/institutions although have bad reputations, have done some apprecianle deeds too. From volunteering, blood donations, scholarship schemes etc. For eg. UML's student union was the first one to reach to Kalapani and put Nepal's flag on the land.   What we're doing is just bashing them on the internet with mostly baseless accusations. (Mostly, not all). That's not how you defeat an established and strong organization. If we want these parties to perish, we've to understand how they function and why they are still popular in villages and countryside. Kati paye gau gau ma ja govt pugna sakya xaina, tya yinai big parties ka sangathan harule public service puryayeka pani xan.

I wanted to take a moment to share something from the heart, especially for the Gen Z community here. I’m not here to lecture, judge, or pretend that I “know better.” In fact, it’s the opposite—I’m here because I genuinely admire a lot about Gen Z, and I’d love to learn from you if you’re open to talking or sharing your perspectives.  What I really respect about your generation is the honesty. The courage to say things out loud that older generations kept buried. The way you call out what doesn’t feel right, whether it’s in society, culture, work, or even in yourselves. The world is changing fast, and you all seem to face it with a unique blend of humor, vulnerability, and resilience. And honestly, that’s inspiring.  I’m not perfect, and I don’t pretend to fully understand everything about today’s trends, language, mindset, or struggles. But I’m here with an open mind. If any Gen Z member is willing to talk—to enlighten me, challenge me, laugh with me, or even correct me—I’d sincerely appreciate it.  I’m reaching out with respect and humility. I’m here to listen, not impose. Thank you to anyone who takes a moment to respond. 🙏🏽|||yesto sanskar vaka le kasto desh banauxan hola?

I’m truly grateful. Recently during an interview, I shared my personal political standpoint. I mentioned that I do not personally recognize K.P. Oli as a leader whose ideology I align with. I say this not out of disrespect, but from a place of accountability and responsibility toward our nation. After the recent Gen Z protests, I believe many of us expected honest conversations, acknowledgment of public concerns, and accountability for the injustices that occurred under his administration where many lives were lost. When leadership is unable to take responsibility for such serious matters, it becomes difficult for me to support or follow their ideology. My intention is not to attack individuals, but to stand for truth, transparency, and a future where leaders are answerable to the people. I believe Nepal deserves leadership that listens, learns, and upholds justice for every citizen. Thank you once again to everyone who resonated with my thoughts. Let’s continue pushing for a better and more responsible political culture together.|||So many Incel chicks in comment, are we even safe?|||Nepal is literally full of chutiyas like these, logic fact kei chaina 😂 .

Here are a few from my side:  1. Does RSP view kulman's party as a threat to their voter base as there seems to be a significant overlap between RSP and Kulman’s supporters. Are there any discussions or considerations about forming a coalition with them or other emerging political forces? 2. Sumana leaving brought a lot of negative light on RSP, her exit made it seem like the party was becoming more of a “Rabi supporters’ club.” Has her departure brought any internal changes within the party, or has everything remained largely the same? 3. If an opportunity arises  where you can form a coalition government together with one of the old parties are you willing to take it, for example if UML and RSP together have the numbers to form a government, would you take that opportunity? Or would the party prefer to stay in opposition rather than partner with any of the traditional major parties?

In this context, what does RSP feels about new alternative forces that have emerged after the gen z Andolan? Do you see them as a threat since they too will be contesting for the same voter base? Any internal discussions going on to work with them?  I think a good percentage of people are confused and unsure about where RSP stands on many burning issues in Nepal which has pushed Nepal into instability time and again. I’m sure you know what I’m talking about. RSP seems to tip toe around those issues and avoid discussing it overtly.   Could we see RSP take a vocal stand on those issues and make their ideological stance clear before this election? Perhaps this would help RSP clarify its position to unsure but potential voters, and strengthen its presence in villages, small towns and far districts.|||Do you think the current FPTP voting system should be replaced by Instant-runoff / Alternative voting?

I get it Rabi ko party ho but when I/we voted to RSP, it wasn’t because of Rabi but rather the young people like Sumana, Toshima, Ganesh, Sobita who joined Rabi.   Swarnim Wagle isn’t the face of alternative politics. He went to media and started saying shit about Kulman when Kulman has just stayed silent about RSP-Kulman merger. What is that if not a media trial? He is just a sad Congress member who couldn’t get ticket due to bhauju so jumped ship to RSP. Why does he get more say in RSP ko internal matters than other young faces?  So my question again - why is RSP so Rabi centric? Why should we vote for RSP when the whole party philosophy revolves around Rabi? And when Rabi retires, there’s basically no one to lead because the party has been so focused on Rabi and doing media trial against other young leaders.|||What is RSP stance in privatizing Nepal Oil Corporation, Nepal Airlines, and other state owned companies?

Why not make Kulman Ghising as face of RSP and future PM.|||Why did you go in alliance with CPN-Maoist(formerly), if we look at politicians with big ambitions like Pierre Pollierrve(Canadian LoP currrently), the far-right of germany, the far right of France, all of them have chosen to not form an alliance with the one whom they claim they're fighting against. For example, Pierre Pollierve despite my hatred for him I can agree that he trruly opposed the policies and was there for a change which is why respecting the mandate in previous elections he chose not to form a gov despite having an opportunity to come in power via alliance with NDP, and Qubec. Why did you not stick with the principles and chose an alliance with the two heads whom Nepalese hate?  Second question, what's your party ideology, is it left wing or right wing? Based on following factors;Economics, Culture.  Third Question, the census data reveals that there's been 100% increase in the number of Christian population which clearly shows that our demographics is being destroyed, in the vietnam the missionaries have been converting the indegenous people to have a claim over the land, similar thing has happened with the Naga community of India, so its likely that Kiranti people are next, what will you do to stop this manipulative conversion, if you were in position of power?

I have some critical questions. I would be more than happy if Rabi reads these as well.  1.Why aren't you popular? ..at least upto your actual work?  Why are you guys in the shade while there's only talk of Rabi , Gagan, prasai , balen , sumana in the town. Your name is only taken collectively as \"a raswopa neta\". What are your biggest works and achievements as a member of parliament and rsp central member?  2.Why 45 lakhs signature for Rabi but 8.2 lakhs only voter id? Why can't I say that rsp prioritized a personality cult over connecting to new voters. Why is this not a catastrophic failure? Why did you guys fail to pressurize gov and commission to enable diaspora voting and even voter id registration from abroad. Nid was enabled for a brief period of time only. How can you guys exercise democracy with that slow and buggy registration process and 25 lakhs eligible citizens still unregistered?  3.Why is RSP scared to run elections independently on their own?Any plans to help gagan thapa win again?  4.Why is RSP vulnerable to propaganda by gagan thapa IT cell and 12 bhai fake news?  5.Why is rsp's communication and convincing skills so poor ? Couldn't onboard prominent figures and even chase Sumana away, how will you guarantee this doesn't deter similar newcomers again? I know it's important but is it that only the loyalist shall survive in rsp?   6. How many seats is the bibeksheel party contributing to the rsp in the upcoming election? Any projections? Or is it just a symbol?  7.Why is RSP not popular among genz , heavy backslash to Rabi and rsp being labeled as the same old parties, it being too person centric? Why do genz and youngsters hate political parties? What has rsp done and doing to make rsp popular among youngsters? Why is it so lost?   8.Why is RSP activities limited to Kathmandu valley and Chitwan only? I saw rsp doing some program recently AGAIN in chitwan instead of some new place. By being such limited to two districts how are you gonna secure the majority of seats across the country? Why are you preventing RSP from becoming big? We had hopes and still have some. Who's deciding all these?   9. Who's the youths face in rsp ? And how are they representing us? Where?   10. Why does RSP lack someone who's clear about his stance like what Mahesh basnet is for uml? Who's the spokesperson and why is he/she operating in a clinical and limited periphery.   11. Rabi Lamichhane publicly in a speech told that he lost many seats in 2079 election because he wasted his time trying to onboard popular faces instead of fostering new leadership and win more seats, but you guys seem to entertain this notion of onboarding popular faces more , forgetting the fact that you yourself aren't there due to popularity background. Why? Why can't you do something on your own rather than over-depending upon kulman or balen? I mean if you can't onboard them why waste an excessive amount of energy for that? Why such a weak mindset?  RSP central committee representatives feels incomplete and still need to cater many audiences, why don't you onboard brilliant and sharpest minds rather than just someone based on popularity or old connections? |||What are the things that you've done for Nepal?|||RSP stands for Rabi Swatantra Party?|||Remindme! 1 day|||Whats the ideology of rsp|||In reddit you are supposed to be anonymous sir.",

            "body": "I swear, the more I watch Miraj Dhungana’s actions after the Gen-Z protests, the more pissed off I get. This guy went from saying “I’m not the leader, this is a collective movement” to suddenly announcing a whole political party under the Garikhana Deu banner like it’s some kind of personal promotion. Do you even realize how ridiculous that looks? We were told this movement was leaderless, built on the frustration of an entire generation, and now the SAME person who said he wasn’t leading anything is stepping into politics like he’s been preparing the whole time. It feels like the movement’s energy was used as a ladder.  And don’t even get me started on the way he handled the October 9 protest confusion. When young people were panicking, waiting for clarity, ready to go to the streets again because the country is literally suffocating under corruption, what does he do? He steps back. He shrugs it off and says Gen-Z wasn’t involved. Bro, if you’re going to speak for the movement when it’s convenient, then show up when shit gets chaotic too. That’s literally what leadership is. Instead, he pops up when the cameras are rolling and disappears the moment things get risky. That kind of pick-and-choose activism makes me angry because that’s exactly the political behavior we protested against.  Then there’s the whole “our office was attacked” episode. He went public with it, made it sound serious, and then the police said there was no official complaint, and everything was calm when they arrived. What are we supposed to believe? Either be transparent or don’t dramatize it. People actually suffered during these protests. People bled. People DIED. And watching someone drag the movement into half-explained drama with zero clarity is honestly insulting.  What makes me the most furious is how he keeps talking like he represents the entire generation, giving big speeches about unity, direct elections, overseas voting, and political reform, while his actions keep zig-zagging all over the place. You don’t get to call yourself the voice of Gen-Z while making moves that look inconsistent, self-centered, and convenient. The Gen-Z protests weren’t a TikTok trend. They weren’t a branding opportunity. They were a desperate cry from a generation that’s tired of being silenced and robbed of a future.  Watching someone turn that into a messy political ambition is heartbreaking and infuriating. We didn’t risk our safety so one guy could walk around looking like a “youth politician.” We marched for real change. For accountability. For a country that doesn’t chew its future generation alive. And right now, Miraj feels like he’s drifting so far from the soul of that movement that it’s honestly painful.  If he actually wants to stand for Gen-Z, then he needs to stop playing this half-activist, half-politician game and show some damn consistency, clarity, and courage because right now, all I’m seeing is another person using the movement’s energy to put himself in the spotlight.  Anyone else feel like this? Because I’m seriously done pretending this is okay.    And here are the straight-up questions people genuinely have for him:  Who is funding your movement, your events, and now this new political party?  Why did you claim there was “no leader” during the protests but suddenly step into a political role afterward?  When exactly did you decide to form a party during the protests or after?  If you didn’t intend to be a leader, why are you acting like one now?  Why do you vanish or disengage whenever things get tense, unclear, or dangerous?  Why was the October 9 situation handled so confusingly by you?  Why talk about an attack on your office but file no clear, formal police complaint?  Who keeps you accountable? Who checks your decisions?  What gives you the right to speak on behalf of an entire generation?  Are you building a movement or building a personal political brand?",

Aba ko political events le uslai daro banauna chai sakcha hai in that regard.  He got scared after the sep 8/9 incidents, fearing that his good life could get stripped away from him. He's someone with a lot to lose. His family and relatives probably held him back. Tespachi he probably came back to the front ali pachi with some kind of a plan. Aile chai I just think he's trying to do what he thinks and knows is right - play by the political system's rules. And since we all have severe trauma related to anything 'political party' related, we hate to see it.  Sudan is the opposite of miraj - he's been in the field, has scolded corrupt officials to their face since 2015, has had literal dirt and blood on him. But he's not an eloquent speaker like miraj, he's got 'a look' but the kind of person he has become, branding himself online is not sth he cares about. Whatever he is, is his brand.  In any case, we gotta be careful and discerning and support where needed and criticize where appropriate.

Intentions sahi hola but yinarle anarchy matra badauxan.|||Not a Zenzee and while I appreciate the revolution and all, they have slowly becoming Oli gang. What it demonstrates is the blood we have - thirsty for oneself, power, money, opportunity. I am particularly upset with Sudan Gurung who is hell bent at removing Home Minister and this guy called Miraj Dhungana. I will dismiss Miraj right off the bat because I don't see anything in his eyes and his face. He is a selfish person and anyone who is following him and all should think many times. Sudan Gurung - the guy is hell bent on removing home minister on such a stupid demand that he wants to arrest Oli and Lekhak. What the hell guys ? are you looking for rawanraj? we have laws and we want to enforce it fairly and strictly. Om Prakash is a lawyer and he is not trying to protect Oli or Lekhak - anyone thinks that is such a stupid Zenzee. Do you guys want to arrest someone just on a whim? without gathering sufficient proof? In western countries law enforcement officials spend years if not decades monitoring and gathering evidences against someone they think is culprit - they just don't  arrest someone and investigate - that wouldn't be rule of law. Om Prakash has that schooling. I don't care who Om Prakash is and all but he is definitely a capable guy and has proved it time and again - after all, he is chosen by PM.  Now, are you guys looking to change ministers and government leadership when we only have 4 months to go ? Its such a shame when every so called Zenzee goes to Singhadarbar and disturbs our government's actions. Just think if all the time they spend is meeting you guys.     Now listen to what Mahabir Pun said - please go to your constituencies and help new  political parties that align to your views win - why are you spending so much energies trying to meet the PM ? The Miraj Dhungana is such a scam guy - He is driven by his own ambition, I feel. I did like Sudan but he is also active childish and not a thing in near future.  Whatever everyone says and does listen and watch what Rachha Bam says and does. She is the one who walked out with Army Chief when he seemed to infer democracy was in danger. She is acting with passion and patience. I would recommend everyone to support behind Raswapa, Sagar Dhakal, Baburam, Kulman,  Sumana Shrestha. Sumana is the real deal.     Now if you believe in democracy and free and fair election, support Rabi. How can a person so beloved by people can be in jail without having an opportunity to go to people? is democracy is for the people and by the people?     I recommend please read. Watch what Swarmin Wagle said few days that Deuba was Zenzee, Oli was Zenzee and every popular leader was zenzee when they started politics. There has been tremendous progress but it was not enough. Just because you feel young and under 25 doesn't mean its your government and can do anything. Nope - no way until we have rule of law.     Now this government gotta focus on election and it has to happen. When I hear Miraj and Sudan that say it can't happen in current condition are not only naïve but foolish. They gotta go read what democracy is. Nothing happens without people's mandate which is vote.     And don't forget its not you guys who brought this change - it was a coincidence.  Someone else did on 24th so you really shouldn't overwhelmingly take any credit, especially Miraj who didn't even take part in the protest ! Hope it helps.|||Ani aaja bholi singa durbar bhitra baseka haru protocol follow garera aako hun ta ??|||miraj and party >>>>> yemale and other similar parties|||Yea the protest was headless/leaderless but we need people to lead you can't complain he gained from this protest of course he did and we want a capable leader to run office not military the argument that he was not in the protest is stupid this is exactly why we failed as national because we put fighters as leaders they can be leaders while fighting but in office we need people who lead office not mobs and arms   Not taking his side but this was a common argument against him and I disagree so this ... Btw I don't know why they want directly elected pm within 6 months like bring 2/3 majority and do what you want their ego will delay the election effectively pushing the country years backwards focus on NOTA and NRN voting rights and different policy and development plan for future|||All this shit is happening coz there was no leader during gen z protests. They did not achieve anything despite such massive movement except toppling Government.   Miraj Dhungana came into realization. An organised group is must to move forward. The most important thing a leader should have is a clean image and clear vision. The maturity he has shown not being political figure is admirable.   One of the good thing coming out of Gen Z movement is the youth having interest on politics and stepping forward to be incharge.  We should not discourage them, in the same time help them by giving healthy and constructive criticisms.|||आज उनीहरूले गरेको माग केपी र लेखक लाई सजाए को दायरा मा ल्याउनुपर्छ भन्ने विषयमा थियो। सायद त्यो माग राख्नु गलत भयो होला है।|||Yo sub pani flip bhaira hunxa harek bela.

Muslims of Nepal posted about their happiness when Taliban came back to power, they side with muslims be it anywhere in the world, buddhist burmese vs rohingya muslims they will take sides with muslims, indian hindus va muslims, they will pick muslims, syrian Christians vw muslimw they will pick muslims and so on… When Palestinians atatcked israel , Many musims living in Nepal celebrated it but then they never condemned the murders of 11 innocent Nepali citizens by Hamas.  They will always make reasons like we are Nepali muslims and we are different but their genetics, history is the same as that of Indian muslims as majority of musilmw living in Nepal migrated from Kashmir, UP, Bihar and Bangladesh .  For Muslims, religion comes first before nationality. Many groups within nepal have differences between them but for them the nation comes first, you will see a hindu nepali protesting against India and Buddhist protesting about illegal citizenship to Tibetan refugees. But a muslim will never say anything about illegal migration of Rohingyas .   Also, these people are real fanatics and radicals . ApM ssaid something that’s true, many arab nations don’t provide equal opportunities to women. Saudi just maid it legal for women yo obtain driver’s licenses just a year ago, many of the women can’t travel alone, islam allows mens to have multiple wives but why isn’t the same applied towards women?  Also, PM mentioned that in the past muslims women in muslims nation faced far much difficulties and there was no reason to be triggered about it.  They literally made movies about Sati practices withng some community but no one came put to protest against the release, had it been something about muslims they will flood the streets .  At the end, its upto nepali to believe that muslims of Nepal are different from rest of south asian muslims. I wonder when most of the madarsas, mosques have bangaldeshi, paksitani imams and scholars how will the teachings be any different?

Around a year worth of income of an average Nepalese just for a 2 years of teen's study.  My experience with Kavya was that my mom went there just to check it out (ofcourse it was out of our budget) and sadly she entered her number in some survey they had.      The number of calls those nggas made during 2 whole weeks, fk. We kept on declining and blocking their numbers but everytime it was a new number lmao. When we first asked for discount, they declined for even a rupee but later on they started giving offers themselves, despo times for them ig. I shouted at them once and finally they stopped.|||Kavya na jau bhanxu hai Discount kei ma xaina +2 Ko lagi SXC ya sasto, ramro ma gaye hunxa for science Management ho bhane global|||Me who completed +2 in 1 lakh|||Esto mahango cha +2 aile?|||\\+2 colleges are overrated. colleges will contribute almost nothing to shape your future in +2.|||Kavya and Ace ko last year ko result kasto cha??

Watch khan academy for general concepts. Use Perplexity AI or something like that for personal guidance. I got away with a 3.8+ GPA with only these resources. Perplexity really helped me understand the topics I was really struggling with. Also take full advantage of your school library. I used different books to get my concepts clear. For example: Use Fundamental Physics by Resnick and Halliday to understand the concepts in Physics, Thomas calculus for calculus, also most of the math is covered in BC Bajracharya's Basic of Mathematics. Even if you study an hour a day using these resources, that would be enough (Considering you pay attention in class).|||How much is the fee|||Too bad youtube ma free ma xa 😢|||Don't take online tuition class myannn|||fee?? |||You can easily access any topics from any elite professors for FREE .

But many can't, because of Nepal's education system, which doesn't quite allow for much spare time, and if you pair that with learning some extra skills, you won't have any time left for your partner, whatsoever.      I'm not being resentful, rather this is what i have observed and witnessed. IMO, instead of indulging into some serious relationships, you should continue this casually( friends type).|||No dude, money doesn't always matter. If she understands your situation, there will always be a way. Go shoot your shot king.|||Contrary to popular beliefs , it does homie .|||Ye|||It matters to most, specially girls. If it was the other way around it wouldn’t even be a question. And even if the girl is happy with you not being as rich as her, her family won’t necessarily see you the same way.   But if you’re only casually dating then it shouldn’t matter much. Talk to her about it and keep the convo light hearted!|||yeah  no money  no honey",

Now that there's only four months left for board exams, I have become extremely anxious and stressed and I'm not even sure if I'll pass, let alone ace the exams. How do I maximize my focus and efficiency in these four months to make an academic comeback I guess? Aba k strategy apanauda thik hola ani there's one more thing I'd like to talk about.... Due to my terrible performance in all subjects, mero teacher haru sanga ko image testo ramro chaina ani relation pani testo ramro chaina so theory ta cooked nai ho tara mero practical grades pani cooked? Oh ani one more thing to make it worse I TOOK FRICKIN BIOLOGY! If someone has been through a similar phase, please help this junior get a decent marks so he doesn't get disowned :)",

I'd suggest diligently xoda sabai.  2. Physics– derivations jau sabai, definitions haru and numericals book ko example ani set book ko gara.   3.Chemistry– Organic ko rxns haru matra lekha ani regular basis ma practice garni. Physical chemistry physics jastai and inorgani ta ratni nai ho.  4. Maths– Derivations batai jaani, formula ta paani banauni, examples garni and set ko questions practice garni.  5. Biology- Harek chapter to imp questions hunxa. Set book heresi thaha hunxa. Long questions ta heriranu parxa.  6. Eng/Nep- notes herera natra youtube ma summaries le ni kaam dinxa. Grammar ma chai ali yaad garnu parne kura haru xa.     4 months is good enough time. Ramrai pada natra regrets matra baaki hunxa paxi.    Youtube tira Physicawallah ko strategy videos ni xan hera maile vaneko le pugena vani   (Practical ta chill mai basa aile- final ma files ma lekhya jasari lekhni ho..pass hunxa majalai)|||How did you pass 11th 😭|||Oh damn man tmro ni same mero jastai jastai para haixa,  suru mata k vanxu vane find out what's keeping you away from studying, in mero case ma chai mobile ho (tmro ni huna sakxa) 10+ hours everyday not reading even once nor make notes . That single thing was the sole reason I failed twice in 11, re-exam ko exam Mani fail vaera feri exam deko . Tmi abani anxious vae rakhne ho vane fail hune daar haina sachikai fail hunxau ma jastai final ma. I also chose science tara computer science ligeko yet I struggled so much ( biology ligeko vaeta re -exam ni dina milthena hola ani aile behal hunthyo ) . Same case haixa hamro , maile 10 paxi ta science kinda chosed cus of pressure ani never had interest in studying ani mobile addiction le garda jhan lazy vae . Aba k gara Vanda kheri , practical chai tmle sab complete garnu parxa . Complete all experiments ani make sure they are signed by you lab teacher tes paxi ta you gotta practice them again , watch videos in YouTube on how to do them ani read your lab copy to memorize the obvs , theory stuff , 4 months should be enough for physics , chemistry and biology.  Tespaxi chai exam ko chai vannu parda , being honest I don't think you can do it by studying yourself , atleast that was my case , maile 12 ko final ma fail vae paxi no afai padhai padina so I had to take tuition classes . So I highly advise you to take tuition classes asap and atleast be confident that you can get passing marks ani tespaxi grade increase garla for now just focus on passing grade .   Maile yo sab ekai paragraph ma vanna sakina so if you need any more help you can DM me|||Only who can help you is you urself just study, i regret not studying|||You have time to study and make plans  like start from shorter study time study for 30 min and give yourself a 15 min break but in that break don't use mobile . And don't use mobile for notes too  if possible . Psychologically you are using the same device for entertainment and for notes it will  distract you .  Gradually increase your study time like add 20 to 30 min per 3 days and after one month make the break time of 10 min without mobile phone  That's it you will score brilliant grade at the results|||i was in the same situation a year ago. ali ali padhe, mostly cheat gare ani aayo A pani.   Tara as someone who studied 4-5 hrs before each exam, trust me when i tell you 4 months is a lot. aaile hawa lagla. sab padhnuparxa din ko 7/8 hrs le matra catch up garxu jasto lagla timlai tara dinko 2 hrs padha majjale pugxa.  youtube ma etti dherai resources xa. padha bro bistarai. bio ko chai guide kina ani dinkai euta long answer kantha para pugxa. it’s going to be mind blowingly easy if you start now.   cheat garxu bhanera chai bhaar napara la. didf situations hunxa. At least 50 marks ko confident bhayera jau. i used to make posts like these on here too. trust me you’ll be fine. stress nalikana padha!!!!!!!|||\"academic comeback\" doesn't exist. It's too late; you can only prevent yourself from going downhill.|||1 year aghi ma ni same situation ma thiye lol, Ma chai management bata ho so no idea about your syllabus and course hai. Obviously aaba science ho hard vai halxa tei ho ramro sanga padhne , tuition join garda ni hunxa. 10 ma ramro grade lyako raixau vane pakka ni talent nai xau hola so 4 months chai majja le padhnu ni. best of luck haii",
