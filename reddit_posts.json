            "body": "Good morning people.  When the tikapur massacre happened, it happened far away from the capital. We knew what we knew about it from the media. There were multiple casualties in that incident including killing of a toddler. The killing of policemen there with such brutality was unimaginable.  Everyone was unequivocally against what happened, multiple charges were pressed and people have been convicted with serious consequences. All of us, agreed that a political movement somehow got violent and resulted in unimaginable tragedy. We all agreed they needed to be put to justice.  Chait 15 was not even a protest, it was supposed to be a public gathering, a power show of some kind. It was led by Durge \"Mahisasur\" Parsai. Most people here were against his movement, including the media. They stoned a building and burned it. A journalist tragically lost life and the government \"murdered\" somebody in the street. They vandalized Bhatbhoteni and incurred significant loss. We were vehemently against Durge for what happened. The voice against the government murder was \"muted\" and people tended to take side of government, because the protesters (by that time) had been rowdy. All of were unequivocally against Durge. Balen attributed Gynndra for moral responsibility for the protest and fined him.  Now the Bhadra 23 protest, all of us \"supported\" the protest against corruption. Khadge Oli probably thought he would do exactly same as the Chaitra 15 protest and underestimated the potest. It went violent after it broke the barricade. The government caused unimaginable tragedy. 19 protesters \"murdered\" withing few hours is unimaginable in a democracy. We again unequivocally held the government, Khadge Oli responsible for the murders.  What heppened next day is also unprecedented and unimaginable. I fear, if I say it was wrong, then I may be painted as taking the side of government and not of the protesters. Its a false dichotomy. But lets face it, what happened in 24th was wrong.  In all of these above, the people involved in either sides were Nepali. We are responsible for all of the above on either sides. Blaming one or the other, saying घुषपैठ or foreign forces, winning election and putting Bhauju behind bar is not going to fix it. There is only one way to fix it. Education. It takes at least 10 years for education improvement to take effect. And ain't nobody gonna win election by saying \"I will improve education\".",

It's always the people. Its always morality, your view towards other. How you differentiate what is right and what is wrong. Not saying i wasn't happy when the houses were burning but me along with almost everyone has to change to fix that as of i think|||Agreed. Its education that we are lacking. Zero sense of community, Afulai matra vaye pugxa hune, aruko khedo khanne etc etc. Always blaming the government, its ironic. But again the education we get boils down to being political too. The education we are given is laughable. its like People in power keeps wanting us dumb to keep taking advantage. Such a dumb cycle. :”)|||Revolutionary acts cannot succeed without violence. Peaceful protests are a facade that exist to maintain the status quo. Every revolutionary act in history has had a degree of violence involved and ours was no different. Morality is beyond good and evil.   Edit: I too agree that universal education is necessary in our population. But, equating education it with non violence is a nonsensical argument.|||[deleted]|||New to the country but was here during the protests. Education is def one of the keys and you are right it will take a decade for it to take effect, probably a generation for it to yield results. Having said that education is a lever of uplifting oneself from their current socio economic status and until there is a way for people to satisfy that need in Nepal (jobs and the like) imo more education will just get brain drained out.  Loved the point you are making BUT would love it if you could expand on it. Ie like what portions of education in Nepal do you think would need to be adjusted (unified teaching topics on a specific subject, reforming the countries education system, etc)? I get there are many other factors to consider when it comes to sociopolitical upheavals but how do you think education will take a part in fixing it?

            "body": "Amidst all the dissatisfaction and hopes for a new future, I want to take a little time appreciate the development that has taken before my eyes in Bharatpur.  The main visible development has been the 6 lane highway. I personally believe that a proper road is a basic need but on the side, I also want to appreciate the fact that we didn’t have this before and now we do. I don’t think it’s wrong to be grateful.  And when I look around, I think that what the people around me want is to see visible, tangible development.  I’ve personally seen Bharatpur develop in a fairly short amount of time.  When we had to go to village areas, we would be gone the whole day and come home dusty and exhausted. I also remember going to places like Jagatpur or Meghauli - it would take a whole day trip. 3 hours just on the road (one way). It was painful.  I used to hate my parent coming back from a trip because they would look so tired and old and the whole mood would be off.  Now every travel feels like a holiday — it’s fun, you enjoy the scenery along the way, it’s clean and enjoyable, and you’re not gone the whole day or coming home with back pain, annoyed and a dust powdered face.  I know a lot of young women and mothers who used to stay home all day but now are making income for the home.  They ride scooties and autos carrying bags full of supplies and vegetables, doing door to door / store-to-store marketing. They can cover huge areas in a single day. Before, they couldn’t go farther than a few kilometers. They can do their job at their own time and easily earn at least 20-30k per month which is good for someone who used to earn nothing.  In turn, village people now get more supplies at their local shops and doors. They can take a short day trip to the bazaar and return. They can get to hospitals faster without having to stay overnight at someone’s place.  As for the main bazaar, since the six-lane highway, property values have surged. Well established businesses have started eyeing properties for rent. We now have fashion lines, cosmetics lines, cafes and food places before us that most people hadn’t ever seen before. Homeowners in these areas are benefiting and now earn over double  than they used to.  Tourism is also booming and the hotels are packed.  The place is clean, water is free up to 7,000 liters, hospital benefits for seniors. I can’t say for all places but in my area - there are often free door-to-door checkups, free handouts, and 4 CCTVs (and I live pretty deep inside) and motion sensor lights in the streets. But the road in front of my house isn’t paved yet.  I saw them digging holes recently near poles and asked what’s going on and they replied underground wiring. So underground wiring work is going on.  I can also see that people are doing better and raising their standards of living. Last summer, there was a big increase in the amount of ACs being sold.  Even in 2015, I would take a cycle rikshaw down the main road oralo. Now it’s changed a lot.  I don’t know much about education sector but I think it’s improved. I know a good student who wasn’t given much attention by the school he was going to. He moved here and got noticed by teachers, school and then on city level, awarded scholarship plus monthly stipend.  It’s not perfect, it’s far from perfect. I agree, these all are basic needs but the basic change was what we needed.  Dissatisfaction:  The main dissatisfaction I have is the health care here. Despite having so many hospitals, I don’t trust the health care here.  Adding another dissatisfaction - wildlife management. Although it’s a difficult job due to being surrounded by wildlife, we still have rhinos walking on streets at night and also injuring humans.  I wonder if they are roaming streets due to not having enough space in the jungle. So idk how much attention they are getting. I hope the precious animals also get to live in peace as the development progresses.",

Ani bishnugupta Kathmandu airaney belama yo statue commission gareko. Made from nagdhunga (basal stone).  Yo statue chai harako thiyo (puriyeko) maybe due to lack of maintenance, earthquake who knows.   Malla raja ko palama euta kisan ley khanney belama bhettayo yo murti feri. Legend was that he hit the statue's toe and blood gushed out. Tyeti bela, for myriad of reason, it was named budhanilkantha. Probably because theological literacy wasn't high/ maybe the farmer was more of shiva bhakta. Maybe the coutnry was in the shiva bhakta phase as later royal families have been heavy shiva bhaktas.   Until later, when people recognized, ahh you bishnu ho siva hoina it's name was already 'sealed' as budhanilkantha, including the name for the area. Hence it's called budhanilkantha ani narayanthan.   |||Aww man I stole so much money  and fruits from this temple  When I was homeless.|||It is believed that a mirror image of Lord Shiva can be seen on the underside of the statue, which is surrounded by water from Gosainkunda (a lake created by Shiva).|||TLDR; Honestly, it’s Narayan (Vishnu), but you’d be surprised how often people get confused and wonder if it’s actually Buddha instead of Shiva.  From what I’ve read, the evidence leans much more toward it being a Narayana site. Budhanilakantha is one of only three Jalashayana Narayana (Vishnu sleeping on the cosmic waters) in Kathmandu Valley as far as I know. The other two are at Balaju (erected by the same patron king AFAIK)  and inside Hanuman Dhoka Palace, though that one was added much later by Pratap Malla.  Some old chronicles say that King Haridutta, around 350 A.D., built Budhanilakantha and also set up four other Narayana temples at the four corners of the Kathmandu Valley. That’s Changu, Bishankhu, Ichangu, and Shesh Narayan. Even today, people try to visit all four in one day, which is basically like doing a Narayan dham within valley. And very surprisingly, if you add Budhanilkantha (as fifth point) into the map it forms the legendary \"Khadga\" shape which is described to be the shape of ancient Kathmandu Town Planning. More so, these Narayana Shrines are located cardinally to each other which makes it much cooler (I cant infer much more from it than that lol). Here is the image for y'all to see: [https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0](https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0)  There’s also this story that King Haridutta saw Jalashayana Narayana in a dream, telling him to dig up the original image buried under the Rudramati riverbed. So he built a pond and installed the sculpture there, along with the four corner temples. This is confusing because , other historical analyses and inscriptions suggest the image was consecrated by ruler Visnugupta around 5th century A.D, much later than Haridutta.  The statue itself is amazing. It’s the largest stone sculpture in the Kathmandu Valley, carved from a single block of dark granite. Some stories say they dragged it across the Valley with forced labor, but some scholars argue the granite was actually nearby in the Shivapuri hills, which makes more sense (in some article by Sudarshan Raj  Tiwari, I am not sure). So I dont know which one is more valid, this or the claim mentioned by u/ZoWakaki above me.  Now, the most interesting part is that Buddhists also worship this image as Nilakantha Lokesvara, a form of Avalokitesvara. Avalokiteshvara is considered to be a form of Shiva in Buddhism or vise-a-versa, which can be one way where the Shiva/Vishnu connection in Budhanilkantha comes in place. In fact, if you look closely, you can almost see the Buddha’s forehead in the face of the sleeping Vishnu. Even the long ears of the statue are very reminiscent of Buddhist iconography we see around the valley.  As for the name Budhanilakantha, there’s a story about Shiva drinking poison during the Samudra Manthan. His throat was burning, so he struck the mountain with his trishul and created Gosaikunda Lake. The water from that lake is said to flow down to the pond at Budhanilakantha, and since Shiva’s called Nilakantha, that might be how the place got its name.

I can understand bringing a surprise for children or parents, but the expectation of gifts for everyone is ridiculous.   I had a scenario a few years ago where my brother is from Nepal and my SIL is from India. Bro and SIL were living in Delhi. Parents would travel to the US regularly to see my family and often spend a day or two in Delhi on there way to the US to see family. Always bringing gifts, no matter how tedious or common the visits were. One time my wife was about to give birth, so they jumped on a flight to the US to be with us. The had a 3 hour layover in Delhi, so they grabbed lunch with brother and SIL before their flight to the US. (Remember this is last minute, trying to rush to the USA to help). They didn’t bring my sister in law a formal present (that had been married for 8years) at the quick meeting between flight.  My SIL went home and threw a big fit about her not getting a gift and how disrespectful they were. She locked herself in her room pretended to cry for days.   Am I crazy for thinking my SIL was rude. Or, were my in-laws out of line for not bringing a gift in an emergency situation?  Edit: SIL’a family is well off and she has always been “spoiled”  Edit: My in-laws feel extremely guilty 10 years later for not breaking aging a gift on an emergency trip.  Edit: Spoiled SIL wouldn’t speak to family for almost 2 years after this.  🤦🏻‍♂️|||I'm also a 2nd gen and yes, this is very common. It annoys me because my family will choose a long layover or more difficult route to save like $300 then spend $1,000+ on gifts.   When I go alone I'll only buy stuff for close family.

I look at those big houses inside the ring road and think — what did their ancestors do differently? How did they manage to secure land in the most valuable parts of Kathmandu? Today those properties are worth crores, and the people who own them seem to have such a huge head start in life. Was it political connections? Business foresight? Old money from Rana times? Just luck and timing when land was cheap? Or were they simply more ambitious and risk-taking than the average family? Meanwhile, many of us are just trying to survive — paying rent, sending money home, saving slowly, feeling like we’re always starting from zero. Sometimes it feels like no matter how hard we work, generational wealth is on a completely different level. I don’t hate anyone for it. I’m just genuinely curious — how does that level of wealth and power actually get built in Nepal? And realistically, is it even possible for someone without that background to catch up?

He also enabled and encouraged migrants from Gorkha to squat on some of our ancestral properties. This was also reversed by a successor.

Either your fore-fathers had to living in prime locations for a long time like newars were which were then passed on to the current gen of newars or your caste was favoured by the regime and given \"Birta\" which was then passed on to the current gen of brahmins or chettris. Dalits lag behind the higest - we can gueess why.   Birta lands were royal grants of revenue-free property to elites, temples, or officials, originating from Licchavi-era (c. 400-750 CE) land assignments to feudatories and Brahmins.

I have seen people living in Baluwatar in surprisingly low quality buildings and living standards. Conversely, I have seen others become wealthy in just a few years, one person in particular grew so rich from hydropower shares that had previously left him desperate because they hadn't yielded results for years. He overnight turned his hut like house to a palace like building in same place.  ​Many factors contribute to these different head starts. While \"money attracts money\", United States becoming wealthy wasn't just about the valuable land they acquired centuries ago, we have seen many historically valuable lands sitting in ruins even today. The primary drivers of the early US economy were linked to Europe's colonial past, which extracted, looted and exploited wealth from around the world, especially India and Africa. Those wealthy individuals brought that capital and their slaves on early ships to the USA.  ​Furthermore, those who work for others may never accumulate as much wealth as those who innovate. Many residents in Baluwatar and other posh areas of Kathmandu today are not just the \"old money\" elite, but innovators who started only a decade or two ago. It is hard to imagine how much wealth a seemingly small business can accumulate if it is in the right place at the right time.|||Up until 30–40 years ago, buying land in Kathmandu was quite affordable sometimes even comparable to the price of land in rural districts. At the time, my mom chose to invest in more expensive land in Syangja rather than purchasing additional land in Samakhusi-Thamel area. In early 2040s 7 anna land in that area was 10k while in Syangja 13 anna was bought for 26k.

What cannot be doubted is that the prosecution against Rabi was very excessive compared to others like filing cases in 5 district courts when it could have been more streamlined .. the plan was to keep him in jail till after 2084 election and well know that.   Also.. a lot of Nepalis see total corruption from so many old politicians and nothing happens to them.. so don’t come here and give me this.|||The whole point is that this report failed to generate any legal liability against Rabi. The crime was not committed while running the Gorkha Media Network. It was committed while money was siphoned off from co-operatives for profit-seeking private investments; which is illegal. And the committee failed to implicate Rabi in that act.   Then the case against Rabi became one of motive. That’s why Oli government inflated the case to include money-laundering, which is not only serious but the law demands everyone who is associated in the act to be punished; even if any party is unaware of the crime being committed (which is what Rabi claims). But there is no ground to make a case of money laundering in this whole scandal. There are many reasons to scrutinize Rabi but this case and the findings that are made till now are not enough to call him guilty.|||Party wise , RSP alli kam bhrasta cha!!!

Authenticity is rare these days.  Maybe that smile was their way of saying,  “It’s alright. Relax.”  Maybe their eyes carried a message  you didn’t expect to understand.  Their smile, their glance,  the sudden softness in their voice,  it felt different compared to the start.

            "body": "I’ve always been curious about something. In many old Newari communities around the Kathmandu Valley — Bhaktapur, Patan, Kirtipur, old Kathmandu — you see incredibly narrow houses. Some of them look like they have only 4–5 feet of frontage. Sometimes the land isn’t even in aana — it’s in paisa or even dam. And it’s not just the houses. In some places, the “road” in front isn’t really a road at all. It’s a 2–3 feet wide galli. Sometimes it’s just a narrow passage between houses. No vehicle access. No sunlight for most of the day. Just brick walls, carved windows, and tight corners connecting to a chowk. From the outside, it looks almost impossible by modern standards. So I genuinely want to hear from someone who actually lives (or grew up) in one of these houses: How practical is daily life inside? Does it feel suffocating or just normal because you grew up with it? How do families manage space, privacy, storage? What about ventilation and sunlight? How do you bring in furniture, appliances, gas cylinders through such narrow gallis? During festivals or emergencies, how does it work? Does it feel safe or stressful? I’ve heard that historically taxes were sometimes based on frontage width, which might explain the narrow faces. And in dense traditional settlements, vertical houses made more sense. Plus, the chowks probably functioned as shared community space. But today — in modern life — how does it really feel? Is it a struggle? Is it beautiful chaos? Is it strong community bonding? Or is it something people want to escape from? Would really appreciate honest perspectives from people who’ve lived this reality.",

            "comments": "Now I grew up in one of those houses. My house wasn't super tight like those houses which have around 2 feet of galli access. Our galli is around 10 feet. The land area was 1 aana 1 paisa 1 daam.  The house was L shaped and only a small part of the house faced the galli. There was one small room in front of the house and one large'ish room in the back. In the middle was a small chowk. The house was just built with mud and bricks so the walls were super thick making the rooms even smaller.   The room in the front was really cosy, some would call it suffocating. My friends would say the room is like a walk in closet. But it faced the road and got some light. The room in the back faced the Chowk but the floors 0-2 saw no sunlight. A little bit of Sun in floors 3-4 in the back. The kausi got little Sun because the house on the south was taller and blocked the sunlight.  It was okay. We made it work. Moving furniture was impossible so we had to pull it in through the windows that were Chowk facing. Some floors were small like a little less than 6 feet and my tall friends' heads touched the ceiling.  We only had four family members so the living space was ample for us. At one point we had three other families renting and living on the ground floor and floor number one.  With such an old house, rain water would leak, no matter how much you cleaned it'd never be clean, a side of the house was open, no windows and was designed like a balcony so that side was our ventilation and furniture pulling spot. Cats and monkeys would enter from this space and raid our kitchen.  Earthquakes were scary but thankfully we rebuilt it before 2015. All the other old houses collapsed during the quake in our galli.  Now every house is new and there are shops and stores everywhere. People rent more than half of the house and the houses are 6.5 to 7.5 storeys tall.   I have really good memories in that house. It was small but it fit so many people during festivals and events. Sometimes we had to sit shoulder to shoulder. It worked for us though. I lived in it for 25 years. When I dream about my house, I still see the old one and not the new one.|||If you are really asking the person who live in them, chances are they are gonna say its normal. You dont ask a fish what its like always drowning in that water.   Habit Survival and Adaptation plays a major role. What might be narrow galli to us, might be enough for them, because they never got the luxury of wide roads.|||I used to live in one of those houses in Naradevi in my relatives house. The house lacked width but extended quite far back. So we had two rooms per floor separated by a staircase in the middle. The rooms were okay in size and fairly livable.  One advantage I found was that since houses were so small but tightly packed with others, it was as if whole area was a one big house which helped during earthquake.|||It is cold because there is no sun. It is not bad. Most shops are nearby.   Because Kathmandu is a shithole, you never feel it is shittier.|||As someone who lived on narrow house in patan and spacious house in imadol, On top of my mind, There are pros and cons  Cons 1. No parking space/ no private garden/ compound 2. Non spacious house/ conjusted rooms 3. Hassle in moving furnitures 4. High construction/repair costs 5. Low privay  Pros 1. Community support - you'll feel like a social animal 2. Guthi facilities- free tution classes, music /dance classes, other self dev classes, lot of parties (bhoj) . Use of communical resources. 3. Good water facilities 4. Good budget allocation by local authorities since there is unity among people. Very good acess to govt facilites.  5. Inclusion in festivities 6. With bit of architecture hacks you can live comfortably in small spaces aswell 7. Location - main one. Everything like market, school hspts, labim mall parks are in 15 m walking distance.  8. Security through community- low theft 9. During disaster times like earthquake, the community actually comes together to help each other . The resources are calculated in communal  Basis and guthi takes leadership during these times. 10. Better infrastructure like free garbage mgmt, free public places , better roads 11.  Culture   These are some i can think of. While new generations are moving out, older generations are still rigid in living in these areas even if they have to compromise on space.  Personally i prefer patan evn if we have house in imadol, but man how much i wish if i had a bigger house.|||As someone who lived on narrow house in patan and spacious house in imadol, On top of my mind, There are pros and cons  Cons 1.

            "body": "Sharing an update on NARADA, an intelligence platform I have been building that aggregates publicly available government data across Nepal into one analytical system. A lot has changed since my last post, so here is what is new.  \\*\\*Geospatial Damage Analysis:\\*\\*  The platform now runs spatial analysis using Sentinel-1 (SAR radar) and Sentinel-2 (optical) satellite imagery. It works by comparing pre-event and post-event radar reflections using pixel-wise t-tests to detect structural damage to buildings, even through cloud cover. The system classifies damage zones by severity (Critical, Severe, Moderate, Minor) with 95% confidence scores. This can be applied to natural disasters, civil unrest, or any event where infrastructure damage needs rapid assessment without people on the ground.  \\*\\*Corporate Intelligence:\\*\\*  Every registered company in Nepal (341,801 as of now) has been scraped from CAMIS (Company and Industry Registration System). Each company record includes registration date, type, district, and directors. To detect hidden links between companies, I extract phone numbers from registrations, hash them using HMAC-SHA256 for privacy, and then cluster matches. This found 6,388 phone clusters linking 14,613 companies, meaning thousands of seemingly separate companies share contact information.  Government contract data from 2020 to present has also been scraped. This gets cross-referenced with company records to flag anomalies like a single entity receiving disproportionate contract awards, or newly registered companies winning large tenders.  One concrete finding: a single phone number cluster linked to 51 companies, all registered as agricultural firms. The pattern is consistent with shell companies created to exploit agricultural tax exemptions.  \\*\\*Trade Intelligence\\*\\*  Customs import/export data (1.68 million rows, 6,073 HS codes) is processed to map trade flows by commodity, partner country, and customs office. The system calculates trade balances and can flag anomalies like unusual pricing, volume spikes, or routing patterns that are commonly associated with trade-based money laundering.  \\*\\*What is coming next\\*\\*  Director and shareholder data for public companies will be linked into the corporate graph soon, which will allow mapping of beneficial ownership networks across Nepal’s corporate landscape.  Important note: All data used in this project comes from publicly available government sources. No private data is accessed or stored. Phone numbers are hashed and never displayed in raw form.

High tech manufacturing like electronics and component will be especially trickier to get right. It’ll require huge capital intake and a lot of shared knowledge of building and operating, which I don’t think exists in the Nepal at the moment. Not to say that one cannot come upon a niche opportunity/gap in the market that could be utilised. From my perspective of someone who’s worked in the sector (in and outside Nepal) a large focus is better utilised on building self sustainable small and medium FMCG markets and keep innovating and spending to build knowledge and expertise which could perhaps open doors for greater value added exports as well.|||You cannot beat India and China on mass producing specially when you import raw material from them. |||> Okay, short description yesma Dina parda, aba ko kehi barsa ma kaso Nepal le electricity ma stability Lina nasakla ta, yedi electricity, manufacturing ko cost thorai xa vane, bechna pani sasto ma milyo, hoina rw?  I think the current strategy of building run off the river hydropower is good. It has less environmental impact compared to submerging thousands of villages and forcing them to move away (like the three gorges dam did) and we should start building solar power on an industrial scale and start attaching it to the grid as soon as possible so factories can run during the day for cheaper without cutting into the electricity we need to live our lives in the evening.   That being said, the biggest problems we have are not technical. It is more political and societal. We should not forget what started the Gen Z protests. The politicians who promise a \"quick fix\" to deep problems like monkeys destroying crops by saying something like we will export monkey meat are still running for office and are viable candidates. We need to fix this madness first. I know I am in /r/technepal and we don't like to get too political but really we can't do any long term planning without reducing corruption and nepotism. I won't say completely eliminating because I know it is not possible but we really need to decrease the amount of bribes it takes to get anything done.

Windows just works with way more engineering and CAD software you’ll probably use during your degree. Macs are nice but can run into compatibility hassles or need awkward workarounds.  If you must have a laptop aim for something like:  * CPU: Intel i7 / i9 (get newer versions) * RAM: 16 GB min, 32 GB is even better long-term (more RAM helps with bigger CAD files esp. if you're getting a laptop because adding RAM later on laptop can be a hassle) * Storage: 512 GB SSD minimum, 1 TB is ideal * GPU: A dedicated GPU like NVIDIA RTX 30- or 40-series (e.g., 3050, 3060, 4050) pick the latest one within your budget.  There are a lot of gaming laptops with those specs around \\~1200 EUR just pick a decent brand.  But honestly if you can consider a desktop instead I’d say go for a desktop. You’ll get way more performance for your money, way easier upgrades later, and it’ll handle CAD and workloads much better than a laptop at the same price.      That setup will easily cover light CAD, C coding, even some AI/Deep Learning and whatever else your courses throw at you and should stay solid throughout your bachelor.",

Integrating annotation and opinion-tracking features would allow lawmakers to document their perspectives directly within the policy text clearly surfacing pros, cons, and trade-offs during deliberation. This would transform policy review from a manual, fragmented process into a structured, evidence-driven workflow.  The result would be faster, more informed policy amendment discussions grounded in current global best practices, ultimately accelerating institutional learning and national development.

            "body": "I’ve been working as a manual QA engineer for almost a year now, but I’m feeling stuck. My salary is below the basic rate for my role, and my current job only involves manual testing, which I’m starting to find boring. I’ve expressed interest in learning automation, but my company is pushing me to use AI to generate test scripts, which benefits the company but doesn’t help me grow as a QA professional. On LinkedIn, I’m also noticing that most QA engineer vacancies require 3+ years of experience.  I’m frustrated because I feel like I’m not gaining any technical skills that will help me advance in my career, and I’m concerned that manual QA doesn’t offer the same financial growth opportunities as development roles. I don’t have much interest in backend development, but when I started in QA, I didn’t have much interest in it either, yet here I am, so I’m wondering if I could transition into backend development.  My question: Is it possible to self-learn backend development, build a solid portfolio, and land an associate backend engineer role? Or would I need to start as an intern(backend) to make the switch? Has anyone here made a similar transition? or any other better option for my case?",

But it does show that the person is incapable of finding someone who He/she can stay with. The person is incapable of maintaining health relationship. The person jumps from one partner to another just for the sake of filling the gap of relationship status rather than to find the genuine connection. So for me personally, I would not consier someone with multiple body count bad person, but I will know for the fact that they can not be a good patner. The problem is they are incapable of finding right person which makes them dumb, or they themself have problem which is why people leave you.|||![gif](giphy|LKFzjcZmI42iMpdjVS|downsized)|||![gif](giphy|4mqBypbaolvdCeoqLD|downsized)|||This whole comment section is cringe|||All the men commenting here remind me of the guy who was pro feminism in all of his comments, and was texting every girl in here.

I think the difference is when there was controversy with Balen like in the vehicle case, the replies were mostly criticism. There wasn't a wave of blind supporters with comments of support.

The biggest signs are: recently made accounts with huge number of comments/posts, low karma for an account with such a large number of posts.

Most of the action is Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and WhatsApp (though I’m not sure how impactful WhatsApp is in Nepal, it’s probably the most impact in India). It really wouldn’t make sense to spend much money in this platform.  Secondly, almost every other post is pro-RSP. A guy yesterday literally wrote a post “Bakhra chor Gagane” or something and got 40-50 likes and a bunch of engagement. 8/10 posts are pro-RSP posts and most of these Gagan IT cells are mostly in the comments. So your complaint is just idiotic, but I don’t expect anything else from people like you.  Anyways, Reddit was used by IT cells for a while for elite opinion capture but with the massive influx of RSP supporters (or likely the political awakening of the younger demographics to politics in general, who after the gen-z protests naturally became pro-Balen and with that pro-RSP), I don’t think they even do that. A lot of “high-level” people in Nepal’s media/political landscape used to lurk or use anon accounts here (not this stupid sub but r/nepal), but most seem to be more comfortable in Twitter nowadays. There is literally no benefit in using IT cells here. Better to use that money geo-targeting in Facebook posts in needed constituencies.|||Jasle J bhaneos, tyo ball-less Gagane muji kei kaam chaina.

Nepali people from gulf countries, especially girls who were abused/ scammed by manpower used to call him. He tried to solve almost of the problem. He even brought many nepalese back to nepal when they wanted to return but couldn't. And that is the reason he has many fans following in gulf countries.  One time, even a foreign girl called him and asked for help as she got scammed by nepali man.  Rabi almost slapped a teacher in hotel when the teacher called student girl in hotel to r@p3 by blackmailing  In every programme, he used to get around 4/5 call asking for help. He did it for around 10 years. That is the reason he has many old fan following too because they have watched him for long.  He used to called ministers and connected him with victims to solve the problems. He did at that time when there was low awarenessthan now, and other so-called journalist used to be puppet of partys'.

That contribution is real and deserves acknowledgment.  But we also have to honestly accept that he pioneered and normalized media trial in Nepal. What began as issue-based journalism slowly turned into a practice where suspects were publicly named, confronted, and morally judged before any court verdict. Even if the intention was to deliver quick justice, this set a dangerous precedent.  Media trial shifts power from the judiciary to the media, without accountability or due process. Once this practice became popular, others copied it — often in more reckless and sensational ways. Today, we see how easily public opinion can be manipulated, and how reputations can be destroyed without legal proof.  Acknowledging his positive impact does not mean ignoring the long-term consequences of this approach. Good intentions do not justify a flawed method. If we want a mature democracy, media must inform and question, not replace courts. Learning from this mistake is as important as appreciating his achievements.|||True|||yes agree|||Yes, I remember my dad used to watch his program \"sidha Kura janta saga\" where he provided help to the  helpless.

Its just either computer or bio to choose from. Tara maths ma ramro xau vane u can take management too. Management ma u can take subjects like  general mathematics and business maths. But aba plus two ma aisakesi math will be a bit different but u can cope with it if u r interested in maths. Aba its ur choice, if you want to pursue a career in applied science like engineering then you can choose pcm as your subjects basically (Science stream). If you want to pursue a career in financial science like business management then you can choose management as your field of study. Tara in the context of countries like Nepal you can study applied science only if you had studied pcm in plus two. So aba Nepal mai basera padhne soch xa vane I would recommend pcm, tara if you are likely to study in foreign countries than management lida ni testo farak pardaina. But if ur sure studying financial sciences then u can study management.|||4 gpa holder here (opt math+computer) Aba for me, 4 gpa ayepacchi ta it's automatically science (ofc, I didn't even have a choice) Ani are you sure you dont want to take bio?

Bio linu ko faida chhai euta k ho bhanda you can go to ANY field of your choice after +2.  Bio is only if you are not so sure. Bit, seems like you won't take bio so let me come to your question. Timro aim SEE ma 3.8 ho bhane tyo bhanda ramrai hunchha, dw. Aba ramro bhayesi ig parents will expect you to take science.  If you have the choice between  PCM or Management, it's more about what you want.  Have you thought of your aim? If you are sure that you are doing CA/BBA/BBM/BHM... then why take PCM?  But if you are not so sure, then PCM would be best for you.  Hope i didn't overexplain.

It was for a few days and damn. I used to write in cursive, not pretty cursive but the progressive kinda yk.   It was a lot of pressure for 11 year old me😭 i practiced those stupid monocursive alphabets so much that I couldn't even write the small 's' differently for years. Like, i remember her teaching it like, sad smile, happy smile and connect or something like that. I was onto some running for validation type shii.   I quit that monocursive thing and embraced my cursive again tara this pretty wala.

Try to see what kind of narrative UML is spreading.   The most likely candidate is Gagan. Old Congressis will vote for Gagan (2022's biggest party) and pull in the progressive vote also.|||A lot of assumptions but yeah I think the good thing after this Gen-z protests has been that the tauke haru are out or almost out of electoral politics. Deuba is gone, Prachanda went to the easiest constituency for Maobadi to win but even there he’s going up against the son of two Maobadi soldiers who lost their lives in the Maoist insurgency and KP Oli looks very likely to lose he is scrambling everywhere.   Honestly had Gagan not done his bisesh mahadivesh, the 3 parties already had plans to form a coalition and fight the election as one alliance. And it is his stance of not forming any coalition that we have such a strong competition now. But I’m not gonna lie, nothing is fundamentally going to change whoever comes to power. There doesn’t seem to be any proposal for institutional change in Nepal. RSP is basically running on “Out with the old and In with the new” but not new policies (case in point Balen’s Socialist tilt, his post about that cement factory etc).  It seems they just mean out with old people and in with the younger people. Gagan talks about institutional change, how he is going to be the Tony Blair of Nepal and bring about the “Third Way” and revise Nepal’s economy back to the 90’s era of liberalism. And that all sounds good but knowing Congress, a party that is so deeply entrenched in the status quo, I don’t buy it.   Atleast we will get new faces in parliament, some people seem to be very funny so we will get new contents to laugh at.|||Balen is a wrong choice, mark my comment|||The way Gagan led this time is history, natra pheri Oli ra Deuba milera paila kai khel khelthe|||Just two different player to manipulate bheda public.|||Mark my words ,gagan will be pm after election.|||If gagan will be Pm then it is only possible from congress's alliance of rsp  So  Rsp won't be in opposition anyhow|||bro dont take oli lightly in jhapa he won there 5 time huu|||[removed]|||Balen might not win, jhapalis are not ready for change yet, sorry but the later is a fact ! I support balen !|||I honestly don’t know if people in this thread don’t want Balen to win or are just grossly overestimating old parties. Or whether I am delusional.  This election is the by-product of a major revolution which overthrew the government. The opposition has won every single election following revolutions - Jana Andolan I (Nepal Congress won the elections after the dissolution of Panchayat) - Jana Andolan II (CPN Maoist won the 2008 constituent assembly). RSP is the radical opposition as most of the influential figureheads of the revolution have now joined the party.  And you can clearly see the hype behind Balen and how RSP became a top 4 party in just 6 months of formation in the last election.   Oli might have won numerous elections in Jhapa-5, but I would put my money on Balen from a statistical perspective. Most importantly, he won with a 55.7% share in the 2022 elections. Why do you think it’s so hard to topple him over? And with Balen out of all the people|||Oli is not going to get defeated that easily. I want Balen to win but truth is Jhapa ma he is strong.

Record anusar, statue was commissioned by Vishugupta of the gupta dynasty (son of the more famous Jisnugupta) tyeti bela Lichhavi dynasty was like a vassal state to the gupta dynasty. Ani bishnugupta Kathmandu airaney belama yo statue commission gareko. Made from nagdhunga (basal stone).  Yo statue chai harako thiyo (puriyeko) maybe due to lack of maintenance, earthquake who knows.   Malla raja ko palama euta kisan ley khanney belama bhettayo yo murti feri. Legend was that he hit the statue's toe and blood gushed out. Tyeti bela, for myriad of reason, it was named budhanilkantha. Probably because theological literacy wasn't high/ maybe the farmer was more of shiva bhakta. Maybe the coutnry was in the shiva bhakta phase as later royal families have been heavy shiva bhaktas.   Until later, when people recognized, ahh you bishnu ho siva hoina it's name was already 'sealed' as budhanilkantha, including the name for the area. Hence it's called budhanilkantha ani narayanthan.   |||Aww man I stole so much money  and fruits from this temple  When I was homeless.|||It is believed that a mirror image of Lord Shiva can be seen on the underside of the statue, which is surrounded by water from Gosainkunda (a lake created by Shiva).|||TLDR; Honestly, it’s Narayan (Vishnu), but you’d be surprised how often people get confused and wonder if it’s actually Buddha instead of Shiva.  From what I’ve read, the evidence leans much more toward it being a Narayana site. Budhanilakantha is one of only three Jalashayana Narayana (Vishnu sleeping on the cosmic waters) in Kathmandu Valley as far as I know. The other two are at Balaju (erected by the same patron king AFAIK)  and inside Hanuman Dhoka Palace, though that one was added much later by Pratap Malla.  Some old chronicles say that King Haridutta, around 350 A.D., built Budhanilakantha and also set up four other Narayana temples at the four corners of the Kathmandu Valley. That’s Changu, Bishankhu, Ichangu, and Shesh Narayan. Even today, people try to visit all four in one day, which is basically like doing a Narayan dham within valley. And very surprisingly, if you add Budhanilkantha (as fifth point) into the map it forms the legendary \"Khadga\" shape which is described to be the shape of ancient Kathmandu Town Planning. More so, these Narayana Shrines are located cardinally to each other which makes it much cooler (I cant infer much more from it than that lol). Here is the image for y'all to see: [https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0](https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0)  There’s also this story that King Haridutta saw Jalashayana Narayana in a dream, telling him to dig up the original image buried under the Rudramati riverbed. So he built a pond and installed the sculpture there, along with the four corner temples. This is confusing because , other historical analyses and inscriptions suggest the image was consecrated by ruler Visnugupta around 5th century A.D, much later than Haridutta.  The statue itself is amazing. It’s the largest stone sculpture in the Kathmandu Valley, carved from a single block of dark granite. Some stories say they dragged it across the Valley with forced labor, but some scholars argue the granite was actually nearby in the Shivapuri hills, which makes more sense (in some article by Sudarshan Raj  Tiwari, I am not sure). So I dont know which one is more valid, this or the claim mentioned by u/ZoWakaki above me.  Now, the most interesting part is that Buddhists also worship this image as Nilakantha Lokesvara, a form of Avalokitesvara. Avalokiteshvara is considered to be a form of Shiva in Buddhism or vise-a-versa, which can be one way where the Shiva/Vishnu connection in Budhanilkantha comes in place. In fact, if you look closely, you can almost see the Buddha’s forehead in the face of the sleeping Vishnu. Even the long ears of the statue are very reminiscent of Buddhist iconography we see around the valley.  As for the name Budhanilakantha, there’s a story about Shiva drinking poison during the Samudra Manthan. His throat was burning, so he struck the mountain with his trishul and created Gosaikunda Lake. The water from that lake is said to flow down to the pond at Budhanilakantha, and since Shiva’s called Nilakantha, that might be how the place got its name.

I was hooked on it for two things. It had a monthly satirical column from Manoj Gajurel and childhood memoirs of Khagendra Sangraula. And their cover stories were also always interesting. On one issue, the cover story was a biography of \"Che Guevara\". I really liked him from then.   And when I was in college I used to dislike this one guy from our class. He low key used to irritate me. He was like ali dherai pose dekhauna parne, sir le padai rako bela taai na tui ko question sodhne, remarks dina parne. One day during a gap period we were talking with classmates and somehow the topic of Che Guevara came. Apparently he also admired Che Guevara. He told me about Che's book \"The motorcycle diaries\". He was also surprised that I knew about Che. From then on we got along quite well and became very good friends. He is one of my best friends now.   When I was 21 I got my first tattoo, this same photo of Che on my arm. When I turned 30, I did a world tour. I started in South America and spent 3 months there. And traveled further and made one circle around the world. If I hadn't read \"The motorcycle diaries\" then I wouldn't have got the inspiration to go to South America.  I think reading his biography had a really big impact on me. I like the guy a lot for what he fought for. He inspired me to make a courageous decision to travel around the world.

            "body": "I’ve grown up casually using the word **“last / lastai”** in everyday Nepali  tuff like (*ma ta lastai zhyap  bhaye* , *lastai dhani ho)* and so on. It’s always felt totally normal. But recently I paused and actually thought about it, and now it feels… kind of weird?  In “proper” or older Nepali, **“last” doesn’t really mean anything**. It’s obviously not a native word, and even its English meaning (“final”) has nothing to do with how we use it. And yet it’s everywhere now, especially in urban Nepali.  So I’ve been wondering:  * How did **“last”** end up meaning *“extremely”* or *“intensely”* in Nepali instead of *“final”*? * Why did Nepali pick up this English word when we already had intensifiers like **धेरै, एकदमै, निकै, अति**? * Is **“lastai”** more about borrowing *vibe / tone* rather than literal meaning? * Do other languages (especially multilingual or post-colonial ones) have words like this  ones that make zero etymological sense but still work perfectly in everyday speech? * And why do you think this kind of shift happened **specifically in Nepal**, and mostly in recent decades?  Would love to hear thoughts from linguistics nerds, older speakers, or anyone who’s noticed how Nepali has been changing   especially with the internet and urban culture.",

One is the government and authorities trying to suppress our freedom of speech, which is a legitimate concern. Though have not seen much push from the government after the infamous social media bill proposed by the Oli Govt.  The second one is media, both legacy and new online-based, and influences censoring themselves lest it make them controversial or disrupt their monetization. Add to that media-people feeding their own biases, amplifying their own echo-chamber and downright peddling lies and deception for monetary gain. This is self-imposed and stems from human fear and greed, not directly government tyranny.

            "body": "i work for a Nepali pharmaceutical company. For the first time in Nepal, we’ve launched locally made medicines for asthma and COPD.  For context: respiratory drugs are the **3rd highest-selling therapeutic segment in Nepal**. Asthma and COPD inhalers alone account for **\\~NPR 2 Arabs  in annual sales**. Historically, about **80% of this market was controlled by one Indian company (Cipla)**, and the remaining 20% was split between a few Indian and Bangladeshi companies.  This is only our **second fiscal year**, and somehow we managed to capture **5–6% market share in the first year itself**. That’s something we’re genuinely proud of.  But here’s the part that’s breaking my motivation: **doctors’ demands**.  Almost every doctor asks for money or “support.” It’s the market norm. Almost every company pays. Prescriptions are openly transactional. Ethics are just buzzwords for conferences.  Our CEO started this respiratory segment after the **2015 blockade**, with the idea of making Nepal at least a little more **self-reliant** in this very technical and critical category. DPI inhalers are not easy to make—there’s a reason very few companies here even attempt it.  Meanwhile:  * Indian pharma companies are **billion-dollar giants** * They have **multiple segments**, massive margins * They get **government subsidies** * Their **cost of production is far lower** * **1% of India’s pharma capacity can supply all of Nepal**  Despite all this, we price our products **lower**, so Nepali patients can save **a few hundred rupees every month**.   We supply huge volumes through **tenders at prices even lower than our own selling price**.   Our margins are thin.      BUT.Doctors don’t give a single shee  about any of this.  I’m honestly not even against paying (keeping gifts aside) . I’ve constantly paid for Direct cash ,Expensive dinners, Lunch packages ,flight tickets , holiday trips  ,even internet bills and  asics shoes ffs.   But at least let it make sense.  If I’m giving someone **1lakh**, I expect **10 lakh** in return. That’s the unspoken thumb rule in this system. But some doctors don’t even do that. They use us as leverage to blackmail bigger Indian companies into paying them more.  I don’t expect patriotism.   I don’t expect ideology.  But if you’re taking money, **at least be loyal**.  There *are* a few genuinely humble and ethical doctors who support us, and I respect them deeply.Some are actually even giving us a good return for our investments. But the majority? They’re just abusing us and companies like ours in the process.  How is a domestic pharmaceutical industry supposed to survive like this?   How do you build anything sustainable when ethics are optional and corruption is normalised?  Just needed to get this off my chest.",

I have seen people living in Baluwatar in surprisingly low quality buildings and living standards. Conversely, I have seen others become wealthy in just a few years, one person in particular grew so rich from hydropower shares that had previously left him desperate because they hadn't yielded results for years. He overnight turned his hut like house to a palace like building in same place.  ​Many factors contribute to these different head starts. While \"money attracts money\", United States becoming wealthy wasn't just about the valuable land they acquired centuries ago, we have seen many historically valuable lands sitting in ruins even today. The primary drivers of the early US economy were linked to Europe's colonial past, which extracted, looted and exploited wealth from around the world, especially India and Africa. Those wealthy individuals brought that capital and their slaves on early ships to the USA.  ​Furthermore, those who work for others may never accumulate as much wealth as those who innovate. Many residents in Baluwatar and other posh areas of Kathmandu today are not just the \"old money\" elite, but innovators who started only a decade or two ago. It is hard to imagine how much wealth a seemingly small business can accumulate if it is in the right place at the right time.|||Up until 30–40 years ago, buying land in Kathmandu was quite affordable sometimes even comparable to the price of land in rural districts. At the time, my mom chose to invest in more expensive land in Syangja rather than purchasing additional land in Samakhusi-Thamel area. In early 2040s 7 anna land in that area was 10k while in Syangja 13 anna was bought for 26k. Given the current real estate market, that sounds unbelievable to us now.|||[धेरैले यो भिडियो share गर्दा delete गरिदिए। Reddit sites मा। यो भिडियोमा अबको केही वर्षमा रोजगारी कम हुने पक्का भन्ने विश्लेषण वरिष्ठ पत्रकार विजय कुमारले गरेका छन्। आउदो दिनमा सिमा सुरक्षा कम हुँदै गयो भने, देश सुरक्षित हुने छैन।यो भिडियो share गरिदिनुहोला](https://youtube.com/shorts/c0NVp0fkIQ8?si=D10ZK1vHf3kMt0tt)",

Because nobody is running on reforming the bureaucracy. Whoever wins will give vague orders to do certain things and in a certain way. Orders with no legislation backing them.

The new parties are the worst at this because they’re essentially just populists trying to ride the wave of frustration from the older parties. Unless political parties actually have legislative priorities to reform the bureaucracy, nothing can even begin to change. But that is just boring policy and not popular.

            "comments": "This is closer to the original Tibetan recipe, or commonly known as 'Darjeeling' momo. I personally like it this way too. I actually know 1 person who does not like this kind of momo, says it is too bland! If you want it even simpler, try without garlic. I also add onions, along with green onions, but if you do, need to remove as much water from raw onions as possible. Also try adding some veg oil and butter.  |||It's the achaar that is more important.|||That's your opinion and that's perfectly fine. There's no right or wrong way to enjoy food. I like masala in my momo.|||I agree. Because we eat it with jhol or twakka pareko achaar. masala in the filling tends to overpower everything. Using only chicken breast can make the filling bland, but using different cuts of meat adds much more flavour, texture, umami and juiciness.    For veg momo, I use dried and soaked mushrooms, regular mushrooms, tofu, and cabbage + ginger and garlic and it tastes soo good! |||Yes, like someone else said, Tibetan momos aren't spicy. They use yak or beef too, so it's got a supportive flavor profile for that.  Ones that originated out of the valley use buff though. And they use spices because it absolutely rocks your tastebuds, and at times are delicious even without the chutney/jhol. Places like shandar/narayan dai momo taste great just on themselves easily.  There's no proving you wrong if it's your choice/tastes. But the purbeli type momo you described, I find really bland.|||I see you are man with fine palate. Besides, maybe buff they really don't need masala.|||I don't know what they put it in, but I love shaandar, narayan dai, kiran dai style momo taste. I could eat them everyday.|||I'll be back in Nepal in two weeks and happy to have this problem to sort out. |||Okay so basically I had steamed packaged frozen Korean or Japanese mo:mo: from a 7-11 (not Nepal obviously) and it was really bad and it's only salvation was a condiment of spicy sauce that I had brought independently several weeks prior.   QED for a nepalese, a mo:mo: without a masala is not worth having. Though I suppose those mo:mo: did not have garlic either perhaps.|||Yes, masala wala ta samosa khaye jasto lagyo malai,|||I agree|||For me if you put masala (apart from ginger, onion, fillings, spring onion and coriander) then I call it tarkari momo. No garlic either. Garlic has strong taste and ruins the simple taste of momo. Sadly, ktm ma dherai jaso tarkari momo paucha.",

I’m a man with no heart, no connection, no emotions, no relationships. I’m even heartless toward my family, let alone college mates or workmates. It’s not like I don’t have a heart but I killed that side to survive in this world, because my authentic side was too good. I noticed that and I killed it, to play the game of life.  Maybe because of that or maybe I don’t know, I don’t fit into my college and I never fit in with people. So I don’t have a social life and I don’t really care about those things either.  I go to college, then work, then repeat the process again and again. I would be fine with this if I had time to study or if my paycheck was good but neither is true. Lately, I’m feeling tired of this cycle.  There is only one reason why I’m feeling like this, and it is money. I have a mix of emotions toward this word.  I badly want to focus on my studies, but because of college load, work and the constant pressure of everything. I don’t have much energy left at the end of the day.  It’s not like I don’t have potential, I do, but I feel like I’m not able to use it and I’m just stuck in a loop.  Now it seems like I need to take a few weeks break, just focus on my studies and then find another job after refreshing myself. This is probably the best option i guess.  But in the end, just like the second line, I killed that boy. I killed that innocence. I killed that kindness in me. That side still exists but I wear a mask because I feel it’s necessary to play this materialistic game of life. I want to reach the top, experience everything, and then become a Buddha again.",

My feed is suddenly filled with content from Nepali girls/women posting what I'd call softcore stuff – semi-nude poses, revealing outfits, a lot of emphasis on body exposure under the guise of \"art\" or empowerment. It's everywhere, from reels to stories.  I'm curious: Do these creators know that a big chunk of their male followers might be there primarily for the physical appeal rather than appreciating it as art or self-expression? Or is it all part of the algorithm game where engagement trumps intent?  Not judging anyone – people can post what they want, and followers can choose what to engage with. But as someone from Nepal seeing this shift, it makes me wonder about the cultural implications, the impact on perceptions of Nepali women, and whether Instagram's push for viral content is blurring lines between empowerment and objectification.  What are your thoughts? Have you noticed this trend? Creators here – what's your take on audience motivations? Let's keep it respectful and insightful.  Thanks",

Recently, I received a full-time remote offer from a foreign company offering more than **double my current salary** (paid in USD).  Current situation:  * Current net salary: \\~NPR 90,000/month ( Gross 115000) * New offer: \\~$1800/month (2lakhs46thousands) * No equity in current company * Contract notice period: 2 months * New role: same level (Tech Lead), full-time remote  I feel conflicted because:  * It’s only been 4 months since I joined * The startup relies heavily on me * But the financial jump is significant * The new job starts in about 40 days, I cant complete my full notice period here.  I didn’t actively plan to leave; this opportunity came unexpectedly.  For people working in tech in Nepal:  * Is leaving after 4 months a bad move? * Would you prioritize the salary jump and international exposure? * How would you handle this situation professionally?  Looking for honest opinions and personal experiences. Thanks!",

OR      2) If no equity, just leave ASAP!!! you don't have to feel bad for your boss / seniors / company / friends who don't value your labour and contribution (assuming you are the tech lead taking big decisions that make or break the company's future)     DM me if you or the company or both want to negotiate an equity vesting plan that justifies the contribution for both parties.

Mine is 2.75% per annum.   What i try to do with my salary is... Save 50% enjoy with 25% and invest 25%. I found this method on the internet long time ago and tried my best to stick to it. Most of it gets spend on my clg fees or when doing big purchase like phone, laptop etc which in a way i believe is an investment / what you deserve kind of thing.   Then i invest 25% or sometimes more on the share market. I hope you are already filling IPOs at least as that has made me good money which i started 4-5 years ago. With secondary market also i have got 3X 4X sometimes 5X the bank interest rates returns over these years. (Currently in loss haha:) So i recommend you to start investing by learning about it first..   With savings alone.. i think you are privileged and doing better than 90% lol.

Your math is spot on, paying $21,600/year (approx 30 Lakhs NPR) for standard time-tracking features is a massive leak in your OpEx.  Building this in-house is the correct move for a team of 300+, but you need the right architecture so you don't cripple your employees' computers.  **The Architecture I Recommend:**  * **Desktop Agent (The Tracker):** Built with **Tauri (Rust + JS)**. Unlike Electron apps which eat 200MB+ RAM, a Tauri app is tiny (<15MB) and uses negligible memory. It stays invisible until needed. * **Backend & Dashboard:** **Laravel + FilamentPHP**. This handles the multi-tenancy, employee management, and provides a clean admin panel for your screenshots and time logs. * **Storage: AWS S3 / Any s3 compatible provider of your choice:** critical when you are syncing thousands of screenshots daily.  **My Quote & Estimation:** We can build a production-ready version of \"Time Monitor\" (custom branded for you) for a **one-time fee**.  * **Development Cost:** **NPR 10 lakhs** (One-time). * **Timeline:** 4-6 Weeks (Dev + QA). * **Deliverables:** Windows/Mac/Linux agents + Web admin Dashboard + Source Code.  **Your New Recurring Costs (Infrastructure):** You move from paying $1,800/month to paying for raw server usage only:  * **VPS (Hetzner/DigitalOcean/Local provider in Nepal ( Datahub )):** \\~$30/month. * **Storage (Screenshots):** \\~$10-$20/month. * **Code Signing Cert (Required for Windows/Mac):** \\~$30/month (amortized). * **Total:** **\\~$80/month.** (You save \\~95% immediately).  **Why the quote range?** The complexity isn't in taking screenshots; it's in the edge cases. Handling offline syncing (when internet cuts out), idle time detection (keyboard/mouse hooks without false positives), and auto-updating 300 clients requires robust engineering, not just a script.

Good luck bro.|||I myself have been doing remote jobs along with my Filipino partner, it's mostly about how you appeal the clients rather than just skills, i would say 80% of it is grabbing their attention and the rest is the actual work.

PDF: Nepal is a landlocked country located in South Asia, bordered by China to the north and India to the south, east, and west. It is renowned for its dramatic geography, which ranges from the lowland Terai plains in the south to the towering Himalayan mountain range in the north, including Mount Everest, the highest peak in the world at 8,848.86 meters. Nepal has a rich cultural and historical heritage shaped by Hinduism and Buddhism, with ancient cities like Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, and Patan showcasing centuries-old temples, palaces, and intricate wood carvings. The country is the birthplace of Lord Buddha, who was born in Lumbini around the 6th century BCE. Nepal follows a federal democratic republic system and is divided into seven provinces after the constitution was adopted in 2015. Nepali is the official language, but the country is ethnically and linguistically diverse, with over 120 languages spoken. Agriculture remains a major part of the economy, employing a large portion of the population, while tourism is another vital sector due to trekking, mountaineering, and cultural tourism. Despite its natural beauty and cultural wealth, Nepal faces challenges such as political instability, economic dependency on remittances, natural disasters like earthquakes, and infrastructure limitations. The devastating earthquake of 2015 caused massive loss of life and heritage sites, but the country has shown resilience through reconstruction and social unity. Nepal maintains a unique identity through its traditions, festivals like Dashain and Tihar, and its ability to balance ancient customs with gradual modernization.  # Questions I tested in the video  **Single-Chunk Question**   • What countries border Nepal?  **Multi-Chunk Question**   • Why is Nepal considered geographically diverse?  **Complex / Reasoning Question**   • How do Nepal’s geography and economy influence each other?  **Cross-Context Question**   • Explain how Nepal’s religious history contributes to its tourism industry.  **Hallucination Test**   • Who was the first king of unified Nepal?  The knowledge base is intentionally small so retrieval behavior is easy to observe.  # Tech stack  * **Frontend:** React * **Backend:** Node.js + Express * **Database:** PostgreSQL ( for user data) * **Vector DB:** ChromaDB * **LLM:** Gemini * **Embeddings:** Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2  # Looking for feedback on  * Chunk size & overlap strategies * Better ways to handle hallucination detection * RAG evaluation ideas (precision/recall, answer grounding, etc.) * Any missing features you’d expect in a “real” RAG system  This is a learning project, not production — open to suggestions and critique",

            "body": "Sharing an update on NARADA, an intelligence platform I have been building that aggregates publicly available government data across Nepal into one analytical system. A lot has changed since my last post, so here is what is new.  \\*\\*Geospatial Damage Analysis:\\*\\*  The platform now runs spatial analysis using Sentinel-1 (SAR radar) and Sentinel-2 (optical) satellite imagery. It works by comparing pre-event and post-event radar reflections using pixel-wise t-tests to detect structural damage to buildings, even through cloud cover. The system classifies damage zones by severity (Critical, Severe, Moderate, Minor) with 95% confidence scores. This can be applied to natural disasters, civil unrest, or any event where infrastructure damage needs rapid assessment without people on the ground.  \\*\\*Corporate Intelligence:\\*\\*  Every registered company in Nepal (341,801 as of now) has been scraped from CAMIS (Company and Industry Registration System). Each company record includes registration date, type, district, and directors. To detect hidden links between companies, I extract phone numbers from registrations, hash them using HMAC-SHA256 for privacy, and then cluster matches. This found 6,388 phone clusters linking 14,613 companies, meaning thousands of seemingly separate companies share contact information.  Government contract data from 2020 to present has also been scraped. This gets cross-referenced with company records to flag anomalies like a single entity receiving disproportionate contract awards, or newly registered companies winning large tenders.  One concrete finding: a single phone number cluster linked to 51 companies, all registered as agricultural firms. The pattern is consistent with shell companies created to exploit agricultural tax exemptions.  \\*\\*Trade Intelligence\\*\\*  Customs import/export data (1.68 million rows, 6,073 HS codes) is processed to map trade flows by commodity, partner country, and customs office. The system calculates trade balances and can flag anomalies like unusual pricing, volume spikes, or routing patterns that are commonly associated with trade-based money laundering.  \\*\\*What is coming next\\*\\*  Director and shareholder data for public companies will be linked into the corporate graph soon, which will allow mapping of beneficial ownership networks across Nepal’s corporate landscape.  Important note: All data used in this project comes from publicly available government sources. No private data is accessed or stored. Phone numbers are hashed and never displayed in raw form.

High tech manufacturing like electronics and component will be especially trickier to get right.

Not to say that one cannot come upon a niche opportunity/gap in the market that could be utilised. From my perspective of someone who’s worked in the sector (in and outside Nepal) a large focus is better utilised on building self sustainable small and medium FMCG markets and keep innovating and spending to build knowledge and expertise which could perhaps open doors for greater value added exports as well.|||You cannot beat India and China on mass producing specially when you import raw material from them. |||> Okay, short description yesma Dina parda, aba ko kehi barsa ma kaso Nepal le electricity ma stability Lina nasakla ta, yedi electricity, manufacturing ko cost thorai xa vane, bechna pani sasto ma milyo, hoina rw?  I think the current strategy of building run off the river hydropower is good. It has less environmental impact compared to submerging thousands of villages and forcing them to move away (like the three gorges dam did) and we should start building solar power on an industrial scale and start attaching it to the grid as soon as possible so factories can run during the day for cheaper without cutting into the electricity we need to live our lives in the evening.   That being said, the biggest problems we have are not technical. It is more political and societal. We should not forget what started the Gen Z protests. The politicians who promise a \"quick fix\" to deep problems like monkeys destroying crops by saying something like we will export monkey meat are still running for office and are viable candidates. We need to fix this madness first. I know I am in /r/technepal and we don't like to get too political but really we can't do any long term planning without reducing corruption and nepotism.

If we were to get rid of every successful idea that had come from flawed individuals, much of human progress would disappear along with those who themselves were flawed.  We can—and should—condemn bad behavior without discarding valuable, valid contributions to knowledge and society.  Scientists are more likely to value human progress, curiosity, and long-term thinking—but they are not immune to moral failure. Their work can be noble even when their personal lives are flawed. Judgment must be based on evidence, not archetypes.|||He did biggest contribution for science. Do you really believe that he did something with those minor girls? He can't even do anything. Though i heard that he can only move his middle finger of left hand.

However, we can efficiently manage traffic via road marking, effective communication and traffic lights rules and civic sense. Moreover, why train lines will not be appropriate because of highly fluctuating gradient slopes making us a need to cast high pillars to support along it, and casting pillars/column for support is expensive to construct on itself. Everyone has their own definition of development, but in my view development is not a big deal, the maintenance is. Do you ever think why our roads do not look like foreign countries, why our street looks sad? We do development like those of developed countries, the quality materials might be diff. But the quality we have is sufficient, the maintenance is the big deal. For eg: naala banaunu thulo kuro haina, naali banisakepaxi kattiko function ra maintain hunxa tyo thulo kura ho, road banera thulo kuro haina, road banesi road markings systemic rupma dekhinxa ki nai ani sarbasadaran le follow garxa ki nai...vanne ho...

Later there were news that Samikshya demanded Paul to marry her and threatened that if he didn't then she would file a case against him. Later Durgesh Thapa didn't have good terms with Paul and then durgesh provoked samikshya to file case against Paul.  Samikshya was fine being with Paul but jaba Paul le ma bihey gardina vanyo and with the support of Durgesh , she filed the case. There are still some leaked audios in the youtube in which Durgesh is clearly telling Samikshya to use the \"women card\" to cause trouble to Paul. Also, she herself said \"Jay Nari\" indicating that if a women files a case , she would win that even if the girl is the culprit. Looking at all these, I don't think its fair.

Also, I don’t think Christianity or any religion teaches people to treat faith like marketing.... there are good teachings everywhere. Making fun of help like rice and clothes also feels unnecessary since it’s meant for people who actually need it. And isn’t Nepal secular? Groups like ISKCON openly distribute pamphlets and invite people to religious programs, so preaching itself might not be illegal, maybe forced conversion is the real issue. No hate, just thinking we should focus on building a better, more open Nepal instead of holding old negative mindsets.|||O yeah seeing this if they gave me 20k i will be christian forever",

I don’t understand why people feel the need to stroke their ego by mocking, trolling, and tearing someone down who is clearly just being human online. Fame doesn’t make someone immune to emotions, mental health struggles, or pain. Being a public figure doesn’t mean you deserve cruelty.  What hurts is not just the trolling itself, but how normalized it has become. People comment things they would never dare say face to face—without thinking about the mental state of the person reading it. Even as a third person, reading those comments feels heavy.  Criticism is fair. Hate is not.  Humor is fine. Dehumanization is not.  Do we really gain anything by being cruel behind a screen? Or is it just easier than being kind?",

Probably that 15/16 y/o can help mother with something part time? Can he/she get extra training with computer or other skills that can give him/her something to start living with. When we are giving support, its good. When we are thinking of skills, we're making them independent. Also, would a small capital to buy more veggie and sell that in cart (gadha) be transforming them? Of course its too much asking but you can genuinely ask.  And one advice I give when making a bigger contribution. If you're giving ration , its help and extending arms of support. It is a help. If you're somehow giving money, tell them its a loan  they have to back. Of course you dont want it but when they are capable to return  they might help other people with the feeling of paying the loan (the help they got now).   Anyways, keep up the thought, action and good deeds.|||Ek lakh ma sabai ayo ??? Anyway kudos to you m8.|||Wow yar. Wish I could do the same someday.

            "body": "I was traveling in Nepal this January, mostly to slow down, clear my head, and meet people without expectations. Somewhere along the way, I met an Indian guy fun, outgoing, easy to hang out with at first. We did activities together, explored places, laughed a lot. On the surface, it felt like a solid travel friendship.  But over time, small things started to bother me.  Almost every conversation somehow circled back to women. Not in a harmless, passing way but in a constant, exhausting way. Stories about who he’d slept with, who he wanted to sleep with, and how he planned to marry a Nepali girl someday. The irony was hard to miss: while talking about marriage, he was simultaneously “digging” into three or four different Nepali women, using each connection purely to meet his physical needs.  What really unsettled me was how he talked about women in public. While walking down the street, every passing woman became a comment “She’s looking,” “She has baggage,” “That one’s ready to get slammed.” Over and over again. Loud enough for me to hear, casual enough that he didn’t even see it as wrong.  I’m straight. I notice beauty. I appreciate attractive people like anyone else. But I’ve never felt the need to reduce strangers to comments or talk about them like they’re objects meant for consumption. There’s a line between noticing and disrespect, and he crossed it constantly.  Around the same time, I met a fellow traveler from the US. She was in Nepal to explore, just like me. We decided to visit the mountains together nothing dramatic, just two travelers sharing a plan. We rented a scooter and rode through some incredible places. On the way, I could sense she was hesitant, a little guarded. I didn’t push conversation, didn’t force comfort. I let the ride be what it was.  Once we reached our destination, everything changed.  We talked. For hours. Six or seven hours straight. About life, relationships, family, travel, fears, growth everything that came naturally. No agenda. Just two humans exchanging stories. After sunset, we headed to a homestay and booked a private room. She shared her location with her best friend, brother, and a few close friends back in the US. I spoke to them briefly too, just casually.  Around 11 PM, after more conversation, she went to sleep. I finished some work and slept as well.  The next morning, she told me she’d been freezing all night. I offered her my blanket. We sat wrapped in it for a couple of hours as the sun slowly came up. That’s when she said something that stuck with me.  She told me that in her last 5 years of traveling, this was the first time she’d ever shared a private room with a complete stranger and also the first time she’d felt completely safe doing so. She said most men would try to take advantage of a situation like that. She even compared it to men back home who she knew would “go down that path” without hesitation.  Honestly, it surprised me that this even needed to be said.  I had no intention zero of turning that situation into anything physical. Not because I’m “special” or morally superior, but because I genuinely don’t believe every interaction with the opposite gender needs to lead to sex. Especially not with someone you’ve just met. Physical needs don’t give anyone a free pass to cross boundaries.  I’ve always had female friends. I treat them the same way I treat anyone else. I don’t hit on them. I don’t test limits. I don’t see every connection as an opportunity.  I was in a relationship once six years long. It ended, after a lot of effort and learning. For the past year, I’ve been traveling, meeting people, rebuilding myself, enjoying the days as they come.  And being an Indian traveling in Nepal, I can’t ignore what I keep seeing.  A large number of Indian men here seem to be chasing only one thing massage spas, clubs, dance bars, random women, cheap validation. Commenting on strangers. Treating the country like a playground built for their desires.  I made a few Nepali friends too. They were amazing warm, genuine people. One Nepali friend took me on long bike rides through quiet roads and empty spaces. We spent whole days together smoking, riding, talking, wandering where there was no one around. At some point, she asked me honestly, “What’s your goal in Nepal? Most Indian guys come here only for girls. What about you?”  I laughed and said, “You’ve been with me day and night, to random places where there’s no one around and you’re still asking this?”  And that’s the part I don’t understand.  How some people try to pick up every woman they meet. How everything becomes about getting into someone’s pants for a night. And strangely enough how men like that still manage to find women too.  I’m not writing this to shame anyone. Just sharing an experience that made me think.  Traveling doesn’t just show you new places it shows you who you are when no one’s watching, and who others become when they think they’re entitled.  Adios amigos.  Just another story from the road.  Thanks for reading.",

Once back home, as he spent time in recovery, he decided to document online his near-death experience and post-protest life](https://nepalitimes.com/news/a-new-normal).  >Dhakal, 18, came home from college that day three months ago and then took the bus to Itahari to join some friends who were protesting in front of the sub-metropolitan city office. It was mid-afternoon, and the crowd was chanting anti-corruption slogans and holding up placards.  >Like most young Nepalis, Dhakal and his friends had been angered by videos on social media of the offspring of Nepal’s rich and powerful flaunting their lavish lifestyles.   >\"That was the trigger for me to join the protest, it opened my eyes to just how widespread nepotism and corruption was,\" Dhakal told Nepali Times.   >The police arrested a few students, angering the crowd even more. They massed at the gate of a nearby police station to demand their friends be released.    >Dhakal was standing across the street from the police station when the first shots rang out. The crowd scattered. As he ran for cover, there was a searing pain in his left jaw. Blood was streaming and it took some time for him to realise he had been shot.   >“I was bleeding profusely and couldn’t speak. My vision blurred, there was a ringing in my ears,” Dhakal recalls. “I collected myself and continued to run, fearing that I would be shot a second time.”  >Dhakal collapsed some distance away, and a fellow protestor took him to a nearby hospital, where doctors bandaged his jaw. He was referred to Birat Medical Teaching Hospital, where surgeons immediately performed an emergency operation.    >The bullet had torn through his left jaw, shattering the bone, teeth, and soft tissue. Blood had rushed into his throat, obstructing the airway so doctors first performed a tracheostomy, installing a tube in his throat to help him keep breathing. A week later, the doctors reconstructed his jaw with metallic plates, grafting skin from his chest and transplanting it to the lower left side of his face.   >Dhakal spent three weeks in hospital before being discharged. But the relief of being home was marred by disturbing thoughts. He says, “Just sitting there doing nothing began to take a toll on my mental health.”    >Since he was always interested in content creation and [producing short documentaries](https://www.youtube.com/@docsbyshantanu), he decided to document online his near-death experience and post-protest life.   >Shantanu Dhakal’s Instagram and TikTok [posts are simple, short videos](https://www.instagram.com/shantanu__dhakal/) every other day about his treatment process, dressing his wound and cleaning his tracheostomy tube, attending events with others injured during the protests, and scenes from everyday life in his family farm.   >The comment section has Nepalis and people from around the world reaching out to ask how he is doing and keeping his spirits up. Dhakal now has a caring social media community, and he uses the platforms to keep in touch with other injured protestors across the country.   >Life is returning to a new normal. This week, he returned to college to resume classes after more than two months and is making up for lost time. He has adjusted to speaking and eating with the tube, although the pain never quite goes away.   >“I can eat mostly fine, but it is still difficult to speak,” he says. Soon, he will go to hospital for his fortnightly follow-up, and doctors will determine when his tracheostomy tube can be removed.  >Like other young Nepalis, Dhakal is now even more politically engaged and actively reads the news of the interim government installed after the GenZ protests.   >With the 5 March elections only three months away, young Nepalis like Dhakal hope that the elections will throw out the old and bring in the new. He is among the more than 800,000 new voters who have registered.   >  [https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/live-ammunition-used-against-nepal-anti-graft-protesters-forensics-show-2025-09-26/](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/live-ammunition-used-against-nepal-anti-graft-protesters-forensics-show-2025-09-26/)  [How Nepalese police shot at protesters with ‘military-grade ammunition’](https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20250915-nepal-police-protests-violence-kathmandu)  >Our team spoke to an arms expert, who requested anonymity, and asked him to identify the weapon used here. He said it was a lightweight 7.62x51mm automatic rifle. Other images posted by protesters show munitions found at the site of the protests.  >We have not been able to independently verify these images, but our expert said they look like “7.62x51 mm calibre munitions to be used in assault rifles”. He added that this is a lethal munition. In his view, there is \"a serious risk of fragmentation in the victim’s body at distances of less than 100 to 200 metres.  >Using this ammunition to maintain public order will result in ‘disproportionate’ risk because this is military-grade ammunition.\"",

K gift dim k, we haven't been on a date even. Like, i am translating a book to give him tara idk it still feels less. He's very much into anime and manga stuff. Manga dinxu vanya tara i think the date might be too soon, like way before i can afford that shit. Is there something affordable and special i can give him? And please don't say tyo lipstick ko kisses wala, i find ts very gross and unhygienic.   And if you also think suru dekhi gifts dinu hudaina matinxa and will get spoiled tara guess what i wanna spoil that guy crazy. It's just my life doesn't offer much rn.   Also date kasto hunxa?😭 Like, I don't eat out a lot. Like, it's rare for me. And he's quite a regular outside. Idk how to order and stuff. What if it's expensive😭 I don't want to do 50/50 and shit, i wanna pay the entire thing. And it seems like he's quite comfy with the 'man pays for the meal' shit tara noooioo. He's just a little baby like me! I don't want to burden him with that. Tyasaile i was kind of thinking of going on a date a few years paxi tara i think it'd be a bit sooner. I will have to do some free lance shii defo during my undergrad.   Hyaaannn kasto rant sesh bhaidiryaaa k. La, just tell me, what should i get him on dates? Flowers? i can maybe tara it has to be accompanied with something! Self made gifts are my forte tara wouldn't it be tiring for him? Ahhhhh. Ik you will say ki ask him, tara that sweetie of a male always says 'you'. Ik he's just being nice (and when i point this out he's like, i am not being nice) tara ahhhhhhh. Helllpppoppp!

Discover some resource and start from today to study.   Later is better than never.   DM if needed|||Nepali textbook are itself notes .

Mero sxc ko terminal haruma kaile 3.6 katena tara board ma 3.8+ ayo.|||Personally, I never make notes  I find it useless, shit is well-presented in book, why copy it in ugly handwriting?   Personal recommendation: read the topics thoroughly, understand the details and write every single detail you see, ask why shit happens and why it works, re-understand it and note it somewhere again and again until shit becomes natural and makes sense. Then go to questions, easy to hard and skip the filler ones, only the ones you find to be necessary and dont do it step by step, just get the answer and if the steps make sense, you have understood it, when if you dont have much time for exams (like 1-2 days before exam and want to score good)    If you do have time, solve some model sets, old is gold, just like in exam-style or format in a loose sheet preferably under time constraint. It allows you to see any sort of loopholes in the question, or possibly exam pattern you can use to your advantage (works for subs like english and nepali mainly) and ask your teachers to check it.",

Its just either computer or bio to choose from. Tara maths ma ramro xau vane u can take management too. Management ma u can take subjects like  general mathematics and business maths. But aba plus two ma aisakesi math will be a bit different but u can cope with it if u r interested in maths. Aba its ur choice, if you want to pursue a career in applied science like engineering then you can choose pcm as your subjects basically (Science stream). If you want to pursue a career in financial science like business management then you can choose management as your field of study. Tara in the context of countries like Nepal you can study applied science only if you had studied pcm in plus two. So aba Nepal mai basera padhne soch xa vane I would recommend pcm, tara if you are likely to study in foreign countries than management lida ni testo farak pardaina. But if ur sure studying financial sciences then u can study management.|||4 gpa holder here (opt math+computer) Aba for me, 4 gpa ayepacchi ta it's automatically science (ofc, I didn't even have a choice) Ani are you sure you dont want to take bio?

But if you are not so sure, then PCM would be best for you.  Hope i didn't overexplain.

So, there was this Adhikari woman (i forgot her name) who is quite famous for these lil handwriting workshops around Nepal. I was in 5th grade when she came to our school for ts. It was for a few days and damn. I used to write in cursive, not pretty cursive but the progressive kinda yk.   It was a lot of pressure for 11 year old me😭 i practiced those stupid monocursive alphabets so much that I couldn't even write the small 's' differently for years. Like, i remember her teaching it like, sad smile, happy smile and connect or something like that. I was onto some running for validation type shii.   I quit that monocursive thing and embraced my cursive again tara this pretty wala. Some stupid old cougar who needed to have their eyes checked couldn't read tyasaile some events happened and i am stuck with my present handwriting. Aadha cursive, aadha mono ani hawa ma uddai.

For us however, this is our first horrible man made mass scale event.    for example my mother told these are the events she witnessed, heard about ( there was no internet and reporters were getting chhopped up so source is her words and the fear and disgust in her eyes when talking about it)   i, maobadi kidnapped her school science teacher and tied him to the ground and they started nailing him with large and small nails from the legs and hands, slowly and all over his whole body,   ii. they kidnapped a man form his house at night, made him collect firewood from the forest , they started a fire, like a campfire, beside the fire they asked the kidnapped man to dig up a hole, he did exactly what they said. and after all that in the morning they invited many people from the village including his family members, and they burried him alive with his head sticking out form the  ground so that he could hear and see what was happening and finally they covered his head with the burning coals .    these are just examples and your and my parents have seen/ heard about a lot of similar killings kidnapping , public beheading etc  From their point of view, The old parties have maintained peace, ended such horrible war so they have gained a lot of trust. The old parties have shown their strength, in ending rana rule to ending civil war to ending king's direct rule and our parents know what the political paties gave them the rights and freedom which they have now.    So They're willing to bet one more time that These parties can and will always uphold our sovereignty, freedom and country as a whole.  So it is our duty to make them trust the newer political parties,    it is our duty to make them understand that we will not let the sacrifices and changes made by the old political parties Go to ruin ( the rights and freedom given by the constitution).    It is our duty to make them understand that the the political parties which ended rana rule and the kings rule  are themselves becomming similar elites.    It is our duty to make them understand that the old parties are using similar dictatorial practices which our parent and grand parents fought and ended.  And this is not going to be fast and easy, this is a long process will take years and years.   If you cannot convince your family members think how difficult it  is going to make a stranger understand.  And one more question, why would they listen to you. You are so short sighted and narrow minded. you want people to do exactly what you want them to do just because you said it. You start name calling your family members when they questioned choice which you made for them. They gave their reasons why they're voting. And they are damn right on questioning balen. Why should they trust him, just because he and the media said it.  Isn't that we all be doing, questioning . and They are questioning, You failed to give them answers. Its all on you. Have you asked yourself why should i vote balen?? What answer did you get Try answering without using the words like \"purano party\" \"yemale\" etc. does your answer focus more on old parties or the plans and policies for the country. If it is the first choice you're the veda.  One more thing, it is very sad, but the number of people you've killed does not really seem to matter in national level politics. Prachanda has claimed responsibility for 5000 killings. He became PM multiple times. He has sent kids of 13 and 14 years to the front lines to be used as a cannon fodder.   In short, your parents have seen very brutal violence and They know how bad things will be if old parties get elected but They do not know anything about the newer one. ( might be better or might be wayyy bad.) so they're picking certainity instead of incertainity.     |||vote waste garxa euta generation   dukha paauxa arko generation|||Balen haryo bhane, it's not the end of the world.

Nepal's own USP.  Yet Nepal gets ~1 million tourists a year. Countries with far less diversity get 5–10x more. The problem isn’t that Nepal lacks attractions  The problem is that Nepal’s tourism often exists as: “Something travelers discover on their own”  Nepal isn’t just a trekking destination. It’s an: Adventure sports destination Slow travel destination Culture-plus-nature destination Year-round destination (if positioned properly)  I am personally planning to venture into Tourism.

Decent food  Cons: 1. Awful international airport 2. Terrible roads 3. Eating local food and drinking local water will make travelers sick 4. Polluted, cramped, chaotic, dirty cities 5. Garbage everywhere 6. No direct flights to Europe, US, or Australia  Futute vision should be something like:  Travelers arrive at one of Nepal's many modern, spacious international airports, from where they'd take easy metro to the nearest cities, all of which provide an easy access to adventures that fill the entire spectrum of bare-bones to ultra luxury. Eating street food and drinking any water causes no stomach issues.  That's just my quick brainstorming.|||What Nepal needs is a good PR team too|||You are right mate.. but due to political instability and corruption makes country backwards..Nepal has big potential to get developed which lays between big giants neighbors.|||So true. I have so many friends abroad who've told me they want to do the ABC trek in the last year, but they've always changed their minds when they've seen what's been going on in the country. Truly sad.|||[removed]|||True we have a huge tourism potential and we could be a destination for adventure sports. Besides trekking (but it's amazing what Nepal offers) we can offer lots of stuff like you mentioned but what we lack is infrastructure. How do you get to the trail head to start your mountain biking? Yes we have roads but how reliable are them. We have seen the safety records. If a rider gets into an accident how fast can medics reach him or her. How are they transferred to the nearest hospital safely.  We could be a destination for high altitude training camps like in Kenya or Colorado or Arizona but again what can we offer besides altitude. We have trails but do we have tracks for the work out ? Do we have a combination of flat and hilly lands around that altitude because Nepal's altitude rises rapidly in a very short distance. I know about a high altitude training program in Jumla. Hope that is a success. Training camp would need a good infra as well like basic PT, Gym, Recovery stuff etc.  We have the potential but we need to harness it. Harness in a sustainable way because if we are to increase the number of tourist sustainability is important, safety records are important because the majority of tourists consider everything, risk vs reward. I hope you succeed in your future endeavors but I suggest you to travel abroad to check the Tourism Sector before you venture on yours. Nearest is Thailand , you could see how they have harnessed their tourism potential. Their service industry compared to any other country in the region is miles ahead. Infrastructure, hospitality, transport etc they have it covered.   It's just my observations as I have traveled across Asia, Americas, Europe  when I can and I always think what Nepal could be.|||Do the cluster analysis of whatever feasible in nepal.

Amazing!|||Yea very high potential for top tourism.  besides the amazing nature, many people also speak English - which is an advantage compared to many Asian countries where majority of their populations can’t speak English.   But the infrastructure just isn’t there yet. Close neighbor who has done it well is Thailand - their tourism industry and volume are another level. Their roads, airports, hospitality, foods, entertainment, tourist police to ensure safety, etc. make it easy to attract tourists.|||Isn’t the lack of infrastructure in Nepal part of what makes it appealing? Difficulty getting to a destination creates meaning. When everything becomes easy, it turns into disposable content for a feed. You don’t get profound experiences, you get optimized tourism. Yes, infrastructure improves lives, and that matters. But if development is driven mainly by attention and clicks, we’re not building a future.

            "comments": "Much of what we call national Nepal today was shaped by the effort of King Mahendra. Before his time, even school textbooks were in Hindi, children literally had to read “हमारा देशका नाम नेपाल है”. That alone shows how fragile our national identity once was.  Ask yourself, why can’t we clearly distinguish Amar Singh Thapa from Bhimsen Thapa? Because most of the portraits we rely on were painted by the same court artists during King Mahendra’s era. The same question applies to Divya Upadesh, where was it for all those years? Why did it suddenly surface and gain prominence later?  Maybe some things were rediscovered, maybe some were reconstructed, we may never know for sure. But what is certain is this, King Mahendra played a decisive role in nationalising Nepal’s identity, language, history, and sense of self. Fabricated or rediscovered, those efforts unified a fragmented country. And that, undeniably, was a great deed.|||Because this painting was made during the reign of King Mahendra to show brave king Prithvi Narayan Shah as there was no proper art of King Prithvi Narayan.|||Well that's art not history.|||Glad you are exploring this topic. Feels like you are also curious about history and socio-political anthropology.  Mahendra was driven by political consolidation and a single national narrative. His reign coincided with serious regional instability. To the north, Mao’s Cultural Revolution was unfolding in China. To the down   East Pakistan was breaking away to form Bangladesh. In that context, there was a real fear that Nepal’s sovereignty and internal cohesion could be threatened.  As a result, many reforms and symbols were manufactured or standardized during his tenure to construct a unified national identity. This included the bringing of civil service  (bureaucracy, police, army), the national anthem, the national dress (daura suruwal and dakha topi), the national curriculum (mahendra mala), and the formalization of historical narratives and political doctrine.  Much of what is presented as *Divya Upadesh* guidence book from Prithvi Narayan Shah was entirely manufactured and institutionalized during Mahendra’s rule. From the iconic image of Prithvi Narayan Shah, including his gestures of index finger pointing upward direction (we are one unity symbolism), facial features, dress, and artistic representations, to the moral and political messages attributed to him, these were part of a deliberate political project rather than an untouched historical inheritance.  It is also important to remember that during Prithvi Narayan Shah’s time, there was no modern India or China as nation-states. Phrases like “dui dhunga ko tarul” were reframed as geopolitical doctrine. The *Divya Upadesh* attributed to him was manufactured, published, and promoted during Mahendra’s tenure, much like the Mahendra mala national curriculum that emphasizes narratives such as the Nepal–Anglo war was fought bravely and Nepal being “second richest in water resources.” These were not neutral historical facts but components of a deliberate nation-building strategy.|||It’s kind of a propaganda painting. It’s not that uncommon in the world . Look at that Khukuri thing next to his throne. What even is that lol 😂? Even that pose was created for the purpose of propaganda. That one finger pointing upwards saying we are one ☝️. We don’t even know what he actually looked like. No description even exists. It was all created during Mahendra’s reign. Most people before probably didn’t even know who he was except for the people of Kirtipur who have had a grudge against him for a long time.|||The painting was commissioned by Kind Mahendra and was done by Amar Chitrakar in the 60s. I find this essay quite informative on the modern retelling of the Shah dynasty’s history.   https://www.tasveergharindia.net/essay/nepal-visual-prithvinarayan.html|||This makes sense because it is not a photo but a painting.|||yeslai art bhanxa|||The hand gesture showing unity is also made during mahendra period. Before this the painting or sketch was unidentifiable from malla kings.|||AI ho Ai .|||This painting was painted after 1962. There.|||Read somewhere, this painting was also interpretive, commissioned by Mahendra. That commission included ‘Dibya Upadesh’ as well. There was a discussion on Twitter some time ago and some one posted a Mithila style portait if PNS and said thats the only known portrait of him from his time.|||\"who rules the present, rules the past.\"|||Doesnt Prithvi Narayan Shah looks like Mahendra even though they are 7 generations apart. Maybe thats the answer.|||If u want to talk specifically about the falg. Hamro falg kinda of old and much of tantric symbol. It predates Prithivi himself. If u go some old tantric temple there are those flag . Prithivi was into tantra himself (people say he used it throughout the war) also remember that his and gorakhnath relationship. So yeah it is much older than we think|||Hamro नेपाली flag ko history is about 5000 yrs old , lumbini ma ni भेटेको हो archelogy ले  यो 2 ओटा traingle मात्र हैन एस्को dimenson हरु calculative हिसाब ले मिलाउन पर्छ other it dont wave, aerodynamics को कुरा नी आउँछ ,  Dont take it lightly guys , nepal बुझ्न अलिक गारो नै छ|||This was likely commissioned by the Eoyal family post 1962AD. The painting was done by Amar Chitrakar, here in Kathmandu. Noone actually knew how Prithivi Narayan Shah looked like, so it was an assumption. The unity finger was also kind of an assumption.|||Who gives a f()ck, the artist took creative freedom, jay nepal !!!   Nepal’s true identity is in the future, not the past.

Honestly had Gagan not done his bisesh mahadivesh, the 3 parties already had plans to form a coalition and fight the election as one alliance. And it is his stance of not forming any coalition that we have such a strong competition now. But I’m not gonna lie, nothing is fundamentally going to change whoever comes to power. There doesn’t seem to be any proposal for institutional change in Nepal. RSP is basically running on “Out with the old and In with the new” but not new policies (case in point Balen’s Socialist tilt, his post about that cement factory etc).  It seems they just mean out with old people and in with the younger people. Gagan talks about institutional change, how he is going to be the Tony Blair of Nepal and bring about the “Third Way” and revise Nepal’s economy back to the 90’s era of liberalism. And that all sounds good but knowing Congress, a party that is so deeply entrenched in the status quo, I don’t buy it.

I support balen !|||I honestly don’t know if people in this thread don’t want Balen to win or are just grossly overestimating old parties. Or whether I am delusional.  This election is the by-product of a major revolution which overthrew the government. The opposition has won every single election following revolutions - Jana Andolan I (Nepal Congress won the elections after the dissolution of Panchayat) - Jana Andolan II (CPN Maoist won the 2008 constituent assembly). RSP is the radical opposition as most of the influential figureheads of the revolution have now joined the party.  And you can clearly see the hype behind Balen and how RSP became a top 4 party in just 6 months of formation in the last election.   Oli might have won numerous elections in Jhapa-5, but I would put my money on Balen from a statistical perspective. Most importantly, he won with a 55.7% share in the 2022 elections. Why do you think it’s so hard to topple him over? And with Balen out of all the people|||Oli is not going to get defeated that easily. I want Balen to win but truth is Jhapa ma he is strong.

Hence it's called budhanilkantha ani narayanthan.   |||Aww man I stole so much money  and fruits from this temple  When I was homeless.|||It is believed that a mirror image of Lord Shiva can be seen on the underside of the statue, which is surrounded by water from Gosainkunda (a lake created by Shiva).|||TLDR; Honestly, it’s Narayan (Vishnu), but you’d be surprised how often people get confused and wonder if it’s actually Buddha instead of Shiva.  From what I’ve read, the evidence leans much more toward it being a Narayana site. Budhanilakantha is one of only three Jalashayana Narayana (Vishnu sleeping on the cosmic waters) in Kathmandu Valley as far as I know. The other two are at Balaju (erected by the same patron king AFAIK)  and inside Hanuman Dhoka Palace, though that one was added much later by Pratap Malla.  Some old chronicles say that King Haridutta, around 350 A.D., built Budhanilakantha and also set up four other Narayana temples at the four corners of the Kathmandu Valley. That’s Changu, Bishankhu, Ichangu, and Shesh Narayan. Even today, people try to visit all four in one day, which is basically like doing a Narayan dham within valley. And very surprisingly, if you add Budhanilkantha (as fifth point) into the map it forms the legendary \"Khadga\" shape which is described to be the shape of ancient Kathmandu Town Planning. More so, these Narayana Shrines are located cardinally to each other which makes it much cooler (I cant infer much more from it than that lol). Here is the image for y'all to see: [https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0](https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0)  There’s also this story that King Haridutta saw Jalashayana Narayana in a dream, telling him to dig up the original image buried under the Rudramati riverbed. So he built a pond and installed the sculpture there, along with the four corner temples. This is confusing because , other historical analyses and inscriptions suggest the image was consecrated by ruler Visnugupta around 5th century A.D, much later than Haridutta.  The statue itself is amazing. It’s the largest stone sculpture in the Kathmandu Valley, carved from a single block of dark granite. Some stories say they dragged it across the Valley with forced labor, but some scholars argue the granite was actually nearby in the Shivapuri hills, which makes more sense (in some article by Sudarshan Raj  Tiwari, I am not sure). So I dont know which one is more valid, this or the claim mentioned by u/ZoWakaki above me.  Now, the most interesting part is that Buddhists also worship this image as Nilakantha Lokesvara, a form of Avalokitesvara. Avalokiteshvara is considered to be a form of Shiva in Buddhism or vise-a-versa, which can be one way where the Shiva/Vishnu connection in Budhanilkantha comes in place. In fact, if you look closely, you can almost see the Buddha’s forehead in the face of the sleeping Vishnu. Even the long ears of the statue are very reminiscent of Buddhist iconography we see around the valley.  As for the name Budhanilakantha, there’s a story about Shiva drinking poison during the Samudra Manthan. His throat was burning, so he struck the mountain with his trishul and created Gosaikunda Lake. The water from that lake is said to flow down to the pond at Budhanilakantha, and since Shiva’s called Nilakantha, that might be how the place got its name.

            "body": "I and two of my friends (they both abroad now) had once planned to open a Chhyang Factory in Nepal.   Before anything, I did thorough research, budget allocation, finding international markets, our cultural ties to the drink, even learnt to craft it with help of my Newar Friend circle and their families. For the extension of the project I went to Ilam in search of world class millet and spices. Got few leads, came back bought equipments and started making it. Everything was precise, the ferns and ferments, batch tested almost died drinking the first batch, created and recreated again to make a perfect batch. I had documented every single activity.   Now just to be sure, I first went to IRO, the main office of revenue, Lazimpat to check if the laws of Nepal permits Chhyang; and the officials were quite helpful about it, they turned the pages, pointed out Chhyang as rice beer and mentioned it was taxed 10/- NPR per liter as per the laws of Nepal.   Quite hopeful, we set up a meeting with the director of DOI for the next day, stayed all night to give final touch to our documentations, confident that we will be able to establish one.   Next day, both technical and general directors were in the room during our appointment. We presented our plan, applications and the available resources we had for the establishment.   “Bhanne bittikai tesari paincha?” The first words from the reputed officials. It might not be simple but we had our budget, the land lease requirements, technical scheme, and everything intact.   Our point was, “Nepal ko identity drink Korea bata import huncha, with hefty taxes, but if we do it here instead, we would be able to minimize import, provide employment opportunities and possibly export it too!”  I know Korea has it there as their drink as Makgeolli, but merely importing it instead of making chhyang here makes no sense.   After long discussion, the directors came to the conclusion that we submit our proposal with all the schemes, technicalities and budget and then have a meeting with the industry board lead by then minster for Industry, Mahesh Basnet.  We shook our heads, submitted our file, told that we will be called someday for this matter, could be tomorrow or 10 years from now.   We almost gave up at that point. Now both my friends are abroad, promising to return back if they call, but no one calls.   I don’t expect them to call, but sometimes I go to various chatpate stalls just to check if I find the pages of our documentation wrapping those 20/- or 50/- ko chatpate.   TL;DR  1. Nepal imports korean makgeolli as Chhyang, full of preservatives to keep it alive for a ling time.   2. Thoroughly researched-made documentations, technical schemes, budget allocations for establishing Chhyang as a well-lived Nepali Drink.  3. Visited IRO, the main revenue office and got a green flag from them for the establishment.   4. DOI doesn’t give a f\\*ck, instead implied that this is not possible as their books doesn’t recognize Chhyang, so asked us to submit the proposal documents and their classic “pachi aaunu”.  5. Friends gave up moved abroad. I still check if I can find the pages of the proposal wrapped in Chatpates or Badams.",

            "body": "Hey everyone,  Today my bank account got frozen and I’m honestly panicking a bit.  I work remotely for a Singapore-based company and I get paid in USDT for my work. There aren’t many good options in my country to receive international payments, so I used Binance P2P to convert USDT to local currency and send it to my bank account. This money is my salary, not trading profits or third-party funds.  This morning my bank froze my account without warning. These were my hard-earned savings that I was slowly building to someday build a home, so this hit me really hard mentally.  Tomorrow I’m going to the bank in person, but I’m unsure:  What exactly should I say to them?  What should I not say?  What documents usually help in these cases?  Has anyone here gone through something similar and successfully unfrozen their account?  Is there a real risk of losing the money, or is this usually just a compliance review?  I’m not trying to avoid laws or do anything shady. I just didn’t have a better way to receive my income.  Any advice or shared experiences would really help right now. Thanks for reading.",

I am just trying to understand. no offence/disrespect in anyway.|||nepal ko labour law wise notice period is 1 month, company cant extend this  if you feel like then only u commit 2 month   try to negotiate, if they provide you equity as they highly rely on you it may be beneficial on long run   as lead that salary is not enough u are being under paid|||That's more than double your salary , also remote don't know if that's what you want or not but take the jump.    Ani per month 25000 chai kaa jancha bro ?? Ssf ma ki k 😂|||Try to negotiate the notice period and make the switch. The value in the remote work will be more than your current role. If you really do matter to the company, they will try to make adjustments. It's not only a salary jump on your new role. It is much more|||You can get someone to fill your role. Another developer, may be someone in your network, or may be me if I am qualified😆 Train s/he and leave for another opportunity.. this is a huge jump, if you were lead in my company, I would understand, in fact I would prefer if you take the new offer. But I would be grateful if you gave new lead some support during transition.|||I am working for foreign company for around 3 years now. I too felt the same as you are feeling now when I switched my job. 1800 USD is really good offer. Don't miss this opportunity !! Foreign job comes with remote is the best. U only have to pay 5% tax flat. You will have more money which will motivate you !!|||if the start up heavily depend on you then ask for big equity and if you belive the startup's  scope and future than stay here with company and family with the equity else begin new journey|||if 2x then switch. i would have said don't switch if it is just 25% more.|||Handle the local company as a consultant (part time ) if they agree because they heavily depend on on you. Keep the relationship on good terms. So during the time help them transition so it works both ways.   Since the other offer is remote, you can easily manage time with both, if you can handle both good for you or leave the local and continue with the foreign one.|||Switch switch. No second thoughts needed , better pay probably better technology, flexibility of working from home and international exposure. Communicate properly that you've gotten a better opportunity and will take that. Since you have been there for only 4 months, your knowledge and dependency can be transferred and even if they force you to stay for 60 days, maybe for the last 20 days do part time but only for handover and knowledge transfer.|||I dont think 2 months notice period is enforceable. Check labor law of Nepal.|||Just remember Nepali rupee is losing its value from time to time if I were you I would put that usd salary in a dollar account or other option would be if your startup offers you equity otherwise I would leave and you should also be aware that the new position opens up other kinds of doors.|||Startup work culture and future can be a good career choice in the long run (regardless of your better US offer situation).     MY ADVICE:      1) Ask for reasonable equity in the startup (long-term vesting schedule can be a good option) and stay if you believe in the product / company direction.  OR      2) If no equity, just leave ASAP!!! you don't have to feel bad for your boss / seniors / company / friends who don't value your labour and contribution (assuming you are the tech lead taking big decisions that make or break the company's future)     DM me if you or the company or both want to negotiate an equity vesting plan that justifies the contribution for both parties.  PS.

But again you have a wonderful opportunity to build from scratch in the startup.  If you want to resign, talk with them and be transparent. It will be easy if you don’t lie.|||Take the new job. Say you can work as a consultant for the startup but can't do full time.|||I switched rightway tbh, I had two years contract, they didn't pay my PF  I didnt care.  I am very happy with my decision back then.|||Just make the switch. You current company will fire your without thinking twice if it suited their needs so why should you care about the company.

No.   2. Yes and yes.   3. Tell your current employer that you have got this new job that is offering you this and that. And leave on a good note.   You should not think twice. Opportunity doesn’t always come handy.|||Tech lead and only 90k salary?

Few years ago people who don’t know jack shit used to get job in ML.|||A few good points in the comment section already, here are my thoughts as a senior engineer in the UK with a doctorate. 2 page is good Keep your experience ahead even if it's an internship only.  Limit the number of projects. As you said, if it's a small notebook only and you provide link to the project it devalues your profile.  Bring skills below the about me section.

Focus on 1/2 core projects , refine them. As from the CV ig you are more into the agentic/applied AI stuffs that's currently booming, so focus on it rather than DS/ML if you want to enter the industry soon. Try Fine-tuning models, edge devices deployments , local end to end pipelines, and stuff  and you will be pretty strong.||| Too much Medical: You’ve got 4 medical projects. It looks a bit like academic practice. Swap 2 of them for something else (like Finance or E-commerce) to show you can handle different types of data. Flex that MLOps project: Move the ICU Deterioration one to the top! It’s your best flex because it mentions monitoring and drift (Prometheus/Grafana). That’s exactly what remote MLOps recruiters are looking for. Make Demos \"One-Click\": Make sure those [Demo] links go to a live site (Streamlit/Hugging Face). For remote jobs, if they can't see it working in 5 seconds, they might skip it.

The ‘other skills’ and very beginner projects can go or be merged so the focus stays on the work you’re most proud of.

Like wtf is wrong with you guys?|||People usually miscalculate the complexity of human beings, even if those people are globe-renowned scientists or thinkers. We tend to reduce individuals into neat categories of \"good\" or \"bad,\" when in reality most human lives exist somewhere in a moral gray space.  The figures are indeed contributions to modern society, having shaped our understanding of the universe in the case of Stephen Hawking and the overwhelming propagation of personal computing that underpins everyday life, thanks to Bill Gates. Their contributions are objective in nature, measured, and historically significant.  The Epstein case has indeed cast a sinister shadow on the reputations and personal integrity of those associated with it. Any wrongdoing ought to be investigated, prosecuted, and judged on its merits. Accountability counts.  Yet, it is quite dangerous to erase or dismiss intellectual and scientific contributions on the basis of particular personal moral failures; by doing so, it is an effort to distort history. If we were to get rid of every successful idea that had come from flawed individuals, much of human progress would disappear along with those who themselves were flawed.  We can—and should—condemn bad behavior without discarding valuable, valid contributions to knowledge and society.  Scientists are more likely to value human progress, curiosity, and long-term thinking—but they are not immune to moral failure. Their work can be noble even when their personal lives are flawed. Judgment must be based on evidence, not archetypes.|||He did biggest contribution for science. Do you really believe that he did something with those minor girls? He can't even do anything.

For us however, this is our first horrible man made mass scale event.    for example my mother told these are the events she witnessed, heard about ( there was no internet and reporters were getting chhopped up so source is her words and the fear and disgust in her eyes when talking about it)   i, maobadi kidnapped her school science teacher and tied him to the ground and they started nailing him with large and small nails from the legs and hands, slowly and all over his whole body,   ii. they kidnapped a man form his house at night, made him collect firewood from the forest , they started a fire, like a campfire, beside the fire they asked the kidnapped man to dig up a hole, he did exactly what they said. and after all that in the morning they invited many people from the village including his family members, and they burried him alive with his head sticking out form the  ground so that he could hear and see what was happening and finally they covered his head with the burning coals .    these are just examples and your and my parents have seen/ heard about a lot of similar killings kidnapping , public beheading etc  From their point of view, The old parties have maintained peace, ended such horrible war so they have gained a lot of trust. The old parties have shown their strength, in ending rana rule to ending civil war to ending king's direct rule and our parents know what the political paties gave them the rights and freedom which they have now.    So They're willing to bet one more time that These parties can and will always uphold our sovereignty, freedom and country as a whole.  So it is our duty to make them trust the newer political parties,    it is our duty to make them understand that we will not let the sacrifices and changes made by the old political parties Go to ruin ( the rights and freedom given by the constitution).    It is our duty to make them understand that the the political parties which ended rana rule and the kings rule  are themselves becomming similar elites.    It is our duty to make them understand that the old parties are using similar dictatorial practices which our parent and grand parents fought and ended.  And this is not going to be fast and easy, this is a long process will take years and years.   If you cannot convince your family members think how difficult it  is going to make a stranger understand.  And one more question, why would they listen to you. You are so short sighted and narrow minded. you want people to do exactly what you want them to do just because you said it. You start name calling your family members when they questioned choice which you made for them. They gave their reasons why they're voting. And they are damn right on questioning balen. Why should they trust him, just because he and the media said it.  Isn't that we all be doing, questioning . and They are questioning, You failed to give them answers. Its all on you. Have you asked yourself why should i vote balen?? What answer did you get Try answering without using the words like \"purano party\" \"yemale\" etc. does your answer focus more on old parties or the plans and policies for the country. If it is the first choice you're the veda.  One more thing, it is very sad, but the number of people you've killed does not really seem to matter in national level politics. Prachanda has claimed responsibility for 5000 killings. He became PM multiple times. He has sent kids of 13 and 14 years to the front lines to be used as a cannon fodder.   In short, your parents have seen very brutal violence and They know how bad things will be if old parties get elected but They do not know anything about the newer one. ( might be better or might be wayyy bad.) so they're picking certainity instead of incertainity.     |||vote waste garxa euta generation   dukha paauxa arko generation|||Balen haryo bhane, it's not the end of the world.

My dad brought quite a few for me from KTM every few months, and I used to colour, solve crosswords etc. I event sent crossword solutions (never got published). This is where I knew about sudoku and still love sudoku to this day. I have read a lot of stories in this magazine and some of them  have been life changing for me. I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.  Few years later, through sheer luck (and a bit of reputation in my Nepali class), I got to be the guest editor of one edition of this magazine. Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र). I still absolutely vividly remember that letter, the paper, the handwriting, almost the content (almost 20 years later). The sender had found my information from the guest editor section.

But just sharing their perspective.|||[removed]|||Hmm generalizing blatantly. So typical.   I am in US, and I can say 98% of my friends don’t support his policies. There are a few who do but there’s always an exception.   Now many, including myself, do support some level of checks and restrictions on immigration. Those who didn’t get in take that as being opportunistic or slamming the door after I got in. Far from it.   What I don’t support is people coming through illegal means. What I don’t support is people cheating and providing 100% false representation while applying. Then once they get in, they try to game the system and just be a leech sucking in the benefits without contributing. They are making it harder for the legitimate immigrants and that’s exactly what we hate.  Now I don’t support the current position of not granting any immigration visa indefinitely to Nepal. But you know why this happened? Because almost 40% of Nepalis, about 70-80k take welfare benefits from the US government. You don’t need it if you are a contributing member of the society (except for in some disability/age related case).   There are people coming to US to get free medical treatment. One performer got the treatment and left the Us without paying the medical bills- that person is now banned from coming. Another famous pair got the DV and justified their entry by saying they get free medical for their kid (their case may be legit, but I am just giving an example of what people have been doing).   The administration is going to the other extreme to curb this- but some of it is because the past administration didn’t do anything to prevent it from happening.|||I seriously doubt the accuracy of this sentiment. Nepalis who have settled in America invariably work to bring other family members here. The effort is long and hard, and many are still in process, meaning that spouses, siblings, and others are now cut off from coming over. My brother in-law was able to finally secure his wife's visa a few weeks ago, after working on it for 2 years.  a few weeks later and she wouldn't get to come, so no, Nepali uncles and aunties aren't supportive, and there is no indication that most nepalis voted for trump.  The other thing to consider is the message behind the visa suspensions.  The trump administration is basically saying that immigrants who have come here have not improved conditions, but rather they have made it worse by taking advantage of government programs that they are not entitled to. In other words immigrants are lazy, and thieves. Not a lot to take pride in about that.|||Let me know what you are smoking..seems like good stuff.|||Just like the viral trend chori manchey ko khutta tanney chori manchey naai huncha.

I was a little nervous since it was only a few weeks after the Gen Z protest, but everything seemed pretty calm. I thought to myself, wow it'd sure be cool if we could overthrow our government, get rid of trump and be back to normal in a few weeks.   The Nepali living in the us would not feel happy or safe if they lived in my city I guarantee it.

It is completely white supremacist Nazi shit. It's horrible and I'm ashamed to be an American. These are my friends and neighbors, I don't ask people what their immigration status is, I could care less.   It's usually portrayed that undocumented immigrants are a drain on government services, but that is a lie. They pay taxes since it's automatically deducted from the paycheck to a social security number that doesn't belong to them. If they try to use the services they're caught and deported  We're fighting back but our leaders are ineffective, the police are working with ICE and if we call in the military we're unsure of whose side they'll take.

Why would anyone be happy about the current situation ? All of you who agree with the statement are in Nepal who couldn’t make it to the US.|||May I dare present a different perspective?   Not everyone who votes Republican is \"hiding the ladder since they've made it\". That claim is lazy, false, and ignores basic economic reality.  Some of us vote based on numbers, not slogans. When you are paying over $100,000 a year in taxes (household)—income tax, state tax, property tax, sales tax—and you don’t see proportional benefits in return, fiscal policy starts to matter a lot. At that level, voting conservative isn’t ideological—it’s rational. Lower taxes, limited government, and accountability in spending simply align better with that reality.  Paying six figures into the system and being told you’re “privileged,” “selfish,” or morally inferior for questioning where that money goes is not persuasive—it’s alienating. Wanting to keep more of what you earn does not make you hateful. It makes you financially literate.  Many Republican voters reject racism and extremism outright. What they do reject is runaway taxation, bloated government, and being constantly generalized or morally lectured by people whose policies they fundamentally can’t relate to. The same way not all Democrats are extremists, not all Republicans are villains.  And yes—we are also tired of being lumped together with fringe elements just because we don’t align with extreme progressive ideology. Disagreeing with activist politics, identity absolutism, or ideological purity tests does not make someone anti-human. It means they prioritize practicality over performative outrage.  People vote based on lived experience. For households paying $100k+ in taxes every year, conservative policies often make more sense. That’s not hate. That’s math.",

Truly sad.|||[removed]|||True we have a huge tourism potential and we could be a destination for adventure sports. Besides trekking (but it's amazing what Nepal offers) we can offer lots of stuff like you mentioned but what we lack is infrastructure. How do you get to the trail head to start your mountain biking? Yes we have roads but how reliable are them. We have seen the safety records. If a rider gets into an accident how fast can medics reach him or her. How are they transferred to the nearest hospital safely.  We could be a destination for high altitude training camps like in Kenya or Colorado or Arizona but again what can we offer besides altitude. We have trails but do we have tracks for the work out ? Do we have a combination of flat and hilly lands around that altitude because Nepal's altitude rises rapidly in a very short distance. I know about a high altitude training program in Jumla. Hope that is a success. Training camp would need a good infra as well like basic PT, Gym, Recovery stuff etc.  We have the potential but we need to harness it. Harness in a sustainable way because if we are to increase the number of tourist sustainability is important, safety records are important because the majority of tourists consider everything, risk vs reward. I hope you succeed in your future endeavors but I suggest you to travel abroad to check the Tourism Sector before you venture on yours. Nearest is Thailand , you could see how they have harnessed their tourism potential. Their service industry compared to any other country in the region is miles ahead. Infrastructure, hospitality, transport etc they have it covered.   It's just my observations as I have traveled across Asia, Americas, Europe  when I can and I always think what Nepal could be.|||Do the cluster analysis of whatever feasible in nepal.

Amazing!|||Yea very high potential for top tourism.  besides the amazing nature, many people also speak English - which is an advantage compared to many Asian countries where majority of their populations can’t speak English.   But the infrastructure just isn’t there yet. Close neighbor who has done it well is Thailand - their tourism industry and volume are another level. Their roads, airports, hospitality, foods, entertainment, tourist police to ensure safety, etc. make it easy to attract tourists.|||Isn’t the lack of infrastructure in Nepal part of what makes it appealing? Difficulty getting to a destination creates meaning. When everything becomes easy, it turns into disposable content for a feed. You don’t get profound experiences, you get optimized tourism. Yes, infrastructure improves lives, and that matters. But if development is driven mainly by attention and clicks, we’re not building a future.

Heyy many of you guys have been asking me for an update.  (Update on her) She's with us, she and her baby are doing good now. All of her and her baby's living necessities are covered. Thank you guys for all your help and your concern.  (Update on her situation) We are in contact with the embassy, we are in process of sorting out her documents to send her back.  We have been somewhat successful in contacting her parents. She doesn't have a lot of her documents so that's taking a while. As her mental state is a little unstable due to the trauma, we're being very careful in how we approach this and not triggering her.  We're trying our best to sort this out and send her back by this week. ❤️ Will update you in case any support is needed.

She will have to leave the bay behind if she wants to go back. If she doesn’t want to do that, her and her child will live as undocumented there.

I have been seeing many Gagan-glazing posts recently, so I have a few questions for him.  - When will you speak about the Nepali and foreign currency that was found burnt in your former president’s house? Were those AI-generated, as your party president and many party leaders were claiming?  - You have raised the Sahakari Kanda involving Rabi Lamichhane, but when will you raise the same question about your own party member, Maya Rai, who was also a member of the same sahakari in Kathmandu (I’ve forgotten the name)? What about the Dhanraj Gurung sahakari case?  - You were part of the Government Efficiency team when the recent UML–Congress coalition government was formed. Will you question or take responsibility for the recent GenZ killings? Your party member Ramesh Lekhak was also the Home Minister at that time—have you questioned him about this?  - You have been a Member of Parliament four times, and during your tenure, the Congress has formed the government multiple times. Can you point to any concrete, policy-level achievements you delivered during your party’s time in government?  - What about Aftab Alam case during your party's government was he rightfully being prosecuted or your party's government have him impunity from jail, what about that case?",

And somehow Congress will be saved.|||The real answer is Bises Mahadibesan. That itself was a bidroha against the entrenched cult politics that the Deuba gang has practiced throughout its history. Deuba, as an individual, may once have been a true leader—but over time, the gang culture around him is what turned everything rotten and made him look bhrasta.  From this point onward, Gagan is free.  Free from:  All blame linked to Arzu  All accusations about money in Deuba’s house  All baggage related to Bhutani saranarthi  All the kandas, Teramox, and backroom deals  All blame connected to Lekhaks and their networks  These were never Gagan’s sins to carry.  So why should he keep answering for other people’s cults? Why should a reformist voice be held hostage by the corruption, compromises, and power games of an old guard that refuses to let go?  If anyone needs to answer, it’s the system that protected those networks for decades—not the one who finally challenged them.  Gagan doesn’t need to answer anymore. The Mahadibesan already did.|||He can give you wai wai, not sure about answers.    Also if he is going to get land back from Norvic hospital which Balen failed to do.|||This whole Nepal’s political system is corrupted any new person goes there to do right by the country will just do right for him only.

Don't get me wrong there are shortcomings from him and nobody is perfect but most of the questions you raised here are poor attempt to make him look bad.  You have to realize that even though Gagan is a prominient member of Nepali Congress, he was never the executive. Every decision the party makes as a whole, the chairman (Deuba) has the supreme authority and he is little to no say in any of the decisions.  Even then, he has clearly spoken against all wrongdoings. And you say \"just speak\". But that's the problem of not being in executive power, he can only speak.  You trying to  make the money burnt in Deuba's house somehow a crime by Gagan Thapa clearly tells me that you are just trying to hate. Otherwise as everyone else has said, there is a special probe commission formed to specifically study the burnt money case and all we can do is wait for their report and the government will file the case if there is wrongdoing (which we all believe there is). And Gagan has clearly affirmed this, as any sane person would. You should read him and listen his many public interviews/videos and not just assume he didn't say anything.  He has clearly said multiple times that any and all involved in sahakari kanda should be investigated including naming people from his own party by name, again multiple times in multiple of his public appearences and writings, you should read/watch/listen those. The government should file cases. I don't understand how this would be his fault.  If you again watch his comments in good faith and listen to his parliament speeches, he as said multiple times that  the public is angry, they need delivery. He said he opposed the coalition and publicly opposed it multiple times. But he is not the executive, deuba is. When there is coaliation, he has the moral responsibility to make the government successful. He was indeed in the efficiency team and he said he tried is best to make the government successful because he knew people needed delivery even though he opposed the coalition. He publicly told long before the Gen-Z protest that he couldn't get the government to do what the efficiency team was supposed to do, and he left it. So I don't think that makes him culpable for the massacre during gen-z protest.  But still he has taken moral responsibility for what happened during the protest. He has apologized multiple times for any moral culpability he has. He said he immediately asked the party leadership to break coaliation in the first day of protest and asked Lekhak to resign. Lekhak did resign but the party didn't leave coalition because again Deuba is executive and makes the decision.  He has been parliament member four times. The first time and he failed to deliver the constitution as promised which he was elected for. The second tenure was again the CA election, which delivered the constitution and you can't deny he played crucial role in making the constitution, and he (among all others) delivered the constitution. The next term he went to the parliament again and became health minister and people say he delivered some reforms in health sector (again refer to public catalogues of his works during this tenure). And you have to grant that he has been constant voice in the parliament on various issues, which the MP is sent for. This last time was a short tenure, but as everyone he has played crucial role in voicing concerns in the parliament. Ironically he strongly demanded there be independent probe in sahakari case and there have been multiple arrests and cases filed against some major fraudsters. You should grant that this was successfull. But we can always demand more. I am not his prabakta but to me seems like he could have definitely done more here and I am sure he agrees.  Yeah what about the case? Alam was a proven convict. But congress did dirty by lobbying to release him. I haven't seen him support Alam's release. Again, I am not sure the details of his release but how is Gagan culpable for the crime Alam committed?  Again I am not his prabakta. I try to speak with reason. You could certainly question that he didn't do enough at policy level as MP to propose new laws and pass them. You could ask him that he could not do enough to break Deuba stronghold. But he precisely did that recently.  Now I am watching him closely, he is now in the position to deliver at least from his party level. Make him accountable ask him tough questions. But the aforementioned questions seemed more like an attempt to make him bad (except may be how many policy changed did he make in 1 1/2 tenure as MP except CA MP which they delivered constitution).

At home, my bags were 23 + 22 kg, and my carry-on was 20 kg.  At the check-in counter, the agent told me to move some items from my carry-on into one checked bag so I’d only have to pay excess for one bag. I did exactly that and reduced my carry-on to 12 kg.  Magically, after this:  •\tChecked bags became 32 kg and 25 kg    •\tCarry-on became 13 kg  Somehow, between weighing the bags at home, weighing them again at the counter, and then re-weighing them a third time, my bags gained weight out of nowhere.  I was exhausted and didn’t have the energy to argue, so they charged me for two excess bags — $80 each. No leeway, no consideration.  To make things worse, the agent openly suggested that if I paid cash and didn’t need a receipt, they could lower the price. At that point it was obvious they were trying to pocket the money. Absolutely shameless.  I paid by card, waited until they gave me a proper Turkish Airlines receipt, and made sure everything was legit.  If you’re flying Turkish Airlines out of Tribhuvan International Airport, I strongly suggest avoiding the chubby girl working at the Turkish Airlines check-in counter. She was incompetent from the start — struggling to even open the computer system and issue a boarding pass, while agents at nearby counters were processing passengers with ease.  Extremely bad service and blatant attempts at corruption. This kind of experience is one of the many reasons I seriously hesitate to visit Nepal anymore.",

Happened to me in airport outside nepal as well.  The main difference is that airport scales are \"trade-legal\" industrial devices required by law to be regularly calibrated for high precision, whereas home scales are consumer-grade gadgets that use cheaper sensors and are almost never recalibrated. Additionally, the environment distorts the numbers; weighing a bag on a soft home carpet or trying to balance a large suitcase on a small bathroom scale often creates a \"lighter\" reading than reality, unlike the airport's large, stable platforms embedded in hard concrete. Because of this, the airport scale is generally accurate, while your home scale is just an estimate that tends to drift.|||[removed]|||Are we allowed to video record our interactions there?

            "comments": "Much of what we call national Nepal today was shaped by the effort of King Mahendra. Before his time, even school textbooks were in Hindi, children literally had to read “हमारा देशका नाम नेपाल है”. That alone shows how fragile our national identity once was.  Ask yourself, why can’t we clearly distinguish Amar Singh Thapa from Bhimsen Thapa? Because most of the portraits we rely on were painted by the same court artists during King Mahendra’s era. The same question applies to Divya Upadesh, where was it for all those years? Why did it suddenly surface and gain prominence later?  Maybe some things were rediscovered, maybe some were reconstructed, we may never know for sure. But what is certain is this, King Mahendra played a decisive role in nationalising Nepal’s identity, language, history, and sense of self. Fabricated or rediscovered, those efforts unified a fragmented country. And that, undeniably, was a great deed.|||Because this painting was made during the reign of King Mahendra to show brave king Prithvi Narayan Shah as there was no proper art of King Prithvi Narayan.|||Well that's art not history.|||Glad you are exploring this topic. Feels like you are also curious about history and socio-political anthropology.  Mahendra was driven by political consolidation and a single national narrative. His reign coincided with serious regional instability. To the north, Mao’s Cultural Revolution was unfolding in China. To the down   East Pakistan was breaking away to form Bangladesh. In that context, there was a real fear that Nepal’s sovereignty and internal cohesion could be threatened.  As a result, many reforms and symbols were manufactured or standardized during his tenure to construct a unified national identity. This included the bringing of civil service  (bureaucracy, police, army), the national anthem, the national dress (daura suruwal and dakha topi), the national curriculum (mahendra mala), and the formalization of historical narratives and political doctrine.  Much of what is presented as *Divya Upadesh* guidence book from Prithvi Narayan Shah was entirely manufactured and institutionalized during Mahendra’s rule. From the iconic image of Prithvi Narayan Shah, including his gestures of index finger pointing upward direction (we are one unity symbolism), facial features, dress, and artistic representations, to the moral and political messages attributed to him, these were part of a deliberate political project rather than an untouched historical inheritance.  It is also important to remember that during Prithvi Narayan Shah’s time, there was no modern India or China as nation-states. Phrases like “dui dhunga ko tarul” were reframed as geopolitical doctrine. The *Divya Upadesh* attributed to him was manufactured, published, and promoted during Mahendra’s tenure, much like the Mahendra mala national curriculum that emphasizes narratives such as the Nepal–Anglo war was fought bravely and Nepal being “second richest in water resources.” These were not neutral historical facts but components of a deliberate nation-building strategy.|||It’s kind of a propaganda painting. It’s not that uncommon in the world . Look at that Khukuri thing next to his throne. What even is that lol 😂? Even that pose was created for the purpose of propaganda. That one finger pointing upwards saying we are one ☝️. We don’t even know what he actually looked like. No description even exists. It was all created during Mahendra’s reign. Most people before probably didn’t even know who he was except for the people of Kirtipur who have had a grudge against him for a long time.|||The painting was commissioned by Kind Mahendra and was done by Amar Chitrakar in the 60s. I find this essay quite informative on the modern retelling of the Shah dynasty’s history.   https://www.tasveergharindia.net/essay/nepal-visual-prithvinarayan.html|||This makes sense because it is not a photo but a painting.|||yeslai art bhanxa|||The hand gesture showing unity is also made during mahendra period. Before this the painting or sketch was unidentifiable from malla kings.|||AI ho Ai .|||This painting was painted after 1962. There.|||Read somewhere, this painting was also interpretive, commissioned by Mahendra. That commission included ‘Dibya Upadesh’ as well. There was a discussion on Twitter some time ago and some one posted a Mithila style portait if PNS and said thats the only known portrait of him from his time.|||\"who rules the present, rules the past.\"|||Doesnt Prithvi Narayan Shah looks like Mahendra even though they are 7 generations apart. Maybe thats the answer.|||If u want to talk specifically about the falg. Hamro falg kinda of old and much of tantric symbol. It predates Prithivi himself. If u go some old tantric temple there are those flag . Prithivi was into tantra himself (people say he used it throughout the war) also remember that his and gorakhnath relationship.

The painting was done by Amar Chitrakar, here in Kathmandu. Noone actually knew how Prithivi Narayan Shah looked like, so it was an assumption. The unity finger was also kind of an assumption.|||Who gives a f()ck, the artist took creative freedom, jay nepal !!!   Nepal’s true identity is in the future, not the past.

Honestly had Gagan not done his bisesh mahadivesh, the 3 parties already had plans to form a coalition and fight the election as one alliance. And it is his stance of not forming any coalition that we have such a strong competition now. But I’m not gonna lie, nothing is fundamentally going to change whoever comes to power. There doesn’t seem to be any proposal for institutional change in Nepal. RSP is basically running on “Out with the old and In with the new” but not new policies (case in point Balen’s Socialist tilt, his post about that cement factory etc).  It seems they just mean out with old people and in with the younger people. Gagan talks about institutional change, how he is going to be the Tony Blair of Nepal and bring about the “Third Way” and revise Nepal’s economy back to the 90’s era of liberalism.

This election is the by-product of a major revolution which overthrew the government. The opposition has won every single election following revolutions - Jana Andolan I (Nepal Congress won the elections after the dissolution of Panchayat) - Jana Andolan II (CPN Maoist won the 2008 constituent assembly). RSP is the radical opposition as most of the influential figureheads of the revolution have now joined the party.  And you can clearly see the hype behind Balen and how RSP became a top 4 party in just 6 months of formation in the last election.   Oli might have won numerous elections in Jhapa-5, but I would put my money on Balen from a statistical perspective. Most importantly, he won with a 55.7% share in the 2022 elections.

Record anusar, statue was commissioned by Vishugupta of the gupta dynasty (son of the more famous Jisnugupta) tyeti bela Lichhavi dynasty was like a vassal state to the gupta dynasty. Ani bishnugupta Kathmandu airaney belama yo statue commission gareko. Made from nagdhunga (basal stone).  Yo statue chai harako thiyo (puriyeko) maybe due to lack of maintenance, earthquake who knows.   Malla raja ko palama euta kisan ley khanney belama bhettayo yo murti feri. Legend was that he hit the statue's toe and blood gushed out. Tyeti bela, for myriad of reason, it was named budhanilkantha. Probably because theological literacy wasn't high/ maybe the farmer was more of shiva bhakta. Maybe the coutnry was in the shiva bhakta phase as later royal families have been heavy shiva bhaktas.   Until later, when people recognized, ahh you bishnu ho siva hoina it's name was already 'sealed' as budhanilkantha, including the name for the area. Hence it's called budhanilkantha ani narayanthan.   |||Aww man I stole so much money  and fruits from this temple  When I was homeless.|||It is believed that a mirror image of Lord Shiva can be seen on the underside of the statue, which is surrounded by water from Gosainkunda (a lake created by Shiva).|||TLDR; Honestly, it’s Narayan (Vishnu), but you’d be surprised how often people get confused and wonder if it’s actually Buddha instead of Shiva.  From what I’ve read, the evidence leans much more toward it being a Narayana site. Budhanilakantha is one of only three Jalashayana Narayana (Vishnu sleeping on the cosmic waters) in Kathmandu Valley as far as I know. The other two are at Balaju (erected by the same patron king AFAIK)  and inside Hanuman Dhoka Palace, though that one was added much later by Pratap Malla.  Some old chronicles say that King Haridutta, around 350 A.D., built Budhanilakantha and also set up four other Narayana temples at the four corners of the Kathmandu Valley. That’s Changu, Bishankhu, Ichangu, and Shesh Narayan. Even today, people try to visit all four in one day, which is basically like doing a Narayan dham within valley. And very surprisingly, if you add Budhanilkantha (as fifth point) into the map it forms the legendary \"Khadga\" shape which is described to be the shape of ancient Kathmandu Town Planning. More so, these Narayana Shrines are located cardinally to each other which makes it much cooler (I cant infer much more from it than that lol). Here is the image for y'all to see: [https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0](https://imgur.com/a/ExzTJW0)  There’s also this story that King Haridutta saw Jalashayana Narayana in a dream, telling him to dig up the original image buried under the Rudramati riverbed. So he built a pond and installed the sculpture there, along with the four corner temples. This is confusing because , other historical analyses and inscriptions suggest the image was consecrated by ruler Visnugupta around 5th century A.D, much later than Haridutta.  The statue itself is amazing. It’s the largest stone sculpture in the Kathmandu Valley, carved from a single block of dark granite. Some stories say they dragged it across the Valley with forced labor, but some scholars argue the granite was actually nearby in the Shivapuri hills, which makes more sense (in some article by Sudarshan Raj  Tiwari, I am not sure). So I dont know which one is more valid, this or the claim mentioned by u/ZoWakaki above me.  Now, the most interesting part is that Buddhists also worship this image as Nilakantha Lokesvara, a form of Avalokitesvara. Avalokiteshvara is considered to be a form of Shiva in Buddhism or vise-a-versa, which can be one way where the Shiva/Vishnu connection in Budhanilkantha comes in place. In fact, if you look closely, you can almost see the Buddha’s forehead in the face of the sleeping Vishnu. Even the long ears of the statue are very reminiscent of Buddhist iconography we see around the valley.  As for the name Budhanilakantha, there’s a story about Shiva drinking poison during the Samudra Manthan. His throat was burning, so he struck the mountain with his trishul and created Gosaikunda Lake. The water from that lake is said to flow down to the pond at Budhanilakantha, and since Shiva’s called Nilakantha, that might be how the place got its name.

            "body": "I and two of my friends (they both abroad now) had once planned to open a Chhyang Factory in Nepal.   Before anything, I did thorough research, budget allocation, finding international markets, our cultural ties to the drink, even learnt to craft it with help of my Newar Friend circle and their families. For the extension of the project I went to Ilam in search of world class millet and spices. Got few leads, came back bought equipments and started making it. Everything was precise, the ferns and ferments, batch tested almost died drinking the first batch, created and recreated again to make a perfect batch. I had documented every single activity.   Now just to be sure, I first went to IRO, the main office of revenue, Lazimpat to check if the laws of Nepal permits Chhyang; and the officials were quite helpful about it, they turned the pages, pointed out Chhyang as rice beer and mentioned it was taxed 10/- NPR per liter as per the laws of Nepal.   Quite hopeful, we set up a meeting with the director of DOI for the next day, stayed all night to give final touch to our documentations, confident that we will be able to establish one.   Next day, both technical and general directors were in the room during our appointment. We presented our plan, applications and the available resources we had for the establishment.   “Bhanne bittikai tesari paincha?” The first words from the reputed officials. It might not be simple but we had our budget, the land lease requirements, technical scheme, and everything intact.   Our point was, “Nepal ko identity drink Korea bata import huncha, with hefty taxes, but if we do it here instead, we would be able to minimize import, provide employment opportunities and possibly export it too!”  I know Korea has it there as their drink as Makgeolli, but merely importing it instead of making chhyang here makes no sense.   After long discussion, the directors came to the conclusion that we submit our proposal with all the schemes, technicalities and budget and then have a meeting with the industry board lead by then minster for Industry, Mahesh Basnet.  We shook our heads, submitted our file, told that we will be called someday for this matter, could be tomorrow or 10 years from now.   We almost gave up at that point. Now both my friends are abroad, promising to return back if they call, but no one calls.   I don’t expect them to call, but sometimes I go to various chatpate stalls just to check if I find the pages of our documentation wrapping those 20/- or 50/- ko chatpate.   TL;DR  1. Nepal imports korean makgeolli as Chhyang, full of preservatives to keep it alive for a ling time.   2. Thoroughly researched-made documentations, technical schemes, budget allocations for establishing Chhyang as a well-lived Nepali Drink.  3. Visited IRO, the main revenue office and got a green flag from them for the establishment.   4. DOI doesn’t give a f\\*ck, instead implied that this is not possible as their books doesn’t recognize Chhyang, so asked us to submit the proposal documents and their classic “pachi aaunu”.  5. Friends gave up moved abroad. I still check if I can find the pages of the proposal wrapped in Chatpates or Badams.",

The system itself is messed up, so obviously one person alone can’t fix everything on their own. There will be tons of hurdles, especially in the capital city of the country. Not just the capital, honestly, you can even say Kathmandu as Nepal itself, because it has become the center for everything. No matter what work you have, you somehow have to come to Kathmandu for it. So yeah, I understand his situation.  The one thing I really criticize him for is his lack of communication. That is something I am very disappointed about. During his entire campaign, he kept saying that he wouldn’t be like previous mayors and that he would stay in constant communication with the public. But after winning, he almost completely stopped connecting with people. There is no proper accountability, just one-sided Facebook status updates. This is the part where I am extremely disappointed in him and openly criticize him.  Other than that, I think he has actually shown that work can be done. He has also given inspiration to young people to enter politics.|||Done In some ways  . Even non Exciting programs .Some Jhara tareko type. Some Unfeasible .. some better options appear and done.

It didn’t took me long to understand that he was just overhyped.   After he joined RSP where each members are opportunistic and work in Nepal for western interests it’s clear that he is not good candidate for prime minister.  He was voted to serve as a mayor, He could have waited until next election but for him misusing people’s trust and make them go against government by burning the Nation was easiest way to experience power.

The content is rarely original. It is compiled from existing news articles that anyone could find doing Google. It’s a summary service, not investigative journalism.  2. As it relies on secondary sources, it never goes deep. It stays on the surface of issues, prioritizing smooth editing over raw facts.  3. The channel’s main narrative is simple: 'The country is doomed.' This is a lazy narrative. Telling us that politicians are bad or the system is broken is stating the obvious. It validates anger but offers no insight.  If you want to be entertained, it works. But if you want to be informed, this is a waste of time.",

(Should I personally ask them to deduct 5% TDS?)  I also receive USD payments from an EU-based company. In that case, tax is deducted twice: first by the platform itself (approximately 3.5%), and then another 5% TDS is deducted here. When the funds arrive, my bank automatically converts the USD to NPR based on the prevailing exchange rate and credits it to my account in Npr.  I opened a USD account (dollar card) using my PAN. The annual limit is USD 500, but as far as I understand, this limit is only for payments/spending. Is it possible to increase this limit or ask the bank to keep incoming USD directly in that USD account instead of converting it to NPR?

Cant see both.|||if its real whatdo you do  ??? can you give some info or context|||I can see the angle of “look what you can get even from Nepal,” and yeah, that part can actually be motivating because a lot of people still assume they need to leave the country to reach certain compensation levels. But motivation usually comes from showing the path, not just the end result. A screenshot shows where you landed, not how you got there.  People here asked genuine questions about niche, stack, timeline, experience, etc because that’s the part that actually helps others move in that direction. That’s where the value would have been. Without that context, the post ends up reading more like a soft flex than mentorship. Nothing wrong with flexing, just don’t call it motivation if you’re not giving people anything they can learn from or replicate.  With 5+ years of experience you’ve seen enough of the field to know that the “how” matters more than the “what,” especially for people in Nepal who are trying to break into the global market.

There aren’t many good options in my country to receive international payments, so I used Binance P2P to convert USDT to local currency and send it to my bank account. This money is my salary, not trading profits or third-party funds.  This morning my bank froze my account without warning. These were my hard-earned savings that I was slowly building to someday build a home, so this hit me really hard mentally.  Tomorrow I’m going to the bank in person, but I’m unsure:  What exactly should I say to them?  What should I not say?  What documents usually help in these cases?  Has anyone here gone through something similar and successfully unfrozen their account?  Is there a real risk of losing the money, or is this usually just a compliance review?  I’m not trying to avoid laws or do anything shady. I just didn’t have a better way to receive my income.  Any advice or shared experiences would really help right now. Thanks for reading.",

With Automated workflows and Ai agents, team needing 100 members could only need couple members. That does mean Ai replaced 98 people among 100. That’s how I see.",

If I have the time, I might join if I'm free. If they were inviting Harvard professors, it'd cost you 10x more to attend. Events take time and effort. Many costs. Let's switch the focus to you. Have you organized an event? Was it easy? Who did you invite as a speaker?   If you're a student, why care about an enterprise AI event? I fail to see your criticisms. Not everybody needs to start a business to prove their credibility. It literally takes <20k.  I don't expect them to cover hf peft best practices. It's an event for enterprises. I don't have expectations for food. If I meet somebody interesting, that's good enough for me.  I think you're being confused between training courses and networking events. Plenty of events if you want to learn. ANAIS, NAAMII charged 12k for students this year. Was fine. Good stuff. Made many friends.  I dislike AI non-profits that claim to do research and fail to have any publications or research projects, yet say they're open to collaborations. But the AI association isn't a research body, probably does just events. Executives don't open up VS code and grind all day. That's a very small minority. They're skilled, just not in a way that appeals to you. They bring in investors, organize events, lots of things. If you ask me, there's a lot more to a product than PRs and merges. If you're not already the Lead for some MNC, some humility helps. It's dumb to say a CEO doesn't have skills because they don't code like you do, don't you think?  I'm not affiliated with naamii or any non-profits.|||On one hand, I can see the low effort poster with multiple mistakes and the fluffy pointless nonsense that is the main paragraph probably written by ChatGPT with a 6 word prompt. There's no mention of the \"Experts\" that are supposed to lead the thing.  On the other hand, your post has offered no genuine criticism of the event. It is just as pointless as the poster. Maybe offer anecdotes? Some tangible verifiable reason to justify your \"nrs 350 for 2.5 hours is a massive waste\".  Organizing an event comes with some cost, and some of that must be passed to the visitor. NRS 350 is some money, it is definitely not a lot of money. It is most definitely not \"expensive\" for an event in any sense of the word.   Justify your claims. Why is this a \"scam\"? What other way can a person \"use nrs 350 to learn by yourself\" (your words)?

Try Fine-tuning models, edge devices deployments , local end to end pipelines, and stuff  and you will be pretty strong.||| Too much Medical: You’ve got 4 medical projects. It looks a bit like academic practice. Swap 2 of them for something else (like Finance or E-commerce) to show you can handle different types of data. Flex that MLOps project: Move the ICU Deterioration one to the top! It’s your best flex because it mentions monitoring and drift (Prometheus/Grafana). That’s exactly what remote MLOps recruiters are looking for. Make Demos \"One-Click\": Make sure those [Demo] links go to a live site (Streamlit/Hugging Face). For remote jobs, if they can't see it working in 5 seconds, they might skip it. Add some numbers: In your internship part, try to mention a % improvement or a specific result. \"Built a model\" sounds okay, but \"Boosted accuracy by 15%\" sounds like a pro.|||[deleted]|||If you're  starting make it one page not 2|||Limit it to 1 page.

I was working for one of the renowned company.. they made us use the cursor. They kept telling us to have 2x productivity. We also able to burn the tickets more that we used to do in non AI days.. cursor was able to grasp a project context and was able to finish our 5 sp task as of 1 sp task 😅😅.  we work in micro service architecture and we need to constantly give cursor the context about other services and there was also dependency with others team and well cursor cannot communicate with other team like a actual human do 😁 So the point is that if the system is complex cursor/AI won't be able to do all things on its own.   But recently I switched company. Here we are now building smaller smaller project and sending it to the mass to get subscriptions as fast as possible.. and guess what we are using lovable to build the system. Lovable + supabase + stripe = boom product.   So in this case the point is that if the system you are building is simpler and you have clean vision even people from marketing can now build the system. And believe me marketing head from my company had done that in 2 weeks.    I don't know what future holds.. but guys sakney belaa paisaa shorna sakey shorum hai 😅😅|||The thing to contemplate on is : \"The job was never to write code it was to think in that case it's only the typing long lines with a keyboard that has replaced been replaced\".   The lack of job on the other hand is because of economy, greedy rich people, saturated graduates market and incompetent middle/upper management.|||I think it's a bit nuanced than that. Who created the design document based on client requirements? As of now these tools are great at doing grunt work and they work great in the hands of someone who knows how to translate complex business asks into technical details.

Everything was finalized with the product owner and I researched a bit in the code base what existing tested methods exist. Then boom, give cursor clear instructions. Done in 10 minutes. So then I realized what I have in hand that an inexperienced ones have - already useful skill, product knowledge and codebase knowledge. That is helping me in productivity. But the real growth and survival will happen if I gain the skills of a lead like a team lead, a manager, a product owner, or solution architect or any kind of lead is fine. And you won’t see many leads in a team. Leads are already out standing. So You have to figure out how you can be the lead.|||All|||AI will **replace a significant portion of developers**, and not in some distant future. This is already happening, and it will accelerate rapidly over the next 12–24 months as AI tools get mass-adopted inside companies.  That said, the outcome isn’t as simple as “developers are done.”  What’s actually happening is a restructuring of value.  As companies begin laying off junior and mid-level developers, they won’t eliminate development teams entirely. Instead, they’ll rely on fewer, highly reliable developers who can handle much more work with the help of AI. This creates a paradoxical situation: layoffs on one side, high demand on the other, but only for the right people.    If you come from a development background, the smartest move right now is simple:  * Become exceptional at using AI as a force multiplier. * Just knowing how to code won’t be enough anymore. That used to be the differentiator; now it’s table stakes.    **What matters now is:**  * Knowing how to think in systems * Translating vague requirements into clear specs * Using AI to generate, refactor, test, debug, and ship faster * Understanding architecture well enough to spot what AI gets wrong * Owning a specific niche deeply enough to solve high-value problems quickly    Companies won’t pay top dollar for someone who can “do everything moderately well.”  They will pay very well for someone who can fix a very specific, painful problem reliably.  And let’s be honest: saying “AI won’t replace humans” is already outdated. It has started replacing roles; not because AI is perfect, but because it’s good enough when paired with the right person.  If a non-technical person, like myself, someone who loves tech but never formally learned coding, can now build a full-fledged system using tools like ChatGPT and Replit, then the competitive bar has fundamentally shifted.  AI isn’t coming for jobs.   It’s coming for generic skill sets.    **So the choice is clear:**  * Either level up into a top-tier senior developer who designs systems, makes decisions, and leads execution * Or become a highly specialized mid-level developer with deep expertise in one niche and excellent AI leverage  Anything in between is the danger zone.  This isn’t a threat, it’s an opportunity.  But only for those who adapt early and intentionally.  Cheers!|||Lmao CRUD/landing page ta garihaalxa ni.

After +2, I applied to Canada and the USA for further studies, but my visa got rejected. Instead of wasting a year, I joined BBS , and now I’m in my 3rd year.  When the visa didn’t work out, I decided to take responsibility for my own future. I started learning about AI, automation, and new technologies. Over time, I picked up practical skills, experimented a lot, and eventually started freelancing. Right now, I work as an AI Developer on Upwork, and even in the early stage, I’m earning more than 1 lakh NPR per month.  I’m not an expert and I still have a lot to learn but I know my strengths. I’m good at managing things, people, sales, content, and marketing, and I can execute fast. I have learned most of this by consuming real-world information online and applying it through actual work.  I have big plans in the AI space, but I also know that building something great alone is very difficult. That’s why I am looking for a technical co-founder, someone strong on the engineering side so we can build, learn, and grow together.  The idea is to:  * Start very small and lean * No heavy investment * Focus on AI services / automation / agency-style work * Only basic costs like hosting or APIs * Aim to generate revenue within 2–3 months  I currently live with my parents in Butwal, but I want to move to Kathmandu, take a small flat, and fully focus on building. I also plan to start creating content alongside the business.  I’m looking for someone who:  * Is disciplined and focused * Serious about long-term growth * Not into unhealthy habits * Wants a simple lifestyle with deep work * Has strong technical skills or is deeply committed to developing them  Most importantly, I want a co-founder who understands that things won’t always work. There will be hard times, failures, and uncertainty. During those phases, we should push and motivate each other, stay consistent, and keep moving forward. Even if something fails, we should come out smarter, stronger, and more experienced than before.  We don’t need much money to start just enough for basic living expenses. I have savings that allow me to manage accommodation and food for a long time, and I strongly believe we can make this sustainable within a few months.  The goal is simple:   Live together. Build together. Learn together. Grow together.  If you’re technically strong, disciplined, and serious about building a real AI business from Nepal, let’s connect.",

This has now gotten out of hand, and this type of behavior will surely spread to other tourist areas, especially those closer to the border like Sauraha and others. I have seen these 'tourists' in Thars and other SUVs riding recklessly on our highways, mocking our rules and laws. In my local area in the Terai, there have been a couple of incidents where such SUVs have hit locals, including traffic police, and fled to India.  Let's continue to do what we can from our end - I have reported the videos and his channel, and let's keep reporting those videos wherever we find them, and from any other Indian 'YouTubers'. Influencers from Pokhara need to raise their voices collectively on other popular social media channels like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Local influencers need to unite and raise this issue from their platforms in their individual capacities. Otherwise, we might be just one incident away from breaking news.  I will share this thread with a popular Indian YouTube journalist-The Deshbhakt. I have been following him, and he has made videos on such stupidity by Indian tourists. I will leave his Instagram link here so that everyone with evidence can share information.

Padhe lekheko anpad haru. Stephen Hawking ko contribution kati xa physics ma bujya xau? Like wtf is wrong with you guys?|||People usually miscalculate the complexity of human beings, even if those people are globe-renowned scientists or thinkers. We tend to reduce individuals into neat categories of \"good\" or \"bad,\" when in reality most human lives exist somewhere in a moral gray space.  The figures are indeed contributions to modern society, having shaped our understanding of the universe in the case of Stephen Hawking and the overwhelming propagation of personal computing that underpins everyday life, thanks to Bill Gates. Their contributions are objective in nature, measured, and historically significant.  The Epstein case has indeed cast a sinister shadow on the reputations and personal integrity of those associated with it. Any wrongdoing ought to be investigated, prosecuted, and judged on its merits. Accountability counts.  Yet, it is quite dangerous to erase or dismiss intellectual and scientific contributions on the basis of particular personal moral failures; by doing so, it is an effort to distort history. If we were to get rid of every successful idea that had come from flawed individuals, much of human progress would disappear along with those who themselves were flawed.  We can—and should—condemn bad behavior without discarding valuable, valid contributions to knowledge and society.  Scientists are more likely to value human progress, curiosity, and long-term thinking—but they are not immune to moral failure. Their work can be noble even when their personal lives are flawed. Judgment must be based on evidence, not archetypes.|||He did biggest contribution for science. Do you really believe that he did something with those minor girls? He can't even do anything.

They really do under estimate Balen at every step. During KTM mayoral run, UML were advertising for Balen, thinking they're pulling him down by going personal at every event.

Communism is really stupid if you look back at humanity now.|||This should be categorised as fictional book|||some deep shit ! ... op is not asking for superficial answer|||Technically, yes, he wrote the manual. But, Marx was a man who saw a disease but prescribed a medicine that was more toxic than the sickness. He wanted to fix the world by changing who owns the \"stuff\" without changing the \"human being\" who uses the stuff.  ​When you try to enforce \"equality\" through a state, you don't get a paradise; you get a prison. This is why Marxism has failed wherever it was tried as a rigid political tool.  ​Why \"Harkabad\" is the Antidote TODAY:  ​The reason we look toward a philosophy like Harkabad (Prakriti, Samskriti, Pravidhi) instead of Marxism or Western Capitalism is because it addresses the foundation, not just the \"economics.\" Harka Smapang has time and again said it has nothing to do with his name. He is suggesting a solution that isn't a western copy but suitable to the soil we stand on.   ​Marxism says: \"Who owns the factory?\" ​Capitalism says: \"How much can the factory produce?\" ​Harkabad says: \"Do we even need the factory if it kills the river (Prakriti) and destroys the community's soul (Samskriti)?\"  If you ask me if we need \"Harkabad,\" I would say we need Consciousness.  ​Harka Sampang is essentially bringing consciousness to governance. When he goes out and carries stones with his own hands (Shramadaan), he is moving from the \"ugly\" socialism (taking from others) to the \"wonderful\" socialism (giving of oneself).  ​We don't need a \"Communist\" revolution where blood is spilled to change the law. We need a \"Harkabad\" style evolution where sweat is spilled to restore the land. ​You don't need a book from 19th-century Germany to tell you how to live. You just need to look at the earth beneath your feet and the people around you.",

The feeling of my heart having faster and my stomach twisting like an eel holding it's prey is not new to me but still it's not wholly mine.   The feeling of lying in the bed with inherent thoughts of disperse happiness and the want to be able to understand if that happiness is as true as it seems is not new and it's also not wholly mine   I look at all these motion picture hoping to find something. And what that might be is as ananomus to me as it is to you. I look at these things, listen as they talk, but the existence of this feeling of watching doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm lying on this virgin earth, unmolested and untouched, devoid of any feeling of any sort except for one; consciousness. The consciousness reigns supreme within and without all within the vicinity of my existence.  At this point, life as you call it feels not a moments passing by or time flowing like my thoughts.  My head feels particularly heavy, as if I'm thinking but a thought is yet to process. But how can this be? Without a thought, how can you think? How can one live, without knowing the value of death? But that's not right either. For one to know the value of death,.one must first know of its qualities, it's feature in all it's dimensions. The inherent idea of a thought being, and to think not sounds stupid as if not funny enough. But you can't overlook the idea behind such ponder.   I take very long breaths as I think. My heart beats loud enough for me to hear it. And all my bodily functions seems very much obvious to me. This isn't new but it's not wholly mine.   Ahh now my head hurts a little to. But this shall too pass.   Theres this lingering feeling of solitude that I feel very sensationally. For solitude has been my friend far longer then any. The silence that made me feel alone after some years felt not pleasing but good enough to make me feel a bit stingy if it got disturbed.  But now this solitude engulfs me, strangles me so that I choke these thoughts out of me which are yet to be. But it was this very solitude that made me form a thought but now it want it back. Like how death waits right Infront of you, lingers above you with it's hands around neck, and then takes you through the stairs of lifelessness while you climb oblivious. Similar is the solitude that I experience right now, but instead of lifelessness, I climb and climb but towards nothing, I climb and climb but climb on empty thoughts.   My agitated muscles ache in the silence of my breath while my breath gets shorter and heavier each micro instant.",

School ma A plus lyauni manche sidhai barely passing ko level ma pugey. Kati palta exam disakesi suicidal thoughts aauthyo fail vayo vane k hola vanera. Tara aile I realized its not that serious. Ofc sapna bokechau hola voliparsi kehi garni and u gotta work hard. But dont push yourself too hard , enjoy your life a little . Your life wont end due to a damn exam there is much more to do in life. Aba parents haru ta karai rahanchan . What even can we do lol? Ani btw you are pretty damn good in maths . You will improve in other subjects too . Dont stress out|||I am in 12 now. 11 ko first term was best for me all 60 above (except that damn physics) chem ma ta 64 aathyo but i didn't think that much and tried to do good in physics.   2nd term ma physics ma 49 aayo but chemistry ma 45 that drop of 19 marks made my mental health go blind. I gave up on chemistry and physics, I didn't even want to study these two anymore tara after 3rd term 11 final 12 pre term, finally 12 ko 1st term ma physics and chem ma 52 and 53 aathyo respectively. I was satisfied enough. Ani 2nd term ma ahile physics dhostai xa, chem chain tight teacher parexa k huni ho thaxaina.   So to explain what happened here: 1. Course ko amount badhepaxi the marks drastically drop as you and I both faced.  2. The amount of stuff you have to remember is always more than you remember.  3. For mcq and reasoning questions you must read books cuz teachers don't cover everything.  At last, 11 doesn't matter that much as marks and grades, 11 class is just about the memories you build that 12 might not give you.  You look like a study kinda guy so you might have friends like that too, so i am telling you the reality here. The friends you have might not have that chill attitude later in 12th so enjoy the memories you are building cuz in 12 everyone around you will suddenly start focusing on studying and you might fall behind so 12 ma jani bittikai start learning concepts especially physics ko.   Tips for you in 11  1. Grab any opportunity you have become CR club member Host of program sing or whatever you are good at cuz you will be remembered by that more. Also being a CR or club member will benefit your bidesh ko lagi.  2. Try understanding concepts of everything. Science is all about logic if you don't understand the logic behind it you can't understand the science behind it.  3. Feel free to ask to teachers, they are not your enemies. Friends might suppress your curiosity but it doesn't mean teachers won't listen to you. Concepts bujhdainau bhane teachers lai gayera sodha If you are shy to ask them in public. Go to the teachers in the staff room or meet them in the corridor, hallways and question them. Doing this, some of your friends might call you teacher ko chatne or something like that ignore them cuz you are the one who is gonna stand in that interview after 12th not them.  4. Chill.  Tips for 12 Doing 1 will help you be a face that everyone recognizes in 12. If you don't do 1 you might regret it in 12 so go for it.  Keep doing 2 and 3. After a few months into 12, you will realize that its all about what you understand. If you can understand the concept you will remember the formulae. Like physics ko nai kura garda, concept bujhexa bhane timle mathematically k garne yaad hunxa tespaxi dimaag ma or paper mai tyo derive garera formula lekhna sakxau.   This is all about the tips rant and motivation i have for you|||dm me",

Them ignoring you just means that they’re not a good friend, straight up red flag.   You could drag this attention towards yourself and then work on yourself, learn new hobbies and skills.  Try making friends online. Join communities you like and be present there. It’s all good, i also had this wave of loneliness hitting me at the start of first term but i didn’t let it back me down.
