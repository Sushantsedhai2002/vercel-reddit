If I was an airline company and someone tells me to lower my fare rates. I would stop operating.|||Capitalists do and say these things and wonder why people want communism more and more. Lmao.

Prices are lower in off-season and higher in peak-season. But after a certain point, it feels like price gouging. This is not only me, there are plenty of articles (scientific, philosophical, governmental research) which talks about this.  In conclusion (not mine) it feels fair if there is also a decrease in price with dynamic pricing not just increase. Also the effects seems harsh if you get the short end of the stick.  Imagine a case that my little company has to make 3 business trips to a (smallish) city to serve a critical customer (let's call it customer X). Because of how the deal is done, we charge a good price (for both parties) to the customer X, and we take care of the hotel and travel for the experts to serve this customer. Now imagine 2 of these visit in a year happened when there was a big concert in that city. So instead of getting a train ticket for 60 euros and hotel per 180 euros per night, the charges were 300e for travel and 750 per night for the hotel because of dynamic or surge pricing. The job is about 6-7  working days (8-9 real days) so my company is down about 30k instead of 7k with a 3 person expert team, per visit. That's a 46k loss in a year just from one account.  Now I am sure you're gonna say. Well plan your trips better. That would be only possible if we would know the date in advance. We usually know the dates like a month in advanced tops and no the services cannot be postponed when the prices get better due to it being critical maintenance of crucial systems . Second, the prices go that high in a day when the concert is announced and concerts are usually announced about a year and half early on average, which is not even in the same fiscal year to plan for these things, even if the dates would be known.  You cannot blindly believe it's fair and legal. I am not saying it's illegal, in fact it's not illegal but should it be? So currently, the government and consumer advocacy group is trying to figure things out and asking these kind of question, if it is fair for the consumers. It's has nothing to do about understanding economics. Besides if you let the companies run rampant, they will do the most evilest of things. This is true even when regulations are placed. If the government and regulations are by the people, for the people. These kind of things should be reviewed and controlled. If you don't think so, then I think you are just conditioned to take everything without questioning.|||No you are wrong, they do. That is why everyone is aiming to move to more economically stable countries. I did not read the content, I just liked your heading and had better explanation.|||There is a question of \"why are people not getting minimum wages?\". Minimum wage is actually driving unemployment rates.    Lets Company X wants a salesman. He wants to spend max 15k in order to keep him with a good profit. BUT surprise, labor law prohibits it.    NOW what happens if we go the legal way? - He would not be employing one.    If he goes Practically, he employs one in his desired rate because he can always find some desparate salesman wanting money without any agreement of which he can have power of full exploitation.    Its because there is a labor suplus for the salesman. If there had been labour deficit, he cannot practically employ one at the rate he wants to make profit on.      Because of the minimum wages, labour without agreements are exploited.   \\- Now if there had not been minimum wage, he would make a contract of employment with the same person and he cannot exploit him.",

What are the must-visit places around Manang once I get there? Also, should I go through a tour package or just plan it on my own?  For context, I‚Äôm 25M and just finished my Bachelor‚Äôs. Any tips or guidance would be really appreciated. Thanks!",

            "body": "I have seen recent things about Tashi and TOB, and I genuinely believe that the majority of Nepali people can't even think intellectually.  First things first, let's go with people objecting to Tashi because she is involved in the Free Tibet protest, because it will offend China, or because she is of Tibetan origin, or because it will offend China. Like bruh, why are you guys so afraid of China and think that when she is appointed as minister, China will cut all ties with Nepal and sanction Nepal? People think supporting the Free Tibet movement is a crime. Is there no freedom of expression and protest in Nepal when things don't fit your agenda? Do you believe China will be more pissed off at overthrowing its puppet government or appointing someone who supports the Free Tibet movement?  And also those intellectuals who say Tibet was under serfdom, so China liberated it in 1950. You forget that Nepal was under Rana rule until 1951, which was the same or worse than the Tibetan serfdom, then under the panchayat system from 1960 to 1990, so Nepal isn't any better. Wasn't it deserving for the Free Democratic Union of India to liberate Nepal back then? And the annoying ones are those who say \"btw I support one China policy\", one China policy has nothing to do with Tibet, it's between PRC and ROC (Taiwan), so you guys only made a fool of yourself. Setting aside whether Tibet should be free after seeing the video of the gun with TOB, everyone is calling for their arrest because of the propaganda spread by the UML cyber sena or whatever.  Nobody is questioning why they were arrested, like the Nepal Police has the burden of Proof on themselves, not those guys, if they said it was not a real gun and there has not been a single case of them using any gun or threatning people with gun, the Nepal Police has to find evidence that they possess gun and then get the warrant and arrest them, or is there no due process in Nepal?? If there is really no due process in Nepal, and they were just arrested to be interrogated, why can't you do the same for Oli, Lekhak, and all who were involved in the massacre of the protesters? Now, is it illegal to arrest without due process and evidence, when in both instances we clearly have the visuals, heck, there are even so many casualties in the second case, but the intellectuals will believe the police should do everything to crack down on TOB and arrest everyone involved with the Free Tibet protest because everyone in the Protest is sponsored by the CIA, Are you sponsored by PLA? Or, are you afraid of PLA?  Also, although I am not a Rabi supporter but what is the justification for him being in custody for so long? Like, he is being prosecuted for a fraud case, and for cases like this, shouldn't he be released on Bail? Is he a danger to society, or a flight risk, or what? Do we really not have the rule of law in Nepal, or are our rules so stupid and Authoritarian that if someone gets prosecuted, they can only get out of jail if not found guilty? It's truly baffling.",

Toss in a pinch of cumin seeds to check if the oil‚Äôs hot enough. * Add **2 medium red onions**, finely sliced. Once they turn translucent, add the **mutton** and cook it covered for \\~10 mins on medium-high. * Add **¬Ω tsp turmeric** and **salt to taste** ‚Äî this helps draw out moisture from the mutton and onions. Cook another 5‚Äì10 mins on medium heat until most of the water evaporates. * Add **1 tbsp each ginger and garlic paste** and saut√© for 2 mins. * Then add your **ground spice mix**, **1 tsp red chili powder**, **1 tsp Kashmiri chili powder** (for color), and **1 tsp garam masala**. Cook 1‚Äì2 mins, splash a bit of water so the spices don‚Äôt burn, and let it simmer for another 2 mins. * Add **2‚Äì3 roughly chopped tomatoes**, cover, and cook for 3‚Äì5 mins. * Pour in about **1¬Ω cups of water**, close the pressure cooker, and cook on medium heat for about **3‚Äì4 whistles** (depending on your cooker and mutton tenderness). * Once the steam releases completely and the whistle is fully gone, open it up, give it a stir, and finish with a generous handful of **freshly chopped coriander leaves**.  P.S: I do not follow the recipe exactly all the time, I'm used to just adding stuff based on how I feel and what I have in the house. I do not measure anything most of the time since I have years of experience of making food for myself.  You can also get the spices like you have and completely get rid of the roasting proses once you've made it enough and don't really care because the spices are the same. Just don't forget the GG paste.    Edit: I used GPT to structure everything, don't judge me for it.|||If you want Nepali taste, this is not the one. our friend egohurtvayo has nicely elaborated it.

One guy was ready to invest too, but everyone slowly disappeared like they got flushed down the toilet.  The idea: When we shop online, it‚Äôs usually for three things:  1. Cost   2. Convenience   3. Variety    The problem: A lot of people shop online not because they prefer it, but because they can‚Äôt find what they need in their own city. Sometimes the product is already nearby ‚Äî we just don‚Äôt know where to look. Because of this, people end up waiting days or even a week for delivery.  The solution: Imagine if there was one platform that showed you every store and product available in your city. You could sit at home, browse all local shops, compare prices, and see exactly who sells what ‚Äî before stepping out.  Example: It‚Äôs Diwali and I need a specific disco light bulb I saw online. I don‚Äôt have time to wait for shipping, and I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôll arrive in good condition. Right now, I‚Äôd have to walk around town asking shop after shop if they have it. Most of them don‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt go asking ten stores.  But with a platform like this, I could search for the product, find which nearby shop has it, and buy it right away. That saves time and helps local sellers too.  Why I‚Äôm posting this: I‚Äôve tried to start this project a few times, but without funding, it‚Äôs been hard to test it in the real market. I was honestly about to give up, but figured I‚Äôd share it here. Maybe someone else sees the same potential or has advice on how to bring this idea to life.  I‚Äôm open to all kinds of feedback ‚Äî good or bad. Just wanted to finally put it out there and see what people think.  üôåüèΩ Would really appreciate your thoughts in the comments. üôåüèΩ",

Election Commission allowed registration until November 16, but more than half of that period falls during the holidays.  https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/index.php/news/political-parties-are-trying-to-sabotage-election-commission   >Just days after resolving a month-and-a-half-long dispute within the ruling coalition, the Nepali Congress has secured the appointment of the new Governor of Nepal Rastra Bank. Attention within the Nepali Congress‚ÄìCPN-UML alliance has now shifted to deciding who will be appointed the next Chief Election Commissioner. With Congress obtaining the governor‚Äôs post, UML leaders have argued that the position of Chief Election Commissioner should go to their party.  >Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba had previously stated during a conversation with journalists on May 6 that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had agreed to allow Nepali Congress to choose the central bank governor. In line with that agreement, Dr. Biswo Nath Poudel was appointed governor on Tuesday.  >Meanwhile, the Election Commission has been operating under an acting head for over a month. Ram Prasad Bhandari, who himself is facing a legal challenge in the Supreme Court over his own appointment, has been serving as acting chief commissioner. Currently, the commission is operating with only three out of its mandated five officials. One chief commissioner and one commissioner position remain vacant.  >**The commission had seen a sweeping round of appointments when the previous Oli-led government amended the Constitutional Council Act via ordinance and appointed 52 officials to various constitutional bodies in a single move.**",

He did bring noticeable changes to Kathmandu, not like he completely transformed the city but considering he was just a mayor he still did a lot.  His personality was inspiring too, that fearless attitude, directly calling out those old politicians to their faces, that boosted the confidence of the youth and made us feel like someone was finally speaking for us.  Then the protest started, he said he wouldn‚Äôt join because it was a Gen Z led movement and that was fine. But after the first day he made that heavy statement accusing KP Oli of killing 21 kids and that fueled the fire even more. More youth joined, including non Gen Z, and then opportunists jumped in and that is when chaos started, violence, looting, everything went off track.  He then told people to back off and this is where everything went wrong from his side. When the situation turned into complete chaos, when there was no PM and the army was taking control, that was the moment when we needed leadership, just a single update, a word, any guidance. But he stayed silent.  People will say maybe he got threats but let‚Äôs be real, no one could have touched him for just posting a statement. And I know he is always active on social media because he always is, so silence was a choice.  He didn‚Äôt visit the martyrs, he didn‚Äôt express sadness, he didn‚Äôt acknowledge anything. Instead, after days of silence he came back and started posting about Kathmandu development like nothing ever happened. It felt like he just didn‚Äôt care.  Now he is getting trolled, people are calling him an agent, blaming him for everything, and he is still silent. People will call it some sigma cold mindset but honestly this silence is just making him lose more and more supporters. He has already started realising this.  I don‚Äôt hate him, I have supported him for years and I still don‚Äôt hate him. I am just a frustrated supporter who had a lot of hope in Balen. But now that hope is gone and I don‚Äôt see him as our future Prime Minister anymore, and it hurts to admit that.",

Nepalese ko two three generation biteyko Cha to achieve this setup...starting from the revolt against ranas to the rajas...hamile hamro rights which we enjoy now it took dedication and sacrifice across different time periods to achieve it step by step...agadi ko Generation spent their lives to create this setup and because of that they have robust organization at every sector and every nook and corner of the country... uniharulai jati persecute vayo teti manche attract vayera party ma lagera participation badda they have got a strong organization today...as we all know parties were banned at one point before...  yo nai nabujhi half assed status updates ko pachi kudirachaum deraijana...paila sida Kura Huda Rabi snga kehi samaye king sanga aile tyo mayor balensnga...  You can be independent that is without having any party but can't say you don't have any ideology or political agenda.. the society is built upon diverse political interests... neglecting this diversity was the reason why we struggled for years to establish democracy...in the end it only helped the parties to grow and spread their branches across the country...yo struggle le garera nai they are where they are today...  You need ideology,vision,roadmap and Organisational capacity to bring change in the country... democracy is about the collection of that ideology, vision, roadmap which is presented in the election where ppl are free to choose...and it's representation is set in the parliament...  but ppl are following individuals jsko party nai chaina Organisation nai chaina ideology nai chaina tesko pachi kudiracha hawama...  What matters is votes...that votes is byproduct of robust Organisation ppl say vaguely masu bhaat...the big two even if they are humiliated at social media which raja Badi and anti system and independent are doing at mass scale because they haven't got the capacity of forming the organization that can compete with them...as they still get together every election around 50 to 60 lakhs votes...which is 50 60 percent of votes every time...  74 ma they got 60 lakhs votes together... 79 ma they got 50 lakhs votes together...  Rsp le 11 lakhs payeko thiyo think their votes got stolen... RSP ko rise yehi social media ko hype le garera vayeko thiyo so it won't be long term... because they don't have the organizational setup...banauna khojirachan but after attacks from both left and the right it hasn't been successful in attracting many ppl like previously...even the balendra also attacked them tespachi ta Organisation banna nai sakeyko chaina...badar le afno Ghar Pani banaudaina tehi Ho...  Esari koi Naya party which can compete against them must have a robust Organisation at all sectors and every level in every nook and corner of the country auna parcha to actually compete with them pahila suru ta... jitna ta tadako kura vayo...and Esto Organisation banna derai time devotion and sacrifice chaincha etikai hudaina...anybody falling for social media hype and propaganda are you willing to sacrifice your time ,job and education for desh banauney aviyan...or is it just mindless scrolling through the feeds and commenting in social media for change while they are adding thousands members everyday in their party physically...  Anybody who is promoting ideas the other way or only social media way it's safe to assume they are looking to bypass them like the king or other anti system elements to get their way...but even if they become successful it will be temporary as you can't leave around 50 80 lakhs people unhappy of the parties and expect the country to run smoothly...it has happened before as well like the king taking power but it actually made them where they are today...it actually built their Organisation as all of them united against the king... So there is no bypassing them...anybody selling you this is only selling you pipe dream...  I feel balendra is also part of that political propaganda for something like directly elected pm or anti parties propaganda to bypass them...taevayera He will not form party...He will just sit behind like the king and spread propaganda against the parties hoping that one day some opportunity will come and tyo agenda fulfill huncha vanera...which is only wishful thinking no substance...  Because the whole concept of the parties and organisation is to maximize ppls participation, connection and role in politics...the party is a common platform where ppl can actively participate in politics which was banned by the kings before...it's about connection between the ppl and the power with different hierarchical structure in place...if someone just pops up at the top and has no connection with the ppl...there would be problems sooner or later...politics is not fairytale or Fantasy...  Vote matters and tyo vote Nepal ko contextma robust Organisation le lyaucha...  Its about dominance..the big two have a very strong organisational setup and there are other parties and anti system elements who haven't been able to compete with them by making the same scale of organisation...so they are using social media to their fullest and hoping to influence the disorganised mass so they can bypass them...hamro politics esma revolve vairacha...  Like the anti system or rajabadi guys who wants to change the system but they lack the organisational capacity..  Like the maoist who wants to bypass the parties so they are pushing for directly elected pm because they lack the organisational capacity to challenge the big two...  Like the independent guys who are using social media to their fullest against the parties to create a narrative...it is deliberate and carefully orchestrated with no cross question against them...taevayera balendra is not giving interviews as he wants to set narrative through social media with his one sided status updates...to create a grand confirmation bias amongst the mass...harka seems as though is for the system and the republic for which he faced backlash as well for his anti hindu fb leak but balendra has been carefully avoiding to take any stance for or against the system as it will divide his followers...so he is deliberately keeping to himself so that he can be able to concentrate the popularity and keep hitting the parties...it aligns with the anti system guys as they are using him and giving interviews everyday on youtube to spread their propaganda at mass scale to brainwash the disorganised mass...they wanted a poster boy they got it in balen...as it fits the image as well as he is young to use the youth card to sell their agenda to the youth as well...esp the disorganised mass esp the ppl who lack understanding how politics works...but still this is only propaganda as it lacks substance...its a beautiful pipe dream but reality is different hence the motive is very questionable...  Yo tussle ma RSP caught in between and was made the scapegoat...as RSP was against the dominance of big two parties which goes against the big parties and against the anti system guys as they are supporting this system...Rsp was also against balendra on some issues like street vendors and sukumbasi but he labelled them as chor...  They were making an organisation going the right way democratically but after attacks from all sides it has stopped...the big two parties dominance continues and the anti system or rajabadi or the propaganda against the big two continues...and their tussle continues....  So because they can't fight against them by making a strong organization across the country and convincing ppl at the ground level... unorganized or colour revolution has been planned by placing the seeds of hatred and Frustration and using social media to create hate amongst the mass esp unorganized mass esp towards young ppl who have no understanding how politics works...some are real some are exaggerated...  They have created a scenario where they are trying to generalise the whole party or party system as bad...they want to paint it black and white...but it doesn't work that way... democracy will eventually boomerang against anyone who thinks they are the chosen one...I hope nobody thinks that way esp when you have diverse political interests, ethnicity,regional interests...",

And now when everyone needed his fans be like \"uslai maardinxan\". Only reason media is not being harsh to him is cz these undecided, neutral people will move to support RSP/Rabi which media doesnt want, so they are trying to not attack Balen much, but once Rabi is done, he gonna get same treatment.   In present scenario, case on Balen is more seriouis, \"Raajdroha\" is very serious allegations. Rabi ko case court bata handle huncha sooner or later, but balendra lai \"Raajdroha\" or \"deshdrohi\" tag sadhai laagne wala cha, ani jaba oldies back to power, balen ki ta mainstram politics maa audaina daraera ki uslai ni jata jata todfod aagjani vako cha teta teta case lagaera dulaidinxan, i dont balen is that daring guy so he will probably take rest from politics.|||Foundation binako structure eventually collapses... organization binako political structure also do... democracy lai tangible Organisation le banaucha not hashtags or clout of social media....|||Because of deep rooted politics in our country.

Cause in recent years STD/STI disease is rapidly increasing in Nepal|||Summary from chatGPT: Tei vayera modern science is completly behind.  Because, my friend, modern science treats erectile dysfunction (ED) like a Wi-Fi issue: ‚ÄúIs the signal reaching? Is the blood flowing? Okay, then problem solved.‚Äù It‚Äôs obsessed with the plumbing and keeps ignoring the software.  Here‚Äôs the ugly truth:  1. They only nailed the mechanical model. Science understands blood vessels, nitric oxide, PDE5 inhibitors (Viagra, Cialis)‚Ä¶ all that jazz. Works fine if your problem is blocked arteries or low blood flow. But when the cause is neurochemical ‚Äî say, from meds, trauma, or chronic stress ‚Äî it‚Äôs like trying to fix a broken motherboard with a wrench.   2. No one funds the hard stuff. There‚Äôs no big-money incentive to research subtle neuroendocrine or receptor-level dysfunctions like what happens in SSRI-induced ED or PSSD. Those are messy, long-term, and unprofitable. You can‚Äôt sell a patented ‚Äúbrain receptor recalibrator.‚Äù   3. They don‚Äôt measure what matters. Standard blood tests check testosterone, prolactin, LH, FSH, thyroid, etc. But you can have perfect labs and still have ED ‚Äî because the problem isn‚Äôt your hormones, it‚Äôs your receptor sensitivity, dopamine-serotonin balance, or peripheral nerve signaling. None of those show up on blood work.   4. Psychiatry and urology barely talk. So you get a urologist saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all in your head‚Äù and a psychiatrist saying ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not my department.‚Äù Basically, two blind men arguing about the color of an elephant.   5. ED research is stuck in symptom management. Pills, pumps, and performance anxiety therapy ‚Äî great short-term tools, but no one‚Äôs really asking, why do these systems stop responding biologically in the first place?    If you want to be blunt about it: science isn‚Äôt ‚Äúbehind‚Äù because it‚Äôs stupid; it‚Äôs behind because it chose the easy parts. Blood flow is measurable. Neurochemical dysfunction? Not so much.  You want the frontier? It‚Äôs in neuromodulation, receptor resensitization, and gut-brain hormone axis. But those fields are barely waking up.|||ED vaneko hamro D hard na hunu haina penetration ko lagi?

Eleven of our sons, including Bipin Joshi, who arrived in Israel just 25 days before Hamas‚Äôs October 7, 2023, bloodbath, were brutally murdered. Four days ago, 48 hostages clung to life; now, only 20 survive. Hamas‚Äôs ‚Äújustified‚Äù slaughter, draped in twisted dogma, mocks humanity. Two years of torment, dangling hope of Bipin‚Äôs survival, only to end in his cold-blooded killing by these bloody cowards. At home, Gen Z‚Äôs September ‚Äúuprising‚Äù killed 51, including kids, burning Kathmandu, freeing 12,500 criminals to prop up corrupt elites‚Äô spoiled brats. Our nation‚Äôs credibility is trashed, a global joke. Hamas and their ilk, like Jamkash, happily point fingers at Jews and Hindus for every woe, but when it‚Äôs time to face their own kind, they scatter like roaches, spineless.

            "body": "Once, I (27F) was traveling from my hometown to Kathmandu. A woman and her son sat next to me on the bus. I usually get along well with older women because I‚Äôm soft-spoken and shy, I mostly listen, and they often end up sharing their life stories with me.  This woman immediately took a liking to me and started talking. At first, I thought she just wanted to be friendly, but later I realized she had other motives. She seemed nice overall, but her main goal was clearly to find a wife for her son. I was flattered that she thought I‚Äôd be a good match, but it made things a bit uncomfortable.  Even before she spoke to me, I‚Äôd noticed her son looking at me several times. It was obvious he had a crush on me. He seemed shy or maybe just polite which I appreciated because it spared me from having to reject him outright. Still, I wasn‚Äôt interested at all. I avoided looking at him or talking to him because I didn‚Äôt want to give him the wrong idea. Honestly, I‚Äôm surprised he hasn‚Äôt picked up on my lack of interest by now.  He‚Äôs in his early 30s, about five years older than me, but I just don‚Äôt find him attractive in any way. Once, after a service, I accidentally made eye contact with him and immediately turned my whole body away, I feel like that should‚Äôve made things pretty clear.  Whenever his mom is around, she keeps trying to talk him up to me. He just stands there smiling politely while she does all the talking. I usually change the subject, excuse myself, or try to avoid her altogether, but she‚Äôs persistent and won‚Äôt back down.  She always talks about him in a way that‚Äôs implied not outright saying ‚Äúdate my son,‚Äù but trying to highlight his good qualities so I‚Äôll notice him. If I were to call her out on it, I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôd deny it. I‚Äôve even told her I‚Äôm not looking to date anyone right now and that I‚Äôm focused on my studies. When she first heard that, she looked shocked and concerned, as if something was wrong with me. Then she brushed it off and kept going, which felt disrespectful.  She‚Äôs really fixated on the idea that I‚Äôd be the perfect wife for her son , but I want absolutely nothing to do with him.  I can easily see this turning into drama if I tell her directly that I‚Äôm not interested. I don‚Äôt want to create an awkward or tense situation, but I also don‚Äôt know what I should‚Äôve done at that time to handle it better.",

There are 0 to none scholarships for international students in the UK. Medicine jhan is  designed for UK residents only. If you were to (suppose) get a conditional offer, then you are expected to pay all your fees on your own! They only let few international students in this course in the hopes of making profit. So sorry to say but this isn't realistic.  Ani, the hours you can work as an international student CANNOT even pay off your living expenses; let alone school fees considering medicine is the most costly of them all (around 15- 20k pounds I believe per year). So if you can afford spending 500k pounds for just the fees for 6 years of medical school (not even considering the average cost of living) then sure, shoot your shot. This isn't the US. You aren't given full rides or scholarships. You need to be realistic.   MBBS Nepal ma padha then you can try going to the UK.

You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

Even after taking reexam on both, i don't think i will pass. because of me failing on my exams, my mother and entire relatives blame me that i didn't try hard enough, didn't study and other similar things. my mother calls me a faliure, that i destroyed her dreams and i brought her nothing but pain etc etc.       i tried , i tried to focus on class, watched youtube, searched notes, asked the topper friends what they did at home and studied. heck, because of that tension and stress my hair started falling out, at age 17.    i was not even a bad student before. i even got A on SEE.       when choosing what to study, my friends choose management, but following the WISHES of my family and relatives, i choose science. after a week, i told her that i find science hard but she said just \"**The admission money is already paid and is only half can be refunded**\" totaL was 20,000+ BOOKS. and i failed again and again and again.    and still to this day, she screams and brings up my results in every argument and uses me as a example infront of my sister everyday.  now, she has said \" **if you fail again, then go get a room away from home and do what you want or study again from class 11 in management from the start\".**  now, i don't want to get out of my house without proper source of income. i can do every single house work and can even cook nearly everything , no problem if i start living alone. but it will be problem with no money or limited money.  and i would rather die than study and take that tension for another two years again. my mind is already way too damaged from that.  so, if i fail is there a course that i can get in techical line or something. like i heard that there are courses (18 months - 3 years ) that one can complete and start working , even if only SEE passed.    so , if there is any course that exists, please tell me.",

In very rare, exceptional cases, NTC may have options for extremely large accidental top-ups, though the taxes already paid to the government make a full reversal highly complex. * **Attempt a formal complaint through the digital wallet:**¬†If they used a digital wallet like eSewa or Khalti, they should file a complaint with that wallet provider. These wallets can act as intermediaries and request a reversal from¬†[Nepal Telecom](https://www.ntc.net.np/), though ultimately, NTC controls the outcome.¬†  Long-term strategies for using the balance  Since a refund is almost certainly not an option, the best approach is to recover the value over time by converting the credit back into cash.  * **Offer balance transfers to friends and family:**¬†The¬†Reddit user¬†can offer to transfer balance to friends and family in exchange for cash. This is a common and reliable method of liquidating NTC balance.    * **Balance transfer limits:**¬†NTC allows up to 20 transfers per day, with a maximum of Rs. 500 per transfer.    * **Execution:**¬†They can use the NTC mobile app or the USSD code¬†`*422*SecurityCode*RecipientNumber*Amount#`¬†to initiate transfers. * **Offer mobile top-ups in the local community:**¬†For people who prefer cash transactions, the user can act as an unofficial recharge agent. They can offer to top up people's phones in exchange for cash, perhaps at a small discount to incentivize the transaction. * **Bundle and sell discounted packages:**¬†The user can purchase various voice, data, and SMS packs offered by NTC and resell them to others at a discounted rate. For example, they could buy a large 28-day data pack with a market value of Rs. 999 and sell it to someone for a reduced cash price. * **Use the balance for services and bills:**¬†The user can offer to pay for other people's utility bills that can be settled via an NTC number and accept cash in return. This could include things like landline or internet service bills if NTC provides them.¬†  Warning for the Reddit user  * **Scams:**¬†Advise the user to be very cautious about offers from strangers promising to buy the balance or provide a refund. They should only perform transactions with people they know and trust to avoid losing the balance without getting paid. * **Security code:**¬†The NTC security code for balance transfers is like a bank PIN and should never be shared with anyone. The user must perform all transfers themselves.¬†|||1xbet money.|||I have seen such thing alot of times I don't think now they did it mistakenly.

They didn‚Äôt let the father go downstairs  thinking it might just escalate the situatio. So, they called the police station, gave them their address, and asked them to come as soon as possible.  They waited but nobody came. Eventually, the father went down to confront him but the man ran away. Their father and their brother tried to chase him, but he hid somewhere. They stayed at the gate for about 30 minutes, thinking he might return. Neither the man nor the police showed up.

Somebody has to form a new party, then organize and expansion on all 77 districts within 4-5 months. This is highly difficult task.  So I think it's better to vote for their enemy, whoever it may be. Even RaPraPa is a better option right now.  RSP hate bandwagon only helps UML and Congress crawl back into power.|||I don't think so.  RSP Don't have cyber Sena like yml ( it has one called yuwa sang and student union), congress ( Tarun dal, student union, Gagan thapa own army), maobadi ( ycl, student union), RPP ( youth union), etc.|||Hijack haina bro bikalpa nai rsp ho ahile ho paribesh ma.

Haha  Jokes aside, I do believe the presence of RSP/Ravi is very heavy on the internet and does not necessarily mean the 'cyber-sena'. It could simply be because most of their supporters happen to be relatively younger and fluent on social media. Just like the Gen-Zs.   The online presence is far from the real votes on the ground. Otherwise, you could expect RSP, or Balen, or GenZ, or any new forces to win the majority of the votes, which sadly is a distant dream for now.|||It's very easy to tell whether they were bots or not. When ‚ÄòArrest Rabi‚Äô was trending, I questioned many of those anti-Rabi posters, they either didn‚Äôt reply or couldn‚Äôt respond when cross-questioned. You can do the same here, just cross-question them. I have been supporting RSP since 2022, so you cant tag me as bot.|||Rabi ko supporter naya hainan baru portest ko bela aayeka rabi haters le chai hijack hanya ho. Protest ko bela unexpected hate pairako thyo rabi le. The hate was skytouching. See this, yemale and congress ko cyber sena ekdum strong xa as compared to any other. So if you any hate against balen or rabi or any non party affiliated strong candidate. It's not hard to distinguish them. Usually, they have an account not older than 1 week.|||RSP is the best available option for now, I think.|||Yes, in all nepal subs.|||Because eauta alternative politics ma aako comparatively swaccha chhabi vako party lai bina thulo kaaran badanaam gariyo asti aasti.....aba the truth must prevail so RSP ko post aairako ho jasto lagxa malai jasle closely bujheko xa RSP lai unharu bata|||Mah RSP ko supporter ho ra ahile samma ta maile kunai cyber senas related to RSP dekhya xna even in Facebook, Facebook.

Hence you proved yourself wrong.|||RSP is the best option right now imo, but sadly, it's following the same trajectory as old parties focusing on a single \"deuta\" figure.   Instead, they should focus on their big strengths like their 5 core agendas and superb team, but they keep on dragging back to rabi and his shenanigans. (I understand his influence on the general public as he has greater reach but could result dangerous if we trust him blindly).  I really hope RSP does not become another kaan chedeko jogi. Hope they learn from what happened to AAP in India.|||RSP ko voting sign cha? RSP ko party office cha? Cha ni - sabai party ko hunu parcha. So RSP ko cyber cell pani cha - sabai party ko cha.

While they may be *better* than others, the main point is that they can't survive against other parties' well-established forces if they don't have one of their own.  They simply can't sustain themselves against the cyber operations of the established parties.  Let me share an incident with you all. I'm friends with a current or former RSP Member of Parliament (*samsad*), and he literally invited me to like a specific Facebook page‚ÄîI think he did it by mistake. I checked out that page, and what I found was a newly created, fresh page named **\"Gen Z Sunsari.\"** That page is now continuously promoting Ravi Lamichhane and his colleagues.  Let me be clear: I support the RSP, and I think it's a **good thing** that they have a cyber sena. If they don't, they're cooked for sure. Oli, Deuba, and Prachanda all have massive cyber armies and huge amounts of money to distribute, often hidden away in the homes of various party workers (*karyakarta*).  The RSP needs to fight fire with fire to survive and thrive.But I think Facebook and tiktok is better place to let your sena attack then here|||RSP kids don't understand its about ideology not about a coward populist leader|||Not only them.

            "body": "**Namaste everyone,**  I'm 16, from Rautahat - yes, that district everyone jokes about for illiteracy and underdevelopment. I'm Madhesi, Muslim by birth (though I don't really practice - I'm more rationalist/agnostic), and I have what might sound like a crazy dream: **I want to be Nepal's Prime Minister.**  Before you laugh or close this tab, hear me out.    # Who Am I?  I'm just a kid who refuses to give up on Nepal. My family, relatives, even I myself until a year ago thought: \"This country is for losers. Just study abroad, get PR, and forget this place.\" But my heart couldn't accept it.  I was born in the most backward part of Nepal. Hill elites don't see us Madhesis as \"real Nepalis.\" Muslims are less than 5% of the population. I'm probably the most \"un-prime-ministerable\" person you can imagine. But I don't care about that anymore.  I'm tired of seeing Nepal stuck while our neighbors move forward. I'm tired of corruption eating our future. I'm tired of smart Nepali youth feeling like they have to leave to have a good life.  **I want to be the Lee Kuan Yew of Nepal. The Deng Xiaoping of Nepal. The Barack Obama of Nepal.**  And I'm not just dreaming - I'm preparing. I'm going to study development economics (bachelor's and master's). I'm going to learn from every country that went from poor to rich. And one day, I'm going to lead Nepal to become a developed nation. The Gen Z revolution gave me hope.    # My Vision: Nepal 2065  **Simple question: Can Nepal become a developed, prosperous nation in 40 years?**  **My answer: YES. Absolutely yes.**  Here's my plan - **8 Pillars of Development**. I'll keep it short because this is already getting long:    # PILLAR 1: EDUCATION - Make Every Nepali Skilled  **The Problem:**  * Government schools are so bad that even poor families sacrifice everything for private schools * Teachers are underpaid and unmotivated * Rote learning, no critical thinking * English weak (we can't compete globally)  **My Solution:**  * **Pay teachers like professionals** (NPR 60,000-150,000/month based on experience) * **Make teaching prestigious** \\- only top 20% of graduates can become teachers * **English-medium education** (but keep strong Nepali language and culture classes) * **World-class facilities** \\- labs, computers, sports, arts in EVERY school * **Free quality education** K-12, so 90-95% of kids go to government schools (not private) * **Schools open 12-14 hours/day** \\- free homework help, clubs, sports after regular classes * **AI-powered personalized learning** \\- every student learns at their own pace  **Timeline:** 10 years to transform 50% of schools, 20 years for all schools world-class  **Cost:** \\~$300-400 billion over 30 years (sounds huge but totally doable with growing economy)  **Result:** By 2050, every Nepali kid gets education as good as Singapore or Finland. We become the most educated country in South Asia.    # PILLAR 2: INFRASTRUCTURE - Connect Every Part of Nepal  **The Problem:**  * Roads are terrible (takes 2 days to reach places that should be 8 hours) * Electricity cuts (though better now) * Rural areas isolated * Kathmandu traffic nightmare  **My Solution:**  **Roads:**  * Upgrade East-West Highway to 4-6 lane international standard * Build 10-15 North-South corridors (connect Terai to hills to mountains) * Every village connected with all-weather roads * **Investment:** $45-65 billion over 25 years  **Railways:**  * Terai railway connecting major cities (compatible with India) * Hill railways to Kathmandu, Pokhara (expensive but necessary) * **Investment:** $40-80 billion over 40 years * *(No bullet trains - too expensive for mountains, but modern 120-160 km/h trains? Yes!)*  **Electricity - Our BIGGEST Advantage:**  * Nepal can produce 40,000+ MW of hydropower * **Plan:** Build massive hydro projects, produce way more than we need * **Export to India, Bangladesh, Pakistan** \\- earn $20-30 billion/year * Cheap electricity attracts factories, industries * **Investment:** $40-65 billion * **Return:** $200-300 billion over time - **this pays for everything else!**  **Urban Transit:**  * Kathmandu Metro (4-6 lines) * Modern bus systems in all major cities * **End traffic hell**  **Internet:**  * High-speed fiber optic everywhere * 100 Mbps internet in every village by 2035 * Enable remote work, online businesses  **Total Infrastructure Investment:** $160-270 billion over 40 years    # PILLAR 3: ECONOMIC POLICY - Create Jobs and Wealth  **The Problem:**  * Too dependent on agriculture (60% of people, only 25% of economy) * Almost no manufacturing * Youth have no jobs * Everyone wants to go abroad  **My Solution:**  **Phase 1 (Years 1-10): Light Manufacturing**  * Textiles and garments (like Bangladesh) - **500,000-1 million jobs** * Food processing (tea, spices, dairy) - **200,000-300,000 jobs** * Construction materials - **150,000-250,000 jobs** * Target: $15-20 billion exports  **Phase 2 (Years 10-25): Heavy Industry**  * **Aluminum smelting** using cheap hydropower (like Iceland) - **huge export potential** * Steel production * Electronics assembly (like Vietnam) - **300,000-500,000 jobs** * Pharmaceuticals * Target: $50-80 billion exports  **Phase 3 (Years 25-40): High-Tech Economy**  * IT services (like India's BPO) - **500,000-1 million high-paying jobs** * AI and software development * Financial services hub * Advanced manufacturing * Target: $150-250 billion exports  **Special Economic Zones:**  * Create 8-12 SEZs with tax breaks, ready infrastructure * Attract foreign investment * Make it EASY to do business (start company in 1-2 days, not 6 months)  **Support Small Businesses:**  * Cheap loans (3-5% interest) * Business training and mentorship * Remove bureaucratic barriers  **Target:** By 2065, Nepal exports $500 billion - 1 trillion worth of goods and services    # PILLAR 4: GOVERNANCE - End Corruption, Make Government Work  **The Problem (We All Know This):**  * Massive corruption at every level * Nothing gets done without bribes * Politicians care about power, not people * Bureaucracy is nightmare  **My Solution - Learn from Singapore:**  **Zero Tolerance for Corruption:**  * Pay government officials WELL (so they don't need bribes)    * Ministers: $200K-300K/year    * Senior civil servants: $100K-150K/year * But **HARSH punishment** for corruption:    * Minimum 10 years jail    * Take all their stolen money + more    * Lifetime ban from public service    * Publicize their names (shame them) * **Independent anti-corruption commission** with real power * Fast-track corruption courts (decide cases in 6-12 months)  **Transparency:**  * Every rupee of government spending online, trackable * All government tenders open and transparent * Officials must declare assets publicly every year  **Meritocracy:**  * Hire best people, not party members or relatives * Tough exams for civil service (like IAS but tougher) * Promote based on performance, not seniority * Fire people who don't perform  **Digital Government:**  * 90% of government services online * Get licenses, permits in hours, not months * No need to visit offices and bribe officials  **This is CRITICAL - without this, everything else fails**    # PILLAR 5: HEALTHCARE - Healthy People, Productive Nation  **The Problem:**  * Government hospitals terrible * Healthcare expensive * Rural areas have almost nothing * People die from preventable diseases  **My Solution:**  **Three-Tier System:**  * **Health centers:** One per 5,000-10,000 people (basic care, vaccinations, maternal health) * **District hospitals:** 100-120 modern hospitals across Nepal (surgery, emergency, specialists) * **Major medical centers:** 8-12 world-class hospitals (advanced treatments, teaching, research)  **Universal Health Insurance:**  * Everyone covered from birth * Poor: 100% government paid * Middle class: Subsidized * Rich: Pay themselves * **No one goes bankrupt from medical bills**  **Train More Doctors:**  * Need 60,000-80,000 doctors by 2040 (currently have \\~30,000) * Expand medical schools * Pay doctors well so they don't leave for abroad  **Use AI/Technology:**  * AI diagnosis in every health center (even villages get expert-level care) * Telemedicine (video call with specialists) * Electronic health records  **Investment:** $100-150 billion over 30 years  **Result:** Life expectancy goes from 70 to 83-85 years. Everyone gets world-class healthcare regardless of wealth.    # PILLAR 6: AGRICULTURE - Modernize and Prosper  **The Problem:**  * Farming is still medieval (manual labor, low productivity) * Farmers are poor despite working hard * Young people don't want to farm  **My Solution:**  **Modernize:**  * Tractors, harvesters, modern equipment (subsidized) * Irrigation everywhere (80-90% irrigated by 2040) * Hybrid seeds, proper fertilizers, training * Result: **Productivity increases 3-5x, farmers earn well**  **High-Value Crops:**  * Premium tea and coffee (marketed as \"Himalayan\") * Organic fruits and vegetables (off-season for India) * Spices (cardamom, ginger, turmeric) * Medicinal plants * Export to India, China, Europe, Gulf  **Only 10-15% in agriculture by 2065, but they're prosperous** (like US farmers - few but rich)  **Investment:** $17-27 billion over 30 years    # PILLAR 7: TOURISM - Our Natural Goldmine  **Current:** \\~1 million tourists, $2 billion revenue  **Potential:** 8-12 million tourists, $35-50 billion revenue  **How:**  * Better airports (Kathmandu, Pokhara, Lumbini, plus new ones) * Good roads to tourist destinations * Range of hotels (budget to luxury) * Safety and cleanliness * Promote beyond trekking:    * Lumbini (Buddhist pilgrimage - huge potential)    * Cultural heritage    * Adventure sports    * Wellness/yoga retreats    * MICE (conferences, business events)  **Marketing:** Spend $200-500 million/year promoting Nepal (like Thailand does)  **Investment:** $13-26 billion over 30 years  **Result:** Tourism becomes massive foreign exchange earner, creates 2-2.5 million jobs    # PILLAR 8: SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT - Inclusive, Equal Society  **The Problem:**  * Inequality (rich-poor gap, regional disparities) * Discrimination (against Madhesis, Dalits, women, minorities) * Brain drain (educated youth leaving) * Social tension  **My Solution:**  **Equal Opportunity:**  * Education and healthcare free for all (no advantage from wealth) * Merit-based system everywhere * Special programs for historically disadvantaged groups (temporary) * All regions developed (not just Kathmandu)  **Gender Equality:**  * Equal pay enforced * Maternity leave (6-12 months paid) * Universal childcare (so women can work) * Safety and protection laws enforced  **Pension and Social Security:**  * Everyone 65+ gets pension ($100-150/month minimum) * Unemployment insurance * Disability support  **Stop Brain Drain:**  * Create opportunities at home (good jobs, good life) * Pay competitively (can't match US but reasonable) * Make Nepal attractive to live in * Engage diaspora (bring back their expertise and money)  **National Identity:**  * Nepali identity that includes everyone (Madhesi, Pahadi, Dalit, Janajati - all equally Nepali) * Respect diversity but build common purpose * Federal system works (provinces have power)    # THE BIG PICTURE: Nepal 2065  **If we do all this:**  **Economy:**  * GDP: $3-4 Trillion (from $40 billion today) * Per capita: $75,000-100,000 (from $1,350 today) * **Rich, developed nation - on par with South Korea, Poland**  **Quality of Life:**  * Life expectancy: 83-85 years * Everyone educated to university level * Everyone has comfortable home, good job, healthcare * Clean environment, modern cities, connected villages * Low crime, stable democracy, respected globally  **Global Standing:**  * Top 20-25 economy in the world * Regional leader (South Asia's success story) * Respected for renewable energy, education, sustainable development  **Most importantly:** Every Nepali child has opportunity to reach their potential. No more \"I have to leave Nepal to succeed.\"    # THE CATCH: Population & Technology Challenges  **Warning from Japan/South Korea:** When countries develop, birth rates collapse. Korea now has 0.72 children per woman - population will halve! Aging society, economic stagnation.  **Nepal must avoid this:**  * Support families (generous parental leave, free childcare, child allowances) * Make having kids compatible with career (especially for women) * Keep fertility at 2.0-2.1 (stable population, not shrinking) * Use AI/technology to maintain productivity even with older population  **Technology opportunities:**  * **AI in education:** Every student has personal AI tutor (learn at own pace, reach remote villages) * **AI in healthcare:** Expert diagnosis in every village health post * **AI in agriculture:** 3x productivity with precision farming * **AI in government:** Automated services, no corruption opportunities * Nepal can LEAPFROG - skip old technology, go straight to cutting-edge    # THE COST & FUNDING  **Total investment needed:** $870 billion - 1.35 trillion over 40 years  **Sounds impossible? It's not. Here's how:**  * **Government budget:** 40% (from growing tax base as economy grows) * **Private investment:** 30% (domestic and foreign) * **International loans:** 20% (World Bank, ADB - cheap long-term loans) * **Hydropower revenue:** Pays for itself + generates surplus ($20-30B/year exports)  **The math works. South Korea, Singapore, China did similar investments. Nepal can too.**    # THE REAL QUESTION  **Can Nepal really do this?**  **Historically, YES:**  * South Korea: $100 per person (1960) ‚Üí $35,000+ (2020) in 60 years * Singapore: Poor city-state (1965) ‚Üí $65,000+ per person (2020) in 55 years * China: $200 per person (1980) ‚Üí $12,000+ (2020) in 40 years * Estonia: Soviet legacy (1991) ‚Üí $28,000+ (2020) in 29 years  **What they had in common:**  * Long-term vision * Investment in education * Good governance (low corruption) * Strategic economic policy * Sustained effort over decades  **Nepal has everything needed:**  * Natural resources (hydropower, tourism) * Strategic location (between India and China) * Young population (demographic advantage NOW) * Democracy (legitimate government) * Can learn from others' successes and mistakes * Technology available to leapfrog  **What's missing? Political will and execution.**    # MY COMMITMENT  I'm 16 now. I'll be 26 in 2034. I'll be 46 in 2054. I'll be 56 in 2065.  **My plan:**  1. **2025-2029:** Complete high school, go to best university for development economics 2. **2029-2035:** Bachelor's and Master's in Development Economics, study successful transformations 3. **2035-2045:** Work in development (World Bank, ADB, or Nepal Planning Commission) - gain experience 4. **2045:** Enter politics seriously (I'll be 35-36, eligible for PM) 5. **2045-2065:** Lead Nepal's transformation (ideally as PM, or in other leadership roles)  **I'm not just dreaming. I'm preparing.**  And here's the thing - **I don't need to be PM to start this**. This vision needs thousands of committed people - in government, business, education, civil society. If you believe in this vision, YOU can contribute too.    # THE FINAL QUESTION (The One That Matters)  **Would you accept a Madhesi Muslim as your Prime Minister?**  I'm not asking you to vote for me now - I'm 16, that would be weird.  I'm asking: **If someone from Rautahat, someone Madhesi, someone from a Muslim family (even though I'm not religious), came to you in 20-30 years with this vision, this plan, this commitment - would you give them a chance?**  Or would you say: \"No, PM must be Bahun/Chhetri from Kathmandu hills\"?  Because honestly, that's what I'm most afraid of. Not that the plan is hard (it is, but doable). Not that it costs too much (it's affordable). Not that Nepal can't do it (we absolutely can).  **I'm afraid that Nepal will reject good leadership because of caste, ethnicity, religion.**  I want to believe we're better than that. Gen Z is showing we can be better than that.  So tell me honestly:  **Would you accept a PM who is:**  * Madhesi (from Terai, not hills) * Muslim by birth (though rationalist/agnostic in belief) * From Rautahat (most backward district) * But has the vision, knowledge, and commitment to make Nepal developed?  **Or would you prefer:**  * Traditional hill elite * \"Right\" caste and religion * From \"right\" family * But continuing same old politics that kept us poor for 70 years?    # Why I'm Posting This  I know I sound crazy. I know I'm just a kid. I know the odds are against me.  But someone has to say this. Someone has to have the audacity to dream that Nepal can be great. Someone from Rautahat, someone Madhesi, someone Muslim has to stand up and say: **\"I refuse to accept that we're destined to be poor. I refuse to accept that I have to leave Nepal to succeed. I refuse to accept that my identity disqualifies me from serving my nation.\"**  If you think this vision is stupid, tell me why (genuinely - I want to learn).  If you think it's impossible, show me what I'm missing.  If you think someone like me can never be PM because of where I'm from, at least be honest about it.  But if you think - even a little bit - that this could work, that Nepal deserves better, that maybe, just maybe, we should judge leaders by their vision and ability rather than their last name and birthplace...  **Then let's start a conversation.**  Because real change doesn't start in Singha Durbar. It starts in conversations like this.    **‡§ß‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§¶ for reading this essay. I know it's long. But Nepal's future is worth a long post.**  **Would you accept a Madhesi Muslim PM? Would you accept THIS vision for Nepal?**  **Let's discuss. ‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§ï‡§®‡•ç ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä (Truth and righteousness) - that's what Nepal needs, regardless of who brings it.**    *P.S. - To those who'll say \"just another kid dreaming, will forget in 2 years\": Maybe. But every leader who transformed their nation started by dreaming when young. Lee Kuan Yew was 35 when he became PM. Obama was community organizer in his 20s. Balen was just engineer before he became mayor. You have to dream before you can build.*  *P.P.S. - Yes, I know $3-4 trillion sounds insane when we're at $40 billion now. But Korea went from $4 billion to $1.6 trillion (400x) in 60 years. Nepal going from $40B to $3T (75x) in 40 years with modern technology? Actually conservative.*  *P.P.P.S. - If you're from Rautahat or Madhesi community or any minority - this post is especially for you. Don't let anyone tell you that you don't belong in Nepal's future. We belong just as much as anyone else. Maybe even more, because we know what it's like to be left behind.*      **What do you think?)**",

Sorry for that.|||- A Muslim prime minister is a big nono for small nation like ours.  - Since 80% of wealthy Islamic nations have some form of Sharia law implemented, they should first become completely secular, declare themselves non-Islamic countries, and elect a Hindu, Jew, or Christian prime minister.

            "body": "Hello guys, I travel alot and here are some tips i collected from my experience to get cheap flights and save cost in travel.   1. Don‚Äôt book to KTM, book round trip to and from Delhi and do self transfer(meaning get separate ticket to delhi to ktm). Usually it unlocks more number of airlines and likely to get a cheaper deal.   Same applies to cheap destinations like Thailand. You can get an e visa easily and then do self transfer there as well. It costs $35 dollars for e-visa but you will get better deals in flights. Also thai air asia launched flights to BWA as well, so people going to western nepal, this could be better option.  this wont show in google flights cause it requires visa but its very easy to get.   recently i had booked usa - bangkok - usa (two way) and then bangkok - nepal - bangkok(two way) making usa-nepal round trip under $700. including two single entry visa $70.  2. Websites like skiplagged or sky scanner shows you the most optimal flights based on prices and duration, but remember to not book it from there. only use them to see prices. Use the official website to book.    3. never search up flights in official websites unless you are going to book cause the moment you will close the tab, they will price hike it. thats why use other third party or incognito google flights to do price search.   4. international students can get discount if you use student universe app (now called byo jet or sthm like that). you need to verify yourself as student tho. but remember that your credit card cashback will only be  1% if you use this. but if you had used official website, it could be upto 5%. so calculate this and only use student universe discount if it is cheaper than normal cashback.   5. if you dont have a travel credit card, apple cash (tap pay) (if you are iphone user) works with no foreign transaction fee anywhere in the world. it does not have cashback tho but you can use it to pay anything outside your country. works in nepal too, bhatbhateni, restaurants, daraz delivery, etc. exchange rate is realtime price.   6. domestic flights during festivals, when flights to and from ktm is expensive, you can try to do alternative airports as well.   example. this dashain, ktm to bhairahawa was 8500 but KTM to Pokhara was 4200, and Pokhara to Bhairahawa was 3200. total 1100 cheaper. I did this and chilled in pokhara with my friends for 2 hours (layover lol). (this is subjective and prices are subject to change. just giving you idea to look for options cause there are flights from pokhara to/from bhairahawa, bharatpur and nepalgunj).",

Also skyscanner has an option to use flexible date or even select a month for departure and return and then you can select different dates to see which combination will have the cheapest option.   Also to add what OP as listed. When you transfer make sure to check your luggage options. For example - you bought 2 different tickets, and self transferring in Delhi. Make sure that the Delhi to KTM leg has the same luggage options. Your flight between the USA and Delhi will probably have 2x23 kg check in luggage and you used both. But usually the DEL-KTM leg will only have 20 kg or something like that. You will have to pay for rest or perhaps buy second baggage. Also you will have to collect your luggage , pass through immigration and then re check in. Make sure to have a good amount of time.   Also if your first leg gets delayed/canceled, you might miss your second leg and airline is not responsible so it's important to give yourself time.   This is a good option if you travel light or alone. What OP has suggested is a good travel hack.   For skiplag, most of the time you need to travel with carry on only since you are likely to skip the second leg.|||Indian Airport ma Nepali ko lagi NOC haru chaine testo kei ta hudaina ni?

They mentioned that there has been an alarming rise in Muslim occupants in the Terai region. Majorly mosque in these areas have been filled with these people who were never seen earlier. I don‚Äôt want to discuss about the hypothesis on how they came and where they are from (I see that someone has already mentioned that in the thread)   At this rate, we are sure to go through some sort of civil war that will be orchestrated in the name of religion. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a Muslim vs Hindu one, or an X religion vs Y religion.   As seen from the recent protest, these religious riots will likely be ignited by some external means, and then the citizens will be left astray to suffer.   In short, we are doomed in the future.

Even if lion is carnivorous, it drinks milk in its young version.  Likewise, many xyz behave as if they are normal when they are small in numbers. But, when they become big in number, they start making troubles. History and other part of world suggest that xyz in majority have always tried and most have became successful in implementing their own religious law. So Yes, in last 10 years, you might have seen so many conflict between different religions and probably it is because of Modi empowerment in India. But then, what is wrong that he had done? while a particular religion cannot celebrate their festival without thinking that there might be communal violence from other side, other religion peacefully celebrate their festival, knowing nobody is going to harm their festival?|||It‚Äôs mainly because of some newly naturalized Nepalis from India who hold radical Hindu views and try to provoke conflict between Hindus and Muslims, and sometimes against Christians.

Never heard of such clashes before. But seeing the islamification of Europe and basically everywhere even in india things are really serious. Recently funding from Turkey and Qatar for spreading this religion in Nepal was caught by Nepal police. They were turning orphan kids from some organisation and trying to convert them. Foreign funding, infiltration of Muslims from Bangladesh and pakistan and opening of madrasas all along the nepal india border etc is causing these problem. Nepal needs to throw these illegal M immigrant out of our country. European Union funding for Christianity and Muslim countries funding for conversion should be raising alarm to nepal government.¬†|||Great infographic Good effort üëç But we don't need this right now",

Because platforms like PayPal, Stripe, and others are not supported, thousands of freelancers, students, and digital creators are struggling to receive their payments from abroad. Many talented individuals are even losing jobs and opportunities simply because there‚Äôs no reliable way to get paid for their work.  This issue directly impacts Nepal‚Äôs growing digital workforce and limits the country‚Äôs potential in the global freelancing market. I kindly request you to post about this problem and urge the Finance Minister and related authorities to take action.  Your platform has a powerful voice, and raising this concern could help push for real change.  Thank you for your time and for always being the voice of the people.  Warm regards, [Your Name",

My previous colleagues vouched for me, and everything felt right.  Then came the reality check.  They couldn't figure out how to send payments to Nepal. Something about international payment systems, tax handling, and complications I honestly didn't fully understand. The conversation ended there.  I'm 18 and actively looking for frontend roles. I've got the skills and the drive, but I'm clearly missing something important about how remote work actually works from Nepal.  Here's what I'm trying to figure out:  How do you handle international payments when companies can't use standard methods? What platforms or workarounds do Nepali developers use? Are there specific things I should know about taxes and compliance? Should I only target certain types of companies that can handle these complications?  If you're from Nepal and working remotely for international companies, I'd really appreciate hearing how you navigated this. What do you wish someone had told you when you were starting out?  I don't want to miss the next opportunity because of something I could have prepared for.  Open to connecting with anyone who's been through this or has advice to share.",

            "comments": "Payoneer and swift might work|||Use swift to transfer salary.|||Deel works fine for me|||Direct wire to a Nepali bank using the SWIFT code is the most reasonable, legal and scalable method available out there.  1. Reasonable: You are getting paid directly to your bank with a nominal transfer fee. 2. Legal: Bank will deduct 5% tax as per government rule 3. Scalable: This action is repeatable month-after-month regardless of amount.  If you're doing any third party systems, like Wise, you lose on three fronts:   A. Wise cuts a transfer commission   B. The amount needs to be converted to NPR before sending and costs money   C. Depositing in Nepali bank has another processing fee in rupees  So this is not a good way to receive salary every month. See how much money you're losing even before paying a single rupee in tax amount.  Some companies do have issues setting up complex arrangements for just one person. I say this because I am the only Nepali person there. Everyone, including Indians are cool with receiving salaries in crypto, Wise wallet or other forms that do not work in Nepal.  The finance team in Dublin, Ireland was extremely helpful and they corresponded directly to the folks at Nabil Bank here and got my salary account set up. I just had to do some signatures and IDs and that's all.

If they commission the salary on bank account then they should have no problem of wiring it straight to your bank account. They'd send you invoice and use that Invoice to show the bank in Nepal as proof of your income and you can setup that recurring payment as your employment payment and bank'll deduce 5% on each transaction from that party, hence your tax payment for Nepal government.  Ask or search for your Bank's SWIFT code and provide necessary documents, that should suffice for international payment afaik.  Edit : unconventional payment should involve third party transaction. Paypal & payoneer work but payoneer is very unreliable. If everything works, no problem but to resolve ANY problem with payoneer is a nightmare. Skrill (I haven't used it) could be an alternative. You could use someone trusted who's abroad to use their paypal. But due to multiple transaction, multiple person's involvement & its extra fees I won't recommend it.|||Ppl saying swift so easily, clients won‚Äôt easily do swift transfer it costs more than wise, remitly or whatever that payoneer is.|||Deel works fine.|||Use bank Bro!

There‚Äôs no login prompt at all, and I can‚Äôt change passwords, SSID, or any settings. It looks like Wordlink has installed their own custom firmware.  Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve tried so far: - Default logins like admin/admin, admin/1234, root/root ‚Äî none worked. - Hidden paths such as `/admin`, `/engineer.html`, `/userRpm/LoginRpm.htm` ‚Äî still no luck. - Factory reset with the reset button ‚Äî didn‚Äôt unlock anything. - Checked for Nokia firmware online ‚Äî found only G-2425G or G-1425G models, not G-0425G-B.

I'm currently juggling a small low-paying project alongside a few higher-paying student final-year projects from Australia (using MERN).  The thing is, I'm already feeling the **MERN saturation**. I'm finding it tough to land solid fresher jobs, so I know I need to learn something new on the side for better long-term security and income.  I've narrowed it down to two options, but I'm totally open to other suggestions:  1. **Solana (Web3/Blockchain):**    * I see huge buzz following **100xDevs** and **Superteam Nepal/India**. The money looks fantastic right now.    * **Goal:** Chase the high-paying, less-crowded early market. 2. **AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning):**    * This is obviously massive and seems like the safer, more secure bet for the next few decades.    * **Goal:** Maximum long-term job security and high income potential.  **The ultimate goal is money and security.** I'm leaning towards Solana because of the immediate high pay I see, but AI/ML feels more stable.  **Which path makes more sense for a developer who is self-learning and needs to be market-ready ASAP? Any other tech stacks I should be looking at?**   **also I hear a lot about rust and golang buzz also tell me about that also learning is not an issue to me I can learn things quick like I have been a good learner and good student as well so.. also like or should I go in Devops ,Nuxt and things like that a lot of buzz very very confused every other post in X and every other yotube video keeps on confusing me**",

What do they mean?   22 seeders mean there are 22 people who have the complete torrent downloaded to their machines, and are sharing it.  144 leechers mean people who have partial torrent but not the complete torrent.  If you are downloading a torrent, you first become a leecher. If you download the complete torrent, and keep it active in your torrent client, then you become a seeder. If you only download partial torrent but keep sharing (seeding) what you have downloaded, then you will still be reported just as a leecher.   > Don't the people (servers) need to communicate to each other to send me the files for download, where does it take place? Doesn't it needs some sorts of coordination server?  There are torrent trackers, such as The Pirate Bay. Trackers normally don't host any content themselves, they will just have a listing of the content, and the tracker will track the seeders and leechers. So when you download a torrent file (or use a magnet link), the torrent file will have information on what content the torrent should have (the actual torrent content will be with seeders/leechers) as well as information on seeders/leechers.  > And if there is one, can't people who don't want their stuff illegally downloaded track those coordination servers?  It's not so easy. It's fairly easy to start your own torrent tracker. If you take out one torrent tracker, then many more would pop up to take its place. And the seeders/leechers would continue to have access to the files, they could just switch to another tracker.   There are also countries with cheap internet access and loose copyright laws who won't cooperate with US/EU, so many trackers are hosted on those countries.  > Also can I become seeder too if I want to put out something on pirate bay myself with my 16 GB RAM laoptop?   You don't need to upload to become a seeder, you just need a completed version of the torrent active on your torrent client.  You can upload torrents on various trackers, or even have your own tracker. There are many legitimate uses of torrents such as hosting Linux ISOs.  > And what do people who provide their own computing resources get for their efforts? Why do they do it?   It doesn't really take much computing resources other than disk space and bandwidth (CPU and RAM usage will be low on a decent torrent client).  Torrenting does require generous people who have the spirit of sharing. Without this, torrenting won't work.  There are also private torrent trackers which have seeding and ratio rules (you may need to seed each torrents for at least a minimum amount of time set by the tracker and/or maintain a good upload to download ratio, and there are generally incentives for seeding long term). Here you will have to follow the rules of seeding if you want to download. What this means is the files will be better seeded in private trackers, and the quality of files will be higher too.|||**Basically, if you've already downloaded the file or parts of the file, and have enabled seeding, other downloaders can request chunks of the file, and it will be sent from your computer to their computer. Hence termed peer-to-peer.**  **If you've enabled seeding, you're a seeder.**  **If you're just downloading without enabling seeding, you're a leecher.**  **There are communities dedicated to keeping popular torrents active for years, with server farms that keep seeding thousands of torrents 24/7. And some torrent creators seed it themselves with gigabytes per second speeds. Spreading the file throughout the network.**  Torrent files or magnet links just tell your client where to look; trackers(hosted somewhere) or DHT help it find other peers sharing that file. Trackers or DHT don‚Äôt host the actual file, just a list of connected peers and info about which chunks they have.  Once connected, it grabs tiny chunks from many at once and shares what it‚Äôs got back, pure decentralized magic.  See the graph highlighted in red?  https://preview.redd.it/kr31xb3u7xtf1.png?width=976&format=png&auto=webp&s=c84151228f898cc0e6eb3846e87737d6714745d0  The black lines are the chunks that you've already downloaded. As you can see, the chunks are requested in random order.  However, some applications like WebTorrent allow you to download the chunks in order, from beginning to end. Hence, it lets you stream the video without downloading the entire file. Possibly, [goku.sx](http://goku.sx) does this as well.  **That's why torrents are hard to counter.**  Because everyone who's downloaded the file can send it to the ones who request it.  **It's truly genius.**  And people usually **don‚Äôt get paid**. They seed because they want to **help others download faster** and keep torrents alive, like giving back to the community that helped them.  Some do it for **reputation on private trackers**, or just **because they enjoy being part of a swarm**.|||Peer to peer transfer ma seeder bhaneko jo sanga tyo file paila dekhi hunxa ani aru download garne harulai usle share garxa tyo ho   ani leecher bhaneko chai kati thaau ma tyo seeder harule share gareko file download garirako hunxan tiniharuko number ho.|||From my knowledge, Seeders are the providers who have the files installed on their system and they are distributing it in parts to the leechers that is you in this case.   And to be a seeder is not a heavy task, after finishing the download by taking bits one by one and arranging the file, the torrent itself starts to seed if the torrent client is open. I seed on my 4 gb ram laptop too. It's not done for profit, it's done cuz you wanna help others out cuz you also got helped by others. And use QBittorrent if not alr.|||Torrenting is just file sharing among people. The torrent file is not the movie,it is really like a map that shows where the pieces are located. Seeders have the full file and share it out. Leechers download but also share what they got. Your computer downloads small pieces from many people at the same time. It also shares the pieces you've already downloaded with others. No single server contains the file,trackers just help computers find one another. You may share your own files also by leaving your torrent running. People generally share to help others and keep torrents running. The more you share, the faster your downloads are.|||What it is: 1. p2p nai ho. 2. Decentralized vatekole files are divided into equal parts. Each part may be a small chunk of 2MB, 4MB, 8MB etc depending on configuration. 3. Example: 64MB filr would have 16 parts each of 4MB or, 8 parts each 8MB. 4. SEEDER = who hosts parts (seeds)source 5. LEECHER is who downloadeds(leeches) from source 6. For this to work, SEED (Part of File) must exist with ATLEAST one Seeder.  Gow it works: 1. When you do a torrent download, you are initially a Leecher Only. For all parts. 2. As soon as you download ANY part, you become a Seeder for that part. 3. Meaning, you are now a source for that part for someone on the network  4. If more people have the part that you want, and if they are nearby, your download of that part will be significantly faster. 5. If a single Seeder is serving some particular PART, the download of that part (Leeching) will be painfully slow. 6. Thankfully, many Leechers for that PART means someone downloading closest to that Seeder will complete the download faster, and they in-turn will become Seeder for that part. So, -1 Leecher +1 Seeder happens. This makes your download faster. You can download each part from 1 peer by default, but you also have the option to choose multiple peers for a PART. 7. If you leave the file as-is after the complete download. That file will continue being seeded. You will act as a peer with all parts. Essentially, making the download faster for everbody. 8. Downloads are not sequential by design, because UDN will grab whatever is available. But modern torrent clients have the option of concurrent download. You trade download speed with serial download of parts. Useful for things like streaming video (You can play video on VLC as it is downloading, that way!)|||Simply understand like,  seeders - those who have complete files  leechers - those who have incomplete files  In this case the new downloader also becomes leechers as it has incomplete files.   In Torrent the client who is downloading is also uploading at the same time to others that doesn't have incomplete files. Only when the file is completely downloaded the client becomes a seeder.   There is no server here. All leechers act on its own who wants which chunk of missing file and completes it from the easiest seeder or peecher.  Count that the more the seeder the better the download as multiple chunks of files can be taken from multiple seeders which may find the easiest.  For a file to be downloaded completely there needs to be atleast one seeder and none or any no. of leechers.  More the leechers means multiple clients has incomplete files. In this case each leechers acts selfish grasping incomplete file of its own from any leechers or seeders with the shortest or easiest available route or port.   Note that when there is only single seeder then leechers downloads from any other leachers which file is available but since the complete file is only one so the missing piece is only completed through that single seeder. As soon as the leecher completes its file it instantly becomes seeder.  Also there is role of port which can make complex for time being.|||lots of questions but i will try to answer them one by one!  Seeders are those who have the complete file. leachers are those who are still downloading the file and have parts of it.  Most  .torrent has a tracker url. its doesnot host the file but keeps the ip addresses of the people who have the file i.e seeder and leechers. when you start downloading you client qbittorrent ask for the file and the trackers replies with the ip addresses of the people who have it. and then you client directly connects you to the seeder (no server in between).  Yes ‚Äî trackers are public, and law enforcement or copyright agencies can (and do) monitor them. and join in the swarm and look for seeder or people who are downloading. That‚Äôs how copyright notices often originate by logging IPs seen sharing a particular movie or software.   you are saring the file as you are downloading(leacher). Once the download is complete you client automatically starts seeding it as long as you are kepping the application open, and everytime you open the application. in the case of seeding it does not take much bandwidth.  torrenting is bandwidth, I/O heavy not ram or cpu, You are not hosting the file Like a server you are just sharing it.  For the love of the game. if nobody shares it the torrent dies. most client forces their users to seed or do it on auto . some do it for the freedom. and sharing is caring.  No significant computing power is needed torrenting mostly uses bandwidth and disk I/O, not CPU or RAM.  Torrenting itself is completely legal  it‚Äôs just a peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol. What can be illegal is *what* you download or share. Distributing copyrighted material (like commercial movies, games, or software) without permission can violate copyright laws in many countries. In practice, enforcement often focuses on large uploaders or tracker sites rather than individual users. so you are safe.|||Basically, you are looking for a packet of parle G. Say, 10 people on this thread have a packet of parle G each. So we agree to share you a copy of our individual biscuit each. Some will give you 2 piece, some will give 5 etc untill you complete an entire packet worth of biscuits. Sharing a copy of your file is Seeding.  Getting said file from other sharing the same file is leeching.  Now, you asked for a friend to help you look for said parle g is the torrent file/sites  After you get your copy of file, just let it be on the torrent. Others who'd want it will then get connected to you and you will share a copy of your file with them.  Torrenting itself is not illegal, sharing copyrighted files is. (But who cares, most of us can't afford any useful softwares legally anyway :D)|||Just set your torrent client to run at startup & keep it running in the background to seed.

They were involved in big scandals and there was a huge outburst in tech community regarding the company, the front face community and its founders.   Last time I checked their HR and operation team was full of low-paid interns being exploited.",

Actually you don't even need to ask this question, every human has a purpose: to keep living on‚Äîeither survive with eternal lifespan or reproduction. Aba purpose tw thaha bhae halyo, what should you do? Live in the best way your current self can understand and afford. See you got the purpose(to live) and for being more specific you also got a goal(make the best out of the your life).  It sounds like we are back to starting point as you're kind of asking how to live. You don't need to know more either, people are just bored so they just keep adding complexities to pass their time. Purpose of human life is simple, just live.  Arko bhayo job ko kura. For getting a job you need: skills to do the job, way to let people know that you have these skills and they can trust you with that job, and reason for them to choose you over others(it could be your skills, your popularity, your relationship with them, etc).  But what if my efforts of learning all these skills are wasted? If you're really skilled, any outdated tech skills will still get you job in right places. That aside, if you're not really passionate about something beforehand, then sikney bhanera kasari choose garney? Let's understand this with holi tshirt and casual tshirt analogy. You cannot start producing holi tshirt off-season 'cause you saw good sales of holi tshirt in holi season. But if you know there will be demand of holi tshirt, then it might be good idea to start producing holi tshirt before holi season. Also, if you can know there is a demand of holi tshirt during holi season, you should only print them if you can produce and make them reach customer on time. Otherwise, it's better to focus on casual tshirt production.  Aru tw problem timi lai chear nai xa, and you also know what to do about them. For assistance, you can take help of professional therapists that help with these problems.|||I get this thought alot. Mailay chai mero experience ma k jannay vanda..to provide for your family also can be your purpose, to take them places where they never been dream of can also be your purpose of lie. Purpose jarure xaena thulai huna parxa. It can be as simple as to let people know you exist in this world. This is my thougt and learning when it comes to purpose of lifeüôÇ",

The situation remains uncertain. Several media outlets have only reported that his name is missing from the list of 20 hostages confirmed to be alive, yet some are hastily jumping to conclusions without verified information. Such speculation is irresponsible, especially when the facts are still unclear. These pages are so immaturely jumping to conclusions in a state where things are uncertain.|||Bipin looked fine in that released video dated November 2023. It means that either Bipin died during the strikes or Hamas' foul play. Our foreign policy is also to be blamed. How could they detain Nepalese who had no association with Israel?

Eleven of our sons, including Bipin Joshi, who arrived in Israel just 25 days before Hamas‚Äôs October 7, 2023, bloodbath, were brutally murdered. Four days ago, 48 hostages clung to life; now, only 20 survive. Hamas‚Äôs ‚Äújustified‚Äù slaughter, draped in twisted dogma, mocks humanity. Two years of torment, dangling hope of Bipin‚Äôs survival, only to end in his cold-blooded killing by these bloody cowards. At home, Gen Z‚Äôs September ‚Äúuprising‚Äù killed 51, including kids, burning Kathmandu, freeing 12,500 criminals to prop up corrupt elites‚Äô spoiled brats. Our nation‚Äôs credibility is trashed, a global joke. Hamas and their ilk, like Jamkash, happily point fingers at Jews and Hindus for every woe, but when it‚Äôs time to face their own kind, they scatter like roaches, spineless. Yet we let their hate-preaching ideology fester in our hills, unchecked. No more. Deport their firebrand clerics, cut off their dirty foreign cash. We must back our own against Hamas, demand international recognition to flex Nepal‚Äôs strength, resilience, and power. This must never happen again.

Four days ago, 48 hostages clung to life; now, only 20 survive. Hamas‚Äôs ‚Äújustified‚Äù slaughter, draped in twisted dogma, mocks humanity.

What do you have to tell about this ? Love is never impure and childhood love NEVERR.. it is just that society hates people who truly love. Because society wants control and love has that power to go beyond any boundaries. Thus they break hearts who truly belonged to each other. Neither caste nor religion can confine love or any close relation despite your (immediate family members like siblings,  uncles, aunts or 1st cousins (in most of the cultures) and marriage is not always about producing child but core is to find a suitable partner with whom you desire spend your whole life with. If sex and children were only the reason to get married then homosexual relationships or marriages should never happen right!? society had always tried to confine and condition love whereas love is usually spontaneous and unconditional and can happen with anyone . But Choice is always yours . So choose your path carefully:-   If you have more of an endurance capability--> choose your cultural values and societal rules and protect your external peace over internal harmony where you must face pain when you have to suppress your emotions and live in silent suffering. GOD SHREERAM'S PATH   OR   if you have more of a courage--> choose your love and internal peace over external conflict you must have to face for violating societal or cultural rules called taboo. GOD SHREEKRISHNA'S PATH.   See, nothing is superior,  love or duty. Both are sacred and you should choose  one thing and overcome your indecisiveness .. either duty or love , you must choose as per your soul's capability i.e  either sacrificing your love in exchange of external peace. (Endurance) ( go with this route,  if you believe or think you can supress your emotions for the rest of your life and can digest silent suffering)   Or,  Embracing love you desire at the cost of your external peace. ( if you don't care what society thinks and are courageous enough ,go with this route )   Both paths involves hurdles and suffering either internal or external.  Choice is yours that which can you digest. God is there and he'll obviously help you in your journey.|||bro went from saiya to vaiya real quick|||Are you Kumai Bahun?

I know current governement wont investigate genz \"leaders\" but next gov should launch serious investigations on these people as well. Though one might argue at there is difference between violence caused by those in power and those fighting against people in power but even then accountability doesnt just vanishes, this is the reason ghost of 17k still looms over prachanda, prachanda was also fighting for \"people\" but he is still accused of being a mass murderer, gyanendra shah is as much of a murderer as is prachanda. But this point isnt brought up as much, when discussing the civil war. There is also a lot of opportunism, people who werent part of protest have started claiming its leadership, next gov should also launch serious investigation in these regard to punish those who are trying to destablise nepal in name of various agendas.

Because there was no one to guide me, i failed this year's neb board.   so from someone who learned from his own experience, my best advice is that you don't depend only on teachers from your school. there are tons of videos on youtube and tons of notes and  straight up answers in the internet.   if you do not understand and get anything at all, then only focus on the questions that are asked many times or repeated i.e only imp questions.   you have to make sure that you atleast passing marks, so look focus on the chapters you understand and master them first then only focus on others.   You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

Even after taking reexam on both, i don't think i will pass. because of me failing on my exams, my mother and entire relatives blame me that i didn't try hard enough, didn't study and other similar things. my mother calls me a faliure, that i destroyed her dreams and i brought her nothing but pain etc etc.       i tried , i tried to focus on class, watched youtube, searched notes, asked the topper friends what they did at home and studied. heck, because of that tension and stress my hair started falling out, at age 17.    i was not even a bad student before. i even got A on SEE.       when choosing what to study, my friends choose management, but following the WISHES of my family and relatives, i choose science. after a week, i told her that i find science hard but she said just \"**The admission money is already paid and is only half can be refunded**\" totaL was 20,000+ BOOKS. and i failed again and again and again.    and still to this day, she screams and brings up my results in every argument and uses me as a example infront of my sister everyday.  now, she has said \" **if you fail again, then go get a room away from home and do what you want or study again from class 11 in management from the start\".**  now, i don't want to get out of my house without proper source of income. i can do every single house work and can even cook nearly everything , no problem if i start living alone. but it will be problem with no money or limited money.  and i would rather die than study and take that tension for another two years again. my mind is already way too damaged from that.  so, if i fail is there a course that i can get in techical line or something. like i heard that there are courses (18 months - 3 years ) that one can complete and start working , even if only SEE passed.    so , if there is any course that exists, please tell me.",

The child will have access to education and almost everything another child can ask for. We have belief that the child carries spirit of Taleju Bhawani, which gives the child immense power. Again, in an age where we have lost our belief, I cannot prove it.  The kumaris I have visited emit strong aura (i may have been brainwashed to feel this).

A 3 year old child has no idea what she is getting into. She cannot grasp what a normal childhood is, what is right and what is wrong. The only thing she knows and does is based on her likes and dislikes, which is heavily depended upon how her parents/surrounding elders dictates.   Ani about 'No complains' from past Kumaris:   Newari culture is super sensitive. You cannot say anything against their culture. Otherwise, you'll have to face \"Tom n Jerry\" like people. I think, every ex Kumaris understands this at some point. With this much pressure along with the grooming done from a very young age, I don't think anyone dares to speak up. Which basically means none of us know what they really feel inside.    Well, of course, keeping in mind how they're thrown away once they reach a certain age or goes through ü©∏. At least, a life time opportunity to be a Kumari where they could renounce their position if they don't feel like it should be a way.   They don't preach, they don't teach, they only show up during jatras. I've never seen Kumaris actively participating in rituals or any sort of activities. Yestai ho vane, why not create a statue of a Kumari for the rest of our lives and stay quiet???|||Also it adds to the stereotype that period blood is impure|||Yeah the 1sttime ever I saw Kumari it was not aww like I hoped but pity to the \"Living Goddess\" she had the look of not a girl her age but of an \"ice princess\" in anime.

The only thing you should feel bad about is her parents who now have to be her full time care takers probably having to leave their jobs and careers and move into the kumari house with her.|||I used to extremely religious before and used to glorify ts But realising Kumari tradition is cruel was my first step towards atheism|||As a Newar, I understand the cultural side of it. But living in the US and having global exposure, I also see it as more of a pageant. If you‚Äôve seen Little Miss Sunshine, you‚Äôll get the context.||| The Living Goddess tradition of Nepal is a complex institution rooted in centuries of culture. While modern concerns about child rights are valid, the practice is governed by strict rituals and has evolved to address contemporary welfare standards. Here are the key facts:  1. The Selection is Meticulous and Considered an Honor:  ¬∑ A Kumari is chosen from the specific Shakya clan of the Newari community, a Buddhist goldsmith caste. ¬∑ The selection process is incredibly rigorous. Candidates must meet 32 strict physical perfection requirements (e.g., eye shape, voice quality, hair color) and demonstrate a fearless and serene demeanor (e.g., by not crying during a ceremony in a room of 108 ritually sacrificed animal heads). ¬∑ For the family and community, her selection is not a punishment but the highest spiritual honor.  2. The Role is Central to National Culture and Unity:  ¬∑ The Kumari is not just a religious figure but a national symbol. ¬∑ Her most important public duty is during the Indra Jatra festival, where she blesses the President of Nepal, providing divine legitimacy to the state in a ceremony that blends Hindu and Buddhist traditions. This is a key event for national identity.  3. Significant Reforms and Safeguards Have Been Implemented:  ¬∑ Education: By law, the Kumari now receives a formal education from private tutors within her residence. The government provides a monthly stipend specifically for this purpose. ¬∑ Family Presence: Contrary to isolation claims, her family (typically her mother) lives with her throughout her tenure. ¬∑ Financial Security: Upon retiring at puberty, the state grants her a lifetime pension. As of recent years, this is approximately NPR 10,000 per month (roughly $75 USD), along with a lump sum of NPR 1 million (roughly $7,500 USD) to support her transition. ¬∑ Successful Reintegration: Former Kumaris like Dr. Chanira Bajracharya, who served until 14, have publicly spoken about their positive experiences, pursued higher education, and built successful careers, demonstrating that life after the role is viable.  The Kumari tradition is a deeply embedded socio-religious institution. It is factually inaccurate to frame it simply as the \"isolation\" of a child. It is a state-sanctioned, culturally sacred role with defined rituals, significant community support, and legally mandated provisions for the girl's education, family life, and long-term financial security. The debate around it highlights the global tension between cultural preservation and evolving child rights, but the practice itself has demonstrably adapted to modern norms.|||I ain't newar but also I think aaba yesto kura chai parents haru le vhaneko ramro hami third party le vhannu vhanda pani . look if kumari ko parents le chahanu hudaina vhani tyo kumari ko candidate mai na leraunu parni ho . so parents lai kehi problem xaina , kumari le as a normal human being ni basna paunu hunxa after completion so I think we are no one to question sodhna lai|||What about the tradition of marrying off daughters into the inlaws house?|||After giving this some thought question is of a philosophical one.

Khaire ko documentary haru herera brainrot kura nagara na. Not everyone is privileged to become kumari and nor they are selected randomly. The family members themself have to fill the form and there's a long running selection process. Only a certain clan of newar can become Kumari. There are lots of inhuman and child abusive traditions going on all over. In case of kumari they get highest level of love and respect. They can live with their parents, they can play, they can watch TV, they can even play video games. It would be better if you watch podcasts of ex kumaris it's really helpful. I used to think same like everyone calling this inhuman before but they are living the normal life as you and me. And the fact that you can't speak up being kumari is totally false, yes you can't but only in jatras and other religious ceremonies, do you speak up during sharad and other pujas(it's prohibited to talk during sharad if you don't know).

Go visit terai Muslim villages girls at the age of 15 are getting married and at the age of 21 they are booned with 3 childs.

To those insisting Kumaris are always ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù or dismissing criticism by belittling others, few things we can reflect on:   1. How much do we actually know about child psychology and development, especially at such a young age when experiences shape a lifetime? 2. Yes, a Kumari is worshipped as a goddess now but when her time ends, how does a goddess step back into an ordinary life? How do peers treat her? How does she even make friends? 3. With isolation and the constant expectation to suppress emotions, what happens to her social, communication, and interpersonal skills? Who helps her navigate that later? 4. Does she ever get space to express her own feelings and thoughts or is silence part of the job description? 5. We‚Äôve all seen videos of new Kumari, some barely three years old, literally asleep in full dress during rituals. How on earth can a toddler be burdened with divine expectations when they can barely stay awake through it? 6. As Nepalis, many of us defend dal bhat tarkari because it‚Äôs what we grew up with it feels untouchable. (I know it‚Äôs not the same but for reference) For a Kumari, this role is all she has ever known. So how would she even recognise or articulate what she‚Äôs missed out on, when she never had the chance to experience it? 7. And let‚Äôs be honest do we really believe someone put on a pedestal that high, surrounded by cultural pressure, guilt, and shame, would openly talk about the negatives of being Kumari? Yes, things have changed there‚Äôs more education, some family contact,but none of that cancels out the developmental and human rights concerns we‚Äôre talking about.  And honestly, the comments here kind of prove the point: we were never really taught to think critically. Instead of having an actual discussion, people are throwing around ‚Äúbahun,‚Äù ‚ÄúChristian,‚Äù or ‚Äúother cultures‚Äù like that somehow answers the question.

Goodness flows through Kumari.  She is worshipped for being the medium of taleju bhawani. They are taught that they as an individual are not god, but the goodness that flows through her is what makes her worshipped.  And calling Kumari as a \"virgin goddess\" is stupid and a complete disregard of religious belief. It's a literal translation not a literary translation.   A lot of misconceptions have already been debunked.  Therefore they are able to integrate back into society well. They have good societal support . They are mentored, taught and are well taken care of. They themselves have immence respect for their religion and tradition.  If you think being a Kumari is wrong, you simply look at other practices in other religions. Nuns are not allowed to marry or consummate. Denying the right to marry and consummate can be considered as an oppressive practices denying one from their human desires. In radical Islam, burka, multiple marriages, denial of human rights for wemen.  While such petty comparisons are stupid themselves, what I want to say is we are worshipping female power. We are actually looking at females as devine. Not simply blind worship.   Nothing about today's childhood is normal.  You see young boys and girls sent off to boarding schools as normal? It's more isolating depressing. Parents just sticking their child to an iPad, or a hyperactive parent forcing their child through multiple activities (music class, sports, extra activities) even when their child may not want to to them, and pushing their child to extremes, putting their child through ridiculously high expectations, so that they can fulfill own ego( yes I've seen it happen).  A lot is not normal in so called modern normal childhood.   A lot of narratives and propogandas have infiltrated our thinking. Be water and explore into the culture.

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. üò≠üò≠2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye üò≠|||3 brsa vo dashign namanako|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

I emailed ambition guru saying they have a security issue and a security researcher replied my email too. His name‚Äôs MANIK KOIRALA. He asked me what the issue was and I explained the whole situation but I didnt give him the process of accessing the course for free. I demanded some fee as bug bounty and infact he even said they will report the bug and talk about the bounty and as I was familiar with ambition guru, I trusted them and told them the whole process and after few days I emailed him again asking if they fixed it or not and what about my bounty and all but they did not reply at all. THEY GHOSTED ME WTF  ANI CRAZY THING I JUST CHECKED IF THE BUGS STILL THERE GUESS WHAT THEY FIXED IT AND I DID NOT GET MY BOUNTY!!  If I had not reported this they would have to face a use loss as everyone could access any course for free!!!   What should I do guys I need my bounty any how I mean if it was a huge bug??

To this young innocent guy here , I too thought about reporting it and asking a bug bounty but I already knew I was not going to get any so I just opened my laptop and got an extension named M8UL downloader or something to download all those videos , ( why I downloaded an extension?? : cause institutions upload videos in small small chunks of file that play altogether to form a video , like you you download from other extension you will find files of 8sec 15sec more than 100 of such files will exist there and the extension I mentioned just compiles them all and let you download the full video ) .|||Hello u/Space_X_Offical, thank you for contributing to r/NepalPlusTwo.

You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

Anything you write remotely close against Maoist terrorist party or nice about 'Monarky', or say anything about the mod. Your post will be immediately banned. Something tells me this is done deliberately to not bring back 'Monarky' and promote anti religion and pro communistic sentiment among young minds by suppressing the Voice of the other/ Please be Mindful !!!! --- Hope this Post wont get banned after this update.  2nd Update- I just got warned by Reddit that my account might get banned. Like I suspected, There seems to be group of Maoist sympathizing insurgents in most of the nepalese subreddit with Communistic Ideologies who will get your post banned or Comment deleted by group reporting if it doesnt align with their thoughts and who will like their own comments to make it look like they are saying meaningful when they are not.",

He pushed Nepal towards democracy and republicanism.   He gave poor villagers and lower-caste groups a voice in national politics.   He increased women‚Äôs participation in politics and society, with many ex-fighters now active in leadership roles.   In western hills and Madhesh, state institutions were weak or absent. Villagers depended on landlords for loans, justice, and protection, which kept exploitation unchallenged (Kamaiya, Haruwa-Charuwa, Haliya systems). His movement gave villagers confidence to defy landlords for the first time.

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not ‚Äúrevolution,‚Äù it‚Äôs not ‚Äújustice,‚Äù and it sure as hell isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe voice of the people.‚Äù It‚Äôs mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn‚Äôt make you brave‚Äîit makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that‚Äîsurrounded by a wave of so-called ‚Äúyouths‚Äù who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let‚Äôs not sugarcoat it‚Äîthe so-called Gen Z ‚Äúwarriors‚Äù hiding in the mob weren‚Äôt heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country‚Äôs social fabric. He still can‚Äôt step foot in certain countries because he‚Äôs internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he‚Äôs propped up as a ‚Äúleader.‚Äù  Let‚Äôs be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn‚Äôt an accident‚Äîit was a setup. While Deuba‚Äôs family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don‚Äôt get it twisted‚Äîthose sharpshooters in the crowd weren‚Äôt just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres‚Äîformer insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let‚Äôs stop pretending this was ‚Äúthe people rising up.‚Äù It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist‚Äîthe one who drowned this nation in blood‚Äîwalks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don‚Äôt for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn‚Äôt that Deuba suffered humiliation‚Äîthe real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn‚Äôt a flower; he‚Äôs a weed choking the soil of Nepal‚Äôs democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too na√Øve to realize they‚Äôre being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||Prachanda and Baburam are India's puppet.

            "body": "The country is burning, and Shrinkhala uploaded a 34 minute PR reel. I just finished watching 11 minutes of the 34 long video Shrinkhala Khatiwada uploaded to ‚Äúexplain her silence‚Äù and I had to stop, not because I was bored, but because it was painful to watch someone so out of touch, so self-absorbed, and so deep into their own victim complex that they‚Äôve become completely blind to reality. I‚Äôm making this post and hoping people don‚Äôt fall for the carefully packaged sob story. First off is the immediate red flag that there is zero acknowledgment of her privilege. She talks about having a simple life, and claims her parents worked hard for her and her brother. That they had a house with 3 bedrooms, didn‚Äôt have to pay rent, had a good upbringing and she still thinks that counts as simple. And that‚Äôs the only privilege she‚Äôs ever had. That alone shows how detached she is from what ‚Äúaverage‚Äù really means in Nepal. She never even briefly reflects on the fact that her father is a powerful politician, and instead, she makes it sound like she built her life from scratch. It‚Äôs baffling.  She genuinely believes her name shouldn‚Äôt have been dragged into any of the national discourse and says that people were using her name just to get content and she literally says something along the lines of, if people got attention that way, ‚Äúso be it.‚Äù That‚Äôs her takeaway. The entire nation is in shambles, people are angry, protesting, waking up to decades of injustice and she still can't look beyond her own image. It's almost unbelievable how someone can watch a country crumble and somehow make it all about themselves. She positions herself as the one being targeted ‚Äúfor no reason‚Äù and says she wanted to fight back but was too overwhelmed by people turning against her. Again, not a word about why people might be justifiably critical, just a one-sided narrative of being attacked unfairly.  She says TikTok posts were changing the narrative of her entire life. But does she stop for a second to reflect on why people are questioning her? No. Instead, she keeps doubling down on this idea that she‚Äôs misunderstood, and that her critics are just trying to take her down for no reason. There is no realization that being the daughter of a well-known and allegedly corrupt politician is a reason why people hold you accountable especially when you‚Äôve benefitted from that influence. That‚Äôs not defamation. That‚Äôs public scrutiny. Then comes the part where she calls herself ‚Äúself-made.‚Äù And at that point, I had to pause and ask how? You‚Äôre born into a powerful and connected family. You have access to platforms, resources, and networks that most Nepalis can‚Äôt even dream of. And yet here you are, trying to claim some underdog story? She goes on to brag about her accomplishments, how she‚Äôs made so much money, and how people apparently can‚Äôt handle the fact that someone as young as her is so successful. As if that‚Äôs why people are questioning her. No, Shrinkhala, people aren‚Äôt criticizing you because you‚Äôre young and successful. They‚Äôre angry because you‚Äôre trying to rewrite your origin story while skipping over the very privileges that made your success possible.  She even says she never felt the need to justify herself to anyone before because ‚Äúsatya ko saath cha.‚Äù That‚Äôs when I realized how deep her delusion runs. She genuinely believes she‚Äôs standing on moral high ground, and yet her video is filled with nothing but self-praise, image management, and emotional manipulation. She talks about being ‚Äúsatya‚Äù while ignoring every contradiction, every unfulfilled promise, and every instance where she stayed silent when it mattered. Then she says if she doesn‚Äôt defend herself, then ‚Äúthe rest of the world will write her narrative.‚Äù Again, it‚Äôs about her. Not the truth, not justice, not accountability, not the people, but her narrative. The country is collapsing under the weight of corruption, and her priority is that her public image might be misunderstood. She even says her future generations will suffer if she doesn‚Äôt clear her image like that‚Äôs the greatest injustice here. Not the looted resources, not the betrayed citizens, but her family name. She thanks those who ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt unfollow her‚Äù and those who supported her privately. That‚Äôs her criteria for support which is social media metrics. Then she starts talking about her life story, narrates her autobiography, and once again, takes the opportunity to list her accomplishments and how she was a topper, won design competitions, etc. But does she ever stop to think about why she got those platforms? Does she reflect on how being a politician‚Äôs daughter might have given her access others don‚Äôt have? Of course not. Instead, she paints herself as someone with a ‚Äúsmall-town mindset‚Äù while talking about winning designer competitions. How many small-town Nepalis get to do that? There‚Äôs such a massive contradiction in her story, and she doesn‚Äôt even seem to see it.  She even says ‚Äúma maa nai kei kami thiyo hola‚Äù and tries to sound reflective, but it‚Äôs just another way to victimize herself. As if people criticizing her now are just reinforcing her lifelong feeling of being ‚Äúnot enough.‚Äù Then she addresses people who accuse her of not following through on the promises and ideals she expressed during Miss Nepal. And honestly, that criticism is completely valid. If you stood on a national stage making tall claims about development and change, then yes, people will hold you accountable. That‚Äôs not trolling. That‚Äôs responsibility. And finally, the most absurd part that she says she never had any power. How? You were Miss Nepal and are one of the most followed influencers in the country, daughter of a powerful political figure, a Harvard graduate. And you don‚Äôt have power? Then who does? If you truly believe you never had any power to make a difference, then what was the point of all the public positioning, speeches, and social impact projects? That‚Äôs not humility. That‚Äôs denial.  She tries to play down her travel experiences too. Says that before Miss Nepal, she had only been to India, and that‚Äôs ‚Äúnot an achievement,‚Äù and that her Hong Kong trip immediately after the pageant was the only international travel till then. Then she brings up her UK trip, saying it was funded by youth, and she didn‚Äôt really get to enjoy it because she was only there for work, so apparently, that doesn‚Äôt count as privilege either. Every step of the way, she undermines and downplays her privilege, refuses to acknowledge her advantages, and continues to position herself as a victim. And all of this? Is just the first 11 minutes. I honestly couldn‚Äôt keep watching. It became clear very quickly that this wasn‚Äôt a sincere explanation. It was a 34 minute long PR video just to clear her image, filled with narcissistic reflections, gaslighting, and image control disguised as vulnerability. I really hope people don‚Äôt fall for victimized narrative. Please don‚Äôt.",

The lack of self-reflection and the constant logical fallacies, positioning anyone who challenges her as lacking critical thinking, etc, is not lost on us.

Like cleaning garbage on the street or starting a free tuition for street children. We should make heroes of those ordinary people. We should also start questioning our perception of beauty. Why is Shrinkhala Khadka considered *anything*? Is she physically appealing or sexually affable or glamorous? Why should she have *any* followers, to begin with? Then we should start questioning the perception of our 'beauty standard'. Why should only fair skinned, better looking people get millions of followers. It's not going to be easy but we should always question. If we play the same pop culture game and dig deep into how propaganda and algo can be manipulated then we can perhaps start asking questions like the way you have did.   It's not easy because it's a biased platform where heritage money and incumbent power are in bed with the forces of propaganda (e.g. Insta algorithm). Its a hard battle to win.

There are way worse people than her in Nepal. In my view, arson who damaged the private and public properties are way worse than her and legally criminals. Similarly, there are better faces of nepo babies - the OG nepo baby, the ex-king.  I am saddened that there is no empathy. Literally, her house was burned down by an angry mob. Have some empathy.  Nepal has systematic corruption at every level. Everyone has either given or taken bribes.  There are minimal financial opportunities within Nepal. It makes financially more sense for an honest person to seek employment abroad. By destroying businesses and targeting the elites, the country will witness even less investment. It needs money to create investments for more jobs. Ironic thing was people who protested showed their own corruption by looting private companies - which again legally is a crime.   If I can have empathy for arsons and thieves who destroyed and looted public and private properties, have some empathy for another Nepali who was threatened and attacked viciously online just for being more successful than most people.|||If you guys really think she got what she deserved - having her old parents house.

Can you all focus on how better you can be as human beings instead of being so wild in this game ? Haven‚Äôt you never made a mistake in your life ?

Then, randomly some months ago saw the same name on social media and him selling his book for helping to build industry or research center.  Then, saw his post about how he will work more for young people so he will get more votes from younger generation if another such vote occurs in the future. I was so impressed by such a positive take by this man.  But today, like many others I got to see the video of his graduation speech on Nebraska University. I searched some more on YouTube and this man has been actively saying nothing but 'my home village' and 'my country Nepal'.  His love for this nation is second to none. Even after how he has been treated by everyone including myself. Even I never bother to search online about him.  Everyone in Nepal like me need to apologize to Dr.Mahabir Pun.  His quote,\"There comes a difficult time, unusual situation that people usually don't need to go through. In that situation it is necessary to have uncommon faith and uncommon approaches to face the uncommon odds of human life.\" from the same video of graduation speech. It will never leave my brain. This man said those words on 2007 and lived by it. His uncommon faith and uncommon approaches has definitely made huge impact on me today. And hoping Nepal will follow his will of uncommon faith and uncommon approaches to face the uncommon odds of human life.  This is not a time to be wasting on excel sheets, Facebook status, conspiracy theories and on egocentric people. We won't get any better person than him to lead the change on his sector.

            "body": "My house was vandalized in the name of \"Gen z protest.\" My dad is a civil servant, and we live in a humble 3 story house (the third story was only recently built). It was a small house when we moved in, which was 17 years ago‚Äî few months after I was born.   After working for over 25+ years for the government, this country, and its public, my dad still has a very clear history. No bribery, no corruption, no money laundering‚Äî nothing. Rising high in status and the post, he is recognized for his diligent work and highly stable work ethic.  Now, back to the present. The protestors had reached our house. I had once thought, why would anyone target our house? It's a civil servant, not some minister or anything of that sort. My father rose high due to his hard work and competitiveness, not any connection or bribery. We can all see from how my parents lived rental first (he was already a civil servant then). Only after a few months of me being born did they buy a house, not without taking loans.  I don't know why it happened because our house was aba and definitely not supposed to be a part of whatever that was. The protestors were going to burn our house, but because of it being attached to other houses, the neighbours finally calmed them down into not burning our house. Instead, they burned our bikes, went into our house, and threw things out to burn them. What's worse? When the protestors left, all the people living nearby, went in and out for 2 days straight‚Äî morning, day and night, pickng whatever things they liked amd taking it home with them as if our house was some kind of thrift store giving away our stuff for free.  We were at our relative's house, and when we saw all the black smoke coming from the direction of our house, we were devastated. \"Our house got burnt.\" That's what we thought. As i was the oldest child in the family, i couldn't let myself break down. I can still hear those devastating gut-wrenching cries and sobs from my mom, haunting me like a ghost every time i close my eyes.   I am a college student. My uniform is gone, and so are my books and copies. My sister is in middle school. Her uniform and books and copies are nowhere to be found as well.   Our money and jewelries, of course, are gone too. The same money my father earned and mind you, a civil servant's earnings isn't much. Only enough to label us as a middle-class family. The same money my sister sent us, her hard-working money(which was in dollars at that).  Our clothes, bags, and even utensils are gone, and so are our food storage(stuff). My mom is someone who saves money. However, she can just like my dad because she knows she has experienced the hardships with my dad. Because they know. Because they have experienced hardships and complications in their life. Because they have faced obstacles.  We have never wore any designers, no luxury fashion brand. All are affordable and comfortable. The only designer my mom and dad ever even had is when my big sister from abroad visited us and surprised us with some designer bags (which she also got scolded for spending so much because she is still studying and working in between only).  Our guests'clothes, laptops, phones, everything is gone. Me and my sisters' savings and my mom's little spending for managing our household‚Äî nothing is left. Not even our puja ko thaan(a small place we had to worship and pray gods).   We have tons of debts. I am old enough to learn that by now. Now that our house was totally and utterly robbed and vandalized while my dad kept on working for the same public, we have nowhere to sleep on. No clothes to wear. There is no place to shower or bathe.  We had to hide away from our own house we once called home to keep ourselves alive. My father was lucky enough to be safe because if it was even a few seconds late, it would have all been over. We were fortunate to be alive, even though we had done nothing wrong to people.  Morality? Humanity? Conscience? Guilt? Remorse? None. The same people, the same public, that my dad is working so hard to serve with his whole heart, has done this to him, to his family.  Gen z, huh? Protest against corruption, huh? My dad, having the cleanest history‚Äî no corruption, bribery, connection, whatsoever. So why our house? Why? What had we ever done to them? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.   I have no hope left. None for this country, none for the people of this country. This is now a country full of robbers and thieves. Humans are jealous. Humans are greedy. People are full of themselves, full of greediness and selfishness. In my heart, humans are creatures who have ruined any hope for more in me and my family. My father, who once poured his heart for this country and the people in this country, is on the verge of giving up on it.  You people, opportunists, and robbers who call yourselves voice of justice‚Äî I'll be watching, watching who you are going to tame to pull this country back together. People like my dad who are so wronged will be out of all this mess soon, Who are you going to pull to patch this broken country? I'll be watching. I'll be happily watching everything crumble and fall apart with your \"justice.\" You have given the opportunists a sense of win. You've let them think anything is possible, and now, everything will fall apart while you watch everything crumble in front of your eyes.  Lastly, I'd like to be a little vulgar and uncensored. If you are uncomfortable, scroll away.  Whoever has participated in vandalizing my house and robbing it empty‚Äî You are going to see hell and worse. I hope you feel yourself rotting away. I hope you don't think it's over now because whatever you stole, it will haunt you for the rest of your life and afterwards. I will forever haunt you, even in your dreams, converting it into a disastrous nightmare. You'll see hell. You are going to suffer.  [Edit: I never expected this post to gain so many views. I‚Äôm very grateful to those who are wishing me and my family well, thank you very much for that. And I also understand those who might raise an eyebrow on this post and not believe in my words. It‚Äôs up to you, whether you want to believe me or not. I have no intention of forcing it on you.   I‚Äôd also like to request anyone who knows me through this post to maintain my privacy and not reveal anything about me or my family on the internet(please refrain any stalker behavior). I have never gone public like this and I also don‚Äôt like the attention this is getting(makes me uncomfortable) but I‚Äôm going to keep this post so other people who have experienced something like this can be open about it here. Let this be a safe space for those to speak up.]",

While this was an absolutely needed protest and it did bring much-needed attention and change, we also can‚Äôt deny the darker side of it. While the deaths of innocent people rightfully shook everyone and fueled the anger, more innocent lives were lost in the chaos that followed.  Gen Z cannot ignore the fact that others died in fires, or that people were looted and harmed during the unrest. It‚Äôs easy to say the movement was hijacked by goons, but the videos and reports show some protesters themselves vandalizing property and stealing from people who had nothing to do with the issue. Ironically, those who stood up against corruption ended up damaging the lives and livelihoods of ordinary citizens.   Those responsible should be held accountable for it!!!

They are just normal people who don't want to see more unemployment and rising prices due to an influx of people. The blame, however, should go directly to the bureaucrats and the big businesses of Australia who are exploiting the immigrants and its laws by hiring cheap wages.|||I am Australian and play tennis with some wonderful Nepalis.

Much love to you all Aussies too.|||Appreciate it mate|||Thanks for your kind appreciation. Let me tell you our Nepalese perspective.  As a Nepalese, it's really tough for us to enter Australia, first you must pass at least high school with good marks, then get a really good English test score, then you must show a significant bank balance, so your immigration policy is already filtering only the best people from other countries.   I am a Engineer myself, it's relatively easy for someone like me to immegrate to Australia, but for students of other field, you're immigration policy already make sure only the best students come in your country, and it should be that way to be honest.   Regarding your immigration issue, well I believe any country should only allow immigration if there is net positive for the country, you don't want a bunch of liabilities to come in your country, right??  So, just look at the data, you can very easily find out what communities are contributing to Australia, and what communities are hampering the country, and simply adjust the policies that way, it's really that simple.   Regarding recent protests against Immigration, well I think that's just the coverup done by the rich and elites to brainwash common Aussies so that the blame is shifted towards immigration when in fact Australia has the best immigration compared to many Western countries.   My cousin recently returned back to Nepal, they lived in Melbourne for almost 10 years, they shared the economy isn't doing great compared to past years, and the blame is being shifted solely towards immigration.|||U will be welcomed here in Nepal.

For instance, people said that some organized bands/crime was taking place respectively were active; this seems to make sense if we look at what happened (beating people, setting things on fire after taking TV monitors etc...). Then there is the issue of the military shooting eagerly at people who were no threat at all - a good example is the video of a car where people walked to that car, assuming the cops could help them, and then suddenly someone from inside the car shooting one guy dead, then driving off. That is very strange - why did they kill someone there? And who were the killers? There are other videos showing strange things. Then there was pillaging and theft - some may have been from individuals who just seized an opportunity, but there are still question marks about that; most genuine protesters don't have as an objective to steal stuff. This all has to be investigated - unfortunately I do not trust any official from Nepal to make a genuine investigation here. It needs external people who are not involved on either side, perhaps investigators from Brazil, Switzerland and Canada; these should be impartial enough.

Most of times Indian (south asians) face racism is due to...   1. bad dressing up sense , fashion.  2. manners   3. smell     Always dress well, wear clean, not necessarily new, clothes, be polite in train, bus ( say thank you to driver, leave seats for women , pregnant, elderly etc ), don't play music in phone without earphones, don't speak in phone in crowded space, hold door if you can, and use thank you, sorry, excuse me please as often as you can. And avoid eating food with garlic, onion like lot ... mild amount won't be cause body odour.      Chinese, Korean look same as Japanese , but Japanese never face racism (mostly) , it is because they are so conscious about their appearance in public, their mannerism and they are so well dressed, we must be like Japanese ;)|||Dhaka topi lagayera k hunxa ra ?

And from what I have seen very recently, he has stopped seeking suggestions from GenZ crowds.   So everything that he has been doing at this point forward, is solely on his own discretion. Maybe he will try to cite his behaviour as something that is approved by a mass, but clearly it isn‚Äôt.   He got to be the face of GenZ because there was no one who wanted to come forward. And at this point of time, I can clearly anticipate that all of fellows from the groups will feel as if they are in the wrong boat right now.

People can disagree with his role but it is undeniably true that he became a face of representation of the ‚ÄúGen Z‚Äù (aba sabai gen z le choose gare or not is a different debate) at a time when army was constantly asking for us to be unified and bring forth a representative at such a volatile situation. Thankfully the situation solved. But after the negotiations with The President and the subsequent outcomes of the negotiations, he should have taken a back seat and let the person intended to run the position do their work( at the end of the day, us ‚ÄúGen Z‚Äù haru le nai choose garya hola ni ta Sushila Shreeman lai?) And I don‚Äôt get his afu chai cabinet ma na basne tara aile aba afu bina ko cabinet ma k hunxa sabai kura afu bata jawos bhanne expectations rakheko dekhda chai I felt he was either arrogant or naive when it comes to governance and how power plays when it comes to running a literal government. I think it would be best for him and his team to take a rest and REFLECT and let the experts do their thing( aba haina bhsne ki ta afai cabinet ma basnu thik hola)   Regarding the family‚Äôs demands, I won‚Äôt be so quick to comment on it as it as very sensitive issue for them and I don‚Äôt think this interim govt  would be so unkind to the families like the past (party kongovts would be). It‚Äôs only been  2 days that the govt has been in place, I think his maturity would be reflected if he supports the govt in finalizing the cabinet first and letting the administration come to its daily routine. And then u can always raise the family‚Äôs issue.

            "body": "We all know most ISP here lock the router and dont give any access to the web management. As a devops practitioner and someone who is very invested in homelabbing and selfhosting, locked router was my biggest achilles heels.   Requirement: A secondary router, you main router will stop working and secondary router will only work through LAN1 port.   Solution: All you have to do is create a ticket on vianet app stating \"Turn the router into bridge/modem only mode\". Someone will call you back, just ask them username and password for PPPOE and use your secondary router to configure through PPPOE instead of DHCP. Tada!!! you now have full control over your router.   Bonus 1: You can flash openwrt with Luci web interface and you will be able to configure anything you can think of. extra advantage is you can configure mesh routing without needing a special router. I have managed to easily flash it on my Mi router and a old tp link router, search for guides depending on your model or ask Claude or Gpt to search specifically for your router model.   Bonus 2: Vianet gives you globally accessible IPV6. That means you are free from CGNAT. Use this to access your home services without needing any relay like Cloudflare Tunnel or Tailscale VPN. Direct connection means no extra latency and maxed bandwidth and you can use this to host online game servers to play with your friends!! But for some reason Worldlink doesnt connect sometimes. Ncell and ClassicTech seems to have no problem tho. I am not sure if NTC offers IPV6.  Bonus 3: Host a adguard DNS server and configure your openwrt to use it as your default DNS server. This way you will have adblocking for your whole network. Your parents and old grannies wont have to see ads no more (wont work with Youtube app - use revance) and it keeps them safe from online phishing and malwares. You can also set some static ip and adguard to block some websites like gambling and pornography if there are minors in your household.   Disadvantage: The only downside of this is your main router will turn pretty much useless. Internet wont work through wireless and extra ports. So dont forget the vianet tech support to turn off the DHCP and wireless on the main router. Since my secondary router also has 2 ports only I had to invest some money on extra gigabyte switch.   I know some of you will appreciate this so this is my appreciation and giving back to this community. enjoy and have fun!! Happy Dashain!!!

Did it impact your internet speed in any way?   Also, directly exposing your local network and devices through IPv6 is not really a good idea.

So I have a camera that allows remote viewing. However, when I connect the camera to Vianet, remote viewing doesn't work and I need to be within my home network to view the feed through the app.  The remote feed viewing works in Worldlink and Ncell's mobile data.

He had written a long convincing description saying things like:  > ‚ÄúScam ho vannu vanda agadi read: I buy from Vietnam promotional offer and sell it here with Rs.200 profit per account.

This isn't just about a bad interview, it feels like a deliberate strategy to exploit job seekers for free labor.  I went through **multiple** rounds of interviews over several weeks. Everything seemed promising. The conversations were positive, and they talked about a great fit for their team. Then came the \"final\" task: to design a comprehensive digital marketing campaign.  I spent days on this. I researched their brands, analysed their competitors, and built out a full strategy, complete with campaign ideas, target audiences, content plans, and performance metrics. I treated it like a real, paid project because I genuinely wanted the job and to show my capabilities.  I submitted the work, feeling confident. Then... nothing. Total radio silence. I followed up, but no response. The most infuriating part? The reason given was a flimsy, nonsensical excuse that had nothing to do with the work I submitted.  This isn't an isolated incident. I've heard from others who have gone through the exact same process with them. They get you to design a full campaign, which they can then use or adapt, and then they ghost you or reject you on some silly pretext. It's a blatant exploitation of job seekers' time and skills.  If you're a digital marketer in Nepal and you're considering applying to IMS Group, be warned. This is not a legitimate hiring process. It's a fishing expedition for free campaign ideas. Save your time and your work for a company that respects candidates and values their professional effort.  They were still hiring 2 days ago and I gave the interview 3 months ago.",

            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada‚Äôs classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.¬†  We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking‚Äìmuch to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in¬† Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate -¬†the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala‚Äôs approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.¬†  Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn‚Äôt mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‚Äòhelp‚Äô. One time, she even said airily, ‚ÄúI wash my own dishes, you know.‚Äù She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala‚Äìa beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth‚Äìlingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don‚Äôt intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‚Äònepo babies‚Äô who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).¬†  Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It‚Äôs a troubling idea to think that despite what‚Äôs happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

And a few after she became miss nepal... I can somewhat vouch for the \"I'm busy with this and that... Can you help me with this\" part...  People around her always had the same feedback.. and I quote as I recall \"Euta kaam pani garna parexaina yo kt lai.. jahile ni help help vanxa...  help magne pro vikhari..\"  üòÇ (she barely does a thing on her own, always keeps asking for help , she like pro-beggar ..)   I never liked her naak ma singan adke jasto boli.. And always felt she has a cunning personality that clings over you until she can no more use you for her advantage..  Sisan literally dodged a  bullet.. all thanks to her greed though..|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn‚Äôt some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake ‚Äúbeauty with brains‚Äù narrative. Do you guys remember Niti‚Äôs big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let‚Äôs not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala‚Äôs prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it‚Äôs her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let‚Äôs be real- Sisan wasn‚Äôt perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they‚Äôd known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn‚Äôt even exist. This just proves it- they weren‚Äôt just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can‚Äôt just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala‚Äôs career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav‚Äôs narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What‚Äôs the lesson we can learn from here ?  Karma is real af & money can‚Äôt give you lifelong happiness, night Redditors|||Wish we had more tea like this on all nepo babies.|||She didn't get any fucking scholarship from the Nepali government.

Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don‚Äôt even make sense to begin with. Don‚Äôt know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don‚Äôt even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It‚Äôs so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It‚Äôs astounding what the world has come to and it‚Äôs deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can‚Äôt be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn‚Äôt she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It‚Äôs better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has. It‚Äôs disheartening!|||[deleted]|||What do you expect from a pageant queen?

Every move, every word, every connection seems like part of a bigger calculation. While most people get dragged through the mud on social media, she somehow stays a step ahead. Of all platforms, she was clever enough to pull the LinkedIn card first. That‚Äôs not by accident, it‚Äôs calculation. She knows the bashing on Tiktok or Instagram doesn‚Äôt matter as long as her professional side stays spotless, especially where she might work with people internationally who will never know the side of her life in Nepal that‚Äôs been exposed and torn apart ever since the truth came out.  It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs playing this endless game of Ludo, always climbing the ladder, polishing her image as she goes. But at the same time, you can‚Äôt help but feel she‚Äôs only ever a roll away from hitting 98 and sliding right back down the snake.|||We wont know if what you claim is true. But I wouldn't be surprised if its true either or even worse. I would assume that she was in her best behavior since she was not in Nepal and probably wanted to portray the best of her image.  My moment of disdain for her came about when her father one of the members of the parliament who were on monthly housing allowance along with the monthly pay. The beinfit is probably meant for the MPs who had to move temprorarily to the capital or who didn't have their own residence. Iirc, they had to manually opt in to get that added housing allowance. When the news published, her father's reaction was something along the line of \"I didn't know, I was getting it. I am happy to return it.\"  Question for her, how come you dont know the source of wealth and your parent's ethics?

These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!! And the way she's silent when the country is bleeding says alottt too!!!!!!  And about the Nepal's government scholarship for harvard,this is not true, she is telling an entire different story about harvard scholarsip & how she paid fees there. She said she got 30% scholarship at harvard and the remaining 70% is paid through her brand endorsements money as she is brand ambassador to few company. We didnt buy that story, she tried hardest to sell it though and still fools people with this shitty madeup script about harvard's 30% scholarship & 70% funding through brand endorsement's money lmao. And lately she's being questioned on 50,000USD she got during miss world competition after winning \"beauty with the purpose\" title.

This is valuable for those of us who were shocked and skeptical about her success right from the day she got into limelight. I watched her view on Youtube yesterday and couldn't get past a minute of that video, she is clearly playing victim and trying to play the game.  Nope! she doesn't deserve any chance at all.  The students that I know personally who went to Harvard, MIT and many other prestigious institutions had grit, determination, belief in hard-work, may be little bit of luck but most of all they had \"humility\". They NEVER used their \"Harvard degree\" or Ivy league label to show off. It's those who want to fame and fake pride that put up social media posts to show off their diplomas. Honestly, it was very very clear even before she went to Harvard that she was on the wrong side of fame game.  For the longest time I thought it was a generational difference, since there are many other Harvard students who have publicized themselves in several Youtube videos and they are all Gen Z, and as a Gen Y (Millennial) observing this trend seemed justifiable.  However, Shrinkhala was building a house of cards and the fact that she had the audacity to publicize and put Sambhav Sirohiya in the limelight using Harvard freebies was just laughable a few years ago.  Like you pointed out, the fact that she still has 900K followers is troubling for sure but let's hope those are just her fake followers (some % are bought/in-organic followers, some her closest elite allies like \"Other Miss Nepals/ Businessmen/political affiliates etc. and some her enemies) as they say, **keep your friends close and enemies closer.**|||I heard that B.arch is the easiest subject to get at Pulchowk and that too for a girl as they have separate reservations for women.

Miss World organization saw through her, so didn't let her go to the final round. There is no substance in her words and it  sounds exactly like a politician speech. Idealistic statements with no action. Look at the legacy of previous Miss Nepal winners. Most of them marry rich businessman and secure a rich, lavish life.

She‚Äôs totally naive and it‚Äôs the time to be a child. Usko personal tutor huncha and all Rey but come on it‚Äôs her age where she should be able to be a child.|||Concern is valid but we don‚Äôt have enough information to either justify or call it an exploitation yet. Aafno aafno opinion lai fact jasari prove garna nakhojam.   Questioning the tradition is valid and should be done. That‚Äôs how we will get more information on the practice and then we can determine whether the tradition is actually jeopardising the child‚Äôs mental health or not.   But without any credible information just blatantly labelling it exploitative and child abuse will do more harm than good.|||True, the Kumari tradition is precious but it needs to be modified so culture thrives without harming the child.|||  Wait till the local Newar finds out that someone has spoken a fact here. üòÇ|||Hi all I am a Newar, and i don‚Äôt oppose the tradition.  The child will have access to education and almost everything another child can ask for. We have belief that the child carries spirit of Taleju Bhawani, which gives the child immense power. Again, in an age where we have lost our belief, I cannot prove it.  The kumaris I have visited emit strong aura (i may have been brainwashed to feel this). But she does have to be disciplined (i dont mean someone disciplines her). The child is treated with utmost respect by the best people in a homely environment.   Aba before age of 15 16, Manang Mustang ghumna khasai koi jaadaina hola (only speaking for myself) After she is no longer a Kumari, she can go whereever she wants to.   Anyways, I am open for a discussion and may be able to pose any questions to the people in the inner circle. I don‚Äôt know much myself but do have the connections if we want the facts so we can all stop conspiring.  Jay Desh|||We should support female pope in Vatican gender equality let's goooo!!!|||What about the rights of Nuns... We should talk about this also|||Kumaris: A common doll for everyone.   A 3 year old child has no idea what she is getting into. She cannot grasp what a normal childhood is, what is right and what is wrong. The only thing she knows and does is based on her likes and dislikes, which is heavily depended upon how her parents/surrounding elders dictates.   Ani about 'No complains' from past Kumaris:   Newari culture is super sensitive. You cannot say anything against their culture. Otherwise, you'll have to face \"Tom n Jerry\" like people. I think, every ex Kumaris understands this at some point. With this much pressure along with the grooming done from a very young age, I don't think anyone dares to speak up. Which basically means none of us know what they really feel inside.    Well, of course, keeping in mind how they're thrown away once they reach a certain age or goes through ü©∏. At least, a life time opportunity to be a Kumari where they could renounce their position if they don't feel like it should be a way.   They don't preach, they don't teach, they only show up during jatras. I've never seen Kumaris actively participating in rituals or any sort of activities. Yestai ho vane, why not create a statue of a Kumari for the rest of our lives and stay quiet???|||Also it adds to the stereotype that period blood is impure|||Yeah the 1sttime ever I saw Kumari it was not aww like I hoped but pity to the \"Living Goddess\" she had the look of not a girl her age but of an \"ice princess\" in anime. Like I have never seen such a sad expression ever probably cause she cant smile or cry.|||i think no newari person feels that being chosen as a kumari is a bad thing and they have ripped the kid of her most deserving childhood, she has a great life in kumari house fully taken care by her parents, she also gets educated within the kumari house, apart from her kumari duties, providing blessings to people which is a small time of her day and appearing in festivals she has a normal fun life.  The only thing you should feel bad about is her parents who now have to be her full time care takers probably having to leave their jobs and careers and move into the kumari house with her.|||I used to extremely religious before and used to glorify ts But realising Kumari tradition is cruel was my first step towards atheism|||As a Newar, I understand the cultural side of it. But living in the US and having global exposure, I also see it as more of a pageant. If you‚Äôve seen Little Miss Sunshine, you‚Äôll get the context.||| The Living Goddess tradition of Nepal is a complex institution rooted in centuries of culture. While modern concerns about child rights are valid, the practice is governed by strict rituals and has evolved to address contemporary welfare standards. Here are the key facts:  1. The Selection is Meticulous and Considered an Honor:  ¬∑ A Kumari is chosen from the specific Shakya clan of the Newari community, a Buddhist goldsmith caste. ¬∑ The selection process is incredibly rigorous. Candidates must meet 32 strict physical perfection requirements (e.g., eye shape, voice quality, hair color) and demonstrate a fearless and serene demeanor (e.g., by not crying during a ceremony in a room of 108 ritually sacrificed animal heads). ¬∑ For the family and community, her selection is not a punishment but the highest spiritual honor.  2. The Role is Central to National Culture and Unity:  ¬∑ The Kumari is not just a religious figure but a national symbol. ¬∑ Her most important public duty is during the Indra Jatra festival, where she blesses the President of Nepal, providing divine legitimacy to the state in a ceremony that blends Hindu and Buddhist traditions. This is a key event for national identity.  3. Significant Reforms and Safeguards Have Been Implemented:  ¬∑ Education: By law, the Kumari now receives a formal education from private tutors within her residence. The government provides a monthly stipend specifically for this purpose. ¬∑ Family Presence: Contrary to isolation claims, her family (typically her mother) lives with her throughout her tenure. ¬∑ Financial Security: Upon retiring at puberty, the state grants her a lifetime pension. As of recent years, this is approximately NPR 10,000 per month (roughly $75 USD), along with a lump sum of NPR 1 million (roughly $7,500 USD) to support her transition. ¬∑ Successful Reintegration: Former Kumaris like Dr. Chanira Bajracharya, who served until 14, have publicly spoken about their positive experiences, pursued higher education, and built successful careers, demonstrating that life after the role is viable.  The Kumari tradition is a deeply embedded socio-religious institution. It is factually inaccurate to frame it simply as the \"isolation\" of a child. It is a state-sanctioned, culturally sacred role with defined rituals, significant community support, and legally mandated provisions for the girl's education, family life, and long-term financial security. The debate around it highlights the global tension between cultural preservation and evolving child rights, but the practice itself has demonstrably adapted to modern norms.|||I ain't newar but also I think aaba yesto kura chai parents haru le vhaneko ramro hami third party le vhannu vhanda pani . look if kumari ko parents le chahanu hudaina vhani tyo kumari ko candidate mai na leraunu parni ho . so parents lai kehi problem xaina , kumari le as a normal human being ni basna paunu hunxa after completion so I think we are no one to question sodhna lai|||What about the tradition of marrying off daughters into the inlaws house?|||After giving this some thought question is of a philosophical one.

Khaire ko documentary haru herera brainrot kura nagara na. Not everyone is privileged to become kumari and nor they are selected randomly. The family members themself have to fill the form and there's a long running selection process. Only a certain clan of newar can become Kumari. There are lots of inhuman and child abusive traditions going on all over. In case of kumari they get highest level of love and respect. They can live with their parents, they can play, they can watch TV, they can even play video games. It would be better if you watch podcasts of ex kumaris it's really helpful. I used to think same like everyone calling this inhuman before but they are living the normal life as you and me. And the fact that you can't speak up being kumari is totally false, yes you can't but only in jatras and other religious ceremonies, do you speak up during sharad and other pujas(it's prohibited to talk during sharad if you don't know). Go visit sudurpaschim hundreds of girls are being raped during their chhaupadi bas. Go visit terai Muslim villages girls at the age of 15 are getting married and at the age of 21 they are booned with 3 childs.

To those insisting Kumaris are always ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù or dismissing criticism by belittling others, few things we can reflect on:   1. How much do we actually know about child psychology and development, especially at such a young age when experiences shape a lifetime? 2. Yes, a Kumari is worshipped as a goddess now but when her time ends, how does a goddess step back into an ordinary life? How do peers treat her? How does she even make friends? 3. With isolation and the constant expectation to suppress emotions, what happens to her social, communication, and interpersonal skills? Who helps her navigate that later? 4. Does she ever get space to express her own feelings and thoughts or is silence part of the job description? 5. We‚Äôve all seen videos of new Kumari, some barely three years old, literally asleep in full dress during rituals. How on earth can a toddler be burdened with divine expectations when they can barely stay awake through it? 6. As Nepalis, many of us defend dal bhat tarkari because it‚Äôs what we grew up with it feels untouchable. (I know it‚Äôs not the same but for reference) For a Kumari, this role is all she has ever known. So how would she even recognise or articulate what she‚Äôs missed out on, when she never had the chance to experience it? 7. And let‚Äôs be honest do we really believe someone put on a pedestal that high, surrounded by cultural pressure, guilt, and shame, would openly talk about the negatives of being Kumari? Yes, things have changed there‚Äôs more education, some family contact,but none of that cancels out the developmental and human rights concerns we‚Äôre talking about.  And honestly, the comments here kind of prove the point: we were never really taught to think critically. Instead of having an actual discussion, people are throwing around ‚Äúbahun,‚Äù ‚ÄúChristian,‚Äù or ‚Äúother cultures‚Äù like that somehow answers the question.

Goodness flows through Kumari.  She is worshipped for being the medium of taleju bhawani. They are taught that they as an individual are not god, but the goodness that flows through her is what makes her worshipped.  And calling Kumari as a \"virgin goddess\" is stupid and a complete disregard of religious belief. It's a literal translation not a literary translation.   A lot of misconceptions have already been debunked.  Therefore they are able to integrate back into society well. They have good societal support . They are mentored, taught and are well taken care of. They themselves have immence respect for their religion and tradition.  If you think being a Kumari is wrong, you simply look at other practices in other religions. Nuns are not allowed to marry or consummate. Denying the right to marry and consummate can be considered as an oppressive practices denying one from their human desires. In radical Islam, burka, multiple marriages, denial of human rights for wemen.  While such petty comparisons are stupid themselves, what I want to say is we are worshipping female power. We are actually looking at females as devine. Not simply blind worship.   Nothing about today's childhood is normal.  You see young boys and girls sent off to boarding schools as normal? It's more isolating depressing. Parents just sticking their child to an iPad, or a hyperactive parent forcing their child through multiple activities (music class, sports, extra activities) even when their child may not want to to them, and pushing their child to extremes, putting their child through ridiculously high expectations, so that they can fulfill own ego( yes I've seen it happen).  A lot is not normal in so called modern normal childhood.   A lot of narratives and propogandas have infiltrated our thinking. Be water and explore into the culture.

            "body": "People love to throw shade at King Mahendra, calling him an authoritarian who killed democracy. But let‚Äôs be real: he‚Äôs the only king after Prithvi Narayan Shah who actually did something that mattered for the survival of Nepal.    Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus ‚Äî with nine governments in ten years. That wasn‚Äôt democracy, it was chaos. Leaders were busy stabbing each other in the back while the nation stayed dirt poor, uneducated, and vulnerable. Tell me, what ‚Äústable democracy‚Äù exists when governments collapse every year? None. Mahendra saw this and did what no one else had the guts to do: he hit reset.    Yes, he dissolved parliament. Yes, he banned parties. And you know what? He was right to. Without stability, Nepal was on track to become India‚Äôs backyard project or another pawn in the Cold War. Mahendra‚Äôs Panchayat system gave the country one thing it desperately lacked: stability.    And let‚Äôs talk achievements:    He balanced India and China like a chess master. Without him, we‚Äôd have been swallowed by one side decades ago.    He pushed Nepal onto the global stage ‚Äî Non-Aligned Movement, a stronger UN presence, and an independent foreign policy.    He jump-started modernisation: roads, schools, universities, tourism. These are things no king before him, and very few leaders after him, have been able to deliver at that scale.    But historians? They love to cry about ‚Äúdemocracy dying in 1960.‚Äù These same historians never admit that the so-called ‚Äúdemocrats‚Äù of the 50s were busy running the country into the ground. It‚Äôs easy to glorify B.P. Koirala in hindsight, but Mahendra was the one cleaning up the mess in real time.    Here‚Äôs the hard truth: Mahendra was the only king who actually acted like a king ‚Äî a protector of sovereignty. Everyone after him either coasted on his legacy or failed miserably. Without him, Nepal might not even exist as the independent state it is today.    Call him authoritarian all you want, but facts don‚Äôt lie. After Prithvi Narayan Shah, King Mahendra was the only true king Nepal ever had.",

He saved Nepal from being a puppet of foreign countries. He was a gem.|||Its not an unpopular opinion though. Those who know history know how Progressive Mahendra was. One thing though, his rapid advancements did over heat a fledgling Nepalese economy which is why we needed to privatize our industries. But the privatization was a joke,   they privatized it too quickly and privatization advocates in Nepal did admit they made a huge mistake later on.|||Mahendra is a complicated figure. On one hand, he did keep Nepal intact at a time when regional instability and internal divisions could have easily spiraled out of control.  On the other, his coup dismantled the first democratic experiment and concentrated power in the monarchy, which created long-term issues that Nepal is still untangling today.   It‚Äôs less that historians hate admitting he saved Nepal, and more that they frame it as a tradeoff between short-term stability and long-term democratic development.|||Popular opinion. It's because of Prithvi Narayan Shah and King Mahendra that modern day Nepal even exists as a separate country in its current form. Otherwise there would not have even been an independent country known as Nepal.|||His authoritarian enforcement of the Nepali language and Hindu traditions on a diverse population that wanted nothing to do with them was one of the causes of the civil war that would follow.  He killed democracy in its crib and pulled us back into medieval institutions. Even if I were to hypothetically accept that he was a good ruler for the sake of argument, there is no guarantee and his heirs and his heirs‚Äô heirs would have been good rulers, which is why absolute monarchy fails. Any good that he might have done during his reign is negated by the fact that long term institutions are more important than charismatic rulers, and he ruined the institution of democracy. All the instability that we have faced since 2008- would have happened in the 1950s and we could have been a prosperous democracy by the present. This guy pulled us decades back.  It‚Äôs easy to look back at the past with rose tinted glasses and romanticize it, that is the first step on the road to fascism, but the truth of life, prosperity and happiness is in the future and progressive institutions.|||The problem with Monarchy in Nepal and everywhere else is that there are few good apples in 1 crore ropani orchard.  Except PN Shah, Mahendra and maybe Birendra (many sources call him spineless but I don't know), no one else were fit to rule. The country fell into Ranas dictatorship  because of Monrachy system failure.  So here we are, dealing with generational political trauma.|||A quick ChatGPT will give you some real perspective:  Most historians and political analysts agree that King Mahendra‚Äôs reasons were more of a pretext to consolidate royal power rather than genuine democratic concerns. Here‚Äôs why:  1. Political instability was exaggerated  Nepal‚Äôs first elected government (1959‚Äì1960) under B. P. Koirala had been in office for only 18 months.  While there were some administrative problems, it wasn‚Äôt long enough to judge the parliamentary system a failure.  Corruption and inefficiency existed, but not at the level Mahendra claimed.   2. Fear of losing monarchical dominance  The 1959 elections gave the Nepali Congress a clear majority.  Koirala‚Äôs government was popular and gaining legitimacy, which posed a direct threat to the king‚Äôs absolute authority.  Mahendra feared the monarchy would become a ceremonial institution like in India or Britain.   3. Foreign policy pretext  Koirala pursued a relatively independent foreign policy, maintaining balance between India and China.  Mahendra accused him of endangering Nepal‚Äôs sovereignty, but in reality, the king wanted direct control over diplomacy, which was vital for aid and recognition.   4. Use of \"underdeveloped society\" argument  Mahendra claimed that Nepalese people weren‚Äôt ‚Äúready‚Äù for democracy due to illiteracy and lack of experience.  This was partly true, but instead of strengthening democratic institutions, he abolished parties and built a system where only the king‚Äôs will mattered.   5. The Panchayat system benefited him most  Under Panchayat, all political power flowed through the king.  It created the image of \"guided democracy,\" but in practice, it was royal autocracy with no accountability.   üìå Conclusion: Mahendra used the excuses of instability, corruption, and national unity to justify a royal coup. The deeper reason was to preserve absolute monarchy and prevent Nepal from transitioning into a genuine parliamentary democracy.|||Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus, with nine governments in ten years. That wasn‚Äôt democracy, it was chaos.  LOL. The King chose PM. He was the one responsible.|||Yes man agreed. He is the guy who defined Nepal and Nepali people. He did a lot of great works for the country. But many people and our school books consider him as a dictator telling about how he banned political parties and not mention about the reforms and development made by him for the country. One of the greatest leader of our country King Mahendra!!|||Ali history paddam, 1959 ma first election vako ho tyo vanda aagadi sab PM king le choose garya ho, 1st election ko 1.5 years ma coup vako ho.|||But his policies are disastrous for Nepal till this day  He opened Nepal's border with India, opened free trade with India, allowed India to build its Army base in Lipulekh Limpiyadhura Kalapani since then these territories are occupied by India  He also forced Khas culture on Newaris and Janjatis which influenced them to become Communists|||Agreed!|||Will not let anyone discredit the blood of 17k Nepali|||We wouldn't have been swallowed by any side. Non-alignment was the default policy from the beggining, and B.P koirala would have continued that policy. Nepal would have 'modernized' without an iron-fisted dictatorship.|||Matrika literally wanted to suck cock of india..   He was puppet of India...while BP was good...Matrika and BP's power struggle caused mahendra to step in...and take all the powers..   Thats my unpopular opinion too.|||I agree with most of your points. But your point about 10 governments in nine years doesn't show the instability created by parties but by the monarchs. The monarchs were the ones that were making them unstable. The one time it seemed to be stable, he couped the government. That doesn't diminish the fact thought, that his rule saw probably the most balanced foreign policy of Nepal, where Nepal truly stood out as a sovereign nature. I still believe that had Mahendra controlled a bit of his authoritarian ways and worked together with B.P. Koirala, Nepal would have been in a much better position that it is currently. Both of them are the best leaders Nepal had post P.N. Shah. It might be an unpopular opinion but I think P.N. Shah might be more important historically, but these two are probably the best leaders Nepal got, even better than P.N. Shah.|||Unpopular hoina, brain-dead opinion.

Ani jabo dui tukra road pitch garyo bhandai ma khusi hune??|||sovereignty? of who? Mahendra model of nation-building was \"one religion, one custom, one language.\" Hindu orthodoxy was enforced as state ideology, treating non-Hindu communities as second-class. Nepali was imposed as the only legitimate language, sidelining rich traditions like Maithili, Newar, Tharu, Tamang, Limbu, etc. This wasn't genuine unity - it was control through forced uniformity. What looked like stability was in fact suppression. That brittle foundation is why today's Nepal wrestles with federalism, ethnic assertion, and identity politics: democracy didn't invent division, it revealed what had long been silenced.  The Koiralas, born and educated in Banaras, were accused of being \"too Indian.\" But Nepal had no universities, no political freedom, no space for intellectual growth - precisely because the tyrants had closed those doors. Should they be condemned for seeking ideas in India, or credited for importing the democratic imagination Nepal lacked?  So the paradox is clear:  Mahendra centralized the state but weakened society.|||First question, why was Nepal unstable during those years? And second more important question, if stability was the most important thing for us, why did he take over from a parliament that had a 2/3 majority and the government was led by THE BP Koirala? There was a little chance that the Koirala govt would have toppled and was doing good work..  Yes, there were some long term projects under him that were very good for Nepal. There‚Äôs no denying that and kudos to him. But he was authoritarian, there is no denying that either. Let‚Äôs not over glorify someone and gloss over facts because they don‚Äôt fit our views..|||Educated boomers hate him(my boomer dad lol).|||Nepal was too small for the OG Mahendra.

It was only recently that F1 changed its office address to the F1 Building, before which it was M&S Tower.   The ban was all about control.

Never forget how soon videos started to vanish from TikTok during and after the protest.   This is what this entire fiasco was all about. A plot, put in place to achieve total control to serve Mission 2084.  The elections might have been scheduled for 2084, but the election campaigns would have launched months ahead. Imagine them having total control of social media going into 2084?   Even though we've ridiculed them for being 8th standard, they had an ambition- that is total control under the cloak of democracy.

It‚Äôs a different story but that‚Äôs exactly how I felt watching Shrinkhala‚Äôs videos.  I never idolized her or hated her, but this is too much. It was giving manipulation & narcissism. It‚Äôs one thing to defend her reputation, but completely another to do so by playing the victim card, shifting narratives & repeatedly saying things so that they are perceived as truth & dodging accountability by blaming others. Tbh it really bothered me that she (and her PR team) thought that we‚Äôre dumb enough to believe those excel sheets. Maybe what she said is true, but she could have showed the actual proof.  In her place, all of us would feel terrible. But to say things like leaving instagram account as it is so that it can be a testament to hate while not acknowledging her silence on a platform with a million followers over deaths of youth is crazy. Becoming an influencer means you are sometimes answerable to questions & accusations, it‚Äôs not just about making your feed aesthetic & scoring brand deals. People turned her into an influencer, so ofc she will have to be answerable sometimes. I wonder what she thought? Yea it‚Äôs not easy, but it‚Äôs part of all that fame & money.  To see that she was so concerned about setting her narrative & defending her image while not even feeling sorry for those who died, were injured & whose families are now forever incomplete is baffling.   Her narrative has been set forever now. Clearly, not to everyone, but to lots of us.

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. üò≠üò≠2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye üò≠|||3 brsa vo dashign namanako|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

Most Nepalis obtain citizenship at 16 while others obtain citizenship later. Why can't the freaking Election Commission (EC) get the data from that source?

We must hold institutions accountable and ensure that no other family is forced to endure the same pain and silence.  Let us honor Nirmala‚Äôs memory not with silence, but with action.

They are simple and have generally easy solutions that most if not all can understand. But they ask questions that often require you to interpret the asked topic in a different way. Thwy might twist a simple concept like vector addition and join it with irl examples.

You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

All these feels so different and absurd, if we pause and think about it.  We knew these would happen but not like this, at least we didn't assume that it would be us that would bring the final change.  It feels so nice, peculiar and absurd at the same time, I loved to be the part of this event, i will remember it forever, perhaps even tell my grandchildren about this.But the situation is far from better, we don't know whats there after this, we don't know what is really going on, our part is still there to play, we don't know, if the same old authoritarian system will continue, but the only thing we can do is, acknowledge, and be ready.",
