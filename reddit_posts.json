Mahesh is Oli‚Äôs pet, fine, but everyone else who shows up to cheer him on are the real desh drohis. After everything that happened they‚Äôre still praising him.  What kind of welcome is this? Is he returning from a victory? He was terrified for his life, resigned and fled. He didn‚Äôt resign on his own, he found out Deuba was attacked and a huge crowd was outside Baluwatar, he was scared and the Army told him they would rescue him if he resigned. And these UML puppets are acting like he‚Äôs won a contest.  Congress is the same. None of them have openly condemned Deuba. Please stop with this Gagan Thapa act, he‚Äôs a lost cause now; no point discussing him. Did people forget the money found at Deuba‚Äôs residence? The videos showing piles of cash, rooms stuffed with money, cupboards with foreign currency, even a kid can tell it‚Äôs black money, yet they still call him a savior.  Oli still shows no remorse and refuses to step down as party leader. Where is Prithivi Gurung? He vanished; he should face massive backlash too. We haven‚Äôt forgotten his press conference that night.  So to everyone saying ‚ÄúJay Oli‚Äù and joining his welcome: you are equally responsible for what has happened to this nation. We‚Äôll see your faces in those viral videos. Jhola haina, bora nei bokera jao aba. Also stop calling yourself communist, communist ko nam ma dhabba haru.",

Fell free to add your tweaks ;)  .1. **Download UniGetUI** to inspect installed software and save to package useful ones (will be useful for reinstall)  2. **(Optional) Use Windows Disk Management** to create a new disk partition `D: Data`, move data there, so that it doesn't get cleaned.  3. **Download official Windows 11**, use Windows 11 Installation Media for USB - [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11)  4. **This step will auto select Windows 11 Pro version**. On the USB‚Äôs root, create a file sources\\\\ei.cfg (plain text). Put this content in it:      [EditionID]     Professional          [Channel]     Retail          [VL]     0  5. **When installing windows, it offers an option to select disk partition** where windows should be installed. Delete all paritions (except data disk in step 2), so that all space is unallocated. Select this unallocated partition as installation target.  6. **(Optional) If stuck on screen \"Oops, you' ve lost internet connection\".** On this screen or on country selection screen:  >Open cmd with Shift + F10 and type `OOBE\\BYPASSNRO.`  >Your computer will restart and now you will have the \"I don't have Internet\" option.  7. **After windows installation, permanently activate Windows 11 and Microsoft Office 365:(https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts)**  >a. Open PowerShell as administrator and enter: `irm` [`https://get.activated.win`](https://get.activated.win) `| iex`  >b. Select `[1] HWID` \\- for windows activation. Follow activation steps.  >c. Select `[2] Ohook` \\- for Office download and activation. Then Press `[3] Download Office` \\- and follow hearts on the website to download Office 365. After installation, press `[1] Install Ohook Office Activation`.  8. **Debloat Windows 11 and set optimal configurations: (https://github.com/Raphire/Win11Debloat)**  >a. Open PowerShell as administrator and enter: `& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm \"https://debloat.raphi.re/\")))`  >b. Select `(2) Custom mode` \\- press again `(2) Remove default` selection of bloatware apps, as well as mail & calendar apps, developer apps and gaming apps.  >c. Follow further steps onto your consideration. I click \"yes\" to 90% of proposed changes.  9. **Configure Windows Defender for optimal security:**  >a. Download `ConfigureDefender.exe` from [https://github.com/AndyFul/ConfigureDefender](https://github.com/AndyFul/ConfigureDefender)  >b. Launch ConfigureDefender and press `HIGH`.  >c. Close the app and you can now remove it.  10. **Install UniGetUI and reinstall all the apps**  11. **(Optional) Install some other cool apps:**  >a. Unchecky - when installing apps auto de-selects bloatware install options.  >b. Revo Uninstaller - when removing apps cleanups all residuals like registry keys and temp files.  >c. 7-Zip - file archiver  >d. VLC - media player (or more advanced: MPC-BE)  >e. qBittorrent - torrent client  >f. SumatraPDF - lightweight file reader  >g. Notepad++ - advanced text editor  >h.

If you have legal paper, you will be able to save those money in AUD instead.  Regarding tax, the rate is 5% for remittance. You can provide your PAN to the bank and they will deduct it. The international companies are not registered here so it can't be done in the name of those companies though. I suggest you to visit Nabil/Laxmi/Global IME etc to proceed further.|||from which platform did you find this remote job?|||Is it something with the big truck company?

Otherwise youd be paying 30-39 percent tax (with dollar payments you will pay 5% and its relatively straightforward - bank auto-deducts the 5% TDS and pays to IRD.

Her innocent voice trying to mask her narcissism. Like girl, take a back seat. Right now people, children HAVE DIED for a cause. You cannot make this about you and your character defense right now. I think she says in her video that she was never in a power to do anything about corruption. But girl you have money, and privilege. What did you do with that? Anything altruistic? Did you stand up for what is moral with your immense influence? If brands can pay you THAT much allegedly then why did you not use your voice and influence for doing good? Instead you got to flaunt your husband's house, his cars, the jewels he gifts for you and the trips you guys take? I think it's just about being moral and using your influence to do some good not just rub it in peoples faces that you married rich. Girl, the world does not revolve around you. And if you are going to be a public figure and you cannot hear the people out? Like disabling comments and just giving speeches? Like girl.... excel sheets ko screenshots is not \"proof\".  And in the age of AI, very easy to fake any documents. I have a very hard time believing anything you say in that childish self victimizing voice. You are unbearable.

I used to follow her until like 2020 but after that I unfollowed her, not hating on her but just by own preference.  I think most of the hate and propaganda originated from this frustrated and jealous online audience and Sisan fanboys because of her successful educational, professional career and being married to a rich dude, which is not a crime. Every one of you would do the same, no doubt.  And all the theories, clips that I saw before Sept 8 was just some hit piece with no actual truth or evidence behind any of that, which was very easy to spread especially during that frustrated time and she's very popular.  I still don't follow her but I chose to see facts and evidences before making narratives and ruining somebody's life.   And before you internet warriors come after me, I'd like to say I was also in the protest Sept 8 in the frontline and our fight wasn't against her but against the actual corrupt leaders.",

But there are still people who are supporting her, because sabai kura easily trust garna mildaina especially when it's mostly allegations. Gossips lai prove garna ni sakinna. Pls read until the end.  So, recently Tiktok ma ekjana le Shrinkhala ra Shambhav ko total 9 jana ko group le Shey phoksundo ma Army ko helicopter bata 'rescue' ko naam lidai misuse gareko witness gareko bhanyo. They said majjale ramairako, hasirako thyo re yo 9 jana ko group, ani helicopter aayera lagyo re. News portals ma ni news bhetincha rescue gareko bhanera. Malai chai valid proof nai chahirathyo pattyauna. Given how she has been portraying herself through social media and PR videos, it was time we start questioning their misuse of power.   I wanted to see pictures of that 'rescue' operation. Having some free time, I did some internet digging and found a facebook page of Nepal Army posted on October 2023. It exactly matches the news portals and tiktok user's claim, plus Shrinkhala‚Äôs story(it's on her story highlights). Yes, Summit air use gareko vlog cha, but my guess is ktm to dolpa jana lai use gareko ho, not return to ktm.   Picture: collage of the picture on fb page of Nepal army, then Shrinkhala‚Äôs group of 9 people who went to Shey Phoksundo. Luga haru milcha, anuhar ni milcha. You can see that it's the same group.   This really shows how much power is misused in Nepal and the recent nepo-kids trend was helpful to shed light on this. I am also against all the opportunists who posted against their exes to gain relevancy during vulnerable times. Aba chahi we should think twice before blindly following social media figures.",

Despite public outrage and repeated promises, there has been no accountability, no closure, and no identified perpetrator. We cannot allow this case to be forgotten or buried in the past. Every life matters, and no one especially a child deserves to suffer such unimaginable violence. It is deeply troubling that systemic negligence, mishandled evidence, and lack of urgency have left this case unresolved. We must stand together and demand a transparent, thorough investigation. We must hold institutions accountable and ensure that no other family is forced to endure the same pain and silence.  Let us honor Nirmala‚Äôs memory not with silence, but with action.

I used to be in a school Where the mentioned below stuff was done; - if you come to school late, first uniharu stick le Hanne and then shoe nikali nangai khutta class Ma basaune.. - for big nails, again some slaps but Infront of everyone in the line of assembly..the punishment was changed to literally kapada kholera nuhauna (bathing) Garna lagaune (it was so fucking traumatic & lot of students cried during this)  Then there was a English ma'am(who was also our class main head) jasle timilai pronounce Garna kahile class Ma sikaudaina Tara ma'am Le sabai Lai qns sodhda jaslai ramrari pronounce garna aaudaina Thiyo teslai literally 20 stick kutne (many times even blood comes from everyone) And if you can't answer the question: taba timilai naked garne and beat you 10 sticks even after that.. sometimes she changes the punishment to toilet Ma hamilai thunne for the whole time..   Also she crossed the line once when she asked the fucking class monitor or teacher asslicker to write down the name of who are noising the class when teacher doesn't come (the class monitor writes 98% of students name besides them) and all received punishment of naked Infront of girls and one guy wasn't even wearing a underwear...he was totally traumatized that day and girls were also naked Infront of us.. It was so sad and traumatizing but then the class monitor who was a girl and a boy and were both topper enjoyed doin this to us..  there are many other punishments that were given to us that time when we were  in class 1-4 (but I don't wanna mention those dark punishments)...it was more harsh for seniors...I quit that school after class 4 and many students were in the same year..|||Bro mc tyo school ma ffs im still so salty. First school when i was in 2 3 grade they would parade naked kids around school for not doing hw. mostly guys being in drawer or kattu never happened to me but i remember even girls got dhamkis like shirt nikaldinchu type from female teachers. Arko school ma i was made to squat and be a chicken for not remembering an answer or something idk even got threats to be stripped for it, this was in grade 6. I remember vividly since its been so long but being paraded around school naked was normal. i think i experienced this from when i was in ukg to class 5. Mostly boys but even young girls would be stripped in summies huncha ta if they have it on but in the kti ko case it was mostly class ma dhamki dine or class ma matra utryaune, while the boys would be taken to lower classes.|||We need to bring back corporal punishment.

What the man didn‚Äôt do or didn‚Äôt say. 2. What people expected him to do.  The man himself has said enough in his posts.   It‚Äôs what, he DIDN‚ÄôT do that impresses me the most about him. Saying ‚ÄúNo‚Äù is harder than saying ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, when everyone wanted him to say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.  (Think about this.)  He put out only a couple of posts, which I think served as guide posts during the revolution.   1. He was the first widely known public figure (that I know) who defined who Gen Z was and gave his support to the protest. 2. When the tempo rose, he clarified that Gen Z should lead, he accepted Sushila even when all of his cultists were going crazy about making him the interim PM.  Removing himself from the picture, brought focus back on the revolution and the task ahead, rather than turn the confusion situation, even more confusing with a popularity contest as a side gig.   There is a lot of things to think about and I think in time we can all make sense of it all.   That‚Äôs my two paisa about him.|||Leading KTM municipality vs leading the nation are totally different. The followers of Balen urging and rushing him to lead 'right now' and come out by 2PM are the same people who will criticize him within one year if he were to be them PM someday. They don't have patience and want to see changes immediately.  Personally, I would like to see him running in the upcoming election as deputy/vice roles first and not immediate PM role...assuming how parties will be formed and if there are any good lead independent candidate who will run with him. He's one of those few worthy to be PM but this is not his peak yet. He just became a mayor like 3 years ago and he still has a lot to show to the general public. If and when he wins to the election, it will be his peak and he has high chances of being a two term PM...assuming two term limit will be in place hopefully. Time will tell.|||GenZ aren't immune to celeb worship culture.|||Hami Nepal has already stated it was part of a plan and they want balen for 5 years. So did they fight for the nation or for the balen is the real question? Why are they biased for balen only and not for other groups of good people?|||About your 2nd picture.  Yes it is definitely an opportunistic behaviour by balen. But how is this behaviour wrong and how is taking over PM position now and securing interim govt now and not taking part in politics for next 5 years do any good to the country.    He is practicing patience to achieve the goal he desires and what people actually wants from a young leader like him. Look throughout the history of world politics, paitence has always been the key factor to shape the world politics.|||Having trusted by many even me,In the moment of national threat, he could do nothing. That‚Äôs the reason I doubt him.  i think he is not completely responsible for being the Prime Minister. Sure, he is a great person. He‚Äôs doing such a great thing in the valley, but being a Prime Minister is very responsible post, his way up talking to seniors, saying I will put fire to SinghaDurbar, I will bury everyone if you‚Äôre in tudinkhel, getting carried away by emotions, being Prime Minister means you should not be carried away by any emotions and none of the factors should affect your judgment which you believe to be true and is lawful, Hopefully he will make such changes and we can finally see him in the top, as much as I want him to be the Prime Minister I do think he is inexperienced and immature in this field,|||We are so far behind that criticizing political leader sounds like a hater.

For the past decade, the corrupted 3 have been playing nothing but tato aloo with us so its natural to be sticking nail to current situation. Give it some time and our voices will get echoed.|||If there‚Äôs one thing old political leaders never learned, it was how to handle criticism. The moment anyone spoke up, they tried to shut it down and let‚Äôs not even start on the behavior of their hardcore supporters(jholey as we call them).  Even leaders like Balen need to address this with their own supporters, as do all the new representatives entering the upcoming elections. They must say publicly that they welcome criticism, will reflect on it, and use it as a tool for improvement. Leaders should make it clear to their base: don‚Äôt bully or silence people for simply asking questions or raising concerns. Do not perform character assassination against someone just for criticizing. After all, in a democracy, freedom of speech is our right.  At the same time, we the general public also carry responsibility. We need to recognize the difference between constructive criticism and defamation. What we must not do is fall for propaganda, spread rumors, or engage in baseless character assassination.  And if we realize that our criticism or questioning was wrong, we should have the courage to apologize in the same way we raised the question. After all, apologizing will never make you small. It‚Äôs just a simple five letter word: ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù A word that can and should be spoken from both sides.|||Just because you‚Äôre against the system, doesn‚Äôt make you Balen-Supporters. Balen has no experience. Balen should wait and gain some experience. Criticism is a backbone of democracy and one must welcome it.|||EXACTLY. They lack this ability to critically analyse any action of any leader. Like no one is perfect and no one is a good. Let's be honest. Let's criticize people for their actions. People should be held accountable for their actions. Most importantly, leaders who run our nation. If we don't point out their wrongdoings, will they ever stop? Nepalese have such a bheda mindset, istg. Let's be more aware and let's know how to discern leaders and their actions.   By criticizing these leaders, we aren't hating on them. We're trying to bring awareness so that they won't repeat the same thing again and can do things better for the country.|||They need to be aware party KO jhole become jhole because they were andabhakt of party leader ( just like they are blind follower of balen rn)|||I think holding politicians accountable is crucial.

I see people thanking Balen for this movement and saying he was the reason this movement happened and succeeded and all after Sushila Karki became interim PM, and this made me very sad for actual people who started the movement and also faced the consequences and this was even more big realization for me for how blind youth and supporters these days are and this concerns me even more for future|||Tbh he‚Äôs not fitted for PM cause look at him he have no quality of a good leader specially thinking about diplomacy, even small things makes him anguish ani overconfident cause our country is small ani not teti powerful pani people need to fact check yetikai hype ma balen balen vnnerw huni kei hunnw , a single person cant change country ko face nai, a leader should be someone who equally can tackle every obstacle in a subtle way yetikai sano kura ma ni raged huni country lai ni risk ma leraunxa kya , i am not saying he‚Äôs not a good leader he indeed is terw just not fitted for PM.

This is what I‚Äôve been saying for some time. Like the post says, I‚Äôve also been labeled as a party ko jhole and what not. Even here in this sub, people have called me jhole lol just because I questioned him.  I am a Balen supporter. I supported him and did my part by sharing about his campaign on social media and making everyone aware about it. And I was super happy when he won, I still am. But I‚Äôve been criticizing him on various points that I find valid. The top one is communication.  During the election, he constantly criticized Bidya Sundar (the previous mayor) for not communicating publicly. He even said that once he became mayor, he wouldn‚Äôt be like that and would stay in constant touch. He proposed starting a ‚ÄòMayor with the Public‚Äô TV program and even set aside a budget for it, but nothing has happened. He hasn‚Äôt given a single interview.  And then come his jhole supporters who always argue with the same line: ‚ÄòPailai kei chaieko ho.‚Äô With that logic, we should never question anyone. Just look at how Balen has become now, he just posts one-sided, no-context Facebook statuses and nothing else.|||Balen is a hypocrite in my opinion, like he encouraged the protest and even promised to provide a safe and secure environment for the protest but when things turned south he vanished like horn from a donkeys head|||Finally someone spoke about this, belun has literally become a god complex among some people out there, which is kinda concerning, the only time he speaks is to not let his adhabhatka interfere in every other stuff out there.

I personally don't think he has the temperament (though if there's a choice between any big parties' leader and Balen, I'd choose Balen every time).|||Aru kura thik ho, but can‚Äôt say he abandoned.

In Nepal, many people tend to follow leaders without much critical thought, even when those leaders don‚Äôt necessarily act in their favor. Unfortunately, this habit seems to persist across generations. If the younger generation continues with the same mindset, there‚Äôs a real risk that the country could end up facing the same challenges in the future that we are experiencing today.|||You can make your own assumptions and narratives. If Balen had taken the post of PM, you would have said that he is opportunistic, that he enraged protestors just to get the position. I saw somewhere on Facebook, even before Balen‚Äôs official post on sushila karki that balen played dirty game for the sake of pm position. As far as I know, Balen is a farsighted person. He only comes forward when he feels fully prepared.|||That's my whole point, but again..vanepachi manche lai jholey nai lagcha. üòÖ Guy's, learn to ask questions yourself too.

He is still better than most of the people there. Whatever he does, he has never done anything wrong. Stop pretending to be so-called critics for useless reasons. What is your academic background, and what makes you think that way? Have you ever felt the difference between past and present Kathmandu? I have a friend from the core area of Kathmandu, do you know what his opinion about Balen Shah is? No!  Even Harka Sampang is a very good person. Moreover, Sagar Dhakal‚Äôs brother has been working actively to eradicate the dictatorship of these political parties. Maybe your parents are bootlicking those rotten political parties, so you only see what Balen has never done and will never do. Just because he supported the movement does not mean he said he wants to become prime minister. You must understand that he posts only a few things because his words are weapons. One word from him has many consequences in such a movement. He is very clever and very wise; unlike Harka Sampang, though I like Harka as a person.

If Balen had come out saying he‚Äôs ready to lead, a lot of people would‚Äôve jumped in claiming he planned the whole movement and just used Gen Z for his own benefit. That‚Äôs probably why in his statements, he keeps stressing that this is Gen Z‚Äôs movement and that the government will be formed by them. imo, staying out of it was the smartest move he could have made.  I‚Äôm all for questioning and criticizing leaders. I agree that its a problem if you dont want to do it.

You just need to nudge them, give them support they will do their good vs evil thing which any human will do.

This has been ongoing for more than two decades. Behind the few visible figures, there are countless others who have either assisted them or benefitted through their association‚Äîranging from major brands in Nepal to traders. For example, Sher Bahadur Deuba‚Äôs son and his sanitary pad importing company stand as an illustration.  They have institutionalized corruption by appointing foreign ambassadors based on party loyalty and financial gains, extending even to the transfer of bureaucrats to preferred locations in exchange for bribes and other undue benefits. The problem is not limited to the political system alone; bureaucrats, too, require checks and balances. A mechanism must be established to regulate the power of bureaucrats over politicians. Since bureaucrats are permanent stakeholders, their influence is even greater. One effective way to mitigate this is to appoint domain experts as ministers‚Äîfor instance, a professional civil engineer as a minister cannot be misled about the cost estimates of a construction project.  There remains much to be done. Moreover, these political parties will attempt to form alliances before elections, bringing forward the same candidates and restoring the same exploitative system. Therefore, the first and most meaningful reform must be a change in the electoral process, with the inclusion of a ‚ÄúNOTA‚Äù (None of the Above) option.  Further accountability can be ensured by eliminating political appointments to certain positions. At present, even temporary (karar) appointments are made based on party affiliation rather than merit. As a result, even highly qualified experts are compelled to seek political approval. The recent appointments of Vice-Chancellors at B.P. Koirala Institute in Dharan and Gangalal Hospital are prime examples.  In addition to these issues, several other structural flaws persist.

            "body": "I‚Äôm from Sri Lanka. I lived through our 2022 Aragalaya. People around the world respected us because we fought the system without destroying our own country.  At Galle Face, we protested for 124 days straight. Over 100,000 people joined at times. But here‚Äôs what made it different:  We camped peacefully on Galle Face Green. There were kitchens feeding thousands, medical centers to help anyone sick or injured, book libraries, free internet, and even coffee corners. We built a community, not chaos.  We sang songs, danced, made art, and watch movies ‚Äî yet we never destroyed property. Some critics complained we were ‚Äútoo playful,‚Äù but that didn‚Äôt stop us from being fair, disciplined, and organized.  When we finally entered the President‚Äôs House, we didn‚Äôt loot. Not a single priceless portrait worth millions was stolen. Not a single fire was set. People laughed, swam, sang ‚Äî but respected the place because it belonged to the people.  Even when ministers‚Äô thugs attacked us, the world saw who was violent and who wasn‚Äôt. That moral high ground is what gave us victory.   Now, I look at Nepal and I see motorbikes burned, parliament on fire, leaders‚Äô houses torched. Brothers, ask yourselves: is that really a fight for justice‚Äîor are you burning your own tax money, your own people‚Äôs livelihoods?  Because here‚Äôs the bitter truth:  The cost of every destroyed building, every burned vehicle, will come back to you in higher taxes, worse inflation, more suffering.  If you destroy what belongs to the people, the world will stop listening to your message and only see the flames.  Today you may cheer, but tomorrow you‚Äôll be paying for the very damage you caused.   Please think back. Don‚Äôt let your anger blind you. Sri Lanka proved you can bring down corrupt leaders without burning your country. Hold on to your moral strength. Don‚Äôt make your children pay for your rage.  From one struggling nation to another: don‚Äôt turn your fight for freedom into self-destruction.",

Somehow they are along fighting terrorism - somehow Nepal is taking away their land - somehow Bangladeshi immigration is capturing Indians and turning them into radical muslims - somehow China is trying to wage a war on them - somehow US is trying to destroy them as US is jealous that India might beat them in the World Economy and take place with China.  Although it makes sense from Indian point of view, India need to instill hatred for all the other countries for their own government to sustain. India would have easily and happily capture Nepal - if we weren't close to China.  The amount of hatred Indians have for themselves is surmount. So, they're sharing it to everyone. Current BJP government thrives due to public anger.  Everyone have their own agenda - but the level Indian media shows is really destructive in the longer run. It's just like Trump administration currently is for the US - they'll face the consequences 2 generations from now on.|||It's not for you people, it's for us. He and his Left ecosystem are mostly of foreign payroll trying to create instability in India for a long time now. People here want a regime change with the USA at the helm of mostly every other instability. It's wider Geopolitics anyway. China is the new rival of the West with an enormous amount of resource. And India is too big and diverse of a country to make it fall with a simple violent protest like Nepal or Sri Lanka or Bangladesh (no offence intended here, I am just comparing the size and population of respective countries. I strongly believe in Nepal-India ties as we all are one people with similar religion, culture and people to people relations).   Our battleground is different - Caste Census, Nation wide NRC and SIR, Regional instability like we recently saw the condition of Manipur which again was a made up conflict, Historical grievances like Hindu temple destruction by Islamic invaders and reclaiming process, Building up of Civilisational ethos to counter Communist-Jihadi nexus, resisting Pakistan project in the garb of Khalistan Movement that is trying to reduce us and Effectively checking illegal infiltration.   Our leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi has openly asked for Western intervention in Bharat, Regime change mastermind Soros has openly declared $1 billion for regime change in Bharat and usual arm-twisting in the name of Trade War with USA is another topic.

India has free-speech protection for their media. 2. This means, no regulation of media is allowed. 3. Govt has tried to stop fake news by bringing laws multiple times, but people protest against it 4. This is because of fear of censorship which India experienced during \"Emergency\" imposed by Indira Gandhi  in 1975. 5. Media are for-profit organization who earn from views. 6. In todays age, clickbait is the way to get most views. And thus all media has gone to the lowest level to get clicks. 7. News is now 24 hours business. There are not that much interesting news to keep people engaged. So, once again the quality drops. 8. The few good media that doesn't involve in this get ignored by everyone because they dont get enough clicks.  During censorship era, Indian govt used to force media to remove articles they dont like. And some newspapers used to still print with blank sections to let people know they are being forced to remove content.  https://preview.redd.it/dsyvpa5tq4pf1.png?width=1539&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fb357bc6b522a5c5ad23e2ec4b407fdeccefd1a|||They are just shit scared that a revolution like ours might happen in their country as well against BJP.

Honestly, this feels like a really positive shift bringing in professionals and independents instead of just party loyalists. What do you all think? Could this actually improve governance?",

But moreover, It was romanticized to burn parliament (Seeing the Indonesia and Bangladesh, people wanted to vandalize the parliament on first day).

For instance, people said that some organized bands/crime was taking place respectively were active; this seems to make sense if we look at what happened (beating people, setting things on fire after taking TV monitors etc...). Then there is the issue of the military shooting eagerly at people who were no threat at all - a good example is the video of a car where people walked to that car, assuming the cops could help them, and then suddenly someone from inside the car shooting one guy dead, then driving off. That is very strange - why did they kill someone there? And who were the killers? There are other videos showing strange things. Then there was pillaging and theft - some may have been from individuals who just seized an opportunity, but there are still question marks about that; most genuine protesters don't have as an objective to steal stuff. This all has to be investigated - unfortunately I do not trust any official from Nepal to make a genuine investigation here. It needs external people who are not involved on either side, perhaps investigators from Brazil, Switzerland and Canada; these should be impartial enough.  With 71 people dead, this can not be explained via \"all accidents\".

It's definitely CIA and Rajabadi pushing him and supporting him. No common man can do this.¬†|||Kaha vanyo ? Any source.|||Agree!|||I think it is now time for him to reflect on what has happened, the difficult role he played in this fiasco and take a break for himself , for his mental health and for the sake of the leadership which he and his team ‚Äúscrambled‚Äù at the last hour. People can disagree with his role but it is undeniably true that he became a face of representation of the ‚ÄúGen Z‚Äù (aba sabai gen z le choose gare or not is a different debate) at a time when army was constantly asking for us to be unified and bring forth a representative at such a volatile situation. Thankfully the situation solved. But after the negotiations with The President and the subsequent outcomes of the negotiations, he should have taken a back seat and let the person intended to run the position do their work( at the end of the day, us ‚ÄúGen Z‚Äù haru le nai choose garya hola ni ta Sushila Shreeman lai?) And I don‚Äôt get his afu chai cabinet ma na basne tara aile aba afu bina ko cabinet ma k hunxa sabai kura afu bata jawos bhanne expectations rakheko dekhda chai I felt he was either arrogant or naive when it comes to governance and how power plays when it comes to running a literal government. I think it would be best for him and his team to take a rest and REFLECT and let the experts do their thing( aba haina bhsne ki ta afai cabinet ma basnu thik hola)   Regarding the family‚Äôs demands, I won‚Äôt be so quick to comment on it as it as very sensitive issue for them and I don‚Äôt think this interim govt  would be so unkind to the families like the past (party kongovts would be). It‚Äôs only been  2 days that the govt has been in place, I think his maturity would be reflected if he supports the govt in finalizing the cabinet first and letting the administration come to its daily routine. And then u can always raise the family‚Äôs issue. We got to prioritize the country‚Äôs wellbeing before anything( sounds very insensitive and heartless but that‚Äôs the reality)   At the end of the day, desh sabai kai ho, gen z, gen x, millennials, boomers what not. Even the parties cannot be excluded in the long run. That is our democracy‚Äôs reality. I think it would be in everyone interest to think rationally and not emotionally. Because I don‚Äôt think govts around the world are run by emotions. Let‚Äôs hope we get the election and a safe landing from this situation.

But the constitution needs to be amended.|||I have been saying and posting about this since yesterday, there was perfectly constitutional way to handle this, sushila karki could have been made the incharge of a power anti-corruption body, and interim- PM could have been chosen from inside the parliament. There are others in the parliament outside of the 3 parties, why wasnt a single MP considered for this, the only mandate the PM would have is that of a holding an election. Why put shushila karki???just because some youtuber with a law degree suggested it and we had a discord poll was no reason to derail from the constitution. This cost of this derailment could be so heavy on us. Frankly speaking I think this happened because Balen didn't want it to happen. He feared and didn't take the leadership because if he can't deliver, his popularity will nose dive, and he feared if a sitting MP even outside of the 3 party were elected interim PM the very fact that they saved this train-wreck of a nation would mean that that interim PMs popularity would rise and would seriously challenge his chances in the next election.

I recently lived in a Hacker House in Dubai and it was an amazing experience for focused collaboration, learning, and launching projects. I‚Äôm curious if something similar could work in Kathmandu.  What is a Hacker House?  * A short-term shared space for builders: founders, devs, designers, students, creators. * Focused on collaboration, project sprints, workshops, and community events (typically 4‚Äì8 weeks).  Why Kathmandu?   There‚Äôs a growing tech and student scene here, and I think a hacker house could help bring people together to build and share knowledge.  Questions for you all:  1. Do you think Kathmandu would benefit from a hacker house? 2. What features would matter most (workspace, internet, events, mentorship, hardware lab, etc.)? 3. Have you seen/experienced something like this elsewhere?     üëâ If enough people are curious, maybe we can even do a small meetup to discuss further.  Would love to hear your thoughts üôè",

Personally, I haven‚Äôt even taken my voter ID yet because of the failures of past politicians, but now it feels more important than ever.  üëâ Sacrificing lives and protesting on the streets is not the only responsibility of Gen Z or the younger generation. Our responsibility now is to hold this new leadership accountable. If **Sushila Karki** and his team fail to deliver as we dream, the next protest is already waiting ahead.  üëâ We also need to boycott the old corrupt parties‚Äî**Nepali Congress, UML, and Maoist Centre**. Let‚Äôs not allow our families, especially elder voters, to be misled into voting for the same old faces again. It‚Äôs our duty to create awareness in our homes and communities.  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Most importantly**: there must be an investigation into every politician since **2046 BS**. Nepal needs money for growth and development, and the billions looted from the people should be recovered from them. We all know that a normal officer-level government employee cannot even build a proper first-floor house from their entire lifetime salary. So how did these corrupt leaders and officials build mansions, buy land, and amass wealth? The answer is clear: corruption.  ‚úÖ **Our Dream, Our Demand ‚Äî No Barriers for Sushila Karki:**  * Election within **6 months** * **Investigation** on each and every politician since **2046 BS** * Recovery of looted money for Nepal‚Äôs growth and future  And for the so-called ‚Äúclean‚Äù leaders like **Gagan Thapa** and others‚Äîdon‚Äôt forget that during their tenure, they remained silent when the people needed them most.

Explain what happened, why we protested, and what has to be different. 2. **Educate people**¬†Teach them to see past ‚Äúfree petrol‚Äù or ‚Äúmasu-bhat‚Äù or \"raksi\", which are just bribes. Promises without accountability are nothing. 3. **Expose corruption**¬†Collect and share real evidence of wrongdoings: misuse of funds, nepotism, failure in public services. If student union leaders or local party people are complicit, record them. Digital evidence, social media posts ‚Äî shame them publicly if they support corrupt leaders. 4. **Demand integrity**¬†Not just because someone says ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring change,‚Äù but because they have a track record, hands clean, transparency, accountability. 5. **Mobilize every generation**¬†Gen Z started this. But we can‚Äôt do it alone. Every Nepali has a role ‚Äî old, young, rural, urban. Everyone deserves a better Nepal.  # Why this matters  * Because now, the¬†*future of Nepal*¬†is in our hands ‚Äî if we choose wisely. * Because allowing corrupt, short-term ‚Äúhelpers‚Äù will only repeat the same cycle. * Because this six-month window is a rare opportunity: the ruling class has to prove themselves before elections.

You need the skills to talk to customers, handle conflict, and inspire a team. \t‚Ä¢\tEffort multiplies both.

Whenever you avoid the call, the pitch, or the awkward conversation because it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot your thing,‚Äù that‚Äôs a signal your emotional intelligence needs reps just as much as your coding skills do.

Delete all paritions (except data disk in step 2), so that all space is unallocated. Select this unallocated partition as installation target.  6. **(Optional) If stuck on screen \"Oops, you' ve lost internet connection\".** On this screen or on country selection screen:  >Open cmd with Shift + F10 and type `OOBE\\BYPASSNRO.`  >Your computer will restart and now you will have the \"I don't have Internet\" option.  7. **After windows installation, permanently activate Windows 11 and Microsoft Office 365:(https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts)**  >a. Open PowerShell as administrator and enter: `irm` [`https://get.activated.win`](https://get.activated.win) `| iex`  >b. Select `[1] HWID` \\- for windows activation. Follow activation steps.  >c. Select `[2] Ohook` \\- for Office download and activation. Then Press `[3] Download Office` \\- and follow hearts on the website to download Office 365. After installation, press `[1] Install Ohook Office Activation`.  8. **Debloat Windows 11 and set optimal configurations: (https://github.com/Raphire/Win11Debloat)**  >a. Open PowerShell as administrator and enter: `& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm \"https://debloat.raphi.re/\")))`  >b.

Follow further steps onto your consideration. I click \"yes\" to 90% of proposed changes.  9. **Configure Windows Defender for optimal security:**  >a. Download `ConfigureDefender.exe` from [https://github.com/AndyFul/ConfigureDefender](https://github.com/AndyFul/ConfigureDefender)  >b. Launch ConfigureDefender and press `HIGH`.  >c. Close the app and you can now remove it.  10. **Install UniGetUI and reinstall all the apps**  11. **(Optional) Install some other cool apps:**  >a. Unchecky - when installing apps auto de-selects bloatware install options.  >b. Revo Uninstaller - when removing apps cleanups all residuals like registry keys and temp files.  >c. 7-Zip - file archiver  >d.

            "body": "I keep seeing a lot of posts and comments on social media calling for the immediate dissolution of parliament. I get where the frustration is coming from ‚Äî people are tired of the same old faces, and the mood is ‚Äúthrow them all out.‚Äù But here‚Äôs the problem: our constitution doesn‚Äôt actually allow that in the current context.  Here‚Äôs why:  1. Parliamentary System 101 Nepal runs under a parliamentary system, not a presidential one. This means the government (Prime Minister + Council of Ministers) is accountable to parliament, and parliament itself is the elected body representing the people. You can‚Äôt just dissolve it like a Facebook group ‚Äî there are constitutional conditions.   2. When Can Parliament Be Dissolved? The 2015 Constitution (Article 76 & related provisions) says dissolution can only happen if:  A Prime Minister can‚Äôt be appointed (no majority, no coalition, no consensus).  The appointed PM fails to win a vote of confidence.  After exhausting all options, parliament can‚Äôt form a government.     Basically: Dissolution is the last resort, only when it‚Äôs impossible to form a government.  3. What About Now? Right now, even if the sitting PM has resigned, parliament still exists and can elect or endorse a new PM or interim government. Until those options are fully tested and fail, dissolution is unconstitutional.   4. Why Keeping Parliament Matters Even if people hate the current MPs, they were legitimately elected. Throwing them out without due process creates a vacuum, which risks the army or monarchy stepping in under the pretext of ‚Äústability.‚Äù That‚Äôs a bigger danger than keeping an unpopular parliament as a placeholder until elections.   5. The Real Reform Instead of chanting ‚Äúdissolve parliament,‚Äù the smarter demand is to:  Force a fixed election date within a short timeline.  Put strict limits on the interim government‚Äôs powers.  Demand transparency and monitoring during the transition.   That way, people‚Äôs anger translates into systemic reform instead of an unconstitutional shortcut that could backfire badly.   TL;DR: The constitution doesn‚Äôt allow dissolving parliament just because we‚Äôre angry. Dissolution only happens if no government can be formed. Right now, parliament has to remain until elections are formally called ‚Äî otherwise, we risk a dangerous power vacuum.",

The constitution does not allow Sushila Karki to be the interim PM. It does not allow a newer election to be announced without the current parliament being dissolved.   One way is to make the current parliament members commit to make themselves dissolved. But you are asking the corrupt people to do the moral thing here.   There is no way forward with the current limitation of the constitutional framework.

            "heading": "The Shrinkhala Khatiwada I knew at Harvard",
            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada‚Äôs classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.¬†  We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking‚Äìmuch to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in¬† Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate -¬†the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala‚Äôs approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.¬†  Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn‚Äôt mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‚Äòhelp‚Äô. One time, she even said airily, ‚ÄúI wash my own dishes, you know.‚Äù She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala‚Äìa beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth‚Äìlingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don‚Äôt intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‚Äònepo babies‚Äô who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).¬†  Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It‚Äôs a troubling idea to think that despite what‚Äôs happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

Sisan literally dodged a  bullet.. all thanks to her greed though..|||She didn't get any fucking scholarship from the Nepali government. She was funded by her corrupt father.|||Wish we had more tea like this on all nepo babies.||| Damn I strictly feel its true|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn‚Äôt some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake ‚Äúbeauty with brains‚Äù narrative. Do you guys remember Niti‚Äôs big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let‚Äôs not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala‚Äôs prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it‚Äôs her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let‚Äôs be real- Sisan wasn‚Äôt perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they‚Äôd known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn‚Äôt even exist. This just proves it- they weren‚Äôt just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can‚Äôt just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala‚Äôs career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav‚Äôs narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What‚Äôs the lesson we can learn from here ?

Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don‚Äôt even make sense to begin with. Don‚Äôt know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don‚Äôt even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It‚Äôs so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It‚Äôs astounding what the world has come to and it‚Äôs deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can‚Äôt be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn‚Äôt she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It‚Äôs better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has.

The beinfit is probably meant for the MPs who had to move temprorarily to the capital or who didn't have their own residence. Iirc, they had to manually opt in to get that added housing allowance. When the news published, her father's reaction was something along the line of \"I didn't know, I was getting it. I am happy to return it.\"  Question for her, how come you dont know the source of wealth and your parent's ethics?

These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!! And the way she's silent when the country is bleeding says alottt too!!!!!!  And about the Nepal's government scholarship for harvard,this is not true, she is telling an entire different story about harvard scholarsip & how she paid fees there. She said she got 30% scholarship at harvard and the remaining 70% is paid through her brand endorsements money as she is brand ambassador to few company. We didnt buy that story, she tried hardest to sell it though and still fools people with this shitty madeup script about harvard's 30% scholarship & 70% funding through brand endorsement's money lmao.

They will play big roles in the coming days|||I believe Sagar Dhakal has the vision, insight, and capability to truly serve the nation.  But too often, we mistake leadership for fame. In this election, let‚Äôs make one thing clear: we‚Äôre not choosing a celebrity , we‚Äôre choosing a public servant. We put politicians on pedestals, treat them like idols, and forget they‚Äôre meant to serve the people, not bask in admiration. That kind of blind loyalty is dangerous. It inflates egos, distorts priorities, and shifts the focus from the country to the individual.  Real leadership isn‚Äôt about charisma, party labels, or personality cults. It‚Äôs about what leaders actually do and how they strengthen communities, protect rights, and build a better future. That‚Äôs the standard that matters.  Holding leaders accountable isn‚Äôt disloyal; it‚Äôs democracy. We should celebrate when they get it right, and we should challenge them when they don‚Äôt.  That means asking harder questions, doing our own research, and refusing to follow blindly. Every leader should be held to the same measure: What are you doing for the people, and what are you building for the future?  The power has never rested with them alone. It rests with us, and it always will.|||Finally someone said it . Yes please he should stand in six months and win|||Sagar actually knows what he is going to do . I am gonna be his jholey for coming election.|||Well I do believe that now whoever comes in power knows the consequences if they do something for their personal gain .But it's not a easy task to develop a nation.All the citizens should work for it too.This generation has more sacrifices to make for the upcoming generations to have a better future.|||Hope he becomes the \"Oxford ma padheko PM\" that he dreamed.|||He makes a great point. It is time to take this opportunity and ensure no other nepali have to get back to the street  just to demand a fair county. I wish Sagar all the best. I am sure young freedom fighters including Sher Bahadur started with a good intent. We need to have a strong mechanism against corruption and extremely strict laws to punish corruption and violence.

Most probably don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs going on. This is not meant to offend you. Nepal for most people here is like a sleepy little afterthought of a country. We are very ignorant that way.   We hope all ends well for Nepal and it gets on with human development and rising out of corruption and poverty. You guys need to understand that you are fighting base human nature when trying to bring about change through revolution. That will take a lot of sacrifice. But you guys already know that and have a turbulent history to learn from.  Politics is a game of cloaks and daggers. Long, hard road ahead. Saying that, our media is pure unadulterated trash, agreed. Our political class is equivalent to elite level maggots. A lot of Indians who come to your beautiful country are also pure trash, considering the kind of behaviour that they exhibit and are capable of. India is not a perfect country and there exists no such perfect country in the world.  Nepal is connected, literally fused, to India in every which way possible. Don‚Äôt let propaganda steer you in the direction of an uncertain future because of this heated atmosphere. Antagonising your most important and fundamentally existential relationship is only going to make things worse. This is time to let cooler heads prevail. Hope your Army holds it together for you guys, till democracy can take hold again. I‚Äôm certain that will happen.   India and Indians don‚Äôt want to take over your country or use force to fix things there. We have our own issues to take care of. Our political class is probably 100X more corrupt and brazen than yours.   Nepal needs to be preserved at all costs, and that only you guys can do. Maybe you can teach us a thing or two about fixing our country. We sure can do with some awakening of our dormant or even non-existent will to fight injustice as a society.  Nepal‚Äôs loss will never be India‚Äôs gain.|||Reassuring to read many comments here that this person assaulting an Indian journalist is a criminal and ordinary Nepali people don't support him.Accross  the length and breadth of India Nepali people are considered friendly and honest.|||What is this?

            "body": "It‚Äôs been a roller-coaster ride for Rabi.   He started the program¬†Janta Sanga Pradhanmantri. The show became a hit because of his bold questions to Prime Ministers, but he was eventually kicked out by Prachanda. That led him to create¬†Sidha Kura Janta Sanga, which again gained massive popularity as he raised issues about migrant workers in the Gulf, corruption, and public suffering.  To continue, he even renounced his U.S. citizenship since his visa wasn‚Äôt being extended. He started a new journey, but unfortunately, the person who was funding him had been illegally taking money from cooperatives. Now Rabi is the only one facing trial for all cooperative scandals, even though there‚Äôs no actual proof of him being a member, chairman, or loan-taker.  And now, even Insta/TikTok/Reddit one-liner ‚Äúpolitics experts‚Äù are against him. So, in total Congress, UML, Maoists, RPP, journalists, and now even Gen-Z from Discord, Insta, and TikTok.  Jailers fail to control prisons, prisoners escape, and yet people say:¬†‚ÄúRabi le vagayo!‚Äù¬†They joke with things like¬†‚ÄúSet Wet,‚Äù ‚Äúhair gel,‚Äù¬†pretending to be cool.  * He managed to break into mainstream politics as an alternative‚Äîsomething Baburam and Ujjwal dai couldn‚Äôt do because they lacked crowd-pulling power. * He used the votes and seats he earned to give a platform to people like Sumana and Swarnim. * He exposed Nepalese media, their syndicates, narratives, and manipulations. * People hated Arzu, Deuba, and Oli mostly because of the way they treated him. * Many problematic bills were stopped or opposed thanks to his exposure‚Äîlike the one that would‚Äôve made corruption cases expire after 5 years. * He didn‚Äôt compromise, even when accused in the cooperative case, and even when offered the PM seat by Congress. * He stood up against Deuba, Arzu, Oli, and Gagan‚Äîand ended up in jail after the new government formed.  Gen-Z: if you were triggered by ‚Äúnepo kids,‚Äù fine. But remember‚Äîyour parents‚Äô anger and frustration over the injustice done to Rabi was one of the reasons you were even allowed to protest in the first place.  So Gen-Z, it‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt like him. That‚Äôs your choice. But he doesn‚Äôt deserve the hate that comes from your half-baked political knowledge.

I hope his case is heard soon and he‚Äôs proven innocent. Rabi seems much gutsier and stronger than Balen.

Rabi is one among a very fewcandidates whom I really want to give a chance.

Happy birthday Ravi sir, come back clean and prove your haters wrong.|||Rabi is cool ‚Ä¶ he just needs to wait 6 months or whenever the next election and compete with Balen and Sumana for the spot.

Source of information nowadays is RONB, random pages from facebook and Instagram reels for most of the people. And you know how these pages are.

I disliked how GenZ acted with herd mentality on the subject of Rabi Lamichhane. They don't know how easy it is to frame someone and jail someone in Nepal.

That‚Äôs your choice. But he doesn‚Äôt deserve the hate that comes from your half-baked political knowledge. If you can‚Äôt support him, at least ignore him.|||Finally some sensible posts regarding Rabi. Been following Nepali politics for 5 years now and I can say rabi has been the most accountable political leader so far. No matter what allegations you throw at him he has always tried his best to clear them. They first charged cases regarding citizenship and passport, faced them in the court and won. Then cooperative fraud surfaced in the media and has been fighting from the court with not a single day spent in hospital unlike other politicians. The original allegations were cooperative fraud but the allegations lacked evidence and the parliament committee cleared him in the direct involvement in taking loans illegally but suggested he be investigated for using the funds as he was MD in the company the loans were funneled into. He has now ongoing cases of organized crime and money laundering which does not make any sense.   Many people hate him and it seems every genz is following the trend of hating them with absolutely zero fact check and zero knowledge of what was happening in the last few years in Nepali politics. I never take anybody seriously if their political knowledge is limited to \"we should make Balen Shah PM and only Nepal will improve\". Our generation should be thankful to rabi for bringing in people like sumana, swornim, sobita, toshima, chanda, biraj, sishir and several other competent people to politics and parliament. The parliament committee meeting suddenly became important and started gaining public attention. They made amendments, led discussion on different bills and made sure  the bill did not pass unchecked. The parliament felt different and they were vocal about different issues. They raised voices on cooperative frauds, meter-byaji problems, issues related to laghubitta and were vocal on human traffic cases. They were the best opposition the parliament had ever seen even if they were in small numbers. Rabi appeals to certain generation of citizen and gains a lot of votes. But he used his popularity to provide a platform for competent people to come forward and unlike every other political parties leader he seems to let his party members work independently and exercise any freedom. People say RSP is divided and every politician seems to have their own opinion. But isn't that a good sign. At least they are transparent and do not have to please their party leadership.|||honestly you changed my opinion and how you are fighting in comments, i looked more and i think without him, it will be hard to beat those jholey haru. i hope everybody realize this soon.|||You deserve more than1000 upvotes man‚Ä¶ Some rationally thinking person  This new 18/19 yr olds have no clue what a guy this is Unerma xitfut political awareness lyaune nai rabi ko samsaad harle ho‚Ä¶ Aile usaile target gardai xan..

Do you think tetro thulo patrakar didn‚Äôt know about GB? He is selfish and power hunger   Fk him. Put him back to jail|||Sometimes I feel pity on him. Yes he's done bad work but compered to other people it's a very minor one but still gets equal criticism as other chor netas|||I don't think he's a bad person or has bad intentions. But i don't think Rabi has a strong political understanding or the genuine political motivation other than his ego feeding nationalism. Politics is a mechanism that binds together a nation with different group of people. Nepal is a diverse country with different groups of people that think and believe differently. Which is why only a common ideology can bind together this nation - nothing else can do it, impossible. Anti-corruption is not an ideology, ofc everyone wants that but as I said before all diverse groups have different thinking and beliefs and they can contradict with each other. In situation like this, unless you have a really strong political ideology (like religious ideology) that binds together the nation, this nation will never be stable and will always go into conflict.   People like Rabi and Balen thrives in chaos. These people offer fuel for the chaos that people are looking for because people are angry, they are unhappy, there's hatred. But these group of people will change when Rabi and Balen will come into power because there's no way they will be a perfect leader. Even when they come in full power, because of situation of Nepal, they will not be able to deliver as per people's expectations because our society won't reform and we are geographically in complex situation and economically we are poor.   This Gen Z movement has completely lost its meaning. Nepal is heading towards a really dark phase. The andolan itself was full on chaos and anarchy..no agenda, no leader, complete mayhem. This is going to backfire so badly that Nepali people have no idea whats coming for them. Election in 6 months is almost impossible given the situation of institutions and political parties and upcoming conflicts. Things won't be smooth from here. If election doesn't happen in 6 months, then God save us because what will happen might be the end of our nation or Monarchy - those are the only two options besides old political parties taking control.|||Totally agree with you. Honestly, even though Rabi Lamichhane was opportunistic, he used that opportunity to bring in deserving MPs and created a common platform for an alternative power. Compared to the three main traditional leaders, he appeared far better, and I won‚Äôt forget his positive contributions.  After Balen won, when Rabi dai stepped in, I was a bit worried he might try to hijack that momentum on September 9, so I was very critical of him at the time.  That said, there are still serious ethical and legal issues surrounding him. At a time when we desperately need a clean representative to fight corruption, it feels contradictory that he himself is entangled in corruption cases. Because of that, I cannot support him right now. While he is fighting his legal battles, I truly believe he should step down as president of RSP.  Also, the name ‚ÄúRastriya Swatantra Party‚Äù feels a bit misleading ‚Äî it may not be fair to genuine independent individuals in the upcoming election. I hope the party addresses these two issues.  In every other aspect, though, I genuinely think RSP is the best existing democratic party.  By the way, happy birthday Rabi dai ‚Äî I really appreciate that you surrendered and showed maturity.|||Post by RSP member|||I think its not GenZ that are against him. It is Balen and HarKa PR team including routiney who wants to take benefits. Rabi is the reason of hope for us. I can't see Balen and Harka being a prime minister of this country keeping diplomacy with foreign nations. Honestly, most of these kids don't know or understand politics. You think Balen will be the Primeminister after election with current constitution that will happen in next six month? Are you even registered to vote? If not RSP then Congress, Amale and Maobadi will reign again. Chetana bhaya!|||Please stop trying to be an apologist for his stunt. We cannot deny the Vendetta show by political parties towards him for his sahakari kanda and the things he did as TV presenter in siddha kura janta sanga.   He was rewarded by public of chitwan for that. But portrayal of him as some kind of Messiah by RaSaPa and the stunts his gang did during the jail break has dig his own graveyard. No amount of Suddhikaran can restore the dignity. He should be ashamed that the a literal goon Deepak Manange hold high ground in terms of morality compared to him.  If he's ever elected, he should be elected to local representative or MP but shouldn't hold any executive position.|||What about attacking in every sarkari offices where he had his case.

One for the 165 candidates who are elected directly (first-past-the-post), other for the party. The votes that party gets determine the remaining 110 members via proportional representation.  so aba either we need new political parties to replace the existing ones by Falgun 21, or we have to vote for the same parties again. This is more complicated because Nepal is not just Kathmandu. The political players which we have termed jholey will be active outside Kathmandu.   So if we need the change in constitution, we have to be more careful. The mandates of the movement are more at risk now than before.",

Another alternative to amend constitution might be via referendum tara that will be complicated too  This is what we need to do. 1. We have to guard our mandates. There must not be any renegotiations. Maoist movement failed because of too many negotiations. 2. Our movements and pressure must not fade. We have to carry them out continuously. 3. We have to prevent any fragmentation in the groups.  I know these are hard things, but we have defeated the broken system in two days.",

Nepal can be a smaller country, but they are much more older nation state than us with full of brilliant souls and whatever Nepalis choose for their country, we respect that from core.  But never think this Rathee fellow has any love towards you guys. He's just putting gun over your shoulder to attack India. He is not even an Indian citizen.

Even we don't entertain them. Each passing day their credibility is decreasing in India. 3. Dhruv rathi is also shit. Even his credibility is decreasing each passing day. One hypocrisy at a time. 4. From the bottom of our hearts we hope things calm down there and change for the better for the people of Nepal.

You don't need any validation from germany ka kukkur.|||Guys, I assume everyone here has someone in their family with some political ties. I too have. But that doesn't mean I have direct ties with them. JHOLEY and BHEDA is a noun that defines people who blindly believe in a person or a political party.      Talking about myself, I am already 36, a father and I am thinking of raising my family here in Nepal. I was totally against going abroad as a student when there was trend to do so. But the political system was never stable here. However, This current GenZ revolution happened against corruption. We indeed got a good progress against these corrupt leaders. But things turned out to be different and here is my roller coaster of emotions. Please let me know if you can relate to this.  Day 0: Social Media Ban - Mixed feelings. Hopeful that social medias will proceed further with registration.  Day 1: GenZ revolution and killing - Lots of anger. Disappointment and discontent.  Day 2: Revolution, excited and happy till 4 PM, until we destroyed the party system. Once the public started destroying Singha Durbar, I came to realize what I had done. I started a fire that I can't extinguish.  Day 3: Realization of the revolution being hijacked. We were just against corruption, regime change was not our motto. The revolution gradually turned into a COLOR REVOLUTION.  Day 4: Worried about who will lead the country. Started mentally supporting Balen/Rabi or any young leader. Furious, since the army asked GenZ to come up with a leader. Finally Hami Nepal, some guys funded by Deep state along with Sanduk Ruit and Swarnim Wagle came into light. They started talking about regime change and Constitution change. They said they directly want to select Zelensky as their prime minister.   Day 5: Much more disappointed as some kids who are aiming to go abroad for future study is electing prime minister through Discord. Sushila Karki elected as PM. Which is some sort of relief. I feared a autocrat.  Day 6 - Day 7: China is yet to acknowledge PM Sushila Karki. China is suspecting foul play as KP Oli had been to SCO and all of this happened just after that.      Now I am very much in distress. I feel that, Nepal is Ukraine. Balen is the new Zelensky and China is the new Russia. I dont want to think negatively but the situation ahead seems to be very dark and we will have to take steps cautiously. There are a lot of hatred here and Social medias are fueling it. None of the GenZ were born during the writing of the constitution. There were lots of revolution that was endured by current revolution Maoist Revolution, Madesh Revolution etc. But now it seems everything has gone to waste and there is no constitution here in the country. Is this PTSD?|||Nepal, you are dealing with dangerous, insecure, violent crybullies who don't care about reasons and motives because they'll just come up with fake news and use that is their motive.

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4. Retirement age and term limits: This is a must, we need a clear retirement age for the public positions just like other jobs.     These sort of things are fundamental of any country, without getting the fundamentals right we cannot expect our country to do better. We have a chance to make things better, lets take this chance.|||also i think! what lessons can be learned from Bangladesh last year?|||Garni nai ho vani presidency system lyauni.

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

It‚Äôs tragic, because they also have families back home and face the same struggles as the rest of us. They should be victims of this system too, yet they show little compassion or critical thought about what‚Äôs happening around them. Why are there protests in the first place? I refuse to believe they're blind to people's frustration and the direction the country is heading.  I still remember when we joined a protest 14‚Äì15 years ago. The police confronted us aggressively, and as kids we were too confused to react. Fortunately, we just stood there processing and visibly confused, and they left ‚Äî but I still shudder to think, *what if our reaction had been different?* Today‚Äôs young protestors are in the same position, pure in their intentions, simply voicing frustration without wanting harm.  And honestly, credit must go to these protestors. They know exactly what they are standing for, unlike us back then who needed adults to organise us. I don‚Äôt see how demonstrations could be any more peaceful than they already are ‚Äî especially when the very leaders being protested against have blood on their hands from before this generation was even born.|||Yo bhatey haru kahi gayera sitcha holani|||randi baan machikne haru|||I mean this tracks, they only like when you're corrupt|||Its not andolan anymore its war|||We want death or at lease exile of KP Oli and other taukes.|||Randi haruko photo, name, address patta lagau.|||shamelss dogs of government|||Machikne radi harlai lakhetdai marnaparne|||Thuiyaa police vanauda haruuu|||you radiko ban harulai agolauno man xa|||ma sanga pani ganhune bhaye, kassam mardinthe radieekko ban|||Mathi bata aako order re ????

It‚Äôs simple.|||Disclaimer: I am not a Balen supporter or cultist.  This post is conflicting for me. But, the post is characterizing the man based on:  1. What the man didn‚Äôt do or didn‚Äôt say. 2. What people expected him to do.  The man himself has said enough in his posts.   It‚Äôs what, he DIDN‚ÄôT do that impresses me the most about him. Saying ‚ÄúNo‚Äù is harder than saying ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, when everyone wanted him to say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.  (Think about this.)  He put out only a couple of posts, which I think served as guide posts during the revolution.   1. He was the first widely known public figure (that I know) who defined who Gen Z was and gave his support to the protest. 2. When the tempo rose, he clarified that Gen Z should lead, he accepted Sushila even when all of his cultists were going crazy about making him the interim PM.  Removing himself from the picture, brought focus back on the revolution and the task ahead, rather than turn the confusion situation, even more confusing with a popularity contest as a side gig.   There is a lot of things to think about and I think in time we can all make sense of it all.   That‚Äôs my two paisa about him.|||Leading KTM municipality vs leading the nation are totally different. The followers of Balen urging and rushing him to lead 'right now' and come out by 2PM are the same people who will criticize him within one year if he were to be them PM someday. They don't have patience and want to see changes immediately.  Personally, I would like to see him running in the upcoming election as deputy/vice roles first and not immediate PM role...assuming how parties will be formed and if there are any good lead independent candidate who will run with him. He's one of those few worthy to be PM but this is not his peak yet. He just became a mayor like 3 years ago and he still has a lot to show to the general public. If and when he wins to the election, it will be his peak and he has high chances of being a two term PM...assuming two term limit will be in place hopefully. Time will tell.|||GenZ aren't immune to celeb worship culture.|||Hami Nepal has already stated it was part of a plan and they want balen for 5 years.

Yes it is definitely an opportunistic behaviour by balen. But how is this behaviour wrong and how is taking over PM position now and securing interim govt now and not taking part in politics for next 5 years do any good to the country.    He is practicing patience to achieve the goal he desires and what people actually wants from a young leader like him.

He‚Äôs doing such a great thing in the valley, but being a Prime Minister is very responsible post, his way up talking to seniors, saying I will put fire to SinghaDurbar, I will bury everyone if you‚Äôre in tudinkhel, getting carried away by emotions, being Prime Minister means you should not be carried away by any emotions and none of the factors should affect your judgment which you believe to be true and is lawful, Hopefully he will make such changes and we can finally see him in the top, as much as I want him to be the Prime Minister I do think he is inexperienced and immature in this field,|||We are so far behind that criticizing political leader sounds like a hater. We are not even to the point where we could say ‚ÄúThis person is bad/clueless , country isn‚Äôt safe with them‚Äù. For the past decade, the corrupted 3 have been playing nothing but tato aloo with us so its natural to be sticking nail to current situation. Give it some time and our voices will get echoed.|||If there‚Äôs one thing old political leaders never learned, it was how to handle criticism. The moment anyone spoke up, they tried to shut it down and let‚Äôs not even start on the behavior of their hardcore supporters(jholey as we call them).  Even leaders like Balen need to address this with their own supporters, as do all the new representatives entering the upcoming elections. They must say publicly that they welcome criticism, will reflect on it, and use it as a tool for improvement. Leaders should make it clear to their base: don‚Äôt bully or silence people for simply asking questions or raising concerns. Do not perform character assassination against someone just for criticizing. After all, in a democracy, freedom of speech is our right.  At the same time, we the general public also carry responsibility. We need to recognize the difference between constructive criticism and defamation. What we must not do is fall for propaganda, spread rumors, or engage in baseless character assassination.  And if we realize that our criticism or questioning was wrong, we should have the courage to apologize in the same way we raised the question. After all, apologizing will never make you small. It‚Äôs just a simple five letter word: ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù A word that can and should be spoken from both sides.|||Just because you‚Äôre against the system, doesn‚Äôt make you Balen-Supporters. Balen has no experience. Balen should wait and gain some experience. Criticism is a backbone of democracy and one must welcome it.|||EXACTLY. They lack this ability to critically analyse any action of any leader. Like no one is perfect and no one is a good. Let's be honest. Let's criticize people for their actions. People should be held accountable for their actions. Most importantly, leaders who run our nation. If we don't point out their wrongdoings, will they ever stop? Nepalese have such a bheda mindset, istg. Let's be more aware and let's know how to discern leaders and their actions.   By criticizing these leaders, we aren't hating on them. We're trying to bring awareness so that they won't repeat the same thing again and can do things better for the country.|||They need to be aware party KO jhole become jhole because they were andabhakt of party leader ( just like they are blind follower of balen rn)|||I think holding politicians accountable is crucial. I hope people realize we don‚Äôt need ¬†more devotees and followers. We need critical, educated thinkers. Support the good work, appreciate your favorite leader but don‚Äôt forget to question often.

I see people thanking Balen for this movement and saying he was the reason this movement happened and succeeded and all after Sushila Karki became interim PM, and this made me very sad for actual people who started the movement and also faced the consequences and this was even more big realization for me for how blind youth and supporters these days are and this concerns me even more for future|||Tbh he‚Äôs not fitted for PM cause look at him he have no quality of a good leader specially thinking about diplomacy, even small things makes him anguish ani overconfident cause our country is small ani not teti powerful pani people need to fact check yetikai hype ma balen balen vnnerw huni kei hunnw , a single person cant change country ko face nai, a leader should be someone who equally can tackle every obstacle in a subtle way yetikai sano kura ma ni raged huni country lai ni risk ma leraunxa kya , i am not saying he‚Äôs not a good leader he indeed is terw just not fitted for PM.

This is what I‚Äôve been saying for some time. Like the post says, I‚Äôve also been labeled as a party ko jhole and what not. Even here in this sub, people have called me jhole lol just because I questioned him.  I am a Balen supporter. I supported him and did my part by sharing about his campaign on social media and making everyone aware about it. And I was super happy when he won, I still am. But I‚Äôve been criticizing him on various points that I find valid. The top one is communication.  During the election, he constantly criticized Bidya Sundar (the previous mayor) for not communicating publicly. He even said that once he became mayor, he wouldn‚Äôt be like that and would stay in constant touch. He proposed starting a ‚ÄòMayor with the Public‚Äô TV program and even set aside a budget for it, but nothing has happened. He hasn‚Äôt given a single interview.  And then come his jhole supporters who always argue with the same line: ‚ÄòPailai kei chaieko ho.‚Äô With that logic, we should never question anyone. Just look at how Balen has become now, he just posts one-sided, no-context Facebook statuses and nothing else.|||Balen is a hypocrite in my opinion, like he encouraged the protest and even promised to provide a safe and secure environment for the protest but when things turned south he vanished like horn from a donkeys head|||Finally someone spoke about this, belun has literally become a god complex among some people out there, which is kinda concerning, the only time he speaks is to not let his adhabhatka interfere in every other stuff out there.

I personally don't think he has the temperament (though if there's a choice between any big parties' leader and Balen, I'd choose Balen every time).|||Aru kura thik ho, but can‚Äôt say he abandoned.

Even the one you support. That is transparency. That is the trust that has foundation|||You‚Äôre right. In Nepal, many people tend to follow leaders without much critical thought, even when those leaders don‚Äôt necessarily act in their favor. Unfortunately, this habit seems to persist across generations. If the younger generation continues with the same mindset, there‚Äôs a real risk that the country could end up facing the same challenges in the future that we are experiencing today.|||You can make your own assumptions and narratives. If Balen had taken the post of PM, you would have said that he is opportunistic, that he enraged protestors just to get the position. I saw somewhere on Facebook, even before Balen‚Äôs official post on sushila karki that balen played dirty game for the sake of pm position. As far as I know, Balen is a farsighted person. He only comes forward when he feels fully prepared.|||That's my whole point, but again..vanepachi manche lai jholey nai lagcha. üòÖ Guy's, learn to ask questions yourself too.

But ever since I saw him become mayor, I have always seen him wearing Nepali dress most of the time and consistently working to conserve our heritage and culture.  You know what? He is still better than most of the people there. Whatever he does, he has never done anything wrong. Stop pretending to be so-called critics for useless reasons. What is your academic background, and what makes you think that way? Have you ever felt the difference between past and present Kathmandu? I have a friend from the core area of Kathmandu, do you know what his opinion about Balen Shah is? No!  Even Harka Sampang is a very good person. Moreover, Sagar Dhakal‚Äôs brother has been working actively to eradicate the dictatorship of these political parties. Maybe your parents are bootlicking those rotten political parties, so you only see what Balen has never done and will never do. Just because he supported the movement does not mean he said he wants to become prime minister. You must understand that he posts only a few things because his words are weapons. One word from him has many consequences in such a movement. He is very clever and very wise; unlike Harka Sampang, though I like Harka as a person. But you need to give Balen full power to unlock his full potential. He wants change, he wants revolution, and he wants to remove corrupt politicians.

If Balen had come out saying he‚Äôs ready to lead, a lot of people would‚Äôve jumped in claiming he planned the whole movement and just used Gen Z for his own benefit. That‚Äôs probably why in his statements, he keeps stressing that this is Gen Z‚Äôs movement and that the government will be formed by them. imo, staying out of it was the smartest move he could have made.  I‚Äôm all for questioning and criticizing leaders. I agree that its a problem if you dont want to do it.

But, when we are talking about selection of interim PM, he did the right thing by not coming out.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**¬†The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**¬†If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**¬†If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**¬†If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

This has been ongoing for more than two decades. Behind the few visible figures, there are countless others who have either assisted them or benefitted through their association‚Äîranging from major brands in Nepal to traders. For example, Sher Bahadur Deuba‚Äôs son and his sanitary pad importing company stand as an illustration.  They have institutionalized corruption by appointing foreign ambassadors based on party loyalty and financial gains, extending even to the transfer of bureaucrats to preferred locations in exchange for bribes and other undue benefits. The problem is not limited to the political system alone; bureaucrats, too, require checks and balances. A mechanism must be established to regulate the power of bureaucrats over politicians. Since bureaucrats are permanent stakeholders, their influence is even greater. One effective way to mitigate this is to appoint domain experts as ministers‚Äîfor instance, a professional civil engineer as a minister cannot be misled about the cost estimates of a construction project.  There remains much to be done. Moreover, these political parties will attempt to form alliances before elections, bringing forward the same candidates and restoring the same exploitative system. Therefore, the first and most meaningful reform must be a change in the electoral process, with the inclusion of a ‚ÄúNOTA‚Äù (None of the Above) option.  Further accountability can be ensured by eliminating political appointments to certain positions. At present, even temporary (karar) appointments are made based on party affiliation rather than merit. As a result, even highly qualified experts are compelled to seek political approval. The recent appointments of Vice-Chancellors at B.P. Koirala Institute in Dharan and Gangalal Hospital are prime examples.  In addition to these issues, several other structural flaws persist. What we urgently require is a comprehensive systemic reform|||Gen Z laid them in the grave, and now they're shoveling the dirt themselves.|||# How to make Gen Z movement bullet proof ?

Its frustration i agree but don't promote these things. Hilton hotel building itself was one of the most advanced building in nepal containing too advanced BIM system. We should have preserved this building for future use but what happened happened and it is owned by marwadi not sure about deuba's son. So don't worry we have the capability to reconstruct these properties and buildings for now please stay calm and let the country Heal. But i am not sure how this building got so affected by fire it has high end firefighting system in it that is capable to withstand very huge fire accidents and extinguish it itself, To demolish this building to this extent, normal fire wouldn't be this effective i have doubts about how this fire took place typical  plan had been executed to do this work normally it is not possible.|||Everything aside the matte black is sick!! üî•üî•|||Resources ko better utilize garne buddi xaina‚Ä¶|||I am sorry, but how does Nepal wants to attract investments in the country.

People watched her speech where she said stuff like, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?‚Äù  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still don‚Äôt have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we don‚Äôt have the right connections.  We don‚Äôt get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, it‚Äôs still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? That‚Äôs probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  We‚Äôre out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor people‚Äôs kids not boil?  On top of that, there‚Äôs already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent. Because this have  been suppressed for so long, and now the mindset is like ‚Äî ‚ÄúIf we can‚Äôt reach anywhere through the system, then we might as well destroy it.‚Äù  And even if some third party tries to trigger people, the truth is, it was already there deep down in their subconscious. This is just it coming out. Right now it feels new, but honestly, it was bound to happen sooner or later.|||No Shit Sherlock (You guys got  manipulated into doing the wrong thing) üòî|||Sherey ko choro lai dhulai diye ki nai ?|||Each Hilton hotel employees 400+ Nepalese nationals üòÇ what about the people that lost their jobs?|||https://preview.redd.it/muoumzxh6eof1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63da78ae8b2a74c1f669dc95f01e062ff9e299b0|||https://preview.redd.it/rjynwvrk6eof1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04a5f8cbe1243c2dfca73c29dea57aa5425243bf|||We could‚Äôve turned this into Hospital but Nope|||This is an absolutely great work revolution.|||Aur Karo money money wali gand masti|||if you make a good system and government now that‚Äòs important!

That drive inevitably brings with it shades of narcissism and opportunism. So rather than fixating on intentions, it makes more sense to judge politicians by their results.

His rough almost mobster-like style may be off-putting to some but in a city like Dharan which is home to hotheaded Kirati / Hill Janajati majority that kind of toughness isn‚Äôt just useful, it‚Äôs necessary.  That said, he is neither qualified nor capable enough to be considered an ‚Äòideal‚Äô Prime Minister.

If a person has done good work, both of them will be appreciated hands down. You have to look at the picture from both sides. Secondly, please ask your senior citizens or elders from a different generation. They have seen history and faced the consequences. The real issue is bringing change in the constitution, i.e., a representative should not be above a certain age and should be allowed to seek votes only for one term. Take that in writing from the concerned representative, live, and show it to the world clearly. Also, please do not discriminate by saying someone is from the ‚ÄúStone Age,‚Äù as such remarks can hurt the sentiments of people who are not from cities.|||Yes, I don't know what to.

(**Bank run**¬†is a situation where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a bank simultaneously, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or financial stability. This can lead to liquidity problems for the bank, as it may not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands. Bank runs can create a cycle of panic, potentially leading to the bank's failure.)  The real pain starts after the protests have calmed. Economic crash is certain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh both went through it. Stock market/real estate crash, inflation and what not.  Whoever takes charge next, likely Balen, will need to address the pointless 'Greater Nepal' rhetoric and become a moderate on this issue. Thanks to Trump, India-China relationship is stable for the first time in ages. The only way Nepal has a future is pledge allegiance to both neighbour's.  Bangladesh under Yunus has been a pain in the ass for India. Nepal cannot make the same mistake. Any wrong steps and a free floating Nepali rupee against the dollar would go from 140 now to 25,000 like similar countries in our GDP range. Probably worse since our economy is in much worse shape.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.¬†¬† Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.¬†¬† Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||How credible is this info?|||Use bitchat for conversation.

            "comments": "We are living in a moment where anger is boiling over. People are tired of corruption, censorship, and being silenced. Many of us are ready to take to the streets on Sept 8. But before we move forward, we must stop and think carefully.  History has shown us what happens when we rush in without preparation. In Bangladesh last year, in Sri Lanka not long ago, ordinary people gave their lives while corrupt leaders fled the country with protection and comfort. Their deaths were forgotten within weeks, while the guilty walked free. If we are not careful, Nepal risks becoming the next chapter in that same tragic story.  That is why this movement must be different. We cannot afford to be reckless. We must protect our people, keep our voices peaceful, and make sure the world is watching every step so that accountability cannot be erased.  Here is what we need to do before Sept 8:  * Get international human rights groups, UN observers, and peace monitors involved beforehand so there are eyes on the ground. * Publish clear and peaceful agendas so nobody can label us as rioters or mobs. * Document everything with photos, videos, and testimonies. Every arrest and every injury must be recorded and shared. * Avoid following local leaders who are affiliated with political parties. Big parties will try to infiltrate, hijack, and twist this movement for their own gain. * Know who is truly standing beside you. Trust matters because infiltrators can turn peaceful protests into chaos.  This movement is about dignity, rights, and accountability. It is not about violence. It is not about revenge. If we lose focus, if we let anger replace strategy, then we risk repeating the same cycle where the powerful walk free and ordinary people pay with their lives.  Nepal deserves better. The world must see us not as mobs, but as citizens united for freedom and justice. If we do this right, our voices will be impossible to silence. If we do this wrong, we risk being forgotten like so many before us.  Stay safe. Stay peaceful. Stay smart.",

She is the daughter of Chabi Rijal, a communist leader and Chief District Officer in Nepal, who recently ordered a shoot-on-sight against youth peacefully protesting corruption in Nepal. His orders have killed over 18 innocent people, injured more than 100 students, and more deaths are expected. This is pure fascism and a gross misuse of power. Young people in a peaceful protest were shot dead, which is totally unacceptable. While our brothers and sisters die in Nepal, Sweta Rijal has no right to study in the US with money from corruption. Her entire funding is from the money from corruption. The US, as a democratic country and a voice for the UN, stands for freedom and justice. Allowing her to stay contradicts everything the US represents. We are struggling to fight this battle in Nepal, and she must be held accountable. I urge you to investigate her visa and take necessary action to send her back to Nepal. Regards, Concerned Citizen from Nepal",

Many of us here are also frustrated by the opportunist media and some jerks. We do have misunderstandings and conflicts between but they should have been side lined at this critical moment. Even the people who are getting inspired and speaking in favour of your protest are getting back lash (and recently a person has been charged under the law by the police)because this protest turned violent but ik that wasn't intended. We can argue about the pros and cons but the fact that you stood up against the system is a big achievement and inspiration. I wish you great luck guys and hope you find a better system than the one you fought against and draw a milestone for us. Although I would say you have had a great loss of infrastructure which could have been avoided if the protest was properly managed.|||Abiskar Raut for POTUS  #RAUT2028|||Good speaker, I hope we learn a lot from him.|||Aja samma malai ni yo manchey(sudan gurung) ley miraj dhungana ley start gareko protest  lai hijack garera, sabai cerdit liyo vanney socheko thiye.

And the hotel was belonging of politicians son. So, they could have made fake protestor's to do it, to claim insurance?  Why are indian and nepalese are fighting here about this matter?? This isn't time for fighting.   And about destroying properties, there are theories that the protest were hijacked by other political parties. Like wise, about governments offices, they wanted to destroy the proofs of corruptions. And public building and properties was collateral damages for those fake protesters to look it real.

The media, also corrupt, manipulates public opinion with false narratives or half-truths, always favoring the state, especially abroad. This has caused enormous polarization in the country, in addition to promoting many unjust laws.  My country is overrun by crime, and there are criminal factions that control entire regions (with the explicit support of the state), and you run a risk when you go out at night, you know? You can be robbed and killed at any moment, and nothing will be done to the criminal.  Education is also of extremely low quality, which has caused an absurd cultural and moral degradation among my people, who today lack even the capacity to think critically.  Salary increases for politicians without social approval are frequent here, and nothing happens. Search the amount of benefits they receive here.  We recently had a scandal involving millions of retirees being stolen against their will by banks and public agencies. What was the government's solution? To create more taxes to pay without punishing those who stole, and to try to inhibit investigations by using public funds to buy off those who would investigate. Search for \"INSS Scandal\".  The current president (rejected by the majority) has actively provoked other countries, especially the US, to create an open conflict between the two countries, precisely to use this as an excuse to remain in power while putting the lives of millions of people at risk.    Anyway, I could spend all day here giving examples of the harm corruption has caused in the society I live in. I recommend imagining how many future geniuses, entrepreneurs, inventors, and exemplary people for humanity could exist here, but won't, thanks to the corruption of some.  Imagine how prosperous societies would be if there weren't corrupt representatives making absurd and selfish decisions to benefit themselves and control others.    I understand that violence blinds people, and it's unpleasant to see someone in this situation, but we need to understand that in today's societies, we have two sides, one side that wants to live and enjoy life peacefully, and the other that wants to use your life to live like gods.   So, what would you prefer?    The people of Nepal are absolutely right to act as they are, and their politicians need to see what true justice is. They acted wrongly, harming thousands of people, and now they need to be punished, something that would never happen without the use of violence.   The corrupt state would never punish itself, and military forces serve and exist precisely to defend the state and its interests, meaning they would never be punished fairly, and even if they have surrendered, the disaster has already been caused, this surrender is just a way for them to try to avoid punishment, however, sooner or later, they will stab society in the back, and guess what, if society doesn't act, nothing will happen to them and their crimes!  Soon my country will go through something similar, and you will be able to see that it is not about revenge, it is about justice, something that unfortunately is disappearing in societies.  There's no point in trying to appear morally superior, evil people exist and will continue to commit atrocities, and if there are no violent reactions against them, everything will only get worse.|||Ajai kutnu partyo mardeko bhaye huntyo.

I am just a sincere, hardworking youth who remained silent because too many opinions create a ruckus. That's what I believed till September 8. When I went to the protest, it was all fine until they started firing. When you're in the battleground, all moralities go out the window. Yet, I did not throw a single stone at anyone and I am proud of that. I remained with the group who were peacefully protesting infront of the army van, I helped people with water to wash their face, tried picking up litters. The main point is I tried being a responsible person. But the moment I saw people being carried to the hospital with their blood spattering the streets, I fucking lost it. In retaliation, my protests became more louder. I came home late at night, tried my best to repost as many information I could. At one point, I felt like people should burn down the entire ministry down, all these nepo-babies should be brought to the streets to teach their parents how it feels to kill someone's child. I was furious, the word being an understatement. But seeing this people getting mob justice was what I never wanted. They don't deserve the least of anyone's sympathies, but we still have humanity in our hearts. That's what differs us from them.¬† I'm trying my best to control the narrative of why the protests happened, so that the opportunistic Indians, Chinese and the entire West may not take undue advantage of us.

            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada‚Äôs classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.¬†  We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking‚Äìmuch to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in¬† Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate -¬†the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala‚Äôs approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.¬†  Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn‚Äôt mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‚Äòhelp‚Äô. One time, she even said airily, ‚ÄúI wash my own dishes, you know.‚Äù She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala‚Äìa beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth‚Äìlingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don‚Äôt intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‚Äònepo babies‚Äô who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).¬†  Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It‚Äôs a troubling idea to think that despite what‚Äôs happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

She was funded by her corrupt father.|||Wish we had more tea like this on all nepo babies.||| Damn I strictly feel its true|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn‚Äôt some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake ‚Äúbeauty with brains‚Äù narrative. Do you guys remember Niti‚Äôs big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let‚Äôs not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala‚Äôs prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it‚Äôs her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let‚Äôs be real- Sisan wasn‚Äôt perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they‚Äôd known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn‚Äôt even exist. This just proves it- they weren‚Äôt just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can‚Äôt just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala‚Äôs career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav‚Äôs narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What‚Äôs the lesson we can learn from here ?

Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don‚Äôt even make sense to begin with. Don‚Äôt know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don‚Äôt even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It‚Äôs so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It‚Äôs astounding what the world has come to and it‚Äôs deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can‚Äôt be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn‚Äôt she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It‚Äôs better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has.

The beinfit is probably meant for the MPs who had to move temprorarily to the capital or who didn't have their own residence. Iirc, they had to manually opt in to get that added housing allowance. When the news published, her father's reaction was something along the line of \"I didn't know, I was getting it. I am happy to return it.\"  Question for her, how come you dont know the source of wealth and your parent's ethics?

These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!! And the way she's silent when the country is bleeding says alottt too!!!!!!

I always wondered if she was true to her image.   At the end of the day she got into Harvard.

I mean gross national happiness instead of gross national product. I believe every single country on this planet should take Bhutan as a role model a little bit more. Where else in the world are citizens asked what their main problems are and what they want from the government? And later, citizens are asked how satisfied they were with the government's performance. I know it's a bit naive of me to make such a suggestion from afar, as a sheltered European who is not really familiar with the form of government in Nepal.

And in the media, they try to appear close to the people, to be there for them, to advance the country by investing in infrastructure or new hospitals, etc. But no, a large part of your taxes ends up with the rulers themselves.

Even if they have the intention and will to do so (like many of us want), they do not know how to run a country. I see them as ineffective in running even a municipality (maybe that was because of politics and in-cooperation from party elected ward heads). The thing is they have a lot more to learn and they will, with time.       This situation would not have happened if there were transfer of power to youth in timely manner. Now the rising youth leaders do not have experience because these corrupt politicians did not allow that.      What we need is a system where corruption should now be absolutely dreaded, seeing how corrupt politicians had to run away for thier life. They have to realize that people will not just punish the corrupt polticians, they will also punish whoever was responsible to prevent that.       There now needs to be a collaborative development with young leaders like Balen and experienced people like Sushila. Each and everyone's characters will show with time, for now, we have to seek for stability as soon as possible.|||If we fail to appoint her then external along with internal force will play and bring more chaos to the country.

I truly want Sushila Karki to be prime minister, but according to our constitution it's not possible. And if we ditch our constitution our country is open for invasion from other countries. So, what's the best option it's BALEN. I know that he won't be able to run for prime minister for the next election but it is a risk we have to take. It's already proven that our protest was the result of different politicians 'parties'involvement. So, let's play it safe and try to choose the best result for us. Already many Indian politicians are saying that they are ready to deploy an army if needed. It's not goodwill but an invasion. So it's best we know what we do for the country.  But if it's possible for her to be prime minister without disturbing our constitution then I'm all for it. I also want a good leader who will work for the development of the country.   Indian is already eyeing the district like Lipilekh and Limpadhura. If we take too long to make a responsible decision, they are favourites to win the case.   The country is already in chaos. So we must do our best to calm it down. We protested against corruption and got unexpected results. We are not ready for it. And we don't have time to think about it and make a decision. But, we must make a decision and make it work, isn't it all there is to it ?    It's not that I don't support \"Sushila Karki\" . She has my full support. But if it is disturbing our core rules set by our constitution. I just thought it isn't right. So it's my request all my fellow citizens ( not just gen-z ) to make a right decision.   But my final warning is that if we defy our current constitution ourselves. It will not be a suprise other countries take advantage of it. So we shall make a decision ourselves and take the best route possible. But you've my support to make her ( Sushila Karki) intrim prime minister. It is the best result seeing her experience on political field.   It might have been a bit long for the attention span of gen-z but i just want to say that, neither the constitution nor the national rules be any shorter üòä. So make your protest and blood of many worthy of something great. You've already done impossible without any preparations. So make a few preparations and make our country great again.|||She can be a mentor, why hog all the power for herself at that age??|||Divide and rule going on same old tactics which works everytime.|||This stupid ando Balen supporter haru.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.¬†¬† Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.¬†¬† Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||Jaha Bhetyo tehi thok saley madarchod lai...|||Aaos na india ma ni nepali xan birsyo kya|||Bro timro yo pic use garey haii Tiktok ma vid halchu|||kun desh jala teta bebasta garnu parxa|||yo machikne lai samatna paryo jasari bhaye ni yellai bachne kunai adhikar xaina|||Bhagey ra canada nai ja la, canada ma nee xodnu hudaina.

I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both.

She is the one who has been abroad for so long and has so many foreign connections and relations that even if she  doesn't want interference, there will be far more foreign interference with her as a leader.

BTW, Gen Z doesn‚Äôt just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didn‚Äôt exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who weren‚Äôt even present for the protests claim we don‚Äôt know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldn‚Äôt even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, ‚ÄòWe have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server you‚Äôre all listening to is just for public discussion‚Äô. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal. Now that it‚Äôs been confirmed everywhere and with Balen posting that the Gen Z‚Äôs choice former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Sushila Karki is the right choice for interim prime minister of Nepal, we look forward to what comes next.|||https://new-nepal-voting.vercel.app/  Vote here or suggest names I can add|||For interim formation CJ Sushila Karki would be the perfect choice.

Even when we look at history of the world, majority of peaceful protest start peaceful and end violently. No entity in power ever gives it up easily.  Change was what we asked for and change is what we are getting.

Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? I‚Äôve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we can‚Äôt let our nation fail.** We can‚Äôt let our nation burn. We can‚Äôt let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**¬†    **1) We lay down our weapons.**¬†  We came in peace, we protested in peace, and we‚Äôve always wanted peace.

The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.¬†    **3) We wear white.**¬†  White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that we‚Äôve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.¬†    **4) We have hope.**¬†  Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.¬†    Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.¬†    Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.¬†    Sincerely,¬†  Pantji, a Gen-Z¬†|||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us.

The president on her cabinet's recommendation dissolves the house of Representatives, 5. Her cabinet carries forward the corruption investigation and reconstruction. 6. The elections will be declared immediately. 7. The new parliament decides the constitutional amendments. (directly elected prime minister etc. and others ) 8.

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen.

One for the 165 candidates who are elected directly (first-past-the-post), other for the party. The votes that party gets determine the remaining 110 members via proportional representation.  so aba either we need new political parties to replace the existing ones by Falgun 21, or we have to vote for the same parties again. This is more complicated because Nepal is not just Kathmandu. The political players which we have termed jholey will be active outside Kathmandu.   So if we need the change in constitution, we have to be more careful. The mandates of the movement are more at risk now than before.",

But that doesn't mean I have direct ties with them. JHOLEY and BHEDA is a noun that defines people who blindly believe in a person or a political party.      Talking about myself, I am already 36, a father and I am thinking of raising my family here in Nepal. I was totally against going abroad as a student when there was trend to do so. But the political system was never stable here. However, This current GenZ revolution happened against corruption. We indeed got a good progress against these corrupt leaders. But things turned out to be different and here is my roller coaster of emotions. Please let me know if you can relate to this.  Day 0: Social Media Ban - Mixed feelings. Hopeful that social medias will proceed further with registration.  Day 1: GenZ revolution and killing - Lots of anger. Disappointment and discontent.  Day 2: Revolution, excited and happy till 4 PM, until we destroyed the party system. Once the public started destroying Singha Durbar, I came to realize what I had done. I started a fire that I can't extinguish.  Day 3: Realization of the revolution being hijacked. We were just against corruption, regime change was not our motto. The revolution gradually turned into a COLOR REVOLUTION.  Day 4: Worried about who will lead the country. Started mentally supporting Balen/Rabi or any young leader. Furious, since the army asked GenZ to come up with a leader. Finally Hami Nepal, some guys funded by Deep state along with Sanduk Ruit and Swarnim Wagle came into light. They started talking about regime change and Constitution change. They said they directly want to select Zelensky as their prime minister.   Day 5: Much more disappointed as some kids who are aiming to go abroad for future study is electing prime minister through Discord. Sushila Karki elected as PM. Which is some sort of relief. I feared a autocrat.  Day 6 - Day 7: China is yet to acknowledge PM Sushila Karki. China is suspecting foul play as KP Oli had been to SCO and all of this happened just after that.      Now I am very much in distress. I feel that, Nepal is Ukraine. Balen is the new Zelensky and China is the new Russia. I dont want to think negatively but the situation ahead seems to be very dark and we will have to take steps cautiously. There are a lot of hatred here and Social medias are fueling it. None of the GenZ were born during the writing of the constitution. There were lots of revolution that was endured by current revolution Maoist Revolution, Madesh Revolution etc. But now it seems everything has gone to waste and there is no constitution here in the country. Is this PTSD?|||Nepal, you are dealing with dangerous, insecure, violent crybullies who don't care about reasons and motives because they'll just come up with fake news and use that is their motive.

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4.

Just wanted to express supreme respect to you from Ukraine.   You're really cool!   We had protests in 2014.   We made lot of mistakes after succeded in throwing down Yanukovich in 2014. War with Russia after that happened that helped corrupted politicians a lot. After five years people were tricked and during war elected complete scammers after watching \"servant of nation\" series with current president in main role.   Now we get kidnapping peoples on streets by police and conscripted forcely to war or you can get out for $10k until kidnapped next time. People get beaten and sometimes murdered in basements by military guys supported by police.   Escaping from country costs minimum $10k, but sometimes 20 and more just for crossing border without guarantees of success.   Or some peoples are going \\~100km through wild forests to escape country hunted by border guards with drones. Some succeed, some die.   Guy who was spokesman of corrupted police forces fighting against protests that time is now in charge of entire police and border guards and special forces.

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

They belittled the Bangladesh protests similarly and painted it as Muslims vs Hindus in Bangladesh. They paint a high opinion of the fugitive Shaik Hasina but curse Nobel laureate Mohammed Yunus. Indian media is the judge, jury and executioner of all the happenings in Nepal, Bangladesh, Srilanka and Pakistan. According to them, India is Ramarajya but others were Raavan rajya. India has become a dead democracy in the past decade. We have no jobs, extremely costly education and no health. We are just scrapping by but nothing to show as the media paints cooked up Indian GDP.

A shift to a fully directly elected system for every seat would ensure greater accountability and public representation. 2. **Establish a Directly Elected Executive Head:**¬†Instead of the parliament choosing the Prime Minister, the call is for a directly elected President or Prime Minister with full executive powers. This would provide a stable government for a fixed term, preventing the \"share-the-power\" politics that have led to instability.|||Also follow what's in constitution, according to constitution of Nepal, people outside of Nepal should be able to vote through embassy, but in reality we can't.|||No regegnation, country out|||So y'all are asking for resignation after kids dead in their school uniform.

It‚Äôs tragic, because they also have families back home and face the same struggles as the rest of us. They should be victims of this system too, yet they show little compassion or critical thought about what‚Äôs happening around them. Why are there protests in the first place? I refuse to believe they're blind to people's frustration and the direction the country is heading.  I still remember when we joined a protest 14‚Äì15 years ago. The police confronted us aggressively, and as kids we were too confused to react. Fortunately, we just stood there processing and visibly confused, and they left ‚Äî but I still shudder to think, *what if our reaction had been different?* Today‚Äôs young protestors are in the same position, pure in their intentions, simply voicing frustration without wanting harm.  And honestly, credit must go to these protestors. They know exactly what they are standing for, unlike us back then who needed adults to organise us. I don‚Äôt see how demonstrations could be any more peaceful than they already are ‚Äî especially when the very leaders being protested against have blood on their hands from before this generation was even born.|||Yo bhatey haru kahi gayera sitcha holani|||randi baan machikne haru|||I mean this tracks, they only like when you're corrupt|||Its not andolan anymore its war|||We want death or at lease exile of KP Oli and other taukes.|||Randi haruko photo, name, address patta lagau.|||shamelss dogs of government|||Machikne radi harlai lakhetdai marnaparne|||Thuiyaa police vanauda haruuu|||you radiko ban harulai agolauno man xa|||ma sanga pani ganhune bhaye, kassam mardinthe radieekko ban|||Mathi bata aako order re ????

The reason I am saying is remember he was the one who is featured in various interviews and podcasts during Mayor elections.

He just write on FB and then finish just one way communication. And there is RONB jasle chai khali Balen lai feature garcha and just show usko ramro part so it's that favouritism.   As a Gen Z, I also voted him in last election. So don't follow or worship in blindly. While selecting representative for interim government I found many youths favor Balen.

Most people don't know the perspectives of one event and they believe only what is potrayed.  Being influenced by balen this much is dangerous for the democracy if these people do not understand what blind support can create.

Honestly speaking they are playing with young people‚Äôs emotions and future‚Ä¶ they are burning our country and feeling the warmth‚Ä¶ and we are happy at the time being because youth are so blinded by this madness they don‚Äôt see right from wrong!! Just look at the way they incite violence like it‚Äôs nothing!! Talking about burning down houses and people is nothing!! This is not a right foundation. We must make all these Gen-Z representatives accountable. Especially, Sudhan Gurung.

Also what happens if he wins election he managed? Would everyone trust he won fair election?   I think what did is best for him and country. If people choose him, he will be pm if not he wont. It‚Äôs simple.|||Disclaimer: I am not a Balen supporter or cultist.  This post is conflicting for me. But, the post is characterizing the man based on:  1. What the man didn‚Äôt do or didn‚Äôt say. 2. What people expected him to do.  The man himself has said enough in his posts.   It‚Äôs what, he DIDN‚ÄôT do that impresses me the most about him. Saying ‚ÄúNo‚Äù is harder than saying ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, when everyone wanted him to say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.  (Think about this.)  He put out only a couple of posts, which I think served as guide posts during the revolution.   1. He was the first widely known public figure (that I know) who defined who Gen Z was and gave his support to the protest. 2. When the tempo rose, he clarified that Gen Z should lead, he accepted Sushila even when all of his cultists were going crazy about making him the interim PM.  Removing himself from the picture, brought focus back on the revolution and the task ahead, rather than turn the confusion situation, even more confusing with a popularity contest as a side gig.   There is a lot of things to think about and I think in time we can all make sense of it all.   That‚Äôs my two paisa about him.|||Leading KTM municipality vs leading the nation are totally different. The followers of Balen urging and rushing him to lead 'right now' and come out by 2PM are the same people who will criticize him within one year if he were to be them PM someday. They don't have patience and want to see changes immediately.  Personally, I would like to see him running in the upcoming election as deputy/vice roles first and not immediate PM role...assuming how parties will be formed and if there are any good lead independent candidate who will run with him. He's one of those few worthy to be PM but this is not his peak yet. He just became a mayor like 3 years ago and he still has a lot to show to the general public. If and when he wins to the election, it will be his peak and he has high chances of being a two term PM...assuming two term limit will be in place hopefully. Time will tell.|||GenZ aren't immune to celeb worship culture.|||Hami Nepal has already stated it was part of a plan and they want balen for 5 years. So did they fight for the nation or for the balen is the real question? Why are they biased for balen only and not for other groups of good people?|||About your 2nd picture.  Yes it is definitely an opportunistic behaviour by balen. But how is this behaviour wrong and how is taking over PM position now and securing interim govt now and not taking part in politics for next 5 years do any good to the country.    He is practicing patience to achieve the goal he desires and what people actually wants from a young leader like him. Look throughout the history of world politics, paitence has always been the key factor to shape the world politics.|||Having trusted by many even me,In the moment of national threat, he could do nothing. That‚Äôs the reason I doubt him.  i think he is not completely responsible for being the Prime Minister. Sure, he is a great person. He‚Äôs doing such a great thing in the valley, but being a Prime Minister is very responsible post, his way up talking to seniors, saying I will put fire to SinghaDurbar, I will bury everyone if you‚Äôre in tudinkhel, getting carried away by emotions, being Prime Minister means you should not be carried away by any emotions and none of the factors should affect your judgment which you believe to be true and is lawful, Hopefully he will make such changes and we can finally see him in the top, as much as I want him to be the Prime Minister I do think he is inexperienced and immature in this field,|||We are so far behind that criticizing political leader sounds like a hater. We are not even to the point where we could say ‚ÄúThis person is bad/clueless , country isn‚Äôt safe with them‚Äù. For the past decade, the corrupted 3 have been playing nothing but tato aloo with us so its natural to be sticking nail to current situation. Give it some time and our voices will get echoed.|||If there‚Äôs one thing old political leaders never learned, it was how to handle criticism. The moment anyone spoke up, they tried to shut it down and let‚Äôs not even start on the behavior of their hardcore supporters(jholey as we call them).  Even leaders like Balen need to address this with their own supporters, as do all the new representatives entering the upcoming elections. They must say publicly that they welcome criticism, will reflect on it, and use it as a tool for improvement. Leaders should make it clear to their base: don‚Äôt bully or silence people for simply asking questions or raising concerns. Do not perform character assassination against someone just for criticizing. After all, in a democracy, freedom of speech is our right.  At the same time, we the general public also carry responsibility. We need to recognize the difference between constructive criticism and defamation. What we must not do is fall for propaganda, spread rumors, or engage in baseless character assassination.  And if we realize that our criticism or questioning was wrong, we should have the courage to apologize in the same way we raised the question. After all, apologizing will never make you small. It‚Äôs just a simple five letter word: ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù A word that can and should be spoken from both sides.|||Just because you‚Äôre against the system, doesn‚Äôt make you Balen-Supporters. Balen has no experience. Balen should wait and gain some experience. Criticism is a backbone of democracy and one must welcome it.|||EXACTLY. They lack this ability to critically analyse any action of any leader. Like no one is perfect and no one is a good. Let's be honest. Let's criticize people for their actions. People should be held accountable for their actions. Most importantly, leaders who run our nation. If we don't point out their wrongdoings, will they ever stop? Nepalese have such a bheda mindset, istg. Let's be more aware and let's know how to discern leaders and their actions.   By criticizing these leaders, we aren't hating on them. We're trying to bring awareness so that they won't repeat the same thing again and can do things better for the country.|||They need to be aware party KO jhole become jhole because they were andabhakt of party leader ( just like they are blind follower of balen rn)|||I think holding politicians accountable is crucial.

I see people thanking Balen for this movement and saying he was the reason this movement happened and succeeded and all after Sushila Karki became interim PM, and this made me very sad for actual people who started the movement and also faced the consequences and this was even more big realization for me for how blind youth and supporters these days are and this concerns me even more for future|||Tbh he‚Äôs not fitted for PM cause look at him he have no quality of a good leader specially thinking about diplomacy, even small things makes him anguish ani overconfident cause our country is small ani not teti powerful pani people need to fact check yetikai hype ma balen balen vnnerw huni kei hunnw , a single person cant change country ko face nai, a leader should be someone who equally can tackle every obstacle in a subtle way yetikai sano kura ma ni raged huni country lai ni risk ma leraunxa kya , i am not saying he‚Äôs not a good leader he indeed is terw just not fitted for PM.

This is what I‚Äôve been saying for some time. Like the post says, I‚Äôve also been labeled as a party ko jhole and what not. Even here in this sub, people have called me jhole lol just because I questioned him.  I am a Balen supporter. I supported him and did my part by sharing about his campaign on social media and making everyone aware about it. And I was super happy when he won, I still am. But I‚Äôve been criticizing him on various points that I find valid. The top one is communication.  During the election, he constantly criticized Bidya Sundar (the previous mayor) for not communicating publicly. He even said that once he became mayor, he wouldn‚Äôt be like that and would stay in constant touch. He proposed starting a ‚ÄòMayor with the Public‚Äô TV program and even set aside a budget for it, but nothing has happened. He hasn‚Äôt given a single interview.  And then come his jhole supporters who always argue with the same line: ‚ÄòPailai kei chaieko ho.‚Äô With that logic, we should never question anyone. Just look at how Balen has become now, he just posts one-sided, no-context Facebook statuses and nothing else.|||Balen is a hypocrite in my opinion, like he encouraged the protest and even promised to provide a safe and secure environment for the protest but when things turned south he vanished like horn from a donkeys head|||Finally someone spoke about this, belun has literally become a god complex among some people out there, which is kinda concerning, the only time he speaks is to not let his adhabhatka interfere in every other stuff out there.

Moreover, Sagar Dhakal‚Äôs brother has been working actively to eradicate the dictatorship of these political parties. Maybe your parents are bootlicking those rotten political parties, so you only see what Balen has never done and will never do.

One word from him has many consequences in such a movement. He is very clever and very wise; unlike Harka Sampang, though I like Harka as a person.

It runs on power. Until you understand this, you‚Äôll not understand the situation. And those who understand this controls the narrative.

But I‚Äôm sure even he does not know he‚Äôs a small puppet planted/invested long ago. Usually foreign powers will not directly direct its agenda, especially for the country at the bottom of the barrel they do not have the time to do so. You just give them small aid, support for us, for them simple investment, which they just got good return this time, especially now east is rising its economy. You just need to nudge them, give them support they will do their good vs evil thing which any human will do. Think about it, nobody was going forward with stance like him to take on some kind of leader role, because we do not have that power (support) and as human we fear unknown.  You might think I‚Äôm thinking too much of this. Well, I can‚Äôt argue you, because I do not know for sure, but this is my stance and most probable thing I saw.",

The revolution as your history will always call it has got its results. I know all is not done you need reforms you need an accountable government. But ask yourself aren't you going overboard now? Literally the whole government has given in and the most possible situation is the army going to take over. Please keep the situation such that the army or any other entity doesn't get the excuse to deny people of their right to rule themselves. This is not  new,  when a revolution with a purpose overshoots give the power mongerers an opportunity to come forward and exploit that. A mob when acting like this is too dangerous.

Also Nepalese Army IS asking somebody to represent the Gen-Z activists. So yeah, they are pretty much in front of it. I am wondering what they will ask from the new government. I am worried it will be about going abroad. To study and not care about the situation at the moment. I hope we get swift government who can clear corruption and restore some order.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**¬†The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**¬†If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**¬†If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**¬†If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

This has been ongoing for more than two decades. Behind the few visible figures, there are countless others who have either assisted them or benefitted through their association‚Äîranging from major brands in Nepal to traders. For example, Sher Bahadur Deuba‚Äôs son and his sanitary pad importing company stand as an illustration.  They have institutionalized corruption by appointing foreign ambassadors based on party loyalty and financial gains, extending even to the transfer of bureaucrats to preferred locations in exchange for bribes and other undue benefits. The problem is not limited to the political system alone; bureaucrats, too, require checks and balances. A mechanism must be established to regulate the power of bureaucrats over politicians. Since bureaucrats are permanent stakeholders, their influence is even greater. One effective way to mitigate this is to appoint domain experts as ministers‚Äîfor instance, a professional civil engineer as a minister cannot be misled about the cost estimates of a construction project.  There remains much to be done. Moreover, these political parties will attempt to form alliances before elections, bringing forward the same candidates and restoring the same exploitative system. Therefore, the first and most meaningful reform must be a change in the electoral process, with the inclusion of a ‚ÄúNOTA‚Äù (None of the Above) option.  Further accountability can be ensured by eliminating political appointments to certain positions. At present, even temporary (karar) appointments are made based on party affiliation rather than merit. As a result, even highly qualified experts are compelled to seek political approval. The recent appointments of Vice-Chancellors at B.P. Koirala Institute in Dharan and Gangalal Hospital are prime examples.  In addition to these issues, several other structural flaws persist.

People watched her speech where she said stuff like, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?‚Äù  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still don‚Äôt have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we don‚Äôt have the right connections.  We don‚Äôt get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, it‚Äôs still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? That‚Äôs probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  We‚Äôre out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor people‚Äôs kids not boil?  On top of that, there‚Äôs already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent.

That drive inevitably brings with it shades of narcissism and opportunism. So rather than fixating on intentions, it makes more sense to judge politicians by their results. On that front, Harka has proven he can deliver. His rough almost mobster-like style may be off-putting to some but in a city like Dharan which is home to hotheaded Kirati / Hill Janajati majority that kind of toughness isn‚Äôt just useful, it‚Äôs necessary.  That said, he is neither qualified nor capable enough to be considered an ‚Äòideal‚Äô Prime Minister. Nonetheless, when compared to Rabi Lamichhane Harka represents a comparatively more credible alternative.

Secondly, please ask your senior citizens or elders from a different generation. They have seen history and faced the consequences. The real issue is bringing change in the constitution, i.e., a representative should not be above a certain age and should be allowed to seek votes only for one term. Take that in writing from the concerned representative, live, and show it to the world clearly. Also, please do not discriminate by saying someone is from the ‚ÄúStone Age,‚Äù as such remarks can hurt the sentiments of people who are not from cities.|||Yes, I don't know what to.

            "body": "What comes next? The only reason Nepal isn't going through a complete currency de-valuation and a bank run is because of the rupee peg. We need to tread water carefully. (**Bank run**¬†is a situation where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a bank simultaneously, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or financial stability. This can lead to liquidity problems for the bank, as it may not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands. Bank runs can create a cycle of panic, potentially leading to the bank's failure.)  The real pain starts after the protests have calmed. Economic crash is certain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh both went through it. Stock market/real estate crash, inflation and what not.  Whoever takes charge next, likely Balen, will need to address the pointless 'Greater Nepal' rhetoric and become a moderate on this issue. Thanks to Trump, India-China relationship is stable for the first time in ages. The only way Nepal has a future is pledge allegiance to both neighbour's.  Bangladesh under Yunus has been a pain in the ass for India. Nepal cannot make the same mistake. Any wrong steps and a free floating Nepali rupee against the dollar would go from 140 now to 25,000 like similar countries in our GDP range. Probably worse since our economy is in much worse shape. ($1 = Lao Kip 21,631.66 LAK)  Nepal needs one stable leader for the next 40 yrs. No interim gov paving way for elections bullshit. Forget the democracy experiment.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.¬†¬† Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.¬†¬† Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||How credible is this info?|||Use bitchat for conversation.

If he gets an interim pm he probably won't hold a proper election for more than a year and will call every Nepali to rebuild all the buildings that got destroyed. He is the worst and most unprofessional option for the interim government. He is a power-hungry person. Don't forget how he won and became mayor. If he actually loves the country he would step out and urge the people to pressure the president into dissolving parliament. He has no qualifications to be a mayor and he is thinking about taking the pm. If he becomes the interim pm or any minister we know we have failed and  His so-called supporters I bet they don't know what an interim PM is, and their work is just like Harkey himself   Anyone supporting him on social media and protesting for him might be paid by him.

            "comments": "We are living in a moment where anger is boiling over. People are tired of corruption, censorship, and being silenced. Many of us are ready to take to the streets on Sept 8. But before we move forward, we must stop and think carefully.  History has shown us what happens when we rush in without preparation. In Bangladesh last year, in Sri Lanka not long ago, ordinary people gave their lives while corrupt leaders fled the country with protection and comfort. Their deaths were forgotten within weeks, while the guilty walked free. If we are not careful, Nepal risks becoming the next chapter in that same tragic story.  That is why this movement must be different. We cannot afford to be reckless. We must protect our people, keep our voices peaceful, and make sure the world is watching every step so that accountability cannot be erased.  Here is what we need to do before Sept 8:  * Get international human rights groups, UN observers, and peace monitors involved beforehand so there are eyes on the ground. * Publish clear and peaceful agendas so nobody can label us as rioters or mobs. * Document everything with photos, videos, and testimonies. Every arrest and every injury must be recorded and shared. * Avoid following local leaders who are affiliated with political parties. Big parties will try to infiltrate, hijack, and twist this movement for their own gain. * Know who is truly standing beside you. Trust matters because infiltrators can turn peaceful protests into chaos.  This movement is about dignity, rights, and accountability. It is not about violence. It is not about revenge. If we lose focus, if we let anger replace strategy, then we risk repeating the same cycle where the powerful walk free and ordinary people pay with their lives.  Nepal deserves better. The world must see us not as mobs, but as citizens united for freedom and justice. If we do this right, our voices will be impossible to silence. If we do this wrong, we risk being forgotten like so many before us.  Stay safe. Stay peaceful. Stay smart.",

She is the daughter of Chabi Rijal, a communist leader and Chief District Officer in Nepal, who recently ordered a shoot-on-sight against youth peacefully protesting corruption in Nepal. His orders have killed over 18 innocent people, injured more than 100 students, and more deaths are expected. This is pure fascism and a gross misuse of power. Young people in a peaceful protest were shot dead, which is totally unacceptable. While our brothers and sisters die in Nepal, Sweta Rijal has no right to study in the US with money from corruption. Her entire funding is from the money from corruption. The US, as a democratic country and a voice for the UN, stands for freedom and justice. Allowing her to stay contradicts everything the US represents. We are struggling to fight this battle in Nepal, and she must be held accountable. I urge you to investigate her visa and take necessary action to send her back to Nepal. Regards, Concerned Citizen from Nepal",

Many of us here are also frustrated by the opportunist media and some jerks. We do have misunderstandings and conflicts between but they should have been side lined at this critical moment. Even the people who are getting inspired and speaking in favour of your protest are getting back lash (and recently a person has been charged under the law by the police)because this protest turned violent but ik that wasn't intended. We can argue about the pros and cons but the fact that you stood up against the system is a big achievement and inspiration. I wish you great luck guys and hope you find a better system than the one you fought against and draw a milestone for us. Although I would say you have had a great loss of infrastructure which could have been avoided if the protest was properly managed.|||Abiskar Raut for POTUS  #RAUT2028|||Good speaker, I hope we learn a lot from him.|||Aja samma malai ni yo manchey(sudan gurung) ley miraj dhungana ley start gareko protest  lai hijack garera, sabai cerdit liyo vanney socheko thiye.

And the hotel was belonging of politicians son. So, they could have made fake protestor's to do it, to claim insurance?  Why are indian and nepalese are fighting here about this matter?? This isn't time for fighting.   And about destroying properties, there are theories that the protest were hijacked by other political parties. Like wise, about governments offices, they wanted to destroy the proofs of corruptions. And public building and properties was collateral damages for those fake protesters to look it real.

I think you've never seen what corruption can cause, or you pretend not to!  I'm from Brazil, and I'll give you an example of what corruption can do to a society.    Here, I saw young people being shot in favelas just for supporting opposition politicians, yes, ordinary people being killed for supporting the other side.  People were and are arrested, tortured, and killed on the unjust orders of corrupt politicians and judges.  The media, also corrupt, manipulates public opinion with false narratives or half-truths, always favoring the state, especially abroad. This has caused enormous polarization in the country, in addition to promoting many unjust laws.  My country is overrun by crime, and there are criminal factions that control entire regions (with the explicit support of the state), and you run a risk when you go out at night, you know? You can be robbed and killed at any moment, and nothing will be done to the criminal.  Education is also of extremely low quality, which has caused an absurd cultural and moral degradation among my people, who today lack even the capacity to think critically.  Salary increases for politicians without social approval are frequent here, and nothing happens. Search the amount of benefits they receive here.  We recently had a scandal involving millions of retirees being stolen against their will by banks and public agencies. What was the government's solution? To create more taxes to pay without punishing those who stole, and to try to inhibit investigations by using public funds to buy off those who would investigate. Search for \"INSS Scandal\".  The current president (rejected by the majority) has actively provoked other countries, especially the US, to create an open conflict between the two countries, precisely to use this as an excuse to remain in power while putting the lives of millions of people at risk.    Anyway, I could spend all day here giving examples of the harm corruption has caused in the society I live in. I recommend imagining how many future geniuses, entrepreneurs, inventors, and exemplary people for humanity could exist here, but won't, thanks to the corruption of some.  Imagine how prosperous societies would be if there weren't corrupt representatives making absurd and selfish decisions to benefit themselves and control others.    I understand that violence blinds people, and it's unpleasant to see someone in this situation, but we need to understand that in today's societies, we have two sides, one side that wants to live and enjoy life peacefully, and the other that wants to use your life to live like gods.   So, what would you prefer?    The people of Nepal are absolutely right to act as they are, and their politicians need to see what true justice is. They acted wrongly, harming thousands of people, and now they need to be punished, something that would never happen without the use of violence.   The corrupt state would never punish itself, and military forces serve and exist precisely to defend the state and its interests, meaning they would never be punished fairly, and even if they have surrendered, the disaster has already been caused, this surrender is just a way for them to try to avoid punishment, however, sooner or later, they will stab society in the back, and guess what, if society doesn't act, nothing will happen to them and their crimes!  Soon my country will go through something similar, and you will be able to see that it is not about revenge, it is about justice, something that unfortunately is disappearing in societies.  There's no point in trying to appear morally superior, evil people exist and will continue to commit atrocities, and if there are no violent reactions against them, everything will only get worse.|||Ajai kutnu partyo mardeko bhaye huntyo.

I am just a sincere, hardworking youth who remained silent because too many opinions create a ruckus. That's what I believed till September 8. When I went to the protest, it was all fine until they started firing. When you're in the battleground, all moralities go out the window. Yet, I did not throw a single stone at anyone and I am proud of that. I remained with the group who were peacefully protesting infront of the army van, I helped people with water to wash their face, tried picking up litters. The main point is I tried being a responsible person. But the moment I saw people being carried to the hospital with their blood spattering the streets, I fucking lost it. In retaliation, my protests became more louder. I came home late at night, tried my best to repost as many information I could. At one point, I felt like people should burn down the entire ministry down, all these nepo-babies should be brought to the streets to teach their parents how it feels to kill someone's child. I was furious, the word being an understatement. But seeing this people getting mob justice was what I never wanted. They don't deserve the least of anyone's sympathies, but we still have humanity in our hearts. That's what differs us from them.¬† I'm trying my best to control the narrative of why the protests happened, so that the opportunistic Indians, Chinese and the entire West may not take undue advantage of us. Please everyone don't let the President resign until a new government is formed. Protect the country. The damages are not done by Gen-z, they are done by the political goons.

Burning down Singha Durbar, one of Nepal's finest architecture. 2. Burning down Supreme Court and Nepal Rastra Bank and several others, 3. Destroying District Administrative Office, Regional Offices 4. Releasing Rabi Lamichhane, a corrupt politician without getting cleared by court 5. Releasing more than 40-50k criminals from jail all over the country WHO THE FUCK WILL TAKE DAMN RESPONSIBILITY IF SOME OF THOSE CRIMINALS, THIEVES, MURDERERS, RAPISTS, PSYCHOPATHS REDO ALL THOSE CRIMES AGAIN?   HOW MUCH PROTECTIVE OUR PARENTS, FAMILY AND SISTERS WILL FEEL NOW KNOWING JUST 1200 CRIMINALS ARE JUST RELEASED FROM THE JAIL NEARBY THEIR HOUSE?   DO YOU REALISE HOW MUCH VENGEANCE AND \"BADLA LINCHU\" IS FILLED IN THOSE GUYS AGAINST SOME PEOPLE?  6. Beating innocent people and harassing young girls by forcefully knocking at the girls hostels at several places.  7. Destroying banks and robbing those banks; sala khatey tw jo koi hos tw sachchai bhikari kai santaan raichas, tw muji lai kei pugeko narahecha jindagi ma, na ta kei ukhadnw nai sakis muji, tw muji lai ta aba MA PANI VANCHU yo sab kura tyo sab kura Bibek Thapaliya khatey le vaneko.  8.

You say their work has benefited generations ‚Äúlike me‚Äù but what about the millions still without quality education, clean water, jobs, or justice? If that legacy was truly built for the people, then why does inequality keep growing? Why is access to opportunity still limited to a select few families like yours?  No one is attacking your elders for their hard work but using that work to claim political or social superiority today is exactly the kind of dynastic thinking that holds progress back.

            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada‚Äôs classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.¬†  We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking‚Äìmuch to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in¬† Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate -¬†the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala‚Äôs approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.¬†  Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn‚Äôt mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‚Äòhelp‚Äô. One time, she even said airily, ‚ÄúI wash my own dishes, you know.‚Äù She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala‚Äìa beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth‚Äìlingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don‚Äôt intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‚Äònepo babies‚Äô who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).¬†  Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It‚Äôs a troubling idea to think that despite what‚Äôs happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

She was funded by her corrupt father.|||Wish we had more tea like this on all nepo babies.||| Damn I strictly feel its true|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn‚Äôt some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake ‚Äúbeauty with brains‚Äù narrative. Do you guys remember Niti‚Äôs big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let‚Äôs not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala‚Äôs prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it‚Äôs her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let‚Äôs be real- Sisan wasn‚Äôt perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they‚Äôd known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn‚Äôt even exist. This just proves it- they weren‚Äôt just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can‚Äôt just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala‚Äôs career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav‚Äôs narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What‚Äôs the lesson we can learn from here ?

Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don‚Äôt even make sense to begin with. Don‚Äôt know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don‚Äôt even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It‚Äôs so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It‚Äôs astounding what the world has come to and it‚Äôs deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can‚Äôt be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn‚Äôt she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It‚Äôs better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has.

When the news published, her father's reaction was something along the line of \"I didn't know, I was getting it. I am happy to return it.\"  Question for her, how come you dont know the source of wealth and your parent's ethics?

These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!! And the way she's silent when the country is bleeding says alottt too!!!!!!  And about the Nepal's government scholarship for harvard,this is not true, she is telling an entire different story about harvard scholarsip & how she paid fees there. She said she got 30% scholarship at harvard and the remaining 70% is paid through her brand endorsements money as she is brand ambassador to few company. We didnt buy that story, she tried hardest to sell it though and still fools people with this shitty madeup script about harvard's 30% scholarship & 70% funding through brand endorsement's money lmao. And lately she's being questioned on 50,000USD she got during miss world competition after winning \"beauty with the purpose\" title. Her ex exposed & questioned her in a very shady way and because of him we all knew this new layer of truth and i highly doubt it went on harvard's funding rather than for actual purpose|||But guys, the 50000 dollars which apparently Shrinkhala and Anuska got, why didnt we know about it earlier? Didnt Dabur Miss Nepal know? Was the money given to them in their personal account or was it provided through Dabur Miss Nepal? This needs to be investigated imo.|||tyasko insta ma followers 899k ma pugi sakyo. Continue on --|||I have a similar story like Shrinkhala‚Äôs on Nepal‚Äôs current president‚Äôs granddaughter (he has 4 and i‚Äôm talking about the one studying at the University of Texas in Austin). Its not easy to get in there and even if you do its one of the expensive schools there. Talking about her Nepal bachelor‚Äôs days, my friends studied with her in KU in nepal in b. arch, and so many said she cheated on exams (A LOT) just to pass. later she worked for the nepal government and came to US for conferences and presentations ü§°. now she has started her master‚Äôs at UT austin, funded by corrupted money. she removed her instagram posts about her prior foreign visits and her recent UT Austin orientation day, and even deactivated her linkedin account.  Now she‚Äôs posting on instagram and facebook, after the new PM was appointed, congratulating her and thanking the president grand dad for this revolution. it‚Äôs crazy how these unethical people still have the audacity to do all this.  (Source: from college friends and family members, and as those of us who are directly impacted by this revolution in nepal, we are not going to stay quiet against corruption and the unethical hypocrisy going on for a long time)|||Glad you shared this all.

I also studied in the states and I know how expensive it can get.   So how did she funded her education considering Harvard which is an ivy league school is extremely costly and on top of that, her lifestyle itself is on the high end. So..  In that case, even you since you studied in Harvard. How did you fund your education?  Just curious. A reply will be great since there are hundred of replies.|||Remember that education in Nepal is based on how well you do...based on your caste. I have heard that a lot of exams are predetermined by the ruling caste. This corruption is so bad that even well-educated people are falsely given a bad grade. While the latter is given a high passing grade. This type of discrimination is not only evil but can takes one's life. HK student commit suicide because of academic pressure.

I always wondered if she was true to her image.   At the end of the day she got into Harvard. I think her winning Ms Nepal helped; also her access to many social works would have helped with her application. But still getting into Harvard is not a small feat- so she must have some intellectual capacity to get picked by the best educational institutions in the world.|||[deleted]|||Still Beautiful though",

I mean gross national happiness instead of gross national product. I believe every single country on this planet should take Bhutan as a role model a little bit more. Where else in the world are citizens asked what their main problems are and what they want from the government? And later, citizens are asked how satisfied they were with the government's performance. I know it's a bit naive of me to make such a suggestion from afar, as a sheltered European who is not really familiar with the form of government in Nepal. But it seems to be similar in many, many countries. Those in power often hold office and positions of honor for decades through their family ties. And they are similar in their decadence. The most expensive clothes, the biggest cars, houses, and palaces. Flying to New York for dinner in a private jet, or to Monaco for F1, or around the globe in a yacht as long as a soccer field. And in the media, they try to appear close to the people, to be there for them, to advance the country by investing in infrastructure or new hospitals, etc. But no, a large part of your taxes ends up with the rulers themselves. The rich and powerful acquire more wealth and more power. Money rules the world! Unfortunately.|||You brutal f*cks you brutally killed the PM's wife burned her down you merciless pigs, you beat the president ruthlessly, have some shame on you, couldn't do a peaceful protests or you have to change government every few years, maybe it was corrupt, but mostly u all were funded by CIA and the US|||These kind of toolkit and hate spreaders are what you need to avoid",

This is literally just her side of the story. Anyone can sit behind a keyboard, write a long emotional post, and instantly turn public opinion against someone. That doesn‚Äôt make it the full truth.  We‚Äôve seen this before ‚Äî remember the Sandeep Lamichhane case? A girl accused him, media and public went wild, and people treated him as guilty before trial. Later, so many loopholes came out. It‚Äôs the same pattern here ‚Äî society naturally sides with the girl because we have an inbuilt bias that says ‚Äúthe girl must be the victim.‚Äù But is that always true? No.  Let‚Äôs also not ignore that sometimes girls do play emotional games. They ghost, they manipulate, they test how much a guy will ‚Äúchase‚Äù them ‚Äî and when he does, suddenly it becomes ‚Äústalking.‚Äù Where‚Äôs the line? Maybe she had past relationships, maybe she‚Äôs not telling the full story about her own actions that led to this fallout. Why should we blindly believe only her narrative and not even question what really happened?  And now people are targeting not just him, but also his family. That‚Äôs disgusting. Whatever the issue is between two individuals, why should parents, brothers, or sisters be dragged into it? People forget that when you destroy someone online, you destroy their whole family‚Äôs dignity too.  Everyone‚Äôs commenting with sympathy for her and anger towards him. But let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî most of that is just because she‚Äôs a girl and he‚Äôs a guy. If the genders were reversed, would people still believe the story this blindly? I doubt it.  Look, if he‚Äôs actually guilty of harassment, the law should punish him. No question about that. But until then, it‚Äôs not fair to publicly assassinate someone‚Äôs character based on one-sided claims. Social media is not a courtroom, and we shouldn‚Äôt let feelings override facts.|||:D|||https://www.facebook.com/share/1JV5hYfP6t/?mibextid=wwXIfr  don‚Äôt bully her. Only message her.

We keep repeating the same mistakes because people get blinded by shiny new faces and ignore anyone who actually knows what they‚Äôre doing. Experience doesn‚Äôt mean someone is corrupt it means they‚Äôve been in the trenches and survived. Throwing it away just to see if a ‚Äúfresh face‚Äù can magically save everything is how you crash a country.  Nepal isn‚Äôt a playground. Leadership isn‚Äôt about hype, popularity, or being young and ‚Äúgreen.‚Äù It‚Äôs about surviving the chaos, making tough decisions, and knowing where the landmines are.

Even if they have the intention and will to do so (like many of us want), they do not know how to run a country. I see them as ineffective in running even a municipality (maybe that was because of politics and in-cooperation from party elected ward heads). The thing is they have a lot more to learn and they will, with time.       This situation would not have happened if there were transfer of power to youth in timely manner. Now the rising youth leaders do not have experience because these corrupt politicians did not allow that.      What we need is a system where corruption should now be absolutely dreaded, seeing how corrupt politicians had to run away for thier life. They have to realize that people will not just punish the corrupt polticians, they will also punish whoever was responsible to prevent that.       There now needs to be a collaborative development with young leaders like Balen and experienced people like Sushila. Each and everyone's characters will show with time, for now, we have to seek for stability as soon as possible.|||If we fail to appoint her then external along with internal force will play and bring more chaos to the country.

I truly want Sushila Karki to be prime minister, but according to our constitution it's not possible. And if we ditch our constitution our country is open for invasion from other countries. So, what's the best option it's BALEN. I know that he won't be able to run for prime minister for the next election but it is a risk we have to take. It's already proven that our protest was the result of different politicians 'parties'involvement. So, let's play it safe and try to choose the best result for us. Already many Indian politicians are saying that they are ready to deploy an army if needed. It's not goodwill but an invasion. So it's best we know what we do for the country.  But if it's possible for her to be prime minister without disturbing our constitution then I'm all for it. I also want a good leader who will work for the development of the country.   Indian is already eyeing the district like Lipilekh and Limpadhura. If we take too long to make a responsible decision, they are favourites to win the case.   The country is already in chaos. So we must do our best to calm it down. We protested against corruption and got unexpected results. We are not ready for it. And we don't have time to think about it and make a decision. But, we must make a decision and make it work, isn't it all there is to it ?    It's not that I don't support \"Sushila Karki\" . She has my full support. But if it is disturbing our core rules set by our constitution. I just thought it isn't right. So it's my request all my fellow citizens ( not just gen-z ) to make a right decision.   But my final warning is that if we defy our current constitution ourselves. It will not be a suprise other countries take advantage of it. So we shall make a decision ourselves and take the best route possible. But you've my support to make her ( Sushila Karki) intrim prime minister. It is the best result seeing her experience on political field.   It might have been a bit long for the attention span of gen-z but i just want to say that, neither the constitution nor the national rules be any shorter üòä.

That one sentence hit me harder than anything in my life. We complain about traffic, money, stress, politics but here was a man who just wanted to feel human again.  When I left, my hands were empty, but my heart was heavy. That day I realized poverty is not only about money. The biggest poverty is being unseen, unloved, and forgotten.  Ratnapark overbridge will never look the same to me again. Today, that beggar gave me more than I gave him. He gave me a reminder: be kind, because sometimes even a small smile can save someone‚Äôs broken soul.",

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.¬†¬† Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.¬†¬† Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||Jaha Bhetyo tehi thok saley madarchod lai...|||Aaos na india ma ni nepali xan birsyo kya|||Bro timro yo pic use garey haii Tiktok ma vid halchu|||kun desh jala teta bebasta garnu parxa|||yo machikne lai samatna paryo jasari bhaye ni yellai bachne kunai adhikar xaina|||Bhagey ra canada nai ja la, canada ma nee xodnu hudaina.

I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both.

She is the one who has been abroad for so long and has so many foreign connections and relations that even if she  doesn't want interference, there will be far more foreign interference with her as a leader.

BTW, Gen Z doesn‚Äôt just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didn‚Äôt exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who weren‚Äôt even present for the protests claim we don‚Äôt know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldn‚Äôt even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, ‚ÄòWe have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server you‚Äôre all listening to is just for public discussion‚Äô. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal. Now that it‚Äôs been confirmed everywhere and with Balen posting that the Gen Z‚Äôs choice former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Sushila Karki is the right choice for interim prime minister of Nepal, we look forward to what comes next.|||https://new-nepal-voting.vercel.app/  Vote here or suggest names I can add|||For interim formation CJ Sushila Karki would be the perfect choice.

Even when we look at history of the world, majority of peaceful protest start peaceful and end violently. No entity in power ever gives it up easily.  Change was what we asked for and change is what we are getting.

Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? I‚Äôve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we can‚Äôt let our nation fail.** We can‚Äôt let our nation burn. We can‚Äôt let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**¬†    **1) We lay down our weapons.**¬†  We came in peace, we protested in peace, and we‚Äôve always wanted peace.

The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.¬†    **3) We wear white.**¬†  White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that we‚Äôve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.¬†    **4) We have hope.**¬†  Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.¬†    Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.¬†    Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.¬†    Sincerely,¬†  Pantji, a Gen-Z¬†|||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us.

The president on her cabinet's recommendation dissolves the house of Representatives, 5. Her cabinet carries forward the corruption investigation and reconstruction. 6. The elections will be declared immediately. 7. The new parliament decides the constitutional amendments. (directly elected prime minister etc. and others ) 8.

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen.

If the government wants registration, fine ‚Äî negotiate with Google, set up rules, whatever. But don‚Äôt cut off an entire nation from one of the most important platforms on the internet.

            "body": "Let me get straight to the point.  Nepal has a multy-party parliamentary system, which means it is a mixed election system. Which means when we vote, we vote for two things. One for the 165 candidates who are elected directly (first-past-the-post), other for the party. The votes that party gets determine the remaining 110 members via proportional representation.  so aba either we need new political parties to replace the existing ones by Falgun 21, or we have to vote for the same parties again. This is more complicated because Nepal is not just Kathmandu. The political players which we have termed jholey will be active outside Kathmandu.   So if we need the change in constitution, we have to be more careful. The mandates of the movement are more at risk now than before.",
