When the school reopened, they found the poor child's dead body. Apparently it happened 10 to 11 years ago in ktm.   Is this story true? If it is true it is truly horrifying. I started suffocating just thinking about it. How painful it must have been for that child.  I did some research and found this documentry called \"Kakhara\". The documentry is apparently based on the incident mentioned above. The date matches too. As of now you cant find the full documentry.  i found info abt this documentry in a website called \"Glamour nepal\".  Does anyone know more about this ?",

I managed to grow an Instagram page in the entertainment and infotainment niche to over 55K followers, and even built a small SaaS website for my audience. I was really excited to try something new, but after losing $10 on a domain, I had to pause it for now. Still, it was a fun project and I learned a lot from it.  As a content creator, I don‚Äôt think I wasted my time at all. I got hands-on experience with Canva, video editing, and engaging with my audience. I even collaborated with an app (though I didn‚Äôt get paid), but it helped me understand how brand deals work. Later, I built and deployed a subscription-based website but never launched it because I doubted if anyone would actually pay for it.  I also tried posting on Facebook as i was eligible for monetization, but things didn‚Äôt go as expected. None of my 25‚Äì30 posts or reels even crossed 100 views, and more than half got copyright claims. It was a bit frustrating, especially since I was used to getting 8‚Äì53 million monthly views on Instagram.  Now I‚Äôm just looking for a job where I can use the skills I‚Äôve learned: content creation, photo and video editing, Canva, social media growth, content strategy, and web development. I‚Äôve learned how to understand audience behavior, spot trends early, and manage online communities, and I‚Äôm excited to bring all that experience into a real job.",

And if it‚Äôs about preserving family prestige, shouldn‚Äôt the country come before prestige?  Moreover, monarchy is not a sustainable system in today‚Äôs world. It concentrates power in one family instead of giving citizens a voice. Democracy, on the other hand, ensures that leadership is chosen by the people and held accountable to them. If we truly want progress and justice, elections are the only fair and transparent way to choose our leaders ‚Äî not by returning to an unelected rule of the past.",

One advice that always resounded to me by a friend was \"So you think life's unfair? There's people that haven't been a kilometer within to a chau chau wrapper. So next time you resort to it, learn to put your head down, and look for that light in the end of the tunnel\". I'm afraid I'm in no position to type in devnagiri, but it sounded even more rousing in Nepali.  Your mileage may vary. But acknowledging you have a chance to make something out of yourself is concrete, palpable, and actionable.  Make no mistake, I hate mincing words: when depressed, remember all the lives that are designated to a mere existence, not the ones that thrive. It'll remind you to be motivated enough to put yourself out of that circumstance.  Here's an advice: Get to a point where you're able to self sustain. Sure, the few years are going to suck, but you'll be happier. Move out of there asap.|||There are people who actually read it all. Leave it be such comments. Rant here often and vent it out , take advice  If it's the environment that's toxic to you , you have no option but to have acceptance of it being such and then changing the very environment is the only way you can thrive again in life .  You have to find the way out . Make the change . Be determined.  The darkness and spiral of depressive mind will try to bring things down but you have to be stronger than that. There is no other way .

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can‚Äôt get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

            "comments": "No. The reforestation campaign in Nepal has been really exemplary. The concept of Community Forests has been modal and it has had a massive impact on the  green coverage. The funding that has been availed through Carbon Purchase as well as NGOs and INGOs have also played a critical role. I don't remember exactly, but UNDP or something published a really great report on the success of community forests and improvement of forested areas in Nepal.   Actually Nepal despite everything and has had excellent metrics when it comes to nature and biodiversity conservation.|||Folks who grew up in the 90s may remember efforts put into forest conservation through media. Maha Jodi ko BannPale. Impressionable ads like an old woman carrying doko vari ko daura and wondering ‚ÄúAja lai ta taryo voli k garne?‚Äù We have done a lot in the field of forest and wildlife conservation. Amidst all the negative things lets commend ourselves on this for once. Hamro Community based Forest Preservation program (Samudayik Bann) is a leading example in the world.|||\"Hariyo ban Nepal ko dhan\" massive initiative is Main reason. This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it. You can hear the news for development work and of NEA cannot cut down the trees easily, yup that is because of same strong protective law.|||It‚Äôs because of movement of people and reliance on gas, concrete instead of timber.|||No , it‚Äôs a result of migration of people from hills to concentrated cities and Terai .

And yet the old generation say that ‚Äòsabai forest fadisakyo‚Äô or say ‚Äòpaila kati hariyali thiyo‚Äô. However I‚Äôd say it needs more effort and forest fire is a serious issue.|||Here's an in-depth international piece on it from NZ's MƒÅori television:   https://www.teaonews.co.nz/2023/04/22/re-greening-a-country-the-story-of-nepals-community-forests/|||what about terai ko char koshe jhadi?|||Kehi Haina aajkal maanxe haru hills xodera flat Tira migration vaye, gas maa reliant vaye , Gai goru, bhaisi paalna xode.

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts. So, yeah definitely a result of afforestation but there is more to this and would be a great topic to delve deep into.|||It‚Äôs meant to highlight the loss of ice and glaciers.

They called the ‚Äúearn and learn‚Äù program an internship, likely just to bypass foreign employment laws. In reality, it was pure exploitation. From what I‚Äôve read, students were made to work five days a week in questionable conditions and study only one. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.  I just hope this changes with the new government.|||i thought hamas was fighting gaza right after they kill him i think they just sick isreal PM both are shit they just want control people.. fucking hate hamas|||Sad|||I'm Israeli, sadly his DNA was diagnosed and was believed to die in the first months of the war R.I.P Bipin|||Vayo vayo pugyo,  He is dead, confirmed by Israel and hamas both.

Over time, they blended with Magars, Gurungs, Tamangs, Tharus, Newars, Rai, Limbu  everyone. Nepal‚Äôs always been a crossroads, not one ethnicity.  Even though most of us are Hindu, our culture feels different  the way we celebrate Dashain and Tihar, our food, our family values. Historically, Nepal meant the Kathmandu Valley, the Newar homeland, while the hills were a buffer between Tibet and the plains. Our roots have always been both Indo-Aryan and Tibeto-Burman.  I get what the OP means in a modern sense, Nepali and Indian identities are different. I studied in India, and the culture there feels more urban, loud, individualistic, while Nepal‚Äôs is quieter, collective, shaped by the mountains.  India itself is diverse Kashmiri to Tamil, Kerala Muslim to Bengali Muslim, Bihari to Rajput   all different.

India is one of the most diverse countries in the world.   The culture of Uttarakhand is indistinguishable from the culture of Sudurpaschim and adjacent regions.   Same goes with culture of Sikkhim, Bengal and Eastern Nepal.   Your definition of Nepal is very narrow and shows that you only think of Terai and Madesh as different while the rest of Nepal as a monolith.|||Why do you think only Madesh has similar culutre to India? We all celebrate Dashain and Tihar(dfferent reason and rituals). Our family values are similar when it comes to education, marriage and relatives and elders. Our spending patterns are similar. Our language in structure are also similar. (Compare nepali to chinese or english that would be different).    India itself is a diverse country which makes it impossible to generalise it. So comparing nepal to one part of India is a statistical error. As Nepal borders with Tibet, its influence is observed in our culture and becasue Northern Nepal is hilly contrast to plains in south, lifestyle changes to adapt to it. But it is again similar to people in Uttarakhand or Northeast India.|||Depends on what part of India you are referring to? India is extremely diverse and Nepali culture - as it is - is more similar to Indian Culture than culture can be between different parts of India. Remember, the India we think of today is British India, but before that Nepal was no different than any other kingdom in the Indian subcontinent. Our festivals, rituals and customs are the same with superficial regional differences. Buddha and Sita both associated with India were Nepali. We are the same people, same broad culture just different nationalities.|||Compared to everyone else like west, China, Pakistan and stuff. Our culture is more similar. Maybe that is the reason.|||Because Nepalese copies indians and indian culture, it's that simple. Just like India people here are also brainrot.

Flavors changes but that changes even between families living 2 houses apart. Such is the diversity.  Architecture is similar. Pahadi architecture is shared across India/Nepal, Plain area architecture is also shared across both countries.  Ofcourse we are more influenced to tibetan culture compared to India as a whole.

But I have found that Pahadi people of India are calmer still and south indians (had lived in Karnataka for education) are also calmer. Only hot heads were in the northern plains of India.  \\*\\*Nepal is different to India only and only due to its Nationalism\\*\\*. Kind of like Germany and Switzerland.  So, let Indians think we are similar because we are. But that does not mean Nepal = India.|||You described Nepal like we were people that have our own unique culture and way of life etc etc  But then tied to to tibetan culture like it was a major contributor  I don't believe that at all, as mentioned above I think we nepali have our own way   Speaking of influence, indian influence is def higher than tibetan cultureüòÇ|||anything to justify greater Indiaüôè",

            "body": "Hello guys, I travel alot and here are some tips i collected from my experience to get cheap flights and save cost in travel.   1. Don‚Äôt book to KTM, book round trip to and from Delhi and do self transfer(meaning get separate ticket to delhi to ktm). Usually it unlocks more number of airlines and likely to get a cheaper deal.   Same applies to cheap destinations like Thailand. You can get an e visa easily and then do self transfer there as well. It costs $35 dollars for e-visa but you will get better deals in flights. Also thai air asia launched flights to BWA as well, so people going to western nepal, this could be better option.  this wont show in google flights cause it requires visa but its very easy to get.   recently i had booked usa - bangkok - usa (two way) and then bangkok - nepal - bangkok(two way) making usa-nepal round trip under $700. including two single entry visa $70.  2. Websites like skiplagged or sky scanner shows you the most optimal flights based on prices and duration, but remember to not book it from there. only use them to see prices. Use the official website to book.    3. never search up flights in official websites unless you are going to book cause the moment you will close the tab, they will price hike it. thats why use other third party or incognito google flights to do price search.   4. international students can get discount if you use student universe app (now called byo jet or sthm like that). you need to verify yourself as student tho. but remember that your credit card cashback will only be  1% if you use this. but if you had used official website, it could be upto 5%. so calculate this and only use student universe discount if it is cheaper than normal cashback.   5. if you dont have a travel credit card, apple cash (tap pay) (if you are iphone user) works with no foreign transaction fee anywhere in the world. it does not have cashback tho but you can use it to pay anything outside your country. works in nepal too, bhatbhateni, restaurants, daraz delivery, etc. exchange rate is realtime price.   6. domestic flights during festivals, when flights to and from ktm is expensive, you can try to do alternative airports as well.   example. this dashain, ktm to bhairahawa was 8500 but KTM to Pokhara was 4200, and Pokhara to Bhairahawa was 3200. total 1100 cheaper. I did this and chilled in pokhara with my friends for 2 hours (layover lol). (this is subjective and prices are subject to change. just giving you idea to look for options cause there are flights from pokhara to/from bhairahawa, bharatpur and nepalgunj).",

            "comments": "Awesome pointers. Thanks for sharing|||I agree with you. Also skyscanner has an option to use flexible date or even select a month for departure and return and then you can select different dates to see which combination will have the cheapest option.   Also to add what OP as listed. When you transfer make sure to check your luggage options. For example - you bought 2 different tickets, and self transferring in Delhi. Make sure that the Delhi to KTM leg has the same luggage options. Your flight between the USA and Delhi will probably have 2x23 kg check in luggage and you used both. But usually the DEL-KTM leg will only have 20 kg or something like that. You will have to pay for rest or perhaps buy second baggage. Also you will have to collect your luggage , pass through immigration and then re check in. Make sure to have a good amount of time.   Also if your first leg gets delayed/canceled, you might miss your second leg and airline is not responsible so it's important to give yourself time.   This is a good option if you travel light or alone. What OP has suggested is a good travel hack.   For skiplag, most of the time you need to travel with carry on only since you are likely to skip the second leg.|||Indian Airport ma Nepali ko lagi NOC haru chaine testo kei ta hudaina ni?

These days though, it feels like the soul of the city is dying. It‚Äôs increasing in population but decreasing in quality of life and peace of living.     * People spit gutka and paan everywhere.    * Public and private sector staff often act like they‚Äôre doing you a favor instead of just doing their job.    * Basic civic sense is missing.    * Many people talk in a rude way, even though Maithili itself is such a sweet language.    * Hospitality is terrible. Even in well-known restaurants, you don‚Äôt get a menu. You have to call staff multiple times, and when they finally come, they‚Äôre rude.    * Local leaders and youth behave like they own the place and can do whatever they want.    * Loud music in public transport and public spaces is normal.    * People get aggressive and start fights very quickly.    * If a policeman tries to enforce basic civic sense (like asking not to play loud music), people threaten him ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôll burn your police station.‚Äù * One time, Janakpur was known for quality education. Now it feels like the complete opposite. And the list goes on. Why don‚Äôt the people and leaders of Janakpur want to learn from other places? Why isn‚Äôt civic sense a priority for the local government? Why can‚Äôt people just be calm and respectful?",

There are two prophecies in the bible.  1. Jesus will return in an event called the Armageddon.  2. There will be a millennia of \"kingdom of heaven on earth\".  But there is disagreement in the order. One believes jesus will return before the millennium are called **pre** millennials, another believes jesus will return after the millennium are called **post** millennials. Both of them want jesus to come back.  To make this happen post millennials work towards the project of this kingdom. Missionary activity is that. They are trying to take over the world, and after a thousand years of that, Jesus will come back. Which is also how Christianity was used to justify imperialism back in the day.  Pre millennials are terrifying. They want to enact this Armageddon. Which is when there is an armed conflict in the valley of Megiddo, in Israel**.** And look at whats happening in that region.  I used to think the hindu idea of every next yug getting worse is bad because it develops an apathy in people. But Christianity is impressive, their prophecies affect real world geopolitics.|||Christian here. I can‚Äôt say for all - many believe that sharing good idea with people will be worth. It‚Äôs like this is one life - so if the truth of Christianityis right then all people should hear the truth.  Now, i understand some come from weird style and approach. I get the frustuation. But the thing is many want people to know what their belief system is and this is a part of ‚Äúparticing their religious acts‚Äù like same as with worshipping in temple - take it as a ‚Äúto do‚Äù for religious duty. Now, there are some sects of hinduism that does this. People of Iscoon - they reinterpret every portion of bhagwat geeta and then mix every religion truth into it. Ask any higher pandit who has good academics in hinduism and see how they cringe on the iscoon and harey krishna movements. My grandfather was a hindu sscholar and knew sanskrit from the bottom from his heart  Be aware of people with korean face who preach christianity- those are funded and have huge cultic around.|||No religion is perfect. Evey religion has bad sides . I dont like christianity but Christ. Read about Christ and His sacrifice and see for yourself if He moves your heart. John 3:16 ‚ÄúFor God so loved the world (you and i) that He gave His only begotten son , that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life)  I personally became a follower of Christ by choice no one forced. I am a business owner i dont depend on anyone‚Äôs donation. I believe every soul has empty wound . Being spiritually awakened and renewed mindset through the words of Christ helps me become a better person and better decision making. You can get better business principles ,leadership principles, life principles in the Bible. Before we judge anyone . Taste for yourself and Read one chapter of proverbs everyday and see if your life would not change within a month or two.|||Western culture dekhi inspired vako xan dherai Jana testai LAI follow garxan they think yo caste  bhanna le Hindu other's ramro hudainw and want others to follow their  path because they can control be the leader|||Let us look at the main source, the bible itself. It is very clear that it commands Christians to 'share the good news' (Matthew 28:19-20) but the bible is clearly against bribery as written in Exodus 23:8. There is also a popular \"prosperity gospel\" which is a distortion of the bible and has given Christianity a bad reputation.   Onto the 'why, what benefit would the normal christians get from me converting to Christianity': The fundamental reason is that the bible says we all have sinned against God (Romans 3:23), doing the things we knew were evil. Now, compared to Hinduism which has a karma system, Christianity has a justice-grace system that is more tied to how courts work, which requires for punishment of sins/crimes and makes the sacrifice of Jesus necessary.¬† Thus, those who believe it to be true want to make it known to others for belief that it will save their souls.",

It bases its response on the chat, says yes then gives an emoji thats close to sea or horse. in older versions of chat gpt it would just give a random emoji and finish the sentence right there, but now there seems to be some kind of check to verify what its saying.  If you dont know, then the seahorse emoji is a widely known Mandela effect. so its very likely there are many private messages where people are discussing it in the fashion i described, so its natural it is also affected by Mandela effect.|||https://preview.redd.it/m0n9cn8judvf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b04215b0d5ee1711d59b9ba4c8f54c1e0f907b20  Mine just crashedüòî|||Chat gpt Lear's fast it's might not be the like this rn|||[https://chatgpt.com/s/t\\_68f36d221e848191993b9565a86a170d](https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68f36d221e848191993b9565a86a170d)   Gave u the link u can see it if u like   it went on loop|||I asked why did you do that and it went again|||It is showing you Magic..xD|||https://preview.redd.it/27kbc9w4s2vf1.jpeg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44171fe40196cb403bdd8e61df2c83b0d794bd82  Uhhh...

Honestly, that's only realistic if you have insane discipline. Those suggesting it are forgetting what it's like to be a complete beginner, they're just projecting their current knowledge onto you.  In a world full of distraction like now, starting with something boring takes extraordinary discipline and I wouldn't trust myself with that.  Start with high level languages instead, especially something visual like web development. Learn html, css, js,  you'll actually see what you're building, which is much more fun.  Once you've got the basics down, set up a proper dev environment. Your desk, theme, and editor actually matter. There are phases where coding gets boring sometimes and having a setup you love makes it easier to show up. When you need a break, customize your theme or tweak your workspace. Then jump back into coding.

If i had too start a tech journey, probably  1. Become good/decent in one language(python/javascript), no c,c++,go,rust 2. learn a backend framework and learn to do basic crud stuff, use database 3. learn frontend and become full stack or  learn linux, web server, basic deployment stuffs and choose the path of cracked backend developer with stacking devops stuffs. 4. Learn cloud, containerization, application monitoring.  Btw, if you are disciplined enough, don't waste 4 yrs of cs,    you can learn the above stuffs in around 1.5-2yrs if you push yourself reguraly,   you probably won't be able to follow through all the stuffs i've mentioned due to time/energy constraint while doing cs stuff. 80-90% cs stuff is absolute bullshit(outdated, non-marketable, non-comprehensible, trivial), you'll regret joining cs after couple of years,   bookmark this comment.|||There is no perfect roadmap  Explore gara.

But I think it really depends on what programming means to you. If you feel cs is just writing code in a company or making aandha paisa, then definitely you should learn those things that will land you a job faster, and a high level is the best way there. But if you are a person who loves to scratch things and is very enthusiastic about this domain, and you like to explore more, then I would suggest going with low level ( i.e., C programming). I also saw someone saying C feels boring, but that's not the case if you are actually interested and want to learn, not for the sake of others or to find a job, but because you want to have strong fundamentals in computer science. I learned C as my first programming language, and I didn't learn it in school; I didn't learn the way that schools teach C. If you learn the way school teaches, then it's definitely boring, and you never get to know how deep yet simple the language is, and how fun it can be. The most interesting and fun days of my programming career were those when I was doing low level programming. I am not saying you can't have fun solving problems in high-level languages, but i feel when you move towards the corporate world or you do something you love as a career/work for others, then I don't think it still sparks in your face. I am not saying you can't enjoy it, many people do actually enjoy it very much, but I find it draining, and THAT'S A PERSONAL VIEW|||Lean AI & ML.

I was really excited to try something new, but after losing $10 on a domain, I had to pause it for now. Still, it was a fun project and I learned a lot from it.  As a content creator, I don‚Äôt think I wasted my time at all. I got hands-on experience with Canva, video editing, and engaging with my audience. I even collaborated with an app (though I didn‚Äôt get paid), but it helped me understand how brand deals work.

I also tried posting on Facebook as i was eligible for monetization, but things didn‚Äôt go as expected.

Yes this is ai generated for proper english and summarization.     Google **discovered** my pages but **wouldn‚Äôt index** them. After some digging, here‚Äôs what I found and how I fixed it.    # üí• The Problems  1. **404s on deep links** ‚Äì `/blog/post` returns 404 because GitHub Pages only serves static files. 2. **Empty HTML for crawlers** ‚Äì SPA loads `<div id=\"root\"></div>` first, no content. 3. **Bad meta tags** ‚Äì my build still used `localhost` URLs.  # üß© My Solution  Couldn‚Äôt use `react-snap` (React 19 issues), so I wrote a custom pre-rendering pipeline.  **Stack:** React 19 + Vite 7 + Puppeteer 24 + GitHub Pages  **Key steps**  * **404.html redirect hack:** custom file that redirects `/blog/post` ‚Üí `/?redirect=/blog/post`, React then restores the route with `history.replaceState`. * **Puppeteer pre-rendering:** after build, launches a headless browser, visits each route, waits for render, saves full HTML to `dist/blog/{slug}/index.html`. * **Auto sitemap:** built from my blog data array.  **Build pipeline:**      npm run deploy     ‚Üí vite build     ‚Üí puppeteer pre-render (13 routes ‚âà30 s)     ‚Üí generate sitemap     ‚Üí gh-pages -d dist       # ‚úÖ Results  * Every page now has full HTML before hydration * Google shows ‚ÄúPage can be indexed‚Äù * Deep links work (no 404s) * Correct canonical + OG tags * 13 routes built in \\~30 s  # üîç What I‚Äôm Asking  1. **Scaling:** Pre-render is sequential (2‚Äì3 s / route). Ideas for parallel or incremental builds? 2. **Content storage:** Posts currently in one JS array ‚Äî split JSON per post or use a CMS? 3. **Approach:** Is Puppeteer pre-rendering worth it vs moving to Next.js / Remix? 4. **SEO:** What else should I add beyond sitemap + OG + canonical + JSON-LD?",

For parents and in general in Nepal, fons which can be repaired easily are good in general. In that case Samsung fons are most repairable and easy to find parts in Nepal. It's better that fon does not break but that's like saying everything is forever. Samsung it is.  Also better you give them options.

I had the same dilemma a month ago on same price range and decided on Redmi note 14 5g, loved the 144hz and is smooth in everything, camera has OIS and is decent. The downside would be bit of bloatware and ads here and there, which you can easily disable.|||Depends on how old your dad is and how much he understands tech. For me I would go with Samsung the OS is just too easy. Looking into specs won't matter if they arent that tech savy. Get a phone which is repairable easy to use and reliable.

Like for the nord phone there was no music player app, I had to install Third party app and they all have ads and its hard to use. So keep those knto considerations as well.|||if you want earlier version then redmi14 5G is good and if you are okay with slightly older version, still not much older redmi.note 13 5G don't buy infinix , as samsung only have UI good , I don't feel anything is good about Samsung.|||Dude looking like your Dad is hardcore Gamer|||Zenfone aka fon. don't follow the crowd dumb fuck|||Ma sanga A15 chai xa.

I know current governement wont investigate genz \"leaders\" but next gov should launch serious investigations on these people as well. Though one might argue at there is difference between violence caused by those in power and those fighting against people in power but even then accountability doesnt just vanishes, this is the reason ghost of 17k still looms over prachanda, prachanda was also fighting for \"people\" but he is still accused of being a mass murderer, gyanendra shah is as much of a murderer as is prachanda. But this point isnt brought up as much, when discussing the civil war.

Silent on Bangladesh Hindus raped and displaced, Boko Haram‚Äôs 35,000+ murdered Nigerian Christians, or Yazidis and Kurds erased by ISIS. Middle Eastern Christians? Down 90% from bombings and beheadings. No hashtags for them or Bipin, just trendy anti-Israel chants. Islam‚Äôs radicals push ‚Äúfinal truth‚Äù and jihad, yet apologists pretend it‚Äôs all a misunderstanding. That denial got Bipin killed, lets grooming gangs thrive, and leaves our temples trashed. Nepal deserves better.  TL;DR: Bipin‚Äôs death, UK grooming gangs, and Islam‚Äôs defenders ignoring ‚Äúradicals‚Äù expose the hypocrisy, while ‚ÄúFree Palestine‚Äù fakes ignore Hindu, Christian, and minority genocides.

Fk the hypocrites fk Trump ani f*k all the so-called peacekeepers playing politics while our people die.  We will never forget how the Nepali government back then tyo randi ‡§Ü‡§∞‡§ú‡•Å ‡§∞‡§æ‡§£‡§æ, ‡§¶‡•á‡§â‡§µ‡§æ at the Foreign Ministry  along with so-called hypocrites like Trump, the Islamic Hamas and Israel‚Äôs diplomatic games all played their cards to let Bipin Joshi be lost.|||**They¬†may say that Islam is a peaceful religion. I don‚Äôt know the exact philosophy of the religion or the teachings of the Quran, but based on what I see in many Islamic countries and among some Muslim communities, Islam is the most violent and intolerant religion in the world. Muslims struggle to coexist peacefully with other religions and never accept religious diversity (The same case with the Nepali Converted Chsitian, they cannot accept the Hindus and Hindus festival whereas those Foreigner who have been practicing Christianity since Century do no have any Obligation to celebrate and take part in different festival and celebration of different religion)**  In many non-Muslim majority countries, Islam is allowed to grow and Muslims are free to practice their religion. But in many Islamic-majority countries, the population of other religions often declines over time, sometimes due to violence, forced conversions, or systemic discrimination. For example, just look at the religious demographics of Pakistan 40‚Äì50 years ago compared to today.  In Europe and North America, Muslims frequently protest and express their views against the Ruling people and religion too, often quite aggressively. But can you imagine Hindus, Christians, or Buddhists openly protesting against Islamic leaders or Islamic policies in Islamic countries? It would likely result in severe consequences or violence.  In Nepal too, while Muslims may seem peaceful now, it‚Äôs worth noting that the long-settled Muslim communities (who have been here since the time of Prithvi Narayan Shah, when they were brought in for weapon-making and other skilled work) have generally coexisted peacefully. However, the more recent or growing Muslim population seems peaceful possibly only because they are still a very small minority.¬† Lets jus see if their population ever reaches 10‚Äì15%, there could be a rise in communal tensions or violence.  **This is not a hate-filled statement, just an observation based on patterns seen in various parts of the world. I am expressing what I see and fear, based on history and current events.**|||Finally someone makes sense.  RESITANCE DOESN'T MEAN KILLING INNOCENT PEOPLE. Islamists will only play the victim card in a place where they are in the minority. Look at the situation of minorites in Pakistan and Bangladesh and you'll know why Indians are afraid of the rapid influx of illegal Muslims . Nepal should be worried a lot more .|||It's true I don't know why progressives support these far right extremists, victims don't prey on innocent people, Hamas deliberately targeted and killed 10 nepalis then took bipin hostage holding him in sub-human conditions for months or years and letting him die in that sh*thole called Gaza. He or Nepal has nothing to do with their struggle nor do we have anything that could help them. It's just that Hamas and their supporters looked at these nepalis and did not see them as human beings.|||selective presentation, misrepresentation, outright falsities, whataboutism, and a willful omission of Israel's historical and ongoing crimes and provocations contributing to the volatile situation in the middle east, let alone the broader historical and geopolitical context - yep this is simply a parroting of far-right and islamophobic talking points.

Maybe you can try to be less idiot and read [this](https://www.marxists.org/archive/gandhy/2001/00001.htm) so you can begin to understand the role of the 3 major religious fundamentalism in ostensibly shaping world conflicts (remember wars are **never** *really* fought over fictitious gods, it's always resources. True, even for those who **fought** thinking they were fighting for other reasons as they are mostly not the ones getting the resources either way, thus, the reason must be made for them. As evident in this quarreling thread.)|||You should ask the orthodox Jews in Israel who are in government, the supporters of Likuud Party what they think of \"our Hindu religion and our gods\". Lol.

War and violence in general is bad. I don't say what hamas is doing is right or good but for the people of Gaza they are their saviour. Kids and women are being killed in Gaza. Kids who didn't chose to be Muslim. Noone is born religious without it being labeled or forced. They have done nothing wrong. Women are tormented and suppressed by religion. What's happening is not their fault. And if USA and pet Israel had announced ceasefire many Israeli and Palestinian children would have been saved.|||shalom|||Bipin Joshi and those 12 in Iraq !!

That doesn't surprise me at all though especially because of the covert (and sometimes even overt) backing - financially, logistically, militarily, intelligence, etc. - those terrorist groups receive from some nations - especially (but certainly not limited to) the US and Israel.  In short, the lack of coverage isn‚Äôt just neglect, it‚Äôs structural. It reflects editorial priorities shaped by political alliances, audience demand, and the need to protect state narratives.|||Well, I am a straight right leaning Christian. What Isreal's government has been doing to Palestinians since 2020, is objectively a genocide, and we Americans are tired of funding their war efforts, heck we don't feed the impoverished and homeless here in the states, but we can fund a stupid war? Both sides are wrong, Hamas and Isreal's government. Both should be brought to justice, and both need to give us our damn money back.   Listen up, over 50k innocent Palestanians have died, mainly women and children, they didn't deserve that. The people on Oct 7 didn't deserve that either. Screw Hamas, and screw Netanyanhu. Put these monsters in jail where they belong and remove Isreal's entire government and arrest the IDF bombers as well. By force, if necessary. America before the 60s wouldn't have funded this crap, neither any European entity/country.  Yes there are other genocides, yes Christians are being genocided in The Middle East/Africa, yes there's radical Islamists, yes there are rising crime rates in the UK ETC. This should all be addressed, and CAN all be addressed. Empathy doesn't have a limit and its not situational, or else its not empathy. None of that excuses what Isreal's government body has done!!

If one has core understanding of the subject and knows how to manage time with good handwriting, it isnt difficult to score 70+. You will need to be consistent though.|||Maile ni 2 barsa almost every exam ma 85 katako ho tei pani 2L jati ta tirnai paryo so its kinda hard tara ali mehenat garyo bhane chai sakchau easily 85% just math lastai dami banaunu paryo ani aru ma decent bhayepani katcha|||Hello u/Technical_Cat6948, thank you for contributing to r/NepalPlusTwo.

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can‚Äôt get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

            "comments": "No. The reforestation campaign in Nepal has been really exemplary. The concept of Community Forests has been modal and it has had a massive impact on the  green coverage. The funding that has been availed through Carbon Purchase as well as NGOs and INGOs have also played a critical role. I don't remember exactly, but UNDP or something published a really great report on the success of community forests and improvement of forested areas in Nepal.   Actually Nepal despite everything and has had excellent metrics when it comes to nature and biodiversity conservation.|||Folks who grew up in the 90s may remember efforts put into forest conservation through media. Maha Jodi ko BannPale. Impressionable ads like an old woman carrying doko vari ko daura and wondering ‚ÄúAja lai ta taryo voli k garne?‚Äù We have done a lot in the field of forest and wildlife conservation. Amidst all the negative things lets commend ourselves on this for once. Hamro Community based Forest Preservation program (Samudayik Bann) is a leading example in the world.|||\"Hariyo ban Nepal ko dhan\" massive initiative is Main reason. This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it. You can hear the news for development work and of NEA cannot cut down the trees easily, yup that is because of same strong protective law.|||It‚Äôs because of movement of people and reliance on gas, concrete instead of timber.|||No , it‚Äôs a result of migration of people from hills to concentrated cities and Terai .

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts. So, yeah definitely a result of afforestation but there is more to this and would be a great topic to delve deep into.|||It‚Äôs meant to highlight the loss of ice and glaciers.

They called the ‚Äúearn and learn‚Äù program an internship, likely just to bypass foreign employment laws. In reality, it was pure exploitation. From what I‚Äôve read, students were made to work five days a week in questionable conditions and study only one. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.  I just hope this changes with the new government.|||i thought hamas was fighting gaza right after they kill him i think they just sick isreal PM both are shit they just want control people.. fucking hate hamas|||Sad|||I'm Israeli, sadly his DNA was diagnosed and was believed to die in the first months of the war R.I.P Bipin|||Vayo vayo pugyo,  He is dead, confirmed by Israel and hamas both.

I see lots of Indian software devs (3 to 5+ work experience ) following the similar route. I just wanted to know if there are Nepalese software devs who also did the same.

Build cool projects and show them off on X or LinkedIn. Follow a bunch of US founders. Research YC and follow YC founders. The projects will need to show extraordinary level of depth in whatever field you want to pursue. A simple webapp, or a mobile app wont suffice. I would say, go deep into AI engineering, do multi-model, multi-agent projects and show them off in LinkedIn. Be raw and honest. Good AI talent is hard to find everywhere. I‚Äôm not talking about AI chatbots, have depth. 3. Look at dev opportunities in Europe. While I was in Norway, it was comparatively a whole lot easier to get a CS job than in the US. Cold emails and reach would be the way to go 4. Research countries where Big Tech will sponsor software engineers and bring them there. There‚Äôs big tech hubs in Poland, Amsterdam, Singapore and more. Research if the tech companies there also sponsor talent from abroad.|||I know a bunch who came directly from Nepal. The companies in EU don't differentiate based on where you're from.   The interview experience might be different depending on the company. Startups might grill you with several rounds of interviews.

The widget of nepali date is what sold me. The UI looks clean. I like that i can see the previous month and calendar years back but it would be cool if instead of the drop-down it was something else as the drop-down blocks the view of the current calendar and i feel it looks like the design aesthetic with the rest of the app design.   I hope you keep improving and adding new features !|||Tried it. Looks good.   One thing that i felt redundant was the popup layout when seeking other dates. Like when i want to see what is on 3rd Kartik, it opens up a popup therefore blocking the calendar entirely. I have to then close the popup  to seek through the next date. I feel that you could just update the info below the calendar for the selected date instead of the popup.   Makes it easier to seek through the dates.|||whats smarter in this calendar?|||Best!

It‚Äôs really smooth on my iOS. It feels like above 90, probably 120. Also, when adding reminders, can you make it show nepali date as well? I often have to hop between two apps to confirm the Nepali date while adding reminders.

The situation remains uncertain. Several media outlets have only reported that his name is missing from the list of 20 hostages confirmed to be alive, yet some are hastily jumping to conclusions without verified information. Such speculation is irresponsible, especially when the facts are still unclear. These pages are so immaturely jumping to conclusions in a state where things are uncertain.|||Bipin looked fine in that released video dated November 2023. It means that either Bipin died during the strikes or Hamas' foul play. Our foreign policy is also to be blamed. How could they detain Nepalese who had no association with Israel?

Eleven of our sons, including Bipin Joshi, who arrived in Israel just 25 days before Hamas‚Äôs October 7, 2023, bloodbath, were brutally murdered. Four days ago, 48 hostages clung to life; now, only 20 survive. Hamas‚Äôs ‚Äújustified‚Äù slaughter, draped in twisted dogma, mocks humanity. Two years of torment, dangling hope of Bipin‚Äôs survival, only to end in his cold-blooded killing by these bloody cowards. At home, Gen Z‚Äôs September ‚Äúuprising‚Äù killed 51, including kids, burning Kathmandu, freeing 12,500 criminals to prop up corrupt elites‚Äô spoiled brats. Our nation‚Äôs credibility is trashed, a global joke. Hamas and their ilk, like Jamkash, happily point fingers at Jews and Hindus for every woe, but when it‚Äôs time to face their own kind, they scatter like roaches, spineless. Yet we let their hate-preaching ideology fester in our hills, unchecked. No more. Deport their firebrand clerics, cut off their dirty foreign cash. We must back our own against Hamas, demand international recognition to flex Nepal‚Äôs strength, resilience, and power. This must never happen again. Israel‚Äôs crushing these terrorists, shutting up the bloody liberals whining ‚Äúcontext‚Äù over our dead.

Both sides will have attachment-less fun for some months and proceed to the next like no big deal.  My own classmates used to change bf like changing clothes. One was stupid enough to send her bf n-des and the whole school got hold of it, just imagine the trauma it will give her in future. Everyone doing whatever the fk it is in the same of true love which changes every few month.      Being a serious guy with some goals in mind used to be the black sheep, still is in colleges. I used to get kinda bullied and the odd one just cuz I didn't have a chick and I didn't goto the cafes and inhale some expensive flavoured shit lmao. (not the reason im attacking this topic tho).

Thats all you gotta do in college.  Secondly, after coming home from college take a break and revise what has been taught in class. Study consistently. 80% of the questions comes from 20% of the important concepts.

Because there was no one to guide me, i failed this year's neb board.   so from someone who learned from his own experience, my best advice is that you don't depend only on teachers from your school. there are tons of videos on youtube and tons of notes and  straight up answers in the internet.   if you do not understand and get anything at all, then only focus on the questions that are asked many times or repeated i.e only imp questions.   you have to make sure that you atleast passing marks, so look focus on the chapters you understand and master them first then only focus on others.   You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can‚Äôt get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

The funding that has been availed through Carbon Purchase as well as NGOs and INGOs have also played a critical role.

This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it.

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts.

Nepal still waits.   And many of us wonder: how different might things have been?      If Bipin were from a more powerful nation, would the world have moved faster?

I was so impressed by such a positive take by this man.  But today, like many others I got to see the video of his graduation speech on Nebraska University. I searched some more on YouTube and this man has been actively saying nothing but 'my home village' and 'my country Nepal'.  His love for this nation is second to none. Even after how he has been treated by everyone including myself. Even I never bother to search online about him.  Everyone in Nepal like me need to apologize to Dr.Mahabir Pun.  His quote,\"There comes a difficult time, unusual situation that people usually don't need to go through. In that situation it is necessary to have uncommon faith and uncommon approaches to face the uncommon odds of human life.\" from the same video of graduation speech. It will never leave my brain. This man said those words on 2007 and lived by it. His uncommon faith and uncommon approaches has definitely made huge impact on me today. And hoping Nepal will follow his will of uncommon faith and uncommon approaches to face the uncommon odds of human life.  This is not a time to be wasting on excel sheets, Facebook status, conspiracy theories and on egocentric people. We won't get any better person than him to lead the change on his sector.

            "body": "My house was vandalized in the name of \"Gen z protest.\" My dad is a civil servant, and we live in a humble 3 story house (the third story was only recently built). It was a small house when we moved in, which was 17 years ago‚Äî few months after I was born.   After working for over 25+ years for the government, this country, and its public, my dad still has a very clear history. No bribery, no corruption, no money laundering‚Äî nothing. Rising high in status and the post, he is recognized for his diligent work and highly stable work ethic.  Now, back to the present. The protestors had reached our house. I had once thought, why would anyone target our house? It's a civil servant, not some minister or anything of that sort. My father rose high due to his hard work and competitiveness, not any connection or bribery. We can all see from how my parents lived rental first (he was already a civil servant then). Only after a few months of me being born did they buy a house, not without taking loans.  I don't know why it happened because our house was aba and definitely not supposed to be a part of whatever that was. The protestors were going to burn our house, but because of it being attached to other houses, the neighbours finally calmed them down into not burning our house. Instead, they burned our bikes, went into our house, and threw things out to burn them. What's worse? When the protestors left, all the people living nearby, went in and out for 2 days straight‚Äî morning, day and night, pickng whatever things they liked amd taking it home with them as if our house was some kind of thrift store giving away our stuff for free.  We were at our relative's house, and when we saw all the black smoke coming from the direction of our house, we were devastated. \"Our house got burnt.\" That's what we thought. As i was the oldest child in the family, i couldn't let myself break down. I can still hear those devastating gut-wrenching cries and sobs from my mom, haunting me like a ghost every time i close my eyes.   I am a college student. My uniform is gone, and so are my books and copies. My sister is in middle school. Her uniform and books and copies are nowhere to be found as well.   Our money and jewelries, of course, are gone too. The same money my father earned and mind you, a civil servant's earnings isn't much. Only enough to label us as a middle-class family. The same money my sister sent us, her hard-working money(which was in dollars at that).  Our clothes, bags, and even utensils are gone, and so are our food storage(stuff). My mom is someone who saves money. However, she can just like my dad because she knows she has experienced the hardships with my dad. Because they know. Because they have experienced hardships and complications in their life. Because they have faced obstacles.  We have never wore any designers, no luxury fashion brand. All are affordable and comfortable. The only designer my mom and dad ever even had is when my big sister from abroad visited us and surprised us with some designer bags (which she also got scolded for spending so much because she is still studying and working in between only).  Our guests'clothes, laptops, phones, everything is gone. Me and my sisters' savings and my mom's little spending for managing our household‚Äî nothing is left. Not even our puja ko thaan(a small place we had to worship and pray gods).   We have tons of debts. I am old enough to learn that by now. Now that our house was totally and utterly robbed and vandalized while my dad kept on working for the same public, we have nowhere to sleep on. No clothes to wear. There is no place to shower or bathe.  We had to hide away from our own house we once called home to keep ourselves alive. My father was lucky enough to be safe because if it was even a few seconds late, it would have all been over. We were fortunate to be alive, even though we had done nothing wrong to people.  Morality? Humanity? Conscience? Guilt? Remorse? None. The same people, the same public, that my dad is working so hard to serve with his whole heart, has done this to him, to his family.  Gen z, huh? Protest against corruption, huh? My dad, having the cleanest history‚Äî no corruption, bribery, connection, whatsoever. So why our house? Why? What had we ever done to them? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.   I have no hope left. None for this country, none for the people of this country. This is now a country full of robbers and thieves. Humans are jealous. Humans are greedy. People are full of themselves, full of greediness and selfishness. In my heart, humans are creatures who have ruined any hope for more in me and my family. My father, who once poured his heart for this country and the people in this country, is on the verge of giving up on it.  You people, opportunists, and robbers who call yourselves voice of justice‚Äî I'll be watching, watching who you are going to tame to pull this country back together. People like my dad who are so wronged will be out of all this mess soon, Who are you going to pull to patch this broken country? I'll be watching. I'll be happily watching everything crumble and fall apart with your \"justice.\" You have given the opportunists a sense of win. You've let them think anything is possible, and now, everything will fall apart while you watch everything crumble in front of your eyes.  Lastly, I'd like to be a little vulgar and uncensored. If you are uncomfortable, scroll away.  Whoever has participated in vandalizing my house and robbing it empty‚Äî You are going to see hell and worse. I hope you feel yourself rotting away. I hope you don't think it's over now because whatever you stole, it will haunt you for the rest of your life and afterwards. I will forever haunt you, even in your dreams, converting it into a disastrous nightmare. You'll see hell. You are going to suffer.  [Edit: I never expected this post to gain so many views. I‚Äôm very grateful to those who are wishing me and my family well, thank you very much for that. And I also understand those who might raise an eyebrow on this post and not believe in my words. It‚Äôs up to you, whether you want to believe me or not. I have no intention of forcing it on you.   I‚Äôd also like to request anyone who knows me through this post to maintain my privacy and not reveal anything about me or my family on the internet(please refrain any stalker behavior). I have never gone public like this and I also don‚Äôt like the attention this is getting(makes me uncomfortable) but I‚Äôm going to keep this post so other people who have experienced something like this can be open about it here. Let this be a safe space for those to speak up.]",

While this was an absolutely needed protest and it did bring much-needed attention and change, we also can‚Äôt deny the darker side of it.

Gen Z cannot ignore the fact that others died in fires, or that people were looted and harmed during the unrest. It‚Äôs easy to say the movement was hijacked by goons, but the videos and reports show some protesters themselves vandalizing property and stealing from people who had nothing to do with the issue.

Much love to you all Aussies too.|||Appreciate it mate|||Thanks for your kind appreciation. Let me tell you our Nepalese perspective.  As a Nepalese, it's really tough for us to enter Australia, first you must pass at least high school with good marks, then get a really good English test score, then you must show a significant bank balance, so your immigration policy is already filtering only the best people from other countries.   I am a Engineer myself, it's relatively easy for someone like me to immegrate to Australia, but for students of other field, you're immigration policy already make sure only the best students come in your country, and it should be that way to be honest.   Regarding your immigration issue, well I believe any country should only allow immigration if there is net positive for the country, you don't want a bunch of liabilities to come in your country, right??  So, just look at the data, you can very easily find out what communities are contributing to Australia, and what communities are hampering the country, and simply adjust the policies that way, it's really that simple.   Regarding recent protests against Immigration, well I think that's just the coverup done by the rich and elites to brainwash common Aussies so that the blame is shifted towards immigration when in fact Australia has the best immigration compared to many Western countries.   My cousin recently returned back to Nepal, they lived in Melbourne for almost 10 years, they shared the economy isn't doing great compared to past years, and the blame is being shifted solely towards immigration.|||U will be welcomed here in Nepal.

There are some spectacular idiots, and they will spout stupid things at you. When I was young anyone 'brown' was called a Paki (it makes me shudder just to type that), believe me the people shouting it had literally no idea of different south Asian countries, and wouldn't have cared even if you tried to correct them. (I was once walking with a friend who was half Iranian, so had the crime of black hair, and someone drove past yelling at us about Paki go home).

Most of times Indian (south asians) face racism is due to...   1. bad dressing up sense , fashion.  2. manners   3. smell     Always dress well, wear clean, not necessarily new, clothes, be polite in train, bus ( say thank you to driver, leave seats for women , pregnant, elderly etc ), don't play music in phone without earphones, don't speak in phone in crowded space, hold door if you can, and use thank you, sorry, excuse me please as often as you can. And avoid eating food with garlic, onion like lot ... mild amount won't be cause body odour.

There is nothing anyone could do because of the constitution for the old leaders to try again.   But this time, if we play our cards right, next election ma voter Id card banayera we need to vote for the party/person who we think can bring a change.  Change doesn‚Äôt happen overnight, we need to be patient.  Either start doing politics by yourself, or support someone who does. That‚Äôs the only thing our constitution allows.|||Lol, things never chang overnight. Expecting these corrupt people to just give up their power and privilege is not that easy. They will come back and try to do everything possible to regain their power.   Instead of being discouraged by their appearance we can get ourselves involved in more and more constructive dialogue and create a scenario where they will not be back again from the next election. Engage in political debate. Spread words. More intellectual discuss will help create a \"vibe\" when they will find hard to regain power. We can never demand so and so person or party should not participate in election or use their constitutional rights. So them trying to resurface and whitewash their image is normal. Unless we convict then for crime in court they are free to start doing that.  Let's keep being vigilant. Let's continue this discourse and may be, just may be, we can tip the society as a whole towards a future without the \"musical chair\".   What the jenji protest has done is create eye opening moment for a lot of the old generation people and has made the younger generation a major stakeholder in the country's governance and politics. Nothing else, this is major achievement in itself. Adem√°s, the parties also feel some sort of pressure to restructure and change. But if we keep on using this momentum to keep on being watchful and create more awakening over time I think the courage and sacrifice will not be for nothing.|||Have patience guys. impatience always brings anger and anxiety.

Yet, even after all this time, I still carry deep respect and pride for the land I came from. But watching this horrific video of a mob savagely beating an elderly man and his wife left me utterly speechless. Regardless of what the couple may have been involved in or accused of, nothing justifies such cruelty.  I thought Nepali men were the descendants of the brave Gurkhas‚Äîwarriors respected and admired worldwide for their courage and honor. Instead, I saw a man sucker punch a woman who wasn‚Äôt even facing him. That wasn‚Äôt bravery‚Äîit was pure cowardice. And the chaos that followed‚Äîhundreds of people raiding and looting their home under the excuse of ‚Äújustice‚Äù‚Äîwasn‚Äôt justice at all. That mob was just as corrupt and criminally responsible as the very people they claimed to oppose. They were not upholding the law; they were exploiting the breakdown of law and order to terrorize and humiliate helpless individuals.  But this rot doesn‚Äôt stop with the mob. The government, too, is guilty. Innocent children were killed during the protests, yet there has been no true accountability. Those in power‚Äîthe Prime Minister, the Home Minister, and the security forces‚Äîbear responsibility for those heinous crimes. They were entrusted with protecting the people, but instead, they used their authority to spill the blood of innocents.  So when I look at this situation, I see two sides of the same coin: mobs acting as judge, jury, and executioner in the streets, and leaders hiding behind power while allowing or even enabling violence against their own citizens. Both are forms of terrorism, both have destroyed public trust, and both have crippled the very soul of Nepal.  And if this mob truly represents the next generation‚Äîif this is the standard of ‚Äújustice‚Äù that today‚Äôs youth believe in‚Äîthen Nepal‚Äôs future is not just uncertain, it is in grave danger. Because a society that celebrates cowardice, looting, and lawlessness, while a government escapes accountability for killing its own children, is a society heading toward doom.|||Maile paila post garya ho, yo bare  https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/s/okOHZ5elMo|||https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/s/okOHZ5elMo|||It's not going to change in one day.

This affectes every country in south Asia including Nepal. That's a problem we should solve. IT's gradually under control I guess.|||Google Bangladesh. And let me know if you found the answer|||Don‚Äôt look up bangladesh/australia. Nepal has average population density.|||Population in SE Asia seems to be quite high in general. I think regarding your question about where the population is concentrated, you will find that the population is scattered throughout the country - everywhere minus above 3000m up the himalayas. Then if you do a deep assessment what % of Perus Land actually has people vs % of Nepal where people reside, you may find the two land sizes may not be off by a magnitude like now when you compare the full size of the country. For eg UK has a landmass of 250k but has a population of 69 mil. That's 2x population of Peru in 1/5th of land. In the other hand australia has a population of 27mil in 7.7mil km2. Russia has 143mil people in 17mil km2 (4x Pop of Peru in 16x land area).  You are also looking at the mercader projection which further makes Nepal look more visually small in the map. Not that it should have any basis when you talk about numbers.   I suppose what I am trying to say is the population may still be high in Nepal but it may not be as high as you think when you factor in livable land in the country. Total land mass alone is not a great indicator.|||Fertile land, fertile people, most are on terai belt. Look at india and bangladesh, how densely populated they all are.

It calculated on a flat, two-dimensional plane, not by measuring the surface area of its mountains, hills, and valleys. The total land area of a country is determined by projecting its borders onto a standardized reference surface, typically an ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the Earth.      Nepal is roughly a \\~1000 km long, and 150 km wide and so the approximate area of 150 sq km.   Now if you count the mountains and valleys that covers like 70% of that 2D area, the actual habitable space is order of magnitide larger. maybe even 50x.   So the actual living space is quite a lot for mountainous country like Nepal. I would imagine same for Peru.|||You know about canada?|||You should have started with Bangladesh and it's population density.  Regardless, depends on how fertile and navigable the lands are.

I hope your life continues to be very rich in experiences and opportunity.|||This kind of post rubs me the wrong way a bit because it feels like you‚Äôre trying to position yourself as ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù or ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than the people who went abroad. The reality is that both paths, either staying in Nepal or going abroad, have their own pros and cons, and people choose based on circumstances that are often very different from yours.  You mention being financially independent, investing early, and balancing work with studies. That‚Äôs impressive, but it‚Äôs also a privilege many don‚Äôt have. Plenty of sons and daughters in Nepal are grinding just to pay off family debts or keep their households afloat. For them, going abroad isn‚Äôt about ‚Äúhype‚Äù but it‚Äôs about survival, opportunity, or helping their families. Even the ability to invest in NEPSE in the first place points to a cleaner starting slate than what a lot of others face.  And while you thrived staying in Nepal, not everyone has that option. Families who send their kids abroad are often taking huge risks and sacrifices, sometimes from already fragile financial situations. Even if someone goes abroad and struggles at first, starting from zero (or even from debt) can eventually set them up for long-term security that wouldn‚Äôt be possible back home.  So yes, it‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre making it work in Nepal, but framing it in a way that hints at looking down on people who go abroad ignores the complexity of their decisions and struggles.|||Simple answer for you it is not same for every one.|||I knew a guy like you who didn't go abroad when he was 22.

Few lakhs is not a big problem for me so I always have that assurance that I can take care of my family if needed. I am also less worried about kids, as they will have better opportunity for everything. Government supports health and education, and only fooding and clothing them is what I have to worry about. They also have opportunity to grow in a better society free from caste and religion based nonsense so they can actually focus on things that matter.

Spiritually and mentally, I am as fucked up as before, which was something I thought I would get over by moving abroad.       However, I have a hope and \"I can do\" mentality. I HIGHLY appreciate the way I think these days mixed with whatever I had learned back in Nepal and the new things in this new environment. I wouldn't give this away for any price! (well a few million dollars might do the trick :D )      Thing is, we tend to have this bias that the things that are familiar to us and we identify with always seem better and superior to others. One should come out of it to see how things actually are. Hence, staying abroad is a must! It provides options and more importantly new perspectives on everything!|||Lol you had a choice. Most people dont.|||this guy is FAKE !!!!|||[removed]|||Oh my god, so much hate here. ‚Äú not everyone is like you ‚Äú , ‚Äú you are lucky ‚Äú  What a bunch of bullshit. I am happy for you and i have a lot of friends in nepal earning as much as me ( i am in Australia rn ). You are doing great   Meanwhile i have hardly any savings. Life abroad is tough, the standard of living in western countries ( Australia included ) is on a decline. If you already have a house in Nepal, you are better off back home.  If i could work in nepal and earn half of what i earn now, my life will still be more luxurious in Nepal.   The only challenge is, one has to be highly skilled. I don‚Äôt think i am skilled enough to secure the same kinda role back home but when i am , i will definitely return.  Most Nepalese here do degrading stuff for work. ü§¢ü§Æ. The only reason people want to go abroad is that they are not skilled enough and are willing to do anything for money.   Nepal doesn‚Äôt have a problem with brain drain, cus people with brains are not the ones going abroad to clean toilets, cus they don‚Äôt have to.  The smart ones are able to survive in Nepal.  I am lucky that i come from a well off family and didn‚Äôt have do low level work for money, but i am  as dumb as them for sure. I just got lucky  People should be inspired from you, instead of getting trapped in a hopeless lifestyle abroad.",

To say RSP karyakarta are no different.... This is very true, but why do you expect it to be otherwise? That's HOW our nepalese civitlity is rooted in, and you can't expect the RSP kartakarta to be entirely different.  This is a problem not just with RSP/Ravi but with everybody else-- Balen, Harka..etc, Even current GenG,  hell even with Rastriye Bibeksheel party supporters... Such changes takes ages and generations. Look at the current US, Europe and other top civilized countries...they are no different either.   While they all are no different, at least the karyakarta of these 'NEW' forces had the audacity of breaking out of the chains of Major political parties and confront them, which was almost IMPOSSIBLE before the era of Ujjwal Thapa/Balen.   2. This current narrative of 'NO DIFFERENT' is the most   dangerous campaign against all the NEW FORCES.  Its the first step by the 3 BIG POLITICAL Parties), and soon will turn into we are better than all others.  Back to the Cycle!   3. Sumana quitting is a big loss to RSP and could be a loss or gain for herself, which only time will tell.  BUT it's a massive loss for us, for sure. It's all according to the Divide and Rule by the major political parties. Unless she is joined by Balen, etc, and turn into another or even bigger alternative force that the RSP itself. Even then, you will still see the new karyakartas no different.|||Nepali haru nai testo ho. Bholi Balen le party kholnu parcha, tyo party ni Balen kai face dekhayera vote khane chalaune ho.

With all due respect to Sumana, she's a much needed breath of fresh air in Nepali politics, I have to disagree with her on one major thing.  She says Rabi needs to step down as RSP leader because she thinks that the best interest of the party and that's what people/youths want. That's where I think she's misunderstood and wrong.  From genZ upto the aged ones, most of them want Rabi in the leadership. That's why he got the highest number of votes among all leaders in the last election.  What I think is that Sumana saw many youth social media activists, who doesn't know politics and are misinformed and those who doesn't represent the overall youths of Nepal at all, they made video saying \"we don't want Rabi\", \"he's same old, corrupt\" which led to Sumana thinking Rabi isn't wanted by current youths and she need to get out of that party to be the voice of the youths.|||Good going on",

Yes, at the time constitution's word by word wasn't matched for forming government. But President did form the govt and dissolve by abiding with the constitution. And not anybody was appointed. The former Chief Justice was appointed, who , even by the position, is supposed to be the most learned of the laws worldwide and Nepal. The only bad is that we have an interim government, but the election date has been fixed and we should in anyway possible make the election successful, even if the interim government fails to do any other thing beside that. Cuz having a parliament is very very necessary brother. Good governance, Corruption control and investigation, all can come in time being, but the democratic, free, and sovereign country do need parliament. We may not like the members and representatives there, but for our democracy and peoples sovereignty, parliament must be there. That is the reason, the upper house National Assembly is still there.  I just read the news in BBC that Taliban government shut down all the internet in Afghanistan. And the people have nothing to say there. Already they had girls education completely removed from the country. And in Sudan there is a terrible civil war ongoing, even worse than Ukraine and Gaza, merely because multiple factions within the army and political groups want executive power for themselves. The condition is pathetic there. Just so so sad.  I know Nepali are frustrated with the government. But let's understand one thing, in Nepal our Parliament and legislative is supposed to be more powerful than the other two bodies. If government fails to do as expected, we should elect better party in the Parliament. Moreover, the development is not just duty of Prime Minister and council of ministers. The administration of Nepal also called the permanent government is there to carry out the tasks for governance and development. The political structure, that is PM and council of Ministers are primarily to make the administrative structures accountable and focused to the citizens' need, demand and aspirations.  So, let's not be too emotional and aggressive to the point that we focus too much on executive and not the legislative and parliament. Laws, Constitution, System can only be changed through Parliament only , and that should always be. So please, dear fellow Nepali brothers and sisters, let's help the interim government to function as best as it possibly can and soon have the parliament, and fully constitutionally functioning all three organs of the state: Legislative, Executive, and Judiciary. Let's participate in the election with joy and hope, and elect the best, if not, the best among the worst, and bring the country into running and stability. Please. This is not the time to fight amongst each other. We need to be united as one Nepali in this so vulnerable time. We will not have a country man, if we keep on fighting and not helping the interim government. Let's elect our representatives in Falgun 21, and do fighting then after. Making the representatives accountable, pressuring them to amend as per our choice through peaceful protest, signature campaign. But for the few coming months till election, let's be optimistic and help each other in family, friends, and communities to participate and be excited for election. We will only have a country, if we can keep it. A country needs the parliament. It is the soul. Executive helps develop, provide security. But the source of our sovereignty, our say in the nation, is through our representative in parliament. How much we want to fight now, let's fight in the parliament. Parliament is literally a place to hear each other, discuss and debate. Let's be fully focused in electing our favored representative and , in bad case best amongst worst, for now please guyss.|||The cleanest and the only way GenZ can get out of this is to win the election by a massive landslide  Parties haru khatisakey.

            "body": "We all know most ISP here lock the router and dont give any access to the web management. As a devops practitioner and someone who is very invested in homelabbing and selfhosting, locked router was my biggest achilles heels.   Requirement: A secondary router, you main router will stop working and secondary router will only work through LAN1 port.   Solution: All you have to do is create a ticket on vianet app stating \"Turn the router into bridge/modem only mode\". Someone will call you back, just ask them username and password for PPPOE and use your secondary router to configure through PPPOE instead of DHCP. Tada!!! you now have full control over your router.   Bonus 1: You can flash openwrt with Luci web interface and you will be able to configure anything you can think of. extra advantage is you can configure mesh routing without needing a special router. I have managed to easily flash it on my Mi router and a old tp link router, search for guides depending on your model or ask Claude or Gpt to search specifically for your router model.   Bonus 2: Vianet gives you globally accessible IPV6. That means you are free from CGNAT. Use this to access your home services without needing any relay like Cloudflare Tunnel or Tailscale VPN. Direct connection means no extra latency and maxed bandwidth and you can use this to host online game servers to play with your friends!! But for some reason Worldlink doesnt connect sometimes. Ncell and ClassicTech seems to have no problem tho. I am not sure if NTC offers IPV6.  Bonus 3: Host a adguard DNS server and configure your openwrt to use it as your default DNS server. This way you will have adblocking for your whole network. Your parents and old grannies wont have to see ads no more (wont work with Youtube app - use revance) and it keeps them safe from online phishing and malwares. You can also set some static ip and adguard to block some websites like gambling and pornography if there are minors in your household.   Disadvantage: The only downside of this is your main router will turn pretty much useless. Internet wont work through wireless and extra ports. So dont forget the vianet tech support to turn off the DHCP and wireless on the main router. Since my secondary router also has 2 ports only I had to invest some money on extra gigabyte switch.   I know some of you will appreciate this so this is my appreciation and giving back to this community. enjoy and have fun!! Happy Dashain!!!

Did it impact your internet speed in any way?   Also, directly exposing your local network and devices through IPv6 is not really a good idea.

So I have a camera that allows remote viewing. However, when I connect the camera to Vianet, remote viewing doesn't work and I need to be within my home network to view the feed through the app.  The remote feed viewing works in Worldlink and Ncell's mobile data.

I'm always thinking of quitting and start farming cash crops, unseasonal crops and some mixed fruit garden. I'm in IoT and embedded so always daydreaming of having a small farm producing high value products like saffron in a climate controlled environment.|||I am a second generation industrialist in poultry working in agritech intergration, very rewarding if you understand the loopholes of market. The best investment I see as of right now is cold storage for fruits and vegetables. There are enough farmers who will work to produce but the hardship for them has been for timely rearing and storage during the season so this can be offloaded into the market during off season. This is how off season fruits are made available even during off season abroad. This concept is relatively new to Nepal, if you move into this market first, you will have competitive edge. I am engaged in poultry currently and my company does have cold chain system so I know how it works (specifically for chicken) and the model is very rewarding.|||I feel your pain of not being able to find a job right now. Are you sure you would want to do farming full time as a job/career? If you think you have a vision and can achieve a fulfilling life then sure why not, but you probably should talk to some experts and get an idea of what it entails. Or shadow someone in the business closely first.  Also if you really want to leave tech then you can choose any field I am assuming youre still young - be it farming or some other thing. If you feel you dont have enough experience to pull yourself a job at this point or just the market is saturated, try specializing in something in tech? like AI/ML? Data? then apply for jobs. It could be online certs or a short term degree (esp if you want to do in overseas.) Remember inexperience is much as an opportunity to learn/explore  more.  Or you could do 50/50 and spend some time researching on the farming business and also upskilling in tech.

This isn't just about a bad interview, it feels like a deliberate strategy to exploit job seekers for free labor.  I went through **multiple** rounds of interviews over several weeks. Everything seemed promising. The conversations were positive, and they talked about a great fit for their team. Then came the \"final\" task: to design a comprehensive digital marketing campaign.  I spent days on this. I researched their brands, analysed their competitors, and built out a full strategy, complete with campaign ideas, target audiences, content plans, and performance metrics. I treated it like a real, paid project because I genuinely wanted the job and to show my capabilities.  I submitted the work, feeling confident. Then... nothing. Total radio silence. I followed up, but no response. The most infuriating part? The reason given was a flimsy, nonsensical excuse that had nothing to do with the work I submitted.  This isn't an isolated incident. I've heard from others who have gone through the exact same process with them. They get you to design a full campaign, which they can then use or adapt, and then they ghost you or reject you on some silly pretext. It's a blatant exploitation of job seekers' time and skills.  If you're a digital marketer in Nepal and you're considering applying to IMS Group, be warned. This is not a legitimate hiring process. It's a fishing expedition for free campaign ideas. Save your time and your work for a company that respects candidates and values their professional effort.  They were still hiring 2 days ago and I gave the interview 3 months ago.",

Build cool projects and show them off on X or LinkedIn. Follow a bunch of US founders. Research YC and follow YC founders. The projects will need to show extraordinary level of depth in whatever field you want to pursue. A simple webapp, or a mobile app wont suffice.

I‚Äôm not talking about AI chatbots, have depth. 3. Look at dev opportunities in Europe. While I was in Norway, it was comparatively a whole lot easier to get a CS job than in the US.

The widget of nepali date is what sold me. The UI looks clean. I like that i can see the previous month and calendar years back but it would be cool if instead of the drop-down it was something else as the drop-down blocks the view of the current calendar and i feel it looks like the design aesthetic with the rest of the app design.   I hope you keep improving and adding new features !|||Tried it. Looks good.   One thing that i felt redundant was the popup layout when seeking other dates. Like when i want to see what is on 3rd Kartik, it opens up a popup therefore blocking the calendar entirely. I have to then close the popup  to seek through the next date.

Every time you run an app, the system checks which permissions have already been granted. The same happens when you open the NIC Asia app. Now, why would NIC Asia need access to your camera?

It has to be tied to the QR feature, because once the app is logged in the whole page is swipe-gesture based. When you swipe left, the camera view for QR is triggered, so it looks like a photo is being taken but it‚Äôs not.

The child will have access to education and almost everything another child can ask for. We have belief that the child carries spirit of Taleju Bhawani, which gives the child immense power. Again, in an age where we have lost our belief, I cannot prove it.  The kumaris I have visited emit strong aura (i may have been brainwashed to feel this). But she does have to be disciplined (i dont mean someone disciplines her). The child is treated with utmost respect by the best people in a homely environment.   Aba before age of 15 16, Manang Mustang ghumna khasai koi jaadaina hola (only speaking for myself) After she is no longer a Kumari, she can go whereever she wants to.

A 3 year old child has no idea what she is getting into. She cannot grasp what a normal childhood is, what is right and what is wrong. The only thing she knows and does is based on her likes and dislikes, which is heavily depended upon how her parents/surrounding elders dictates.   Ani about 'No complains' from past Kumaris:   Newari culture is super sensitive. You cannot say anything against their culture. Otherwise, you'll have to face \"Tom n Jerry\" like people. I think, every ex Kumaris understands this at some point. With this much pressure along with the grooming done from a very young age, I don't think anyone dares to speak up. Which basically means none of us know what they really feel inside.    Well, of course, keeping in mind how they're thrown away once they reach a certain age or goes through ü©∏. At least, a life time opportunity to be a Kumari where they could renounce their position if they don't feel like it should be a way.   They don't preach, they don't teach, they only show up during jatras. I've never seen Kumaris actively participating in rituals or any sort of activities.

The only thing you should feel bad about is her parents who now have to be her full time care takers probably having to leave their jobs and careers and move into the kumari house with her.|||I used to extremely religious before and used to glorify ts But realising Kumari tradition is cruel was my first step towards atheism|||As a Newar, I understand the cultural side of it. But living in the US and having global exposure, I also see it as more of a pageant. If you‚Äôve seen Little Miss Sunshine, you‚Äôll get the context.||| The Living Goddess tradition of Nepal is a complex institution rooted in centuries of culture. While modern concerns about child rights are valid, the practice is governed by strict rituals and has evolved to address contemporary welfare standards. Here are the key facts:  1. The Selection is Meticulous and Considered an Honor:  ¬∑ A Kumari is chosen from the specific Shakya clan of the Newari community, a Buddhist goldsmith caste. ¬∑ The selection process is incredibly rigorous. Candidates must meet 32 strict physical perfection requirements (e.g., eye shape, voice quality, hair color) and demonstrate a fearless and serene demeanor (e.g., by not crying during a ceremony in a room of 108 ritually sacrificed animal heads). ¬∑ For the family and community, her selection is not a punishment but the highest spiritual honor.  2. The Role is Central to National Culture and Unity:  ¬∑ The Kumari is not just a religious figure but a national symbol. ¬∑ Her most important public duty is during the Indra Jatra festival, where she blesses the President of Nepal, providing divine legitimacy to the state in a ceremony that blends Hindu and Buddhist traditions. This is a key event for national identity.  3. Significant Reforms and Safeguards Have Been Implemented:  ¬∑ Education: By law, the Kumari now receives a formal education from private tutors within her residence. The government provides a monthly stipend specifically for this purpose. ¬∑ Family Presence: Contrary to isolation claims, her family (typically her mother) lives with her throughout her tenure. ¬∑ Financial Security: Upon retiring at puberty, the state grants her a lifetime pension. As of recent years, this is approximately NPR 10,000 per month (roughly $75 USD), along with a lump sum of NPR 1 million (roughly $7,500 USD) to support her transition. ¬∑ Successful Reintegration: Former Kumaris like Dr. Chanira Bajracharya, who served until 14, have publicly spoken about their positive experiences, pursued higher education, and built successful careers, demonstrating that life after the role is viable.  The Kumari tradition is a deeply embedded socio-religious institution. It is factually inaccurate to frame it simply as the \"isolation\" of a child. It is a state-sanctioned, culturally sacred role with defined rituals, significant community support, and legally mandated provisions for the girl's education, family life, and long-term financial security. The debate around it highlights the global tension between cultural preservation and evolving child rights, but the practice itself has demonstrably adapted to modern norms.|||I ain't newar but also I think aaba yesto kura chai parents haru le vhaneko ramro hami third party le vhannu vhanda pani . look if kumari ko parents le chahanu hudaina vhani tyo kumari ko candidate mai na leraunu parni ho . so parents lai kehi problem xaina , kumari le as a normal human being ni basna paunu hunxa after completion so I think we are no one to question sodhna lai|||What about the tradition of marrying off daughters into the inlaws house?|||After giving this some thought question is of a philosophical one. What freedom does a child have?  What life does a child choose? Isn‚Äôt everyone forced and fed their parent‚Äôs beliefs?   Also, can you give some evidence of abuse? If not your post would be baseless and in attempt of defamation of our culture.  One Kumari‚Äôs time ended when she was just 12. How much do you remember of your life before you were 12? I asked myself the same question and the answer is not much.   I disagree with your claim that the Kumari‚Äôs are discarded. They are always welcome. What it shows is the core principle of Buddhism that nothing is permanent. All things, even being revered as the living goddess, comes to an end. It teaches humility, an art that is now lost in this modern time.

Khaire ko documentary haru herera brainrot kura nagara na. Not everyone is privileged to become kumari and nor they are selected randomly. The family members themself have to fill the form and there's a long running selection process. Only a certain clan of newar can become Kumari. There are lots of inhuman and child abusive traditions going on all over. In case of kumari they get highest level of love and respect. They can live with their parents, they can play, they can watch TV, they can even play video games. It would be better if you watch podcasts of ex kumaris it's really helpful. I used to think same like everyone calling this inhuman before but they are living the normal life as you and me. And the fact that you can't speak up being kumari is totally false, yes you can't but only in jatras and other religious ceremonies, do you speak up during sharad and other pujas(it's prohibited to talk during sharad if you don't know). Go visit sudurpaschim hundreds of girls are being raped during their chhaupadi bas. Go visit terai Muslim villages girls at the age of 15 are getting married and at the age of 21 they are booned with 3 childs. Ex Kumaris themself enjoy being kumari and love to live their that phase again. If they are fine, their parents are fine no need to talk about that. Now the rules and prohibitions are amended.

Are you saying you love someone else‚Äôs kid than their own parents?|||Do the parents not have any say in this?|||This is sick|||I feel like more people should be aware (not trying to disrespect the culture)|||OP, you‚Äôve raised a really important point. To those insisting Kumaris are always ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù or dismissing criticism by belittling others, few things we can reflect on:   1. How much do we actually know about child psychology and development, especially at such a young age when experiences shape a lifetime? 2. Yes, a Kumari is worshipped as a goddess now but when her time ends, how does a goddess step back into an ordinary life? How do peers treat her? How does she even make friends? 3. With isolation and the constant expectation to suppress emotions, what happens to her social, communication, and interpersonal skills? Who helps her navigate that later? 4. Does she ever get space to express her own feelings and thoughts or is silence part of the job description? 5. We‚Äôve all seen videos of new Kumari, some barely three years old, literally asleep in full dress during rituals. How on earth can a toddler be burdened with divine expectations when they can barely stay awake through it? 6. As Nepalis, many of us defend dal bhat tarkari because it‚Äôs what we grew up with it feels untouchable. (I know it‚Äôs not the same but for reference) For a Kumari, this role is all she has ever known. So how would she even recognise or articulate what she‚Äôs missed out on, when she never had the chance to experience it? 7. And let‚Äôs be honest do we really believe someone put on a pedestal that high, surrounded by cultural pressure, guilt, and shame, would openly talk about the negatives of being Kumari? Yes, things have changed there‚Äôs more education, some family contact,but none of that cancels out the developmental and human rights concerns we‚Äôre talking about.  And honestly, the comments here kind of prove the point: we were never really taught to think critically. Instead of having an actual discussion, people are throwing around ‚Äúbahun,‚Äù ‚ÄúChristian,‚Äù or ‚Äúother cultures‚Äù like that somehow answers the question. When we turn conversation into belittling, blaming, or name-calling, we‚Äôre not defending culture but normalising this behaviour. I mean how hard is it understand you can agree to disagree without all these?|||Actually the closest thing that happens in the west like this is children beauty pagents  AT LEAST, at the very least, this Kumari affects one child over a years. USA child beauty pageants produce so many|||I think this is so cruelüòû a kid should not be isolated from the society, and should not be sit there to just take photo with tourists ..|||People talking about normal childhood and growing up \"normal\", a lot of misconception here.  Goodness flows through Kumari.  She is worshipped for being the medium of taleju bhawani. They are taught that they as an individual are not god, but the goodness that flows through her is what makes her worshipped.  And calling Kumari as a \"virgin goddess\" is stupid and a complete disregard of religious belief. It's a literal translation not a literary translation.   A lot of misconceptions have already been debunked.  Therefore they are able to integrate back into society well. They have good societal support . They are mentored, taught and are well taken care of. They themselves have immence respect for their religion and tradition.  If you think being a Kumari is wrong, you simply look at other practices in other religions. Nuns are not allowed to marry or consummate. Denying the right to marry and consummate can be considered as an oppressive practices denying one from their human desires. In radical Islam, burka, multiple marriages, denial of human rights for wemen.  While such petty comparisons are stupid themselves, what I want to say is we are worshipping female power. We are actually looking at females as devine. Not simply blind worship.   Nothing about today's childhood is normal.  You see young boys and girls sent off to boarding schools as normal? It's more isolating depressing. Parents just sticking their child to an iPad, or a hyperactive parent forcing their child through multiple activities (music class, sports, extra activities) even when their child may not want to to them, and pushing their child to extremes, putting their child through ridiculously high expectations, so that they can fulfill own ego( yes I've seen it happen).  A lot is not normal in so called modern normal childhood.   A lot of narratives and propogandas have infiltrated our thinking. Be water and explore into the culture. A lot has been written about Kumari from a propogandist and religious infiltration viewpoint.  A lot has been written to criticize our culture and ostracize ourselves from our religion and culture. Beware.|||Yeah agreed I thought it was just culture as a child but now I see it as different|||Sadhguru has spoken about the Kumari tradition of Nepal. It is an understanding about God making.

A case was registered in high court of Nepal but the court didn't make decision against Kumari tradition but asked to reform. There have been quiet few reforms.

            "body": "People love to throw shade at King Mahendra, calling him an authoritarian who killed democracy. But let‚Äôs be real: he‚Äôs the only king after Prithvi Narayan Shah who actually did something that mattered for the survival of Nepal.    Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus ‚Äî with nine governments in ten years. That wasn‚Äôt democracy, it was chaos. Leaders were busy stabbing each other in the back while the nation stayed dirt poor, uneducated, and vulnerable. Tell me, what ‚Äústable democracy‚Äù exists when governments collapse every year? None. Mahendra saw this and did what no one else had the guts to do: he hit reset.    Yes, he dissolved parliament. Yes, he banned parties. And you know what? He was right to. Without stability, Nepal was on track to become India‚Äôs backyard project or another pawn in the Cold War. Mahendra‚Äôs Panchayat system gave the country one thing it desperately lacked: stability.    And let‚Äôs talk achievements:    He balanced India and China like a chess master. Without him, we‚Äôd have been swallowed by one side decades ago.    He pushed Nepal onto the global stage ‚Äî Non-Aligned Movement, a stronger UN presence, and an independent foreign policy.    He jump-started modernisation: roads, schools, universities, tourism. These are things no king before him, and very few leaders after him, have been able to deliver at that scale.    But historians? They love to cry about ‚Äúdemocracy dying in 1960.‚Äù These same historians never admit that the so-called ‚Äúdemocrats‚Äù of the 50s were busy running the country into the ground. It‚Äôs easy to glorify B.P. Koirala in hindsight, but Mahendra was the one cleaning up the mess in real time.    Here‚Äôs the hard truth: Mahendra was the only king who actually acted like a king ‚Äî a protector of sovereignty. Everyone after him either coasted on his legacy or failed miserably. Without him, Nepal might not even exist as the independent state it is today.    Call him authoritarian all you want, but facts don‚Äôt lie. After Prithvi Narayan Shah, King Mahendra was the only true king Nepal ever had.",

He saved Nepal from being a puppet of foreign countries. He was a gem.|||Its not an unpopular opinion though. Those who know history know how Progressive Mahendra was. One thing though, his rapid advancements did over heat a fledgling Nepalese economy which is why we needed to privatize our industries. But the privatization was a joke,   they privatized it too quickly and privatization advocates in Nepal did admit they made a huge mistake later on.|||Mahendra is a complicated figure. On one hand, he did keep Nepal intact at a time when regional instability and internal divisions could have easily spiraled out of control.  On the other, his coup dismantled the first democratic experiment and concentrated power in the monarchy, which created long-term issues that Nepal is still untangling today.   It‚Äôs less that historians hate admitting he saved Nepal, and more that they frame it as a tradeoff between short-term stability and long-term democratic development.|||Popular opinion. It's because of Prithvi Narayan Shah and King Mahendra that modern day Nepal even exists as a separate country in its current form. Otherwise there would not have even been an independent country known as Nepal.|||His authoritarian enforcement of the Nepali language and Hindu traditions on a diverse population that wanted nothing to do with them was one of the causes of the civil war that would follow.  He killed democracy in its crib and pulled us back into medieval institutions. Even if I were to hypothetically accept that he was a good ruler for the sake of argument, there is no guarantee and his heirs and his heirs‚Äô heirs would have been good rulers, which is why absolute monarchy fails. Any good that he might have done during his reign is negated by the fact that long term institutions are more important than charismatic rulers, and he ruined the institution of democracy. All the instability that we have faced since 2008- would have happened in the 1950s and we could have been a prosperous democracy by the present. This guy pulled us decades back.  It‚Äôs easy to look back at the past with rose tinted glasses and romanticize it, that is the first step on the road to fascism, but the truth of life, prosperity and happiness is in the future and progressive institutions.|||The problem with Monarchy in Nepal and everywhere else is that there are few good apples in 1 crore ropani orchard.  Except PN Shah, Mahendra and maybe Birendra (many sources call him spineless but I don't know), no one else were fit to rule. The country fell into Ranas dictatorship  because of Monrachy system failure.  So here we are, dealing with generational political trauma.|||A quick ChatGPT will give you some real perspective:  Most historians and political analysts agree that King Mahendra‚Äôs reasons were more of a pretext to consolidate royal power rather than genuine democratic concerns. Here‚Äôs why:  1. Political instability was exaggerated  Nepal‚Äôs first elected government (1959‚Äì1960) under B. P. Koirala had been in office for only 18 months.  While there were some administrative problems, it wasn‚Äôt long enough to judge the parliamentary system a failure.  Corruption and inefficiency existed, but not at the level Mahendra claimed.   2. Fear of losing monarchical dominance  The 1959 elections gave the Nepali Congress a clear majority.  Koirala‚Äôs government was popular and gaining legitimacy, which posed a direct threat to the king‚Äôs absolute authority.  Mahendra feared the monarchy would become a ceremonial institution like in India or Britain.   3. Foreign policy pretext  Koirala pursued a relatively independent foreign policy, maintaining balance between India and China.  Mahendra accused him of endangering Nepal‚Äôs sovereignty, but in reality, the king wanted direct control over diplomacy, which was vital for aid and recognition.   4. Use of \"underdeveloped society\" argument  Mahendra claimed that Nepalese people weren‚Äôt ‚Äúready‚Äù for democracy due to illiteracy and lack of experience.  This was partly true, but instead of strengthening democratic institutions, he abolished parties and built a system where only the king‚Äôs will mattered.   5. The Panchayat system benefited him most  Under Panchayat, all political power flowed through the king.  It created the image of \"guided democracy,\" but in practice, it was royal autocracy with no accountability.   üìå Conclusion: Mahendra used the excuses of instability, corruption, and national unity to justify a royal coup. The deeper reason was to preserve absolute monarchy and prevent Nepal from transitioning into a genuine parliamentary democracy.|||Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus, with nine governments in ten years. That wasn‚Äôt democracy, it was chaos.  LOL. The King chose PM. He was the one responsible.|||Yes man agreed. He is the guy who defined Nepal and Nepali people. He did a lot of great works for the country. But many people and our school books consider him as a dictator telling about how he banned political parties and not mention about the reforms and development made by him for the country. One of the greatest leader of our country King Mahendra!!|||Ali history paddam, 1959 ma first election vako ho tyo vanda aagadi sab PM king le choose garya ho, 1st election ko 1.5 years ma coup vako ho.|||But his policies are disastrous for Nepal till this day  He opened Nepal's border with India, opened free trade with India, allowed India to build its Army base in Lipulekh Limpiyadhura Kalapani since then these territories are occupied by India  He also forced Khas culture on Newaris and Janjatis which influenced them to become Communists|||Agreed!|||Will not let anyone discredit the blood of 17k Nepali|||We wouldn't have been swallowed by any side. Non-alignment was the default policy from the beggining, and B.P koirala would have continued that policy. Nepal would have 'modernized' without an iron-fisted dictatorship.|||Matrika literally wanted to suck cock of india..   He was puppet of India...while BP was good...Matrika and BP's power struggle caused mahendra to step in...and take all the powers..   Thats my unpopular opinion too.|||I agree with most of your points. But your point about 10 governments in nine years doesn't show the instability created by parties but by the monarchs. The monarchs were the ones that were making them unstable. The one time it seemed to be stable, he couped the government. That doesn't diminish the fact thought, that his rule saw probably the most balanced foreign policy of Nepal, where Nepal truly stood out as a sovereign nature. I still believe that had Mahendra controlled a bit of his authoritarian ways and worked together with B.P. Koirala, Nepal would have been in a much better position that it is currently. Both of them are the best leaders Nepal had post P.N. Shah. It might be an unpopular opinion but I think P.N. Shah might be more important historically, but these two are probably the best leaders Nepal got, even better than P.N. Shah.|||Unpopular hoina, brain-dead opinion.

Ani jabo dui tukra road pitch garyo bhandai ma khusi hune??|||sovereignty? of who? Mahendra model of nation-building was \"one religion, one custom, one language.\" Hindu orthodoxy was enforced as state ideology, treating non-Hindu communities as second-class. Nepali was imposed as the only legitimate language, sidelining rich traditions like Maithili, Newar, Tharu, Tamang, Limbu, etc. This wasn't genuine unity - it was control through forced uniformity. What looked like stability was in fact suppression. That brittle foundation is why today's Nepal wrestles with federalism, ethnic assertion, and identity politics: democracy didn't invent division, it revealed what had long been silenced.  The Koiralas, born and educated in Banaras, were accused of being \"too Indian.\" But Nepal had no universities, no political freedom, no space for intellectual growth - precisely because the tyrants had closed those doors. Should they be condemned for seeking ideas in India, or credited for importing the democratic imagination Nepal lacked?  So the paradox is clear:  Mahendra centralized the state but weakened society.|||First question, why was Nepal unstable during those years? And second more important question, if stability was the most important thing for us, why did he take over from a parliament that had a 2/3 majority and the government was led by THE BP Koirala? There was a little chance that the Koirala govt would have toppled and was doing good work..  Yes, there were some long term projects under him that were very good for Nepal. There‚Äôs no denying that and kudos to him. But he was authoritarian, there is no denying that either. Let‚Äôs not over glorify someone and gloss over facts because they don‚Äôt fit our views..|||Educated boomers hate him(my boomer dad lol).|||Nepal was too small for the OG Mahendra.

Hamas and their ilk, like Jamkash, happily point fingers at Jews and Hindus for every woe, but when it‚Äôs time to face their own kind, they scatter like roaches, spineless. Yet we let their hate-preaching ideology fester in our hills, unchecked. No more. Deport their firebrand clerics, cut off their dirty foreign cash. We must back our own against Hamas, demand international recognition to flex Nepal‚Äôs strength, resilience, and power. This must never happen again. Israel‚Äôs crushing these terrorists, shutting up the bloody liberals whining ‚Äúcontext‚Äù over our dead. Nepal, rise, reject this death cult, or lose more Bipins. #NepalStands #HateKills #GenZFails|||also euta kura sachhauna mann lagyo yo Rest in peace vanne sabda christain haru ko ho , they do not believe in re-incarnation so they say that rest in peace so that they won‚Äôt come back but hamro hindu sanskar ma we believe in next janma and we say ‚Äú Hardik shradhhanjali ‚Äú|||[deleted]|||Bro what|||We had hope.

Every other Indian city from Delhi to Bangalore organizes Garba nights during Nauratha, and people participate regardless of their background. They just want to have fun. And honestly, this whole debate reflects how we treat culture in Nepal as well where Bahun Chhetri traditions and Nepali language are promoted as the ‚Äòreal‚Äô identity, while 100+ other languages and ethnic cultures are pushed aside.  And culture is never static. Its constantly influenced by a lot of things like art, cinema, migration, globalization, internet, exchange and influence as well. The same people who happily pay to watch Bollywood movies in movie theaters, worship actors like Salman and Shahrukh and just hoot loudly when they come on screen at theaters, and listen to, sing & dance to Hindi songs without thinking twice suddenly get offended if someone enjoys Garba.

Don‚Äôt get too attached to it.|||Just by criticizing everything doesn't make you intellectual.|||Cultures and traditions naturally spread over time, and this spread is accelerated by influence. Media is the most powerful driver of that influence, and that‚Äôs why our local culture feels as though it is being overshadowed. The problem is not that people no longer value their own culture, but that our media presence is extremely weak compared to others.  Think about how Indian culture has spread in Nepal: through movies, songs, TV serials, and now online content. (migration, political connection and cultural proximity are other factors but in this case, the primary driver is media). The same is true for Western cultures, especially American culture, which influences our everyday lives, from what we eat and wear to the way we think. The recent Garba incident may be one example, but it represents a much broader pattern: cultural identity travels and takes root primarily through media.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, since cultures have always spread, adapted, and reshaped themselves over time. (I mean we'll definitely feel good if a foreigner adopts nepali culture). But preserving one‚Äôs own culture is equally important, because it forms a core pillar of identity. And preservation in today‚Äôs world is only possible through strengthening our own media i.e. by producing movies, songs, and online content that reflect and celebrate our traditions. And they need to be good, not some low effort cash converter sold in the name of patriotism.  And just for context: Garba is not only celebrated in Gujarat, but across India. (showing spread of a culture).|||I dont really see how this would affect op or anyone else for that matter enough to create this discord. And where do you draw the line?

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. üò≠üò≠2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye üò≠|||[deleted]|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

To this young innocent guy here , I too thought about reporting it and asking a bug bounty but I already knew I was not going to get any so I just opened my laptop and got an extension named M8UL downloader or something to download all those videos , ( why I downloaded an extension?? : cause institutions upload videos in small small chunks of file that play altogether to form a video , like you you download from other extension you will find files of 8sec 15sec more than 100 of such files will exist there and the extension I mentioned just compiles them all and let you download the full video ) .|||Hello u/Space_X_Offical, thank you for contributing to r/NepalPlusTwo.

Because there was no one to guide me, i failed this year's neb board.   so from someone who learned from his own experience, my best advice is that you don't depend only on teachers from your school. there are tons of videos on youtube and tons of notes and  straight up answers in the internet.   if you do not understand and get anything at all, then only focus on the questions that are asked many times or repeated i.e only imp questions.   you have to make sure that you atleast passing marks, so look focus on the chapters you understand and master them first then only focus on others.   You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can‚Äôt get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.
