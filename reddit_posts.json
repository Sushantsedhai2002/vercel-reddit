Dubei group ko extremist ko rise hudei cha.  But these are the kind of things I used to see in Indian news but lately I have been seeing it in Nepali news as well. So yesterday I was in Birgunj and I witnessed something that made me kinda angry as well as sad. I had seen it in videos too but iguess seeing it live just pisses you off more.  So what happened was yesterday, this huge group of guys carrying those “Jay Shree Ram” flags were having this really huge rally in Birgunj. You could easily see majority of them were Indians. In the rally there were tons of bikes but most of them had number plates of India. They had this jeep where lots of guys were hanging and chanting Jay Shree Ram, huge speakers blasting music. And the guys on the bike were not wearing helmets or anything, instead they were over confident, driving recklessly. Some of them were even carrying swords, yes literal swords.  And there was police presence but only couple of them. And yeah it was too irritating. Especially the fact that half of them were Indians, they were in Indian vehicles, out here in Nepal doing unnecessary stunt bazi. It just pissed me off. They were disturbing traffic as well but no way anyone could say anything because you can literally see they are those rowdy ones. They too are goons of some group so arguing with them meant getting into a fight with them. Even though there were cops I hardly believe situation would’ve gotten calm sooner. Anyways yeah, seeing so many Indian Bihari people out there with their Bihari number plate here in Nepal disturbing peace just pissed me off.  **Also isn’t there some law or anything barring Indian vehicles to participate in this kind of activities in Nepal?** Because more than half of the vehicles there were Indian. Isn’t this them disturbing peace of another nation? I mean I am not aware about the law so asking. They were in another country, in their own country’s bikes, no helmets or anything, reckless driving, disturbing peace, sometimes even getting into riots. How is this not illegal?  And that makes me think, **is this something they’re (gov) deliberately letting happen?** I mean, obviously cops can’t just make arrests themselves, they need orders from higher-ups. So are the higher-ups letting this pass due to some political reason? Or are they too under the control of Indian influence or what? Because like I said, these were literally citizens of another country disturbing the peace of our country. Yes, there were Nepali people in the rally too, tons of Nepali vehicles as well, but there were equal numbers of Indian vehicles. Gunda haru liera aako thiey India dekhi nei.  So just wanted to share this here as well. These kind of things have been going on since quite some time recently. Just few months back here in Birgunj there was this huge fight between Muslim group and Hindu group. Now idk who was the culprit here or anything but I do know that Indian group infiltration is one of the most likely reason.",

I’ve done a bit of googling but I’m still confused. Here are some of my main doubts:  * Would it make more sense to start with mutual funds as a beginner and then move to stocks once I understand things better? * How exactly do mutual funds in Nepal work? Can I sell them anytime I want, or are there lock-in periods? * Are mutual funds actually profitable or at least decent in the long run? * Or should I just skip mutual funds and go straight into buying a few stocks, even if it’s just for experimenting and learning? * Also, if I do want to start, which broker would be the best choice for someone new?  Basically, I’m trying to figure out the safest but also most practical way to start. I don’t expect to get rich quickly, but I also don’t want my money to just sit idle.

            "body": "Hey r/Nepal, I'm a Grade 12 student dealing with a family crisis and I need urgent advice. My grandpa has severe CKD and an infection.   The government hospital in our district (Rajbiraj) is supposed to provide free dialysis for poor citizens, but they are refusing him due to the infection, and they're also sitting on unused dialysis machines claiming \"no installation space.\"  Because of this, my dad has to take my grandpa on a long, single-session trip to Dharan every week.  My dad is a security guard with a strict 12-hour shift, 7 days a week, because there are only two guards at the bank. He is exhausted, sick, and running himself into the ground.  I feel helpless watching him struggle against the company's rules and the hospital's cruelty. I have two urgent questions:  1. Work Shift: Is the 12-Hour Shift Legal? Is the security company legally required to pay my dad overtime (1.5x basic wage) for the 4 hours worked beyond the standard 8? How do we check his payslip and enforce this  Idk if 12 hour shift he is doing is considered stander or overtime. But I know before the few years it was 3 guard in bank with 8 hour of shift. 2 in day and 1 in night.  Is it legal to make him work for 12 hour.    Can he legally request a reduced shift or a third guard, citing a critical family health emergency that's affecting his ability to work safely?  2. Hospital Denial:  What are our Rights?   The hospital is denying a free, life-saving service to a Bippana citizen. Where in the Nepali government (Health Ministry, Human Rights, Provincial Directorate) can I file a formal complaint?  How can we use public pressure (like local media) to shame the hospital into installing the unused dialysis machines they are hoarding due to an absurd \"no space\" excuse?  Please, any practical advice or contact info for legal/social workers in Nepal would be a lifeline right now. Thank you   I have uses ai for better articulation",

Is the security company legally required to pay my dad overtime (1.5x basic wage) for the 4 hours worked beyond the standard 8? How do we check his payslip and enforce this**  No, it is not legal. Look at [the labor act](https://antislaverylaw.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/The-Labour-Act-2017.pdf). Go to page 18. It says:  >**Working hours:** (1) No employer shall employ labours to work more than eight hours a day and forty-eight hours a week. (2) The labours shall be provided with half an hour rest after five hours of continuous work. (3) In the cases of work which is not to be stopped and is to be carried out continuously, labours shall be provided with such a rest time turn by turn.  >**Not to compel to work overtime:** (1) No employer shall compel a labour to work more than the hours set forth in sub-section (1) of Section 28.  >**Additional remuneration to be paid:** (1) While employing any labour to work overtime pursuant to Section 30, the employer shall pay to the labour remuneration at a rate of 1.5 times of the basic remuneration receivable during regular hours of work.  In simple words, your father should only be made to work 8 hours a day, 48 hours a week. He can't be forced to work more than that. Even in those 8 hours a day shift, he should be given 30 hours a rest after every 5 hours of continuous work. And overtime is completely voluntary. That overtime should be paid at 1.5 times the normal rate.  **2. Hospital Denial: What are our Rights?**  **The hospital is denying a free, life-saving service to a Bippana citizen. Where in the Nepali government (Health Ministry, Human Rights, Provincial Directorate) can I file a formal complaint?**  Hami Nepal might be able to help you. I have seen them protest against BPKIHS and Bir Hopsital for similar issues.  [Here](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/179ztit2RC/) is Hami Nepal asking Bir Hospital administration that they use all the instruments available, among many other things. Their reach has grown after the GenZ protest, especially due to Sudan's involvement with the negotiations.

From the news, it seems like your movement forced real accountability in just a couple of days, which is incredible.  I'm from Morocco, here we are dealing with very similar frustrations, endemic corruption, mismanagement, and policies that leave young people and everyday folks behind. We've already kicked off our own protests (youth-led ones demanding better health and education services, sparked by hospital crises in Agadir and spreading to cities like Rabat, Casablanca, and Tangier), but we're hitting a wall with strong pushback from government forces: arrests, heavy police presence, and restrictions on gatherings.   We want to learn from your playbook to sustain momentum. Could you share some practical advice from your experience?   If you have personal stories, strategies, or even small tips from the front lines, we'd be grateful to hear them. What's one lesson from your protests that helped the most when things got intense?Thanks for your solidarity, stay strong, and here's hoping for better days on both sides.  World of GenZ",

            "comments": "on the field, have a commander of some sorts. someone to listen to if you need to fall back or coordinate. they need a mic. please dont do the \"leaderless\" naivity we did.|||Set your agenda clear. Be ready for anykind of emergency situtaion, think who can be your leader if all leaders flee away or resign. And having a leader is always better. A protest without leader is just an uncontrollable crowd.|||What happened in Nepal was an unfortunate luck.    First day protest was supposed to be peaceful protest against corruption of politicians, calling out Nepo kids and their luxury life.   Protesters entered the parliament(my theory is mimicking capital riot of USA thinking they won't be shot). 19 people died that day, including school kids.   This happened in such a sudden manner that entire country went to sleep trying to undertake what just happened.   Second day was the turning point as citizens raged and destroyed public property and lives were lost. A lot of inncoents.   We still are in uncertain phase and waiting for election.   One suggestion would be to protest peacefully and stay out of chaos.|||Set an agenda in advance, dont let the rioters damage juideciery, catch your leaders before they flee.|||Have a leader or two. And make sure you have a clear agenda. Very Very important.|||Set the agenda in Advance, write it in paper, If click make a symbolic photo of agenda paper handover, so that you can use that as an anchor to remind the interim government if they are slow or not doing their part. Share this picture everywhere so that this becomes a symbol.       Get back to building your society immediately if damage is too much.       Nepalese people saying corruption control is not happening are expecting interim government to round up politicians immediately without investigation, only to be released by next government after 6 month.   This is my expectation: I expected interim government to do is heavily target leader politicians of each party on corruption probe, KP OLI, Deuba, Prachanda. If they can jail them, atleast make it looks like they are almost nearing to arrest them, so that they become the news. We desperately need the news to travel remote areas for next election.|||well. in nepal, it is set that tho bad things are happening. Everyone has some kind of democratic consciousness. So, politicians cant really do massive arrest to dismiss the protest. This is enshrined to everyone of us. There are few radicals so, it is easier for everyone to get behind one agenda. So, young and olds will get behind it, though it was set to be GenZ revolution.   Also, it was very noble of nepalese army who had whole country in their palm, still didnt do any coup for power grab. This is very dangerous situation to be in. You dont wanna be in that situation.|||[ Removed by Reddit ]|||Please have a designated leader. Things will go to shit otherwise.|||The purity of Nepalese protests is that they didn’t have a single leader or figure who could manipulate or guide them—but that also became a boon. In Nepal, many groups with different political agendas infiltrated the movement. Youths are full of energy, often aggressive, so it becomes important to gather people in smaller groups, form a clear idea, and even assign group coordinators to channel the movement in a peaceful—not harmful way. These were our strengths and successes.  Now, let’s talk about the **failures, or our learning from aftermath of protest**:  1. **Lack of Political & Legal Awareness** Most youths had little knowledge of how law and politics work. A better approach would have been to involve seniors or mentors in discussions, and spread awareness through social media and educational circles. 2. **Losing the Narrative** Traditional media often framed the protests as violent, blaming youths for looting or burning when things went south. The counter-narrative should have emphasized that the government’s primary duty is protecting citizens’ lives and property. Responsibility for escalation lies on both sides—but more on the government. 3. **No Long-Term Structure or Sustainability** The protests lacked continuity beyond the streets. Once the immediate momentum died down, there was no organized follow-up in the form of civic groups, policy advocacy, or institutional lobbying. Without this, the energy of the movement dissolved quickly, leaving little long-term impact.  At the end of the day, what happens **after the protest** matters more than anything. Anarchists may tell you to “kill the leaders,” but trust me no revolution built on that idea has ever succeeded. Real victory comes when you channel the movement into lasting change.  That means making a **clear list of demands (1, 2, 3, 4 …)** and pushing to embed those changes inside the **constitution and legal framework**. Only then will the fight truly be won.  But in our case, even though we toppled the government, at the end of the day we lost more than we gained **the precious lives of 75 people, historic monuments, and even the trust of private sectors.**|||If you are expecting things to escalate:  Don't use hands to fight guns, at least use slingshots. Wear jackets, helmets. Take plenty of water and first aid kits with you.   Make sure your demands are properly stated, written and tegulated to public. Use proper means of communication on the ground and on air.|||Find the right leader, otherwise the protest will be hijacked. Jail those politicians as soon as possible.|||Set agendas, set leadership, select the good retired bureaucrats and lawmakers and don't rush for meeting g without setting the fixed agendas. |||Expect the Government to do anything even murder innocent people in numbers. Do not trust them. Keep protesting going. You people protesting in numbers is the biggest nightmare for any authoritarianism, eventually they will cave.|||The main agenda of protest was corruption control, I don’t see that happening in Nepal.|||Set clear agenda and implement it immediately. Know the constitution.|||[ Removed by Reddit ]|||Especially do anything you want but safely and don't destroy government properties.|||You guys need a project manager|||Don't destroy public properties|||I followed a bit of morocco's protest. What i think you guys are lacking is a leadership, clear goals. Also not strong moral narrative. In nepal, everyone was mad at the government and police for killing innocent children, (who were not looting of causing violence). They lost moral group. Police gave up next day. It was also very widespread too gov didn't have the capacity to handle it. Moroccan gov is more authoritarian too. Thus i think yall should expect more resistance. Yall didn't had the element of suprise or as strong moral backing or as clear goals or leadership like in nepal too.  Also idk how the protest is being organized but using discord for it is so great. Try and learn about what we did on discord also in hongkong|||If you guys have an internet shutdown, make sure everyone has this app that communicates via bluetooth. There are several, agree on one that everyone will use.|||1. Set clear adgendas.  2. Have gen-z leadership in place.  3. Don't let the infiltrators like udan urung hijack the revolution.  4. Don't damage the public property!|||DO NOT FALL FOR IT! What Nepal went through was a colour revolution strongly backed by the deep state.

Taxis will be fine. Like everyone else, you are best requesting them on InDrive so you have a fixed price before starting. Make sure to select whether you want a bike or car to get you, and you can also raise/lower the price you are requesting.   In terms of walking in the dark, it’s always best practice anywhere to minimize time out after dark. The streets of Kathmandu are safe, but I’d still avoid it after the point when everyone is asleep. When there are still plenty of people out and about and it’s dark, it’s fine.|||Yeah, use inDrive, it's cheaper than Pathao anyway.

Use ride sharing app instead of directly  hiring cabs, Taxi drivers doesn’t charge you fare amount.  Popular Apps, 1.) Pathao ( most reliable and efficient, easy) 2.) indriver (relaible , efficient and cheap) 3.) Yango ( Newer but has fewer ridider)  Note : you will not get ride sharing taxis directly from arrival gate ) walk 50 m  to the road and ask rider to pick up.

I called the booking company and explained the situation. They said to try and find another insurance provider for now. I am not confident that’s going to happen.  So, I’m wondering: are there any Aussies here who’ve booked travel recently and found an insurance provider that will still cover Nepal?  Also, how safe is it to travel there right now? The tour company says they’re still operating, and I’d be keen to go — but only if I can get proper insurance of course. Otherwise I will ask to be given a refund or credit.",

I’ve been self-studying React, TanStack Query, and responsive design with vanilla CSS. I also see that many companies ask for skills like **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and sometimes Next.js**. What I’m unclear about is:  * Which frontend stacks are most commonly used in our country’s IT companies? * For state management, is Redux Toolkit still the standard, or are lighter solutions like Zustand common? * For data fetching/caching, do companies prefer TanStack Query, SWR, or something else?  I’d really appreciate it if someone could help me build a **clearer roadmap** tailored to my current level. I know software engineers are busy, so I respect your time — I’m also willing to pay for mentorship, and we can discuss the price over a call.  Thanks in advance 🙏",

From what I think you are trying to do is check the contents of your old disk without being infected by anything?   If so you can just plug it in and see the list of contents (without opening any files or running any executables in it) and be safe (most likely), cuz just plugging it in doesn't usually affect.  If you want to run executables within it, use virtualbox on your new laptop, fire up a windows vm and run those there. It's the closest you can do to *\"create clone of laptop\".*|||dd",

This will help in the future as well to keep tab on battery degradation. Windows also has the 'Balanced' battery mode as default. If you want longer battery runtimes turn on the power saver mode or use the battery saver battery option.   \\- Cleanliness: keep your laptop free from dust and dirt to make it run better for longer. Since it's new and under warranty you don't want to go around opening the back panel to clean it every few months just yet. But install an app to keep an eye on the temps, that will let you know if the temperature rises then it might be clogged vents and dust on the fans.   \\- Backup: make sure you backup Windows regularly because one bad update can mess your laptop up. System restore is a good option to use as well as Windows backup using a separate pen drive.    \\- Hard drive partition: If your SSD/HDD is all just one drive then you might want to partition it to have one C: drive for Windows and other drives for your personal files so that in case you need to reinstall Windows your data on the second drive is safe   \\- Remove unwanted apps: Windows comes with a fair share of bloatware, you can install each and every one of these that you don't need.   \\- Startup apps: When you install a new app they are more than likely to be enabled to run at startup. You don't always need all of these to run every time your laptop starts. Disable these from within Task Manager.   \\- Security: Windows Defender is good enough for most of the user but if you want extra security look up a reputable antivirus software and install it. Do note that AV will slow down the PC if they are running scans on the background.   \\- Laptop specific control software: This might already be installed on your laptop.

Attention within the Nepali Congress–CPN-UML alliance has now shifted to deciding who will be appointed the next Chief Election Commissioner. With Congress obtaining the governor’s post, UML leaders have argued that the position of Chief Election Commissioner should go to their party.  >Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba had previously stated during a conversation with journalists on May 6 that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had agreed to allow Nepali Congress to choose the central bank governor. In line with that agreement, Dr. Biswo Nath Poudel was appointed governor on Tuesday.  >Meanwhile, the Election Commission has been operating under an acting head for over a month. Ram Prasad Bhandari, who himself is facing a legal challenge in the Supreme Court over his own appointment, has been serving as acting chief commissioner. Currently, the commission is operating with only three out of its mandated five officials. One chief commissioner and one commissioner position remain vacant.  >**The commission had seen a sweeping round of appointments when the previous Oli-led government amended the Constitutional Council Act via ordinance and appointed 52 officials to various constitutional bodies in a single move.**",

In the heart of those difficult days stood one face — Shrinkhala Khatiwada — who shared repeated apology videos and presented herself as a victim and tells that she shares these emotions.  But now, barely weeks later, she is back to celebrations. Tomorrow, at Resort, a wedding party is being held with her family.  This feels wrong. For someone who was seen as an inspirational model to nepo baby and again apolizing, this sudden shift from grief and accountability to festivity sends a very different message.  I just hope this doesn’t turn into a show on social media — because the wounds of the people are still fresh, and many are still mourning",

You have to understand that Oppressor ('upper') caste people had the sole right over every single major resource of the society since before PN Shah's time. We had the sole right to education, resources, state jobs and treated people as less than human. We enjoyed free labour, respect and economic benefit from the society. They could r\\*ape women at their will, displace people from society and enjoyed protection from the state. No one was able to question them. And this continues to this day.  2. Let's try and get into other people's shoes for once. Imagine hearing the history of exploitations inflicted upon you for generations by a certain caste. Your grand parents tell you the experience of their own exploitation and that they've heard from their grand parents. Your parents add to it. You hear it from your relatives and their shared history. And then you, yourself, as a young person experience it in your life. Don't you think you'd be angry?  3. We do not have either enough understanding or the representation of the oppressed caste in this country. If this stupid sub does not let me write the word Dal\\*t without a warning. I bet this was policy put in place by an oppressor caste person. When do you think we will have the first oppressed caste prime minister of this country?

When my son was born, we did his naming and pasni the Hindu way, and this year, my mom put tika on us. My dad would have too, but he's in Nepal, and we're not. I don't really consider myself religious, but I'll always cherish these traditions to stay connected to my roots.

The only nearby house on that side is the one you can see in the window reflection. We don’t really have issues with them we barely even talk. The only thing that ever happened was like a year or two ago when their daughter scolded me because my phone was too loud on the balcony in the same kitchen room . I apologized and that was that.  But recently during the festivals, my cousins were making noise in the kitchen at night, so maybe that annoyed someone.Not sure.Just my silly guess.  No CCTV on that side of the house, so I can’t really check. But it’s definitely done by a person. Any guesses who could’ve done this.",

This is what most Nepali Christians are taught in churches - if they follow the tradition of wearing tika, they are going against those commandments.|||Dashain Tika is more of a tradition than a ritual. It varies from person to person.|||I am a Christian too and i put tika in dashain. We dont worship idols and we dont believe in many gods but we love participating in festivals either its hindu or muslim or any other religion. There are extremists who think people who dont follow Christianity go to hell but we dont believe such nonsense idea. We believe our God is so loving that He loves all of us either you are atheist or follow other religions and we have free agency to choose whatever we want so we are supposed to judge noone.There are lot of denominations of christianity which confuses lot of people.|||there are no true christians in nepal. trust me|||probably because it's a hindu custom and they're christians? i mean it's like asking a hindu person why don't they go to church on sunday? am i wrong?|||Hinduism is a very loose and open religion, they do not require much loyalty to one God but also believe many gods even outside of Hinduism to be true. As such, they are allowed to take part in activities of other religions.  Christianity presents itself as the truth, as stated by Jesus Himself, \"I am the way, the truth and the life, no one comes to God except through me\".   And the Bible is clear on forgiveness of sin is only through the atonement done by Christ. As such, we shouldn't believe in any other religion as implied by the teachings of Jesus Himself, along with the first commandment.   That is not to say practicing activities of other religions is bad. It is more of an act of loyalty towards ones religion more than anything.   So according to bible, I am not 100% sure that practicing other religious activities is bad but here is a verse that supports the claim:  Romans 12:2 says:  Do not conform to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and pleasing and perfect   This verse is commonly interpreted on not getting along with worldly things such as pleasure, pride, materialism, fame, but may also include other religious practices |||Catholics le lawxa but Protestant le lawdena raixa. I have neighbours and friends of Protestant belief. Btw one of my Protestant friends who's dead now once said that how our Hindu gods and godesses looked like ghosts and satan like whereas Jesus looks more handsome and godly like with his white robe and french cut. Btw everybody hates these Protestant Mfs when they are in their preach mode.|||She is a true Christian, following the bible.  **Corinthians 8:4-6:** \"So then, about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that 'An idol is nothing at all in the world' and that 'There is no God but one.'... yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live.\"  * Notice here: Paul affirms the non-existence of the idol, but also warns that behind it lies a demonic reality (1 Cor 10:20)    * It's Abrahamic religion, monotheistic at core. You haven't perhaps met Brahmins who won't eat from even less brahmins. Many Muslims don't eat chickens, goats and any meat unless they are verified Halal even in muslims eateries.|||Well my maa converted for a year or so due to some shit ass converters and in dashain when we asked her why not wear a Tika its just a Tika then she said the church pastor told her that the as Tika is a symbol of kali or durga they are demons cause they eat blood or sth like that and want bali they said they are rakshas or blood thirsty demons and if she puts on a Tika the demons shaitans rakshas will get to stay in her body. They brainwashed her with this shit. And u know why my pure Buddhist maa converted bc she was having knee problems and sleeping problem as most old age people and her close friend our neighbor who is a recent converted bitch she said if u convert to Christianity all her problems will get solved her knee problem will also go and such bullshit. As my maa is so innocent she believed that bitch women and converted for a year but as though being a Christian for a year didn't heal her she came back to our newar Buddhism and she is more happy now she does bhajans Poojas and plays instruments now. Those bitch ass pastors and their shit ass followers would come to our house to \"pray\" shouting always at their gods asking for good life whenever there's a Buddhist festival to not make my maa feel inclined to her festival and change her mind they did that for a year in every festival. That's why I hate nepali pastors and those recently converted assholes.|||abrahamic religion teaching sabai ustai ho which is opposite of dharmik religion|||This is what I have observed since I have any Christian friends that are Nepali. Since she’s Nepali I’m sure her parents converted to Christianity from Hinduism and not putting tika prob means drawing a line to show they’ve left Hindu rituals. It would be different if they were born Christian. It’s to show their community they have left Hinduism. Convert gare Pachi it reinforces that new identity in their mind and they prob want to stay loyal to their new religion and draw a big boundary.|||I mean.. do you celebrate Christmas??

If you think Nepali Christians are brain washed you should meet Christians from all over the world. They're all just as brainwashed.. But so are Muslims and Hindus. This post in itself shows the level of brain wash and hindu superiority complex just because we are a Hindu majority country. If you think about it.. Long time before anyone ever set foot in Nepal, or anywhere, there were no religion. Its a man made concept to brainwash and control people... There were people who were doing amazing things within it but in general that was never the goal.

But the tourists are often open minded, atheist or not very religious. But evangelical Christians do not believe in any other God than the one they follow. And Christianity in missions specifically teach them to be evangelical. Hence Nepali Christians often don’t want to involve in any Hindu ritual including tika. It sounds ridiculous but from their point of view it makes sense.  One thing I find strange is that we never bring up this issue with Muslims or Jews, only Christians.   Everyone has a right to discard one religious belief for another and it shouldn’t be taken personally. Their right to not put tika should not be taken as an offense and respected. This brings harmony no matter what religion we follow.|||Why does it matter? They can choose |||Following one religion means automatically hating the other.

Jesus is the son of god and mary is the mother of Jesus. They are not Gods. Christians dont have an image of their god. Therefore no idol.|||Christians are not a monolith, just like Hindus are not a monolith. Some are culturally Christian, others aren't.   Full disclosure: I'm an atheist.   Rig Vedic people from central Asia brought their gods to the Indian subcontinent, where there were ethnically different diverse groups of people with a multitude of gods/reliefs/beliefs/traditions. Over centuries, these mixed and became today's Hinduism with a mix of Vedic gods like Indra, Agni, Barun, etc, but also regional gods like Shiva, Pashupati, a multitude of Devis, etc. So, the Hinduism we have today is an amalgamation of central Asian and Indian subcontinent traditions. Dashain itself is a non Rig-Vedic, Devi worshipping tradition.  By the time, Jesus, a Jew, was born in Roman occupied Judea, Yahweh had been, over time promoted as the only God of thr Jews. A few centuries earlier, Jews had worshipped a pantheon of Gods, headed by El Al, with his consort Ashareya and a multitude of divine beings, in which Jahweh was not one of the main gods. Over time, the cult of Yahweh dominated other Jewish cults and promoted him over other Jewish gods to the position of the monotheistic God. Even then, it would have been weird for an Egyptian or a Mesopotamian or a Greek to worship Yahwrh, because they each had their own pantheon of Gods. So, over time, by the time Jesus was born, being a Jew meant that you had entered a covenant with Yahweh, where you had promised to worship him before other gods and to do a few other things, and in return, Yahweh was to protect you.  Well, Judea was under Roman occupation, so Yahweh sure as heck wasn't doing much protecting. Jesus was likely a ragtag preacher that went around preaching to anyone who'd listen that it was the Jews that had failed Yahweh by not observing his laws, that he'd have a judgment day where Yahweh would come and  he'd establish Jesus as the king of the Jews and the righteous  ones   would get to live in this Jewish kingdom with Jesus as king. The poor sap likely never dared preach that he was Yahweh himself. Had he done that, the Jews would have likely beat the crap out of him.  Anyways, he is killed as a common criminal by the Romans and that would have been it - that a Jew street preacher with little following died an unconsequencial death. Then come the rumors of the alleged miracles that he performed. If you read the new testament, there are four gospels - 3 of which share similar stories (in contradictory manner) while the 4th one, the Gospel of John gets batshit crazy.   What likely happened is that who this guy was got bragged up as time went on. He started out, after his death, as the future king of the jews, which was gonna happen after his resurrection. From there, he likely got elevated to the son of God through adoption via baptism. From there, he likely got elevated to the son of God ( Yahweh) by birth, via Mary being impregnated by Yahweh via the holy spirit. Fro.there, he likely got elevated to being Yahweh himself. This would have sounded batshit crazy to Jews. It'd be like the dumbass Nepalis every few years claiming to be Buddha or some other diety, and still have brainteasers moron followers.   So, he is God now, yet, he is still a God of the his Jew followers. It would have been weird for a non Jew to be a follower of Jesus. Then comes Paul, quickly displaces the people that the Jesus character actually interacted with and claims that via dream, or whatever hallucinations he was having that this religion has been opened up for non Jews. Prior to that, to be a Christian would have been for a non-Jew to become a Jew first and then a follower of Jesus.  The story of Christianity is this in a nutshell: Yahweh had to have himself birthed in order to have himself killed (read up original sin, without which concept there is no Christianity) as a sacrifice to himself to appease him to create a loophole around the original sin problem created by the Jewish mythological character Eve, which Yahweh, being the all-knowing, would have known beforehand anyways. It is very convoluted and only makes sense if you have no critical thinking ability. It's the same for all religions though.   Anyways, sorry about going on 18 different tangents.|||Cos they go to different churches , different pastors and sects have different teachings . Sabai hindu le pani tika lagaudaina .

Most of all, register and VOTE.|||No, we should be thankful that we have overcome the first step of political crisis. Yes, at the time constitution's word by word wasn't matched for forming government. But President did form the govt and dissolve by abiding with the constitution. And not anybody was appointed. The former Chief Justice was appointed, who , even by the position, is supposed to be the most learned of the laws worldwide and Nepal. The only bad is that we have an interim government, but the election date has been fixed and we should in anyway possible make the election successful, even if the interim government fails to do any other thing beside that. Cuz having a parliament is very very necessary brother. Good governance, Corruption control and investigation, all can come in time being, but the democratic, free, and sovereign country do need parliament. We may not like the members and representatives there, but for our democracy and peoples sovereignty, parliament must be there. That is the reason, the upper house National Assembly is still there.  I just read the news in BBC that Taliban government shut down all the internet in Afghanistan. And the people have nothing to say there. Already they had girls education completely removed from the country. And in Sudan there is a terrible civil war ongoing, even worse than Ukraine and Gaza, merely because multiple factions within the army and political groups want executive power for themselves. The condition is pathetic there. Just so so sad.  I know Nepali are frustrated with the government. But let's understand one thing, in Nepal our Parliament and legislative is supposed to be more powerful than the other two bodies. If government fails to do as expected, we should elect better party in the Parliament. Moreover, the development is not just duty of Prime Minister and council of ministers. The administration of Nepal also called the permanent government is there to carry out the tasks for governance and development. The political structure, that is PM and council of Ministers are primarily to make the administrative structures accountable and focused to the citizens' need, demand and aspirations.  So, let's not be too emotional and aggressive to the point that we focus too much on executive and not the legislative and parliament. Laws, Constitution, System can only be changed through Parliament only , and that should always be. So please, dear fellow Nepali brothers and sisters, let's help the interim government to function as best as it possibly can and soon have the parliament, and fully constitutionally functioning all three organs of the state: Legislative, Executive, and Judiciary. Let's participate in the election with joy and hope, and elect the best, if not, the best among the worst, and bring the country into running and stability. Please. This is not the time to fight amongst each other. We need to be united as one Nepali in this so vulnerable time. We will not have a country man, if we keep on fighting and not helping the interim government. Let's elect our representatives in Falgun 21, and do fighting then after. Making the representatives accountable, pressuring them to amend as per our choice through peaceful protest, signature campaign. But for the few coming months till election, let's be optimistic and help each other in family, friends, and communities to participate and be excited for election. We will only have a country, if we can keep it. A country needs the parliament. It is the soul. Executive helps develop, provide security. But the source of our sovereignty, our say in the nation, is through our representative in parliament. How much we want to fight now, let's fight in the parliament. Parliament is literally a place to hear each other, discuss and debate. Let's be fully focused in electing our favored representative and , in bad case best amongst worst, for now please guyss.|||The cleanest and the only way GenZ can get out of this is to win the election by a massive landslide  Parties haru khatisakey.

We want to learn from your playbook to sustain momentum. Could you share some practical advice from your experience?

Protesters entered the parliament(my theory is mimicking capital riot of USA thinking they won't be shot). 19 people died that day, including school kids.   This happened in such a sudden manner that entire country went to sleep trying to undertake what just happened.   Second day was the turning point as citizens raged and destroyed public property and lives were lost. A lot of inncoents.   We still are in uncertain phase and waiting for election.   One suggestion would be to protest peacefully and stay out of chaos.|||Set an agenda in advance, dont let the rioters damage juideciery, catch your leaders before they flee.|||Have a leader or two. And make sure you have a clear agenda. Very Very important.|||Set the agenda in Advance, write it in paper, If click make a symbolic photo of agenda paper handover, so that you can use that as an anchor to remind the interim government if they are slow or not doing their part. Share this picture everywhere so that this becomes a symbol.       Get back to building your society immediately if damage is too much.       Nepalese people saying corruption control is not happening are expecting interim government to round up politicians immediately without investigation, only to be released by next government after 6 month.   This is my expectation: I expected interim government to do is heavily target leader politicians of each party on corruption probe, KP OLI, Deuba, Prachanda. If they can jail them, atleast make it looks like they are almost nearing to arrest them, so that they become the news. We desperately need the news to travel remote areas for next election.|||well. in nepal, it is set that tho bad things are happening. Everyone has some kind of democratic consciousness. So, politicians cant really do massive arrest to dismiss the protest. This is enshrined to everyone of us. There are few radicals so, it is easier for everyone to get behind one agenda. So, young and olds will get behind it, though it was set to be GenZ revolution.   Also, it was very noble of nepalese army who had whole country in their palm, still didnt do any coup for power grab. This is very dangerous situation to be in. You dont wanna be in that situation.|||[ Removed by Reddit ]|||Please have a designated leader. Things will go to shit otherwise.|||The purity of Nepalese protests is that they didn’t have a single leader or figure who could manipulate or guide them—but that also became a boon. In Nepal, many groups with different political agendas infiltrated the movement. Youths are full of energy, often aggressive, so it becomes important to gather people in smaller groups, form a clear idea, and even assign group coordinators to channel the movement in a peaceful—not harmful way. These were our strengths and successes.  Now, let’s talk about the **failures, or our learning from aftermath of protest**:  1. **Lack of Political & Legal Awareness** Most youths had little knowledge of how law and politics work. A better approach would have been to involve seniors or mentors in discussions, and spread awareness through social media and educational circles. 2. **Losing the Narrative** Traditional media often framed the protests as violent, blaming youths for looting or burning when things went south. The counter-narrative should have emphasized that the government’s primary duty is protecting citizens’ lives and property. Responsibility for escalation lies on both sides—but more on the government. 3. **No Long-Term Structure or Sustainability** The protests lacked continuity beyond the streets. Once the immediate momentum died down, there was no organized follow-up in the form of civic groups, policy advocacy, or institutional lobbying. Without this, the energy of the movement dissolved quickly, leaving little long-term impact.  At the end of the day, what happens **after the protest** matters more than anything. Anarchists may tell you to “kill the leaders,” but trust me no revolution built on that idea has ever succeeded. Real victory comes when you channel the movement into lasting change.  That means making a **clear list of demands (1, 2, 3, 4 …)** and pushing to embed those changes inside the **constitution and legal framework**. Only then will the fight truly be won.  But in our case, even though we toppled the government, at the end of the day we lost more than we gained **the precious lives of 75 people, historic monuments, and even the trust of private sectors.**|||If you are expecting things to escalate:  Don't use hands to fight guns, at least use slingshots. Wear jackets, helmets. Take plenty of water and first aid kits with you.   Make sure your demands are properly stated, written and tegulated to public. Use proper means of communication on the ground and on air.|||Find the right leader, otherwise the protest will be hijacked.

Because at this point, people are not supporting capable leaders like Balen; instead, they’re busy spreading hate and propaganda against him. And the sad part? The public is actually believing it—without any research, without any critical thinking.  It’s the same attitude everywhere. People complain about modern initiatives like *Shark Tank Nepal* just because the show uses English. But it’s literally a business show, and business everywhere uses English. Why is this even a problem? English is an international language—if you can’t accept that, how do you expect to compete in the global economy?

The Core Issue:  According to investigations by the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) and the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB), the core allegations are:  · Funds totaling at least NPR 1.42 Arba (142 Crore) were funneled from several cooperative societies (including Suryadarshan, Gorkha Media, and others) to Gorkha Media Pvt. Ltd., the company that operated the television channel where Rabi Lamichhane was a key figure.  · Rabi Lamichhane was a promoter, shareholder, and the Managing Director (MD) of Gorkha Media for a significant period when these transactions occurred. · Many of these cooperatives are now in financial crisis, leaving numerous depositors struggling to recover their savings.   Rabi ko Defense:  1. The \"I Wasn't Active in Management\" Defense: Rabi Lamichhane's defense centers on the claim that he was not actively involved in the day-to-day management of Gorkha Media and was unaware of the financial transactions.     · Fact-Check: While he may not have been involved in daily operations, he was the legally appointed Managing Director. Under Nepali company law, the MD holds significant responsibility for the company's financial and operational activities. The question remains: how could the MD be unaware of loans worth over NPR 1 Arba entering the company's accounts?  2. The \"Personal Loan\" Admission:     · Fact-Check: Rabi has admitted to taking a personal loan of NPR 1.8 Crore from Suryadarshan Cooperative while he was both its member and a shareholder of Gorkha Media.     · The Legality: This is a key point of illegality. Nepal Rastra Bank regulations strictly prohibit cooperatives from disbursing such large loans to their own board members or directors. This rule is in place to prevent conflicts of interest and protect depositors' funds. By his own admission, this rule was violated.  3. The Deflection to \"Political Witch Hunt\": While the timing and nature of politics in Nepal can be suspicious, this defense does not address the specific financial and legal irregularities documented by the regulatory body (NRB) and the police (CIB). The evidence needs to be addressed on its own merits.  The Human Cost  This is the most critical part. This isn't just a political debate. The misuse of cooperative funds has a direct human impact. Ordinary depositors, who trusted these institutions with their life savings, have been unable to withdraw their money. This is a serious socio-economic issue that should be the primary focus.  The desire for political change is understandable. However, holding new leaders to the same standard of accountability we demand from the old guard is essential for real progress.  Ask yourself:   · Does the \"Oli/Deuba are against him\" defense actually answer the concrete questions?  · Does it explain the legal responsibility of a Managing Director? · Does it justify taking a prohibited loan as a board member of a cooperative? · Does it address the plight of the depositors who lost their savings?   We should demand accountability based on facts and the law, not based on which political camp we dislike more. Let's move beyond tribal politics and make our judgments based on the evidence presented.",

Theres a famous case called Enron scandal, where two subsequent CEOs basically gave same excuse as Rabi, saying they were unaware about the fradulent schemes and blamed on CFO, auditors. Both of the CEOs were convicted, one jailed for 24 years and the other died.|||https://preview.redd.it/nubhl113mirf1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d29795e31483315aaaa6b784782276a9b85366e  This is applicable for Rabis cult group|||Thank you putting this out.

But, didn’t he replaced the old MD and money was already invested in galaxy television before he came? For second point: he is at fault, but didn’t he returned back the money? He may get some punishment for it. But, it’s not embezzlement.  The thing that i am not clear is why Rabi has not criticised GB Rai at all. May be he is involved, who knows.|||If he can't manage a company, how can he be a leader of a country. He is a opportunist who will do whatever it takes to benefit him.|||[removed]|||Gagan Thapa come from real id|||As a company MD he should have been aware of the financial misconducts in his company. To his defence he has been saying that he wasnt aware of the financial sources. Now the question we should ask is did he take advantage of the illicit funds ? Did he diverted funds to his personal benefits/ personal bank accounts or to the accounts of his relatives and friends? If thats the case then he should be help accountable for that.  Anyone can file case against anyone, but how they have been treating Ravi as a special fraud case and putting him in jail while people doing far bigger frauds were let out in one single day proves that Ravi was jailed not only because of the crimes he has been accused but because of the political envy.   These 3 parties have enough power and resources to damage anyone who they see as a risk. They can produce any amount of evidences against their competitor but despite of that they havent been able to find a concrete evidence of Ravi diverting the funds. Initially they tried to ruin his reputation by bringing his personal life - America ma wife and chori haru lai chodeko etc, but he won the election. Then nagrita kanda, he got out of that as well and now this sahakari. I am pretty sure if he comes out innocent on this one, they will soon find another case against him.  You see these days Balen is seen as a promising candidate for next election and how many posts, comments etc have been coming up recently against him? They are trying to ruin Balen’s reputation and if that doesnt work soon you will see in news that Balen is in jail for some crime.  This is the fate of this country.|||This is some bullshit ass post for influence operation. Kun party ko jhole ho bro? I get what Rabi Lamichhane did is wrong during recent protest but to label somebody guilty with above mentioned half-baked information is plain wrong.  Parliamentary investigation report led by Surya Thapa has clearly said they have not found Rabi involved in any Sahakari lootne dhanda. I get it, he is being prosecuted for using Money that came from the Sahakari but he is personally not involved in how his partner brings money from where. I can't say you are guilty because the salary you have been receiving for your service might be some illegally earned black money from the boss. If there are other misconducts, then absolutely he must be punished on the full extent of the law.|||This is completely wrong, fact is distorted|||OK tell me what about the main coordinator gitendra? Why don't you talk about him? It seems like gitendra is doing some shady business putting Rabi in frame, gitendra is from congress he might played some conspiracy handing documents. By now, gitendra might clear his evidence. We need to soon catch him from interpol and bring him in custody. Everything will be clear afterwards. You don't have strong evidence that Rabi did all this work, gitendra could also do it. It's like 50% probability. So let's not put blame on Rabi yet. Why don't you talk anything about Gitendra? Is this because you are also from congress trying to protect him? If Gitendra has done nothing wrong, why would he has to hide in Malaysia? We need to think from this angle too.|||Rabi lai sajay chain Kati months/years ko diyeko ho?|||Do you have sources to backup your claims? If so, please provide.|||Aru Kei vandina ma .. according to the parliamentary special investigation committee’s report, GB Rai was involved in multiple cooperatives at the same time. He held key roles (chairman, etc.) across at least seven cooperatives simultaneously. Which is illegal by Nepali Sahakari law 2074 I think . Rabi lamichhane being a huge investigative journalist not to mention Home Minister later on literally said he did not know anything about this or the source of funds coming into the organisation that he himself was Managing Director of . It's ridiculous how easily manipulated Nepali people are .. always searching for a Hero Character to save them and make the country magically alright|||\\> I've been following the Rabi Lamichhane cooperative scandal and the discussions around it     Gagan ko Praman follow gareko ho?",

            "body": "I just saw a post of a guy who faced racism in the UK and I wanted to tell you how I got treated when I was in the UK 👀😳.  👀☹️ The first time I faced racism in the UK was when I was with one of my classmates (she was South Indian Christian). I told everyone that I was a Nepali Hindu and she would be like, “Nepal is a part of India 😂” in front of the whole group. Fortunately for me, 70% of my classmates were either white or European. They scolded her and laughed at her poor geography 😂 and one even said, “Do you not know about your own country?” She would always try to prove why Christians are better than Hindus and asked why I eat cow and stuff 😂. Now one of my British and one French friend started practicing Krishna consciousness 😂. She wouldn’t leave a chance to mock me or humiliate me, but people around me were more into spirituality and yoga and stuff, so they would always hang out with me. She ended up coming to school very rarely due to her work at a restaurant, and I would always avoid her when she did come.  Another incident was with a random drugged-up guy shouting at me (I was in the poor part of London). I couldn’t understand what he was actually saying lol 😂 he could barely speak. But I heard him saying “return back.” I just laughed at his state lol poor guy.  And something I would never forget is once I was going for a date and a bunch of school-aged kids (mostly looked like Indians and Pakistanis) were targeting Asian-looking girls and throwing water at them—and I got hit. Like wtf, I couldn’t even scold them because they were kids 👀. I cried for the first time because the day was really important to me and they ruined all my clothes and makeup. Also, they ran away before I could even open my eyes 😢.  I used to work at a 5-star hotel as a waitress (Hotel Café Royal if you wanna Google it) and one extra rich man would drop coins at my table lol 😂 with eye contact, as if I was gonna pick them up. I just picked them and returned them to the guy 😂 saying, “You just dropped this, sir,” and he complained to my manager. After that day, my manager never gave me any rotas and eventually, I just left the job (got paid £350 a month commission for 6 months with no work lmao). Malai faida vayo thiyo.  In my experience, the racism mostly comes from either the poor part of the UK—the guy who has lost his job, the single fat woman who thinks you are taking all their men 😂, the old lonely Karens who’ve had their share of a shitty life and wants to make your life shit, and the immigrants who hate other immigrants, especially their kids who think they are better than us all lmao. They lack manners and project their frustration out of poverty onto us 👀. The other group is the extremely rich, who treat you like 👀😂 you are a fly. But there are many beautiful people who are in between, and I have met some amazing, amazing people on my journey 🥹 people who really treated me like their family.",

            "body": "Hey r/Nepal, I'm a Grade 12 student dealing with a family crisis and I need urgent advice. My grandpa has severe CKD and an infection.   The government hospital in our district (Rajbiraj) is supposed to provide free dialysis for poor citizens, but they are refusing him due to the infection, and they're also sitting on unused dialysis machines claiming \"no installation space.\"  Because of this, my dad has to take my grandpa on a long, single-session trip to Dharan every week.  My dad is a security guard with a strict 12-hour shift, 7 days a week, because there are only two guards at the bank. He is exhausted, sick, and running himself into the ground.  I feel helpless watching him struggle against the company's rules and the hospital's cruelty. I have two urgent questions:  1. Work Shift: Is the 12-Hour Shift Legal? Is the security company legally required to pay my dad overtime (1.5x basic wage) for the 4 hours worked beyond the standard 8? How do we check his payslip and enforce this  Idk if 12 hour shift he is doing is considered stander or overtime. But I know before the few years it was 3 guard in bank with 8 hour of shift. 2 in day and 1 in night.  Is it legal to make him work for 12 hour.    Can he legally request a reduced shift or a third guard, citing a critical family health emergency that's affecting his ability to work safely?  2. Hospital Denial:  What are our Rights?   The hospital is denying a free, life-saving service to a Bippana citizen. Where in the Nepali government (Health Ministry, Human Rights, Provincial Directorate) can I file a formal complaint?  How can we use public pressure (like local media) to shame the hospital into installing the unused dialysis machines they are hoarding due to an absurd \"no space\" excuse?  Please, any practical advice or contact info for legal/social workers in Nepal would be a lifeline right now. Thank you   I have uses ai for better articulation",

Is the security company legally required to pay my dad overtime (1.5x basic wage) for the 4 hours worked beyond the standard 8? How do we check his payslip and enforce this**  No, it is not legal. Look at [the labor act](https://antislaverylaw.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/The-Labour-Act-2017.pdf). Go to page 18. It says:  >**Working hours:** (1) No employer shall employ labours to work more than eight hours a day and forty-eight hours a week. (2) The labours shall be provided with half an hour rest after five hours of continuous work. (3) In the cases of work which is not to be stopped and is to be carried out continuously, labours shall be provided with such a rest time turn by turn.  >**Not to compel to work overtime:** (1) No employer shall compel a labour to work more than the hours set forth in sub-section (1) of Section 28.  >**Additional remuneration to be paid:** (1) While employing any labour to work overtime pursuant to Section 30, the employer shall pay to the labour remuneration at a rate of 1.5 times of the basic remuneration receivable during regular hours of work.  In simple words, your father should only be made to work 8 hours a day, 48 hours a week. He can't be forced to work more than that. Even in those 8 hours a day shift, he should be given 30 hours a rest after every 5 hours of continuous work. And overtime is completely voluntary. That overtime should be paid at 1.5 times the normal rate.  **2. Hospital Denial: What are our Rights?**  **The hospital is denying a free, life-saving service to a Bippana citizen. Where in the Nepali government (Health Ministry, Human Rights, Provincial Directorate) can I file a formal complaint?**  Hami Nepal might be able to help you. I have seen them protest against BPKIHS and Bir Hopsital for similar issues.  [Here](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/179ztit2RC/) is Hami Nepal asking Bir Hospital administration that they use all the instruments available, among many other things. Their reach has grown after the GenZ protest, especially due to Sudan's involvement with the negotiations.

            "body": "1) People like Balen have no ability to form a party and mobilise intellectuals and other people at different levels. It is vastly more difficult than running for mayor as an independent.   2) Without a party with strong roots, you cannot meaningfully win seats in the parliament. No matter how proficiently their \"Expose jholey\" trend is run.   3) It would be much easier to win if the PM were directly elected like a mayor. That is because you do not even speak a word to win an election, and you do not depend on other people. Short-term social media trends can sway the votes towards any direction. So, whoever has the ability to manipulate social media trends, they are likely to dictate who will become the winner (honourable mention RoNB)     In a country with a sub-human average IQ, this would be fatal. You cannot guarantee who becomes your next PM. At one time, it could have been Mukunde just for a joke or Dhurmushe for campaigning for stadium funding.  There is a greater geopolitical risk, though.  With just a drop of money from foreign influencers, you can totally manipulate people with social engineering to prop up puppet candidates that, when they come to power, basically sell the country.

Removing political enrollment in public sector and judiciary 2. Independent and more powerful CIAA rules free from politics. ( removing stuff like time limit to report corruption or inability to check the cabinet decisions. )  Just these 2 changes can bring big improvements to our system.

But this completely hinges on expecting the people to not have the intellectual capacity of choosing a leader that they think is ideal rather than expecting the parties to find the ideal candidate after they win the vote. This also omits the more nuanced point that not only the PM is selected by the people but whoever wants to run doesn't have to follow party mantra and speak their mind directly to the people. Many countries do this, and the other major point is not every voter is on social media, so just being trendy in social media with no on the ground door knocking and convincing older citizens will not lead to a straight victory. You seem to speculating and sensationalizing the foreign influence part without considering how there is always going to be a foreign influence not matter if it's a party or an individual. If the candidate speaks directly to the people, with the things that'll actually make their lives better like higher wage, affordability, job opportunities, better transportation, and so on, I see no reason to not wanting to select the PM directly|||Yeah the r/pant guy he too appeared in my feed and I too had thought the same who tf is pushing for this!!|||Directly elected PM will force political parties to give thought about competent candidate that will be face of the elections.   If you've very unpopular leader in public eye but has control over the major positions in the party, Deuba Oli and Prachanda character will always be there. They'll try to cash the votes that are casted to Nepali Congress, UML or Maoists which necessarily doesn't imply the vote for Deuba/Oli/Prachanda.  Directly elected PM would strengthen the internal party democracy as the candidate is supposed to face national election. Currently, whoever is the leader of the specific party in the Parliament have say on who will be Next Candidate for the executive head of state.   We have seen plenty of scenarios where the opposition within the party come strong in their internal elections but the house is controlled by different fractions thus causing frictions leading upto the elections. Even in case of election, the last leader is least likely to be removed causing stagnation.   But if there is provision of  directly elected executive, the internal voices within the party would be forced to be heard. Only the competent candidates will be viable in the next election.  There will always be fluke like Balen, Zelensky factor showing threats of worst case scenarios. These what if scenarios wouldn't hold because if and when youths decide to come to streets to protest the government, these Balen or Zelensky or Oli factor, which was either elected by Parliament or directly by people, wouldn't matter. Everyone would face the same wrath. We just noticed that just few days ago.|||This will solve one of the biggest problems, which is instability. The government can do their work for the full term without any interference. The people who are saying it will be easy for India (or any other country...) to control the directly elected PM cause they only need to install 1 puppet. Guess what, in today's system, they don't need to control 138 for the government; only controlling the head of major political parties will be enough, i.e. 3 or 4 people. only 3 or 4 people control the majority of the elected MPs of their parties. Lets say they make a puppet as a PM, he will not have unlimited powers, the important decision should also need the majority of the MPs' approval. I am not saying it is the only solution, but we can't do anything if we fear everything.|||Weird thought but don’t be flabbergasted sathi haru. You ever wonder what's cooking in Balen’s mind?

            "body": "Sumana Shrestha quitting the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) is a good example of how **someone’s influence can depend on the organization they are in**.  When she was in RSP, even though the party had problems and got criticized a lot, she had a special position:  * **Insider status:** People saw her as someone with connections and influence inside the party. * **Symbolic value:** She looked like a voice of honesty and reform in a party often under the spotlight. * **Public attention:** Her posts, videos, or opinions often got noticed because people thought they reflected the party’s views.  Even people who didn’t like RSP or were confused about it still paid attention to her, mostly because she was part of the party.  But after leaving RSP, things changed:  * **Lost organizational power:** She can’t influence party decisions anymore. * **Less interesting story:** She’s no longer the “good person in a bad party,” so people pay less attention. * **Fading attention:** Her posts don’t get covered by media unless she criticizes someone like Rabi. * **Audience shift:** Casual followers who were never really RSP supporters still notice her sometimes, but they’re not the core supporters who will consistently engage.  This shows what I call a **“Contextual Halo”**—her influence was bigger because of her role in RSP. Once that context is gone, the halo fades.  Compare this to **Gagan Thapa**, who stays in Nepali Congress. Being in the party gives him **access, networks, and visibility**, which he uses actively. Unlike Sumana, he keeps the **“insider glow”** and his influence doesn’t drop because it comes more from him personally, not just the party.",

            "comments": "One of the biggest reasons I despise Gagan Thapa is this very thing, we all had huge hopes and belief in him. Yet when it came to his party's wrongdoings, he barely acted. Instead, he turned a blind eye, offering only the occasional \"aba yesto nagaram hai sathi ho.\" He was supposed to take the Home Minister post, but instead aimed straight for PM. Had he accepted the Home Ministry, perhaps 75 lives could have been saved.  If you continuously turn a blind eye to evil, you become part of it. The same applies to Sumana, if she keeps supporting or ignoring wrongdoings, what difference does it make? It may hurt her immediate political career, but that's the cost of following her heart. The timing, of course, could not have been worse. And she made things harder for herself by being harshly honest in the media. For a politician, honesty sometimes needs to be softened and packaged with \"mirch masalaa\" so the layperson can digest it. Personally, I feel she could have at least expressed gratitude for giving her the platform.|||She just left the party; there hasn’t been anything significant she has said or done recently. Even when she was in the party, she wasn’t known for making a routine splash- she would come every now and then. You are over analyzing this.|||I believe she is a great leader. She leaving RSP was good in my opinion. But seeing people hating on her and commenting her with absarwadi and opportunist after leaving the party makes me wonder if we're really gonna see a change and development in the nation after election. Nepali people still dont understand the meaning of democracy, good governance and the role of citizens in maintaining the democracy. Until and unless people understand it and stop worshipping party and leaders i dont think we're really gonna change the fate and progress as country|||Maybe she doesn't want these things. She just wanted one genuine platform to serve the country.|||Nepal ko sabaivanda thulo problem vanekai looking for a saviour .. j kurama pani euta Bhagwan jastai Patra aunuparo jasle sabai problems thik gardiyos sabai lai thik lagaos afule chai Kei garnu naparos .. 10 years ago it was Oli , ahile Lamichhane xa paxi Balen hunxa ya someone else.. iniharule j sukai galti garepani jail bata vayepani they'll absolutely curse out anyone who questions or criticises them .. eti vayepaxi tei manxe ma god complex develop hunxa and we have the next Oli.

I hope it doesn't happen but, I believe she is going to fade away like Baburam Bhattrai.|||Same with Bhim Rawal|||Tf is this post??|||Gagan Thapa has a way forward to change the leadership in nepali congress specially now, but i don't think Sumana had that, internally nepali congress is a dictatorship with Sher Bahadur controlling more than 80% of the central committee, but in many ways RSP has it worse, its more of a rabi's personality cult than a party. The whole appeal of the party is Rabi, nepali congress is an organization, if tommorow they call a special convention and elect gagan or biswoprakash as the new leader the rest of the organization will follow suit. I doubt that will be the case for RSP unless rabi stays as the de facto leader and with his permission they elect someone like DP aryal as the chairman. So I think Sumana took a well-thoughtout decision specially after idiot like Hari Dhakal calling her out saying \"bagh ko chala ma syal ko rajai\". RSP for the forseeable future will be \"Rabi ko chala\" and every voice of reform/dissent will be called \"syal ko rajai\". Whether rabi is guilty or not is a whole another question but public perception matters and as I see it RSP will be defending him for years to come, his passports, his involvement in the sahakari scam, his \"prison break\". Rabi is the greatest asset and greatest liability of RSP in a single package.",

            "body": "We all know most ISP here lock the router and dont give any access to the web management. As a devops practitioner and someone who is very invested in homelabbing and selfhosting, locked router was my biggest achilles heels.   Requirement: A secondary router, you main router will stop working and secondary router will only work through LAN1 port.   Solution: All you have to do is create a ticket on vianet app stating \"Turn the router into bridge/modem only mode\". Someone will call you back, just ask them username and password for PPPOE and use your secondary router to configure through PPPOE instead of DHCP. Tada!!! you now have full control over your router.   Bonus 1: You can flash openwrt with Luci web interface and you will be able to configure anything you can think of. extra advantage is you can configure mesh routing without needing a special router. I have managed to easily flash it on my Mi router and a old tp link router, search for guides depending on your model or ask Claude or Gpt to search specifically for your router model.   Bonus 2: Vianet gives you globally accessible IPV6. That means you are free from CGNAT. Use this to access your home services without needing any relay like Cloudflare Tunnel or Tailscale VPN. Direct connection means no extra latency and maxed bandwidth and you can use this to host online game servers to play with your friends!! But for some reason Worldlink doesnt connect sometimes. Ncell and ClassicTech seems to have no problem tho. I am not sure if NTC offers IPV6.  Bonus 3: Host a adguard DNS server and configure your openwrt to use it as your default DNS server. This way you will have adblocking for your whole network. Your parents and old grannies wont have to see ads no more (wont work with Youtube app - use revance) and it keeps them safe from online phishing and malwares. You can also set some static ip and adguard to block some websites like gambling and pornography if there are minors in your household.   Disadvantage: The only downside of this is your main router will turn pretty much useless. Internet wont work through wireless and extra ports. So dont forget the vianet tech support to turn off the DHCP and wireless on the main router. Since my secondary router also has 2 ports only I had to invest some money on extra gigabyte switch.   I know some of you will appreciate this so this is my appreciation and giving back to this community. enjoy and have fun!! Happy Dashain!!!

Every time you run an app, the system checks which permissions have already been granted. The same happens when you open the NIC Asia app. Now, why would NIC Asia need access to your camera? The answer is QR payments. The camera icon you see is most likely a UI feature indicating which hardware or system components (like the camera, location, etc.) are being accessed. iOS has a similar feature, so your phone may show it too.|||Same, just checked (in android)|||Ig that biometric verification is causing that hurdle|||Khichdaina nih bruh|||Proposal chai aba currency digital banaunu khojiraxan..|||Mobile banking applications checks for the permission of the camera on login for biometrics authentication and QR scan function.

Aru bank ko ma dekhayena, nic ma dekhayo|||No worries, I’ve already tested this, nothing is sent to the backend. It has to be tied to the QR feature, because once the app is logged in the whole page is swipe-gesture based. When you swipe left, the camera view for QR is triggered, so it looks like a photo is being taken but it’s not. They likely initialize and tear down the camera process in the background to speed up access.|||SBL does that too|||Samsung OneUI 7.0 ma ni xina hai yo problem, maybe device specific ho ki.|||They keep logs for the fraud detection, yes almost all the banking systems keep the camera logs while logging in to the account.|||aru ma no yasto hunxa camera ko permission on bhayara ho|||Same thing used to happen in kumari and prime bank mobile app, I noticed as I used to turn off camera from the software so any app that needs camera would ask first, but for some reason as soon as I logged in those 2 apps asked to open camera and mic settings, but as of recently it seems to be fixed|||Your account might be hacked!!many of peoples' don't know shit..which is why iphone is too good for protection of ur account..if yu using Android then for sure you are on watch..

It felt impossible for me at first because like everyone says you'd need tons of authority or backlinks to get anywhere on Google, but the thing is, if you really understand what users are looking for and notice what the top pages are missing, you can actually compete. (unless if the targeted keyword is super niche).  The tricky part is figuring that out manually, it would normally take hours if not days, checking every top page, writing content outlines, and spotting what they are missing and acquring backlinks.  That is exactly why I built PikeraAI to speed up the process. it basically takes your keyword as in input and then looks at the keyword, studies the top results, finds the gaps, gives you a content plan, and even lists backlink prospects and opportunities that you could realistically acquire (based on your website DA score).  Basically doing what I used to spend days on in just a few minutes.  Here's a DEMO report on what it actually gives: https://pikeraai.com/demo-report I followed the plan, wrote the content, and within a few 2-3 days my site was in the top five results, no hacks, no magic, just doing the right things in order.

            "body": "I know there are 2 main reasons for current high tax laws while importing combustion vehicles. First:- Overcrowding. Second:- Increase in consumption of Petrol and Diesel. . . 40% reduction could make commuting somewhat more affordable. . I think EV's will sooner or later dominate in the 4-wheeler section which is fine. . But, people will always love the exhaust note of motorcycles. EV's will hardly make it to even 10% on 2-wheelers. . So, they can keep 80% on combustion based 4-wheeler but they should at least drop tax to 40% for all 2 wheelers because even a mid-range cc motorcycles are absurdly expensive to buy in Nepal.",

This will help in the future as well to keep tab on battery degradation. Windows also has the 'Balanced' battery mode as default. If you want longer battery runtimes turn on the power saver mode or use the battery saver battery option.   \\- Cleanliness: keep your laptop free from dust and dirt to make it run better for longer. Since it's new and under warranty you don't want to go around opening the back panel to clean it every few months just yet. But install an app to keep an eye on the temps, that will let you know if the temperature rises then it might be clogged vents and dust on the fans.   \\- Backup: make sure you backup Windows regularly because one bad update can mess your laptop up. System restore is a good option to use as well as Windows backup using a separate pen drive.    \\- Hard drive partition: If your SSD/HDD is all just one drive then you might want to partition it to have one C: drive for Windows and other drives for your personal files so that in case you need to reinstall Windows your data on the second drive is safe   \\- Remove unwanted apps: Windows comes with a fair share of bloatware, you can install each and every one of these that you don't need.   \\- Startup apps: When you install a new app they are more than likely to be enabled to run at startup. You don't always need all of these to run every time your laptop starts. Disable these from within Task Manager.   \\- Security: Windows Defender is good enough for most of the user but if you want extra security look up a reputable antivirus software and install it. Do note that AV will slow down the PC if they are running scans on the background.   \\- Laptop specific control software: This might already be installed on your laptop.

Please answer if you can  I am at bedrest due to accident and have 1 year time until college starts . My medicine bills were huge so i want my parents to make sure i am capable and even tell myself i am capable.  My background:  3 years back i was doing web development and earnings through freelancing but my health started degrading and in last 3 years i was not able to code or even think about it and last month when i was being normal(healthy) again i had a major accident . After operation now i am mentally well but still in a bed rest for 4 months .   What skills should i learn to land a job in about a year ? I am thinking of web developer (next.js + little backend ).  I currently dont remember any basics because it was long back i use to code .  Next year i will probably join 3 year bachelor due to year loss and after that i will apply for abroad .",

Aafno aafno opinion lai fact jasari prove garna nakhojam.   Questioning the tradition is valid and should be done. That’s how we will get more information on the practice and then we can determine whether the tradition is actually jeopardising the child’s mental health or not.   But without any credible information just blatantly labelling it exploitative and child abuse will do more harm than good.|||True, the Kumari tradition is precious but it needs to be modified so culture thrives without harming the child.|||  Wait till the local Newar finds out that someone has spoken a fact here. 😂|||Hi all I am a Newar, and i don’t oppose the tradition.  The child will have access to education and almost everything another child can ask for. We have belief that the child carries spirit of Taleju Bhawani, which gives the child immense power. Again, in an age where we have lost our belief, I cannot prove it.  The kumaris I have visited emit strong aura (i may have been brainwashed to feel this). But she does have to be disciplined (i dont mean someone disciplines her). The child is treated with utmost respect by the best people in a homely environment.   Aba before age of 15 16, Manang Mustang ghumna khasai koi jaadaina hola (only speaking for myself) After she is no longer a Kumari, she can go whereever she wants to.   Anyways, I am open for a discussion and may be able to pose any questions to the people in the inner circle. I don’t know much myself but do have the connections if we want the facts so we can all stop conspiring.  Jay Desh|||We should support female pope in Vatican gender equality let's goooo!!!|||What about the rights of Nuns... We should talk about this also|||Kumaris: A common doll for everyone.   A 3 year old child has no idea what she is getting into. She cannot grasp what a normal childhood is, what is right and what is wrong. The only thing she knows and does is based on her likes and dislikes, which is heavily depended upon how her parents/surrounding elders dictates.   Ani about 'No complains' from past Kumaris:   Newari culture is super sensitive. You cannot say anything against their culture. Otherwise, you'll have to face \"Tom n Jerry\" like people. I think, every ex Kumaris understands this at some point. With this much pressure along with the grooming done from a very young age, I don't think anyone dares to speak up. Which basically means none of us know what they really feel inside.    Well, of course, keeping in mind how they're thrown away once they reach a certain age or goes through 🩸. At least, a life time opportunity to be a Kumari where they could renounce their position if they don't feel like it should be a way.   They don't preach, they don't teach, they only show up during jatras. I've never seen Kumaris actively participating in rituals or any sort of activities. Yestai ho vane, why not create a statue of a Kumari for the rest of our lives and stay quiet???|||Also it adds to the stereotype that period blood is impure|||Yeah the 1sttime ever I saw Kumari it was not aww like I hoped but pity to the \"Living Goddess\" she had the look of not a girl her age but of an \"ice princess\" in anime. Like I have never seen such a sad expression ever probably cause she cant smile or cry.||| The Living Goddess tradition of Nepal is a complex institution rooted in centuries of culture. While modern concerns about child rights are valid, the practice is governed by strict rituals and has evolved to address contemporary welfare standards. Here are the key facts:  1. The Selection is Meticulous and Considered an Honor:  · A Kumari is chosen from the specific Shakya clan of the Newari community, a Buddhist goldsmith caste. · The selection process is incredibly rigorous. Candidates must meet 32 strict physical perfection requirements (e.g., eye shape, voice quality, hair color) and demonstrate a fearless and serene demeanor (e.g., by not crying during a ceremony in a room of 108 ritually sacrificed animal heads). · For the family and community, her selection is not a punishment but the highest spiritual honor.  2. The Role is Central to National Culture and Unity:  · The Kumari is not just a religious figure but a national symbol. · Her most important public duty is during the Indra Jatra festival, where she blesses the President of Nepal, providing divine legitimacy to the state in a ceremony that blends Hindu and Buddhist traditions. This is a key event for national identity.  3. Significant Reforms and Safeguards Have Been Implemented:  · Education: By law, the Kumari now receives a formal education from private tutors within her residence. The government provides a monthly stipend specifically for this purpose. · Family Presence: Contrary to isolation claims, her family (typically her mother) lives with her throughout her tenure. · Financial Security: Upon retiring at puberty, the state grants her a lifetime pension. As of recent years, this is approximately NPR 10,000 per month (roughly $75 USD), along with a lump sum of NPR 1 million (roughly $7,500 USD) to support her transition. · Successful Reintegration: Former Kumaris like Dr. Chanira Bajracharya, who served until 14, have publicly spoken about their positive experiences, pursued higher education, and built successful careers, demonstrating that life after the role is viable.  The Kumari tradition is a deeply embedded socio-religious institution. It is factually inaccurate to frame it simply as the \"isolation\" of a child. It is a state-sanctioned, culturally sacred role with defined rituals, significant community support, and legally mandated provisions for the girl's education, family life, and long-term financial security. The debate around it highlights the global tension between cultural preservation and evolving child rights, but the practice itself has demonstrably adapted to modern norms.|||I ain't newar but also I think aaba yesto kura chai parents haru le vhaneko ramro hami third party le vhannu vhanda pani . look if kumari ko parents le chahanu hudaina vhani tyo kumari ko candidate mai na leraunu parni ho . so parents lai kehi problem xaina , kumari le as a normal human being ni basna paunu hunxa after completion so I think we are no one to question sodhna lai|||What about the tradition of marrying off daughters into the inlaws house?|||After giving this some thought question is of a philosophical one. What freedom does a child have?  What life does a child choose? Isn’t everyone forced and fed their parent’s beliefs?   Also, can you give some evidence of abuse? If not your post would be baseless and in attempt of defamation of our culture.  One Kumari’s time ended when she was just 12. How much do you remember of your life before you were 12? I asked myself the same question and the answer is not much.   I disagree with your claim that the Kumari’s are discarded. They are always welcome. What it shows is the core principle of Buddhism that nothing is permanent. All things, even being revered as the living goddess, comes to an end. It teaches humility, an art that is now lost in this modern time.

The only thing you should feel bad about is her parents who now have to be her full time care takers probably having to leave their jobs and careers and move into the kumari house with her.|||I used to extremely religious before and used to glorify ts But realising Kumari tradition is cruel was my first step towards atheism|||What about treating the child with utmost respect and care is child abuse? You’ve engrained yourself with too much western influence and think that the culture needs to be reformed. Kumaris have friends, education, and the choice is with them and their families. Where do you think that is abusive? You are living in a bubble. It is a different culture and a tradition it doesnt mean that it is abusive. Kumaris have had a long history, have you ever heard one of them come out and say that it was traumatic? Stop your virtue signaling.|||I would like to hear it from past Kumaris, if they dont have a problem, who are we to stop this 1000 yr old practice|||As always kumari tradition is called as a child abusive and inhuman act again. Khaire ko documentary haru herera brainrot kura nagara na. Not everyone is privileged to become kumari and nor they are selected randomly. The family members themself have to fill the form and there's a long running selection process. Only a certain clan of newar can become Kumari. There are lots of inhuman and child abusive traditions going on all over. In case of kumari they get highest level of love and respect. They can live with their parents, they can play, they can watch TV, they can even play video games. It would be better if you watch podcasts of ex kumaris it's really helpful. I used to think same like everyone calling this inhuman before but they are living the normal life as you and me. And the fact that you can't speak up being kumari is totally false, yes you can't but only in jatras and other religious ceremonies, do you speak up during sharad and other pujas(it's prohibited to talk during sharad if you don't know). Go visit sudurpaschim hundreds of girls are being raped during their chhaupadi bas. Go visit terai Muslim villages girls at the age of 15 are getting married and at the age of 21 they are booned with 3 childs. Ex Kumaris themself enjoy being kumari and love to live their that phase again. If they are fine, their parents are fine no need to talk about that. Now the rules and prohibitions are amended. So please watch podcasts of ex kumaris. Btw I'm not Newar. I'm not from valley either. Not even written by me take from other post 🙏🙏|||The concern is ekdamai valid.

But let’s be real: he’s the only king after Prithvi Narayan Shah who actually did something that mattered for the survival of Nepal.    Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus — with nine governments in ten years. That wasn’t democracy, it was chaos. Leaders were busy stabbing each other in the back while the nation stayed dirt poor, uneducated, and vulnerable. Tell me, what “stable democracy” exists when governments collapse every year? None. Mahendra saw this and did what no one else had the guts to do: he hit reset.    Yes, he dissolved parliament. Yes, he banned parties. And you know what? He was right to. Without stability, Nepal was on track to become India’s backyard project or another pawn in the Cold War. Mahendra’s Panchayat system gave the country one thing it desperately lacked: stability.    And let’s talk achievements:    He balanced India and China like a chess master. Without him, we’d have been swallowed by one side decades ago.    He pushed Nepal onto the global stage — Non-Aligned Movement, a stronger UN presence, and an independent foreign policy.    He jump-started modernisation: roads, schools, universities, tourism. These are things no king before him, and very few leaders after him, have been able to deliver at that scale.    But historians? They love to cry about “democracy dying in 1960.” These same historians never admit that the so-called “democrats” of the 50s were busy running the country into the ground. It’s easy to glorify B.P. Koirala in hindsight, but Mahendra was the one cleaning up the mess in real time.    Here’s the hard truth: Mahendra was the only king who actually acted like a king — a protector of sovereignty. Everyone after him either coasted on his legacy or failed miserably. Without him, Nepal might not even exist as the independent state it is today.    Call him authoritarian all you want, but facts don’t lie. After Prithvi Narayan Shah, King Mahendra was the only true king Nepal ever had.",

He saved Nepal from being a puppet of foreign countries. He was a gem.|||Mahendra is a complicated figure. On one hand, he did keep Nepal intact at a time when regional instability and internal divisions could have easily spiraled out of control.  On the other, his coup dismantled the first democratic experiment and concentrated power in the monarchy, which created long-term issues that Nepal is still untangling today.   It’s less that historians hate admitting he saved Nepal, and more that they frame it as a tradeoff between short-term stability and long-term democratic development.|||Its not an unpopular opinion though. Those who know history know how Progressive Mahendra was. One thing though, his rapid advancements did over heat a fledgling Nepalese economy which is why we needed to privatize our industries. But the privatization was a joke,   they privatized it too quickly and privatization advocates in Nepal did admit they made a huge mistake later on.|||Popular opinion. It's because of Prithvi Narayan Shah and King Mahendra that modern day Nepal even exists as a separate country in its current form. Otherwise there would not have even been an independent country known as Nepal.|||His authoritarian enforcement of the Nepali language and Hindu traditions on a diverse population that wanted nothing to do with them was one of the causes of the civil war that would follow.  He killed democracy in its crib and pulled us back into medieval institutions. Even if I were to hypothetically accept that he was a good ruler for the sake of argument, there is no guarantee and his heirs and his heirs’ heirs would have been good rulers, which is why absolute monarchy fails. Any good that he might have done during his reign is negated by the fact that long term institutions are more important than charismatic rulers, and he ruined the institution of democracy. All the instability that we have faced since 2008- would have happened in the 1950s and we could have been a prosperous democracy by the present. This guy pulled us decades back.  It’s easy to look back at the past with rose tinted glasses and romanticize it, that is the first step on the road to fascism, but the truth of life, prosperity and happiness is in the future and progressive institutions.|||Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus, with nine governments in ten years. That wasn’t democracy, it was chaos.  LOL. The King chose PM. He was the one responsible.|||Yes man agreed. He is the guy who defined Nepal and Nepali people. He did a lot of great works for the country. But many people and our school books consider him as a dictator telling about how he banned political parties and not mention about the reforms and development made by him for the country. One of the greatest leader of our country King Mahendra!!|||The problem with Monarchy in Nepal and everywhere else is that there are few good apples in 1 crore ropani orchard.  Except PN Shah, Mahendra and maybe Birendra (many sources call him spineless but I don't know), no one else were fit to rule. The country fell into Ranas dictatorship  because of Monrachy system failure.  So here we are, dealing with generational political trauma.|||Ali history paddam, 1959 ma first election vako ho tyo vanda aagadi sab PM king le choose garya ho, 1st election ko 1.5 years ma coup vako ho.|||A quick ChatGPT will give you some real perspective:  Most historians and political analysts agree that King Mahendra’s reasons were more of a pretext to consolidate royal power rather than genuine democratic concerns. Here’s why:  1. Political instability was exaggerated  Nepal’s first elected government (1959–1960) under B. P. Koirala had been in office for only 18 months.  While there were some administrative problems, it wasn’t long enough to judge the parliamentary system a failure.  Corruption and inefficiency existed, but not at the level Mahendra claimed.   2. Fear of losing monarchical dominance  The 1959 elections gave the Nepali Congress a clear majority.  Koirala’s government was popular and gaining legitimacy, which posed a direct threat to the king’s absolute authority.  Mahendra feared the monarchy would become a ceremonial institution like in India or Britain.   3. Foreign policy pretext  Koirala pursued a relatively independent foreign policy, maintaining balance between India and China.  Mahendra accused him of endangering Nepal’s sovereignty, but in reality, the king wanted direct control over diplomacy, which was vital for aid and recognition.   4. Use of \"underdeveloped society\" argument  Mahendra claimed that Nepalese people weren’t “ready” for democracy due to illiteracy and lack of experience.  This was partly true, but instead of strengthening democratic institutions, he abolished parties and built a system where only the king’s will mattered.   5. The Panchayat system benefited him most  Under Panchayat, all political power flowed through the king.  It created the image of \"guided democracy,\" but in practice, it was royal autocracy with no accountability.   📌 Conclusion: Mahendra used the excuses of instability, corruption, and national unity to justify a royal coup. The deeper reason was to preserve absolute monarchy and prevent Nepal from transitioning into a genuine parliamentary democracy.|||But his policies are disastrous for Nepal till this day  He opened Nepal's border with India, opened free trade with India, allowed India to build its Army base in Lipulekh Limpiyadhura Kalapani since then these territories are occupied by India  He also forced Khas culture on Newaris and Janjatis which influenced them to become Communists|||Agreed!|||We wouldn't have been swallowed by any side. Non-alignment was the default policy from the beggining, and B.P koirala would have continued that policy. Nepal would have 'modernized' without an iron-fisted dictatorship.|||Matrika literally wanted to suck cock of india..   He was puppet of India...while BP was good...Matrika and BP's power struggle caused mahendra to step in...and take all the powers..   Thats my unpopular opinion too.|||I agree with most of your points. But your point about 10 governments in nine years doesn't show the instability created by parties but by the monarchs. The monarchs were the ones that were making them unstable. The one time it seemed to be stable, he couped the government. That doesn't diminish the fact thought, that his rule saw probably the most balanced foreign policy of Nepal, where Nepal truly stood out as a sovereign nature. I still believe that had Mahendra controlled a bit of his authoritarian ways and worked together with B.P. Koirala, Nepal would have been in a much better position that it is currently. Both of them are the best leaders Nepal had post P.N. Shah. It might be an unpopular opinion but I think P.N. Shah might be more important historically, but these two are probably the best leaders Nepal got, even better than P.N. Shah.|||sovereignty? of who? Mahendra model of nation-building was \"one religion, one custom, one language.\" Hindu orthodoxy was enforced as state ideology, treating non-Hindu communities as second-class. Nepali was imposed as the only legitimate language, sidelining rich traditions like Maithili, Newar, Tharu, Tamang, Limbu, etc. This wasn't genuine unity - it was control through forced uniformity. What looked like stability was in fact suppression. That brittle foundation is why today's Nepal wrestles with federalism, ethnic assertion, and identity politics: democracy didn't invent division, it revealed what had long been silenced.  The Koiralas, born and educated in Banaras, were accused of being \"too Indian.\" But Nepal had no universities, no political freedom, no space for intellectual growth - precisely because the tyrants had closed those doors. Should they be condemned for seeking ideas in India, or credited for importing the democratic imagination Nepal lacked?  So the paradox is clear:  Mahendra centralized the state but weakened society.|||Will not let anyone discredit the blood of 17k Nepali|||Educated boomers hate him(my boomer dad lol).|||Nepal was too small for the OG Mahendra.

And second more important question, if stability was the most important thing for us, why did he take over from a parliament that had a 2/3 majority and the government was led by THE BP Koirala? There was a little chance that the Koirala govt would have toppled and was doing good work..  Yes, there were some long term projects under him that were very good for Nepal. There’s no denying that and kudos to him. But he was authoritarian, there is no denying that either. Let’s not over glorify someone and gloss over facts because they don’t fit our views..|||Only corrupt politicians, their jholes and brainwashed wanna be republicans hate him.

Every other Indian city from Delhi to Bangalore organizes Garba nights during Nauratha, and people participate regardless of their background. They just want to have fun. And honestly, this whole debate reflects how we treat culture in Nepal as well where Bahun Chhetri traditions and Nepali language are promoted as the ‘real’ identity, while 100+ other languages and ethnic cultures are pushed aside.  And culture is never static. Its constantly influenced by a lot of things like art, cinema, migration, globalization, internet, exchange and influence as well. The same people who happily pay to watch Bollywood movies in movie theaters, worship actors like Salman and Shahrukh and just hoot loudly when they come on screen at theaters, and listen to, sing & dance to Hindi songs without thinking twice suddenly get offended if someone enjoys Garba. That selective outrage is nothing but hypocrisy.|||I don’t think it’s a problem at all. You need to be inclusive to all religions and culture.

Don’t get too attached to it.|||Just by criticizing everything doesn't make you intellectual.|||Cultures and traditions naturally spread over time, and this spread is accelerated by influence. Media is the most powerful driver of that influence, and that’s why our local culture feels as though it is being overshadowed. The problem is not that people no longer value their own culture, but that our media presence is extremely weak compared to others.  Think about how Indian culture has spread in Nepal: through movies, songs, TV serials, and now online content. (migration, political connection and cultural proximity are other factors but in this case, the primary driver is media). The same is true for Western cultures, especially American culture, which influences our everyday lives, from what we eat and wear to the way we think. The recent Garba incident may be one example, but it represents a much broader pattern: cultural identity travels and takes root primarily through media.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, since cultures have always spread, adapted, and reshaped themselves over time. (I mean we'll definitely feel good if a foreigner adopts nepali culture). But preserving one’s own culture is equally important, because it forms a core pillar of identity. And preservation in today’s world is only possible through strengthening our own media i.e. by producing movies, songs, and online content that reflect and celebrate our traditions. And they need to be good, not some low effort cash converter sold in the name of patriotism.  And just for context: Garba is not only celebrated in Gujarat, but across India. (showing spread of a culture).|||I dont really see how this would affect op or anyone else for that matter enough to create this discord. And where do you draw the line?

But what I can’t agree with is how he’s being turned into a devil figure through misinformation and propaganda. We’ve all seen examples: edited posts claiming he attacked religious groups, fake videos showing him ordering bikes bulldozed (which turned out to be footage from New York), and even deepfakes made just to smear him. Criticising a leader for actual actions is one thing, but manufacturing hate through lies is another. To me, that shows a fear of what he represents more than any genuine accountability. He might not be perfect, but reducing him to some villainous caricature is just dishonest and unhelpful for the country’s politics.",

Come on, there’s no such thing as perfect. We all have pros and cons, and the same applies to leaders. Honestly, it’s harder to be a “perfect” leader because you’re leading a mass of people with different opinions, ideologies, and expectations. There’s no way you can satisfy everyone. No matter how good you are, there will always be criticism. And constructive criticism should be welcomed.  Talking about Balen, he should be criticized too. No one is above criticism. But whenever someone criticizes him, people immediately throw around the “Oh, so you’re a Jhole” tag. That makes no sense. Right now, he’s been the target of both constructive criticism and unnecessary hate. He’s still new, it’s only been a couple of years. I don’t get why people expect him to “save the nation” like some Nyak movie hero. His main role is being a mayor, so let’s focus on that. If he steps into mainstream politics later, then we can have different expectations from him.|||सफा लुगामा सानो दाग पनि देखिन्छ !|||Nobody is perfect in this world, so let’s be fair with criticism|||Yeah bro he is too famous rn.So, it's natural.Still,His supporters far outnumber the haters.

            "body": "My perspective on the Kumari tradition is entirely based on what former Kumaris think.  If we asked 100 ex-Kumaris about their experiences and whether they felt exploited or saw it as a privilege, I’m confident most would say they didn’t feel abused, contrary to what many internet activists claim.  To better understand the reality, I’ll share links to interviews and articles featuring former Royal Kumaris, published by BBC and ABC.  Yes, isolating a child from her parents, friends, education, or the outside world isn’t right, but those conditions don’t exist in the Kumari house as critics portray.   The tradition has evolved significantly. Kumaris can regularly meet their parents, who often care for them, receive personal tutoring for education, play outside with friends, and enjoy movies like other children.   And after retiring as a Kumari, she will be 100 per cent normal Nepali girl who is free to do anything and she'll get a monthly pension of Rs 16k for the rest of her life. (as per 2019 article)  So, don’t let disconnected keyboard warriors, who are influenced by Western lifestyles and detached from our cultural roots, misrepresent our beautiful tradition as a story of abuse or exploitation. Those are the same type of people who romanticize about foreign practices like child beauty contests or halloween but sh!t on our culture.

The respect and reverence given to the Kumari is not only religious but also a reflection of Nepal’s rich history and traditions. These people just find way to get away from traditions. Even the kings would receive her blessings before important events, military campaigns, or other significant state matters. The divine grace of the Kumari was thought to ensure his prosperity and the kingdom’s peace and stability.|||Yep, I've talked to an exKumari myself and she said she felt honored about being chosen. Shes married and working now. I don't see anything wrong with the tradition as it exists. In the past there were some issues about schooling and prejudice against marrying exKumari but there have been lots of reforms and cultural mindset changes now, led by exKumaris themselves. If you don't believe in Kumari or are an atheist, noone is forcing you to visit her or seek blessing. Kumari culture, since it does not really harm anyone, comes under freedom of religion and is protected by Nepal's constitution as well as international law.|||If the child says she doesn’t want to be a Kumari will they find another girl?|||Susan dai ko podcast ma bhako dami xa|||Some medias are showing joy of tears as something else.|||Anything in the name of culture lol|||If people are so worried about this tradition and argue by saying “Stockholm syndrome” or “indoctrination”, then we better question how each of us grew up in our own household.   Of course, certain restrictions are there but just as a child who goes to a monastery or a person going to church has to follow certain rules, she has to as well. We can question some of these rules, but not without understanding the context and significance behind it.   While people are quick to dismiss cultural practices like this in the name of modernization and woke values, they easily forget that tantric traditions are very much alive and thriving in Nepal. Better not mess with those. If you are a non-believer, move on for your own good I would say.|||Not beautiful, it's an ass culture. Calling some random ass little girl a goddess, and dump her the moment she bleeds 🤣 It's straight up bullshit, nothing is beautiful in this. Mfs worshipping an imprisoned child while they discriminate with their own daughter irl, uh oh.|||>My perspective on the Kumari tradition is entirely based on what former Kumaris think.  Classic case of Stockholm syndrome. If a little girl is institutionalized for almost a decade and brainwashed every single day, it's almost certain that she will develop a positive affinity towards this barbaric practice.  Why do you people need this practice at all? Are your superstitious beliefs and culture more important than the childhood of an innocent little girl? You people are willing to sacrifice her entire childhood just to appease your stupid traditions.  >who are influenced by Western lifestyles and detached from our cultural roots  Criticism ayo ki western influenced vandyo, INGO ko paisa khako vandyo, dollarey vandyo, chamaley vandyo. Kati sajilo chha ni Nepali haru lai.|||It's frustrating how often the beautiful and complex Kumari tradition in Nepal is framed by Western narratives as \"child abuse\" or \"isolation.\" This viewpoint, which frequently emphasizes themes of captivity and trauma, completely ignores the testimonies of former Kumaris and the significant modern safeguards and support systems in place.  The facts, based on local Nepali voices and government policies, paint a very different, much more nuanced picture that overwhelmingly supports the continuation of this vital cultural practice, proving it is not exploitative in nature.    The Reality of the Living Goddess: A Cultural Privilege 🇳🇵  Not Isolated, But Tutored and Connected: The claim of \"isolation from family\" is a common critique. In reality, Kumaris receive personal tutoring, maintain regular parental contact (daily visits), and enjoy activities like playing outside and watching movies. This setup is often compared by defenders to a modern, high-standard boarding school experience, not harmful captivity. \\[2\\]\\[3\\]\\[7\\]  Lifelong Financial and Educational Support: Critics claim the girls are \"abandoned\" after their tenure ends at puberty. This is demonstrably false. Upon retirement, former Kumaris receive a substantial monthly pension and educational scholarships from the government, ensuring their successful reintegration and personal development as regular Nepali citizens. \\[6\\]\\[4\\]\\[5\\]\\[8\\]  The Voices of Former Kumaris: Structured interviews and public testimonials from ex-Kumaris and their families show that the vast majority view the tradition as a privilege and a source of cultural pride, not abuse or trauma. They have actively and publicly refuted Western stereotypes about mental strain or deprivation, emphasizing their positive experiences and agency. \\[9\\]\\[3\\]\\[5\\]  Modern Safeguards and Evolution: The tradition is not static. It has evolved significantly to include increased government oversight, modern educational facilities, and legal provisions for the girls' welfare. This illustrates the community's commitment to protecting the Kumaris and balancing ancient spiritual significance with contemporary child welfare values. \\[5\\]\\[10\\]\\[4\\]  The Kumari tradition is seen by its community as the veneration of feminine power and an integral part of Nepal's spiritual and social cohesion. To dismiss it as \"superstition\" while normalizing practices like sending children to high-end Western boarding schools highlights a clear double standard in criticism. The factual evidence, supported by Nepali citizens and former goddesses, establishes that the Kumari tradition is a source of cultural pride and empowerment, not the exploitation depicted by disconnected critics.|||The thing is people think it’s either right or wrong ; why not keep the perspective open.|||You are forcing a minor to give up the most magical years of her life for something that she has no choice over.

If you don't like it, be silent. Live respectfully separately.

That doesn’t make their perspective wrong, but it also doesn’t mean the practice has no problems.  For example, if you ask people who grew up in strict boarding schools, many will say it made them disciplined and strong, while others will point out the trauma from isolation and harsh rules. Both experiences are valid, but focusing only on the positive voices gives a one-sided picture.  The same goes for the Kumari tradition. Former Kumaris may genuinely feel privileged and respected, but that doesn’t erase the fact that historically there were strict restrictions and isolation from normal childhood experiences. Even if those conditions have improved today, that improvement only came because people did question the system.|||Modernization isn’t westernization.|||This was much needed!

Westerners have practically none relative to us, are clueless about the power of these in keeping people together, and they are incredibly incredibly divided people peddling left vs right garbage- they set a terrible example and are absolutely not a group of people to take advice on this matter. 'The n-word' has been a real issue in their society, that alone tells you their moral policing will never stop.

Alot of people these days know what is happening in US more than what is happening here. It also opens door for diverse viewpoints. You can see their view points and they can see yours  - It was always abuse  It was always abuse, there are many shite culture that are indeed abusive. What you mentioned are all abuse and people are starting to ask questions.  Here is how I think things will go  - Dilutification  People in the future will modify these culture and traditions to be more ethical. And thats not exactly because of western culture or Christians, things like that but because people will be more questioning.  I honestly hope these shite actually get cleaned off our culture so that we dont seem like an uneducated tribe|||Errr the Kumari Teej and Dashain are valid criticisms.  The rest are not really an issue because it isn’t harming others. I don’t know what Shivaratri has to do with weed. Where I celebrate it, it has nothing to do with weed nor abusing said weed|||tradition needs to change with time, or at least how you defend it should change with time. otherwise, it'll always be labeled so.

It’s not child abuse at all, the Kumari is never harmed. She’s treated with a lot of respect and care, almost like royalty, and her wellbeing is always prioritized. It’s more of a cultural and religious practice to honor purity and tradition, not something that exploits the child.    I’m no Newar, but the Kumari is cared for like royalty, not abused.|||Let them, You Be happy - My boy - Everything can't be regulated - I am against it but I don't oppose it - and - suppress my philosophy to them.

But that doesn't mean I have direct ties with them. JHOLEY and BHEDA is a noun that defines people who blindly believe in a person or a political party.      Talking about myself, I am already 36, a father and I am thinking of raising my family here in Nepal. I was totally against going abroad as a student when there was trend to do so. But the political system was never stable here. However, This current GenZ revolution happened against corruption. We indeed got a good progress against these corrupt leaders. But things turned out to be different and here is my roller coaster of emotions. Please let me know if you can relate to this.  Day 0: Social Media Ban - Mixed feelings. Hopeful that social medias will proceed further with registration.  Day 1: GenZ revolution and killing - Lots of anger. Disappointment and discontent.  Day 2: Revolution, excited and happy till 4 PM, until we destroyed the party system. Once the public started destroying Singha Durbar, I came to realize what I had done. I started a fire that I can't extinguish.  Day 3: Realization of the revolution being hijacked. We were just against corruption, regime change was not our motto. The revolution gradually turned into a COLOR REVOLUTION.  Day 4: Worried about who will lead the country. Started mentally supporting Balen/Rabi or any young leader. Furious, since the army asked GenZ to come up with a leader. Finally Hami Nepal, some guys funded by Deep state along with Sanduk Ruit and Swarnim Wagle came into light. They started talking about regime change and Constitution change. They said they directly want to select Zelensky as their prime minister.   Day 5: Much more disappointed as some kids who are aiming to go abroad for future study is electing prime minister through Discord. Sushila Karki elected as PM. Which is some sort of relief. I feared a autocrat.  Day 6 - Day 7: China is yet to acknowledge PM Sushila Karki. China is suspecting foul play as KP Oli had been to SCO and all of this happened just after that.      Now I am very much in distress. I feel that, Nepal is Ukraine. Balen is the new Zelensky and China is the new Russia. I dont want to think negatively but the situation ahead seems to be very dark and we will have to take steps cautiously. There are a lot of hatred here and Social medias are fueling it. None of the GenZ were born during the writing of the constitution. There were lots of revolution that was endured by current revolution Maoist Revolution, Madesh Revolution etc. But now it seems everything has gone to waste and there is no constitution here in the country.

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not “revolution,” it’s not “justice,” and it sure as hell isn’t “the voice of the people.” It’s mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn’t make you brave—it makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that—surrounded by a wave of so-called “youths” who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let’s not sugarcoat it—the so-called Gen Z “warriors” hiding in the mob weren’t heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country’s social fabric. He still can’t step foot in certain countries because he’s internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he’s propped up as a “leader.”  Let’s be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn’t an accident—it was a setup. While Deuba’s family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don’t get it twisted—those sharpshooters in the crowd weren’t just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres—former insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let’s stop pretending this was “the people rising up.” It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist—the one who drowned this nation in blood—walks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don’t for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn’t that Deuba suffered humiliation—the real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn’t a flower; he’s a weed choking the soil of Nepal’s democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too naïve to realize they’re being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||CIA & India Agents involved in chaos!

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4. Retirement age and term limits: This is a must, we need a clear retirement age for the public positions just like other jobs.     These sort of things are fundamental of any country, without getting the fundamentals right we cannot expect our country to do better. We have a chance to make things better, lets take this chance.|||also i think! what lessons can be learned from Bangladesh last year?|||Garni nai ho vani presidency system lyauni.

No consultation, no delay. Constitutional legitimacy + protester acceptance = only viable option.  # 2. PROTESTER LEADERSHIP PIVOT  Gen Z groups must **immediately shift messaging**:  * \"Our revolution is being hijacked\" * \"Military rule = permanent corruption\" * **Name specific civilian demands**: New constitution, elections in 1 year  # 3. ARMY FACE-SAVING EXIT  New interim government must **publicly thank Army Chief Sigdel** for \"preserving democracy\" and **offer ceremonial role** in transition (advisory only, no executive power).  # 4. EMERGENCY UNITY GOVERNMENT  * Sumana Shrestha as PM * Balen Shah as Deputy PM * **3 Gen Z representatives** in cabinet * **Clear 12-month timeline** to new elections  # 5. INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION BLITZ  India, China, UN must **immediately recognize** any civilian arrangement. Every hour of delay gives military justification for intervention.  **THE WINDOW IS 6-8 HOURS MAX**. After that, the army's 10 PM ultimatum becomes permanent control.  **Key insight**: Don't fight the chaos - channel it into civilian transition before military \"restores order\" permanently.  **Act NOW or lose democracy for decades.**|||Is birgunj safe to visit today?

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

India has become a dead democracy in the past decade. We have no jobs, extremely costly education and no health. We are just scrapping by but nothing to show as the media paints cooked up Indian GDP.

A shift to a fully directly elected system for every seat would ensure greater accountability and public representation. 2. **Establish a Directly Elected Executive Head:** Instead of the parliament choosing the Prime Minister, the call is for a directly elected President or Prime Minister with full executive powers.

It’s tragic, because they also have families back home and face the same struggles as the rest of us. They should be victims of this system too, yet they show little compassion or critical thought about what’s happening around them. Why are there protests in the first place? I refuse to believe they're blind to people's frustration and the direction the country is heading.  I still remember when we joined a protest 14–15 years ago. The police confronted us aggressively, and as kids we were too confused to react. Fortunately, we just stood there processing and visibly confused, and they left — but I still shudder to think, *what if our reaction had been different?* Today’s young protestors are in the same position, pure in their intentions, simply voicing frustration without wanting harm.  And honestly, credit must go to these protestors. They know exactly what they are standing for, unlike us back then who needed adults to organise us. I don’t see how demonstrations could be any more peaceful than they already are — especially when the very leaders being protested against have blood on their hands from before this generation was even born.|||Yo bhatey haru kahi gayera sitcha holani|||randi baan machikne haru|||I mean this tracks, they only like when you're corrupt|||Its not andolan anymore its war|||We want death or at lease exile of KP Oli and other taukes.|||Randi haruko photo, name, address patta lagau.|||shamelss dogs of government|||Machikne radi harlai lakhetdai marnaparne|||Thuiyaa police vanauda haruuu|||you radiko ban harulai agolauno man xa|||ma sanga pani ganhune bhaye, kassam mardinthe radieekko ban|||Mathi bata aako order re ????

Most people don't know the perspectives of one event and they believe only what is potrayed.

The moment the crisis will come, these same activists are going to point fingers at each other other. Because they don’t know how to take accountability! Look at the way they are behaving… power hungry, god mentality!! I am appalled by this circus. Honestly speaking they are playing with young people’s emotions and future… they are burning our country and feeling the warmth… and we are happy at the time being because youth are so blinded by this madness they don’t see right from wrong!! Just look at the way they incite violence like it’s nothing!! Talking about burning down houses and people is nothing!! This is not a right foundation. We must make all these Gen-Z representatives accountable. Especially, Sudhan Gurung. He needs to stop acting like some filmy hero and step back for people with capabilities to step in and do their job. He is distracting the revolution in many way by his hot headed attitude. And stop with this Balen nonsense. He is just a populist who is just an experienced cringe wannabe… atleast for now he has not shown his worth to Nepali people.

Also what happens if he wins election he managed? Would everyone trust he won fair election?   I think what did is best for him and country. If people choose him, he will be pm if not he wont. It’s simple.|||Disclaimer: I am not a Balen supporter or cultist.  This post is conflicting for me. But, the post is characterizing the man based on:  1. What the man didn’t do or didn’t say. 2. What people expected him to do.  The man himself has said enough in his posts.   It’s what, he DIDN’T do that impresses me the most about him. Saying “No” is harder than saying “Yes”, when everyone wanted him to say “Yes”.  (Think about this.)  He put out only a couple of posts, which I think served as guide posts during the revolution.   1. He was the first widely known public figure (that I know) who defined who Gen Z was and gave his support to the protest. 2. When the tempo rose, he clarified that Gen Z should lead, he accepted Sushila even when all of his cultists were going crazy about making him the interim PM.  Removing himself from the picture, brought focus back on the revolution and the task ahead, rather than turn the confusion situation, even more confusing with a popularity contest as a side gig.   There is a lot of things to think about and I think in time we can all make sense of it all.   That’s my two paisa about him.|||Leading KTM municipality vs leading the nation are totally different. The followers of Balen urging and rushing him to lead 'right now' and come out by 2PM are the same people who will criticize him within one year if he were to be them PM someday. They don't have patience and want to see changes immediately.  Personally, I would like to see him running in the upcoming election as deputy/vice roles first and not immediate PM role...assuming how parties will be formed and if there are any good lead independent candidate who will run with him. He's one of those few worthy to be PM but this is not his peak yet. He just became a mayor like 3 years ago and he still has a lot to show to the general public. If and when he wins to the election, it will be his peak and he has high chances of being a two term PM...assuming two term limit will be in place hopefully. Time will tell.|||GenZ aren't immune to celeb worship culture.|||Hami Nepal has already stated it was part of a plan and they want balen for 5 years. So did they fight for the nation or for the balen is the real question? Why are they biased for balen only and not for other groups of good people?|||About your 2nd picture.  Yes it is definitely an opportunistic behaviour by balen. But how is this behaviour wrong and how is taking over PM position now and securing interim govt now and not taking part in politics for next 5 years do any good to the country.    He is practicing patience to achieve the goal he desires and what people actually wants from a young leader like him. Look throughout the history of world politics, paitence has always been the key factor to shape the world politics.|||Having trusted by many even me,In the moment of national threat, he could do nothing. That’s the reason I doubt him.  i think he is not completely responsible for being the Prime Minister. Sure, he is a great person. He’s doing such a great thing in the valley, but being a Prime Minister is very responsible post, his way up talking to seniors, saying I will put fire to SinghaDurbar, I will bury everyone if you’re in tudinkhel, getting carried away by emotions, being Prime Minister means you should not be carried away by any emotions and none of the factors should affect your judgment which you believe to be true and is lawful, Hopefully he will make such changes and we can finally see him in the top, as much as I want him to be the Prime Minister I do think he is inexperienced and immature in this field,|||We are so far behind that criticizing political leader sounds like a hater. We are not even to the point where we could say “This person is bad/clueless , country isn’t safe with them”. For the past decade, the corrupted 3 have been playing nothing but tato aloo with us so its natural to be sticking nail to current situation. Give it some time and our voices will get echoed.|||If there’s one thing old political leaders never learned, it was how to handle criticism. The moment anyone spoke up, they tried to shut it down and let’s not even start on the behavior of their hardcore supporters(jholey as we call them).  Even leaders like Balen need to address this with their own supporters, as do all the new representatives entering the upcoming elections. They must say publicly that they welcome criticism, will reflect on it, and use it as a tool for improvement. Leaders should make it clear to their base: don’t bully or silence people for simply asking questions or raising concerns. Do not perform character assassination against someone just for criticizing. After all, in a democracy, freedom of speech is our right.  At the same time, we the general public also carry responsibility. We need to recognize the difference between constructive criticism and defamation. What we must not do is fall for propaganda, spread rumors, or engage in baseless character assassination.  And if we realize that our criticism or questioning was wrong, we should have the courage to apologize in the same way we raised the question. After all, apologizing will never make you small. It’s just a simple five letter word: “Sorry.” A word that can and should be spoken from both sides.|||Just because you’re against the system, doesn’t make you Balen-Supporters. Balen has no experience. Balen should wait and gain some experience. Criticism is a backbone of democracy and one must welcome it.|||EXACTLY. They lack this ability to critically analyse any action of any leader. Like no one is perfect and no one is a good. Let's be honest. Let's criticize people for their actions. People should be held accountable for their actions. Most importantly, leaders who run our nation. If we don't point out their wrongdoings, will they ever stop? Nepalese have such a bheda mindset, istg. Let's be more aware and let's know how to discern leaders and their actions.   By criticizing these leaders, we aren't hating on them. We're trying to bring awareness so that they won't repeat the same thing again and can do things better for the country.|||They need to be aware party KO jhole become jhole because they were andabhakt of party leader ( just like they are blind follower of balen rn)|||I think holding politicians accountable is crucial. I hope people realize we don’t need  more devotees and followers. We need critical, educated thinkers. Support the good work, appreciate your favorite leader but don’t forget to question often.

I see people thanking Balen for this movement and saying he was the reason this movement happened and succeeded and all after Sushila Karki became interim PM, and this made me very sad for actual people who started the movement and also faced the consequences and this was even more big realization for me for how blind youth and supporters these days are and this concerns me even more for future|||This. This is what I’ve been saying for some time. Like the post says, I’ve also been labeled as a party ko jhole and what not. Even here in this sub, people have called me jhole lol just because I questioned him.  I am a Balen supporter. I supported him and did my part by sharing about his campaign on social media and making everyone aware about it. And I was super happy when he won, I still am. But I’ve been criticizing him on various points that I find valid. The top one is communication.  During the election, he constantly criticized Bidya Sundar (the previous mayor) for not communicating publicly. He even said that once he became mayor, he wouldn’t be like that and would stay in constant touch. He proposed starting a ‘Mayor with the Public’ TV program and even set aside a budget for it, but nothing has happened. He hasn’t given a single interview.  And then come his jhole supporters who always argue with the same line: ‘Pailai kei chaieko ho.’ With that logic, we should never question anyone. Just look at how Balen has become now, he just posts one-sided, no-context Facebook statuses and nothing else.|||Balen is a hypocrite in my opinion, like he encouraged the protest and even promised to provide a safe and secure environment for the protest but when things turned south he vanished like horn from a donkeys head|||Finally someone spoke about this, belun has literally become a god complex among some people out there, which is kinda concerning, the only time he speaks is to not let his adhabhatka interfere in every other stuff out there.

In Nepal, many people tend to follow leaders without much critical thought, even when those leaders don’t necessarily act in their favor. Unfortunately, this habit seems to persist across generations. If the younger generation continues with the same mindset, there’s a real risk that the country could end up facing the same challenges in the future that we are experiencing today.|||You can make your own assumptions and narratives. If Balen had taken the post of PM, you would have said that he is opportunistic, that he enraged protestors just to get the position. I saw somewhere on Facebook, even before Balen’s official post on sushila karki that balen played dirty game for the sake of pm position. As far as I know, Balen is a farsighted person. He only comes forward when he feels fully prepared.|||That's my whole point, but again..vanepachi manche lai jholey nai lagcha. 😅 Guy's, learn to ask questions yourself too.

But ever since I saw him become mayor, I have always seen him wearing Nepali dress most of the time and consistently working to conserve our heritage and culture.  You know what? He is still better than most of the people there. Whatever he does, he has never done anything wrong. Stop pretending to be so-called critics for useless reasons. What is your academic background, and what makes you think that way? Have you ever felt the difference between past and present Kathmandu? I have a friend from the core area of Kathmandu, do you know what his opinion about Balen Shah is? No!  Even Harka Sampang is a very good person. Moreover, Sagar Dhakal’s brother has been working actively to eradicate the dictatorship of these political parties. Maybe your parents are bootlicking those rotten political parties, so you only see what Balen has never done and will never do. Just because he supported the movement does not mean he said he wants to become prime minister. You must understand that he posts only a few things because his words are weapons. One word from him has many consequences in such a movement. He is very clever and very wise; unlike Harka Sampang, though I like Harka as a person.

If Balen had come out saying he’s ready to lead, a lot of people would’ve jumped in claiming he planned the whole movement and just used Gen Z for his own benefit. That’s probably why in his statements, he keeps stressing that this is Gen Z’s movement and that the government will be formed by them. imo, staying out of it was the smartest move he could have made.  I’m all for questioning and criticizing leaders. I agree that its a problem if you dont want to do it. But when someone has shown that they are dedicated, not corrupt, and actually get things done, you’ve got to give them some benefit of the doubt. Save the tough questions for real concerns. Dont critise just because you think no one can ever be good enough.|||Yes Balen has fallen badly as he didnt seem to care about the youths when they needed him the most. But, when we are talking about selection of interim PM, he did the right thing by not coming out.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):** The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):** If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):** If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):** If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

He pushed Nepal towards democracy and republicanism.   He gave poor villagers and lower-caste groups a voice in national politics.   He increased women’s participation in politics and society, with many ex-fighters now active in leadership roles.   In western hills and Madhesh, state institutions were weak or absent. Villagers depended on landlords for loans, justice, and protection, which kept exploitation unchallenged (Kamaiya, Haruwa-Charuwa, Haliya systems). His movement gave villagers confidence to defy landlords for the first time.

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not “revolution,” it’s not “justice,” and it sure as hell isn’t “the voice of the people.” It’s mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn’t make you brave—it makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that—surrounded by a wave of so-called “youths” who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let’s not sugarcoat it—the so-called Gen Z “warriors” hiding in the mob weren’t heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country’s social fabric. He still can’t step foot in certain countries because he’s internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he’s propped up as a “leader.”  Let’s be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn’t an accident—it was a setup. While Deuba’s family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don’t get it twisted—those sharpshooters in the crowd weren’t just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres—former insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let’s stop pretending this was “the people rising up.” It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist—the one who drowned this nation in blood—walks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don’t for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn’t that Deuba suffered humiliation—the real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn’t a flower; he’s a weed choking the soil of Nepal’s democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too naïve to realize they’re being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||Prachanda and Baburam are India's puppet.

This has been ongoing for more than two decades. Behind the few visible figures, there are countless others who have either assisted them or benefitted through their association—ranging from major brands in Nepal to traders. For example, Sher Bahadur Deuba’s son and his sanitary pad importing company stand as an illustration.  They have institutionalized corruption by appointing foreign ambassadors based on party loyalty and financial gains, extending even to the transfer of bureaucrats to preferred locations in exchange for bribes and other undue benefits. The problem is not limited to the political system alone; bureaucrats, too, require checks and balances. A mechanism must be established to regulate the power of bureaucrats over politicians. Since bureaucrats are permanent stakeholders, their influence is even greater. One effective way to mitigate this is to appoint domain experts as ministers—for instance, a professional civil engineer as a minister cannot be misled about the cost estimates of a construction project.  There remains much to be done. Moreover, these political parties will attempt to form alliances before elections, bringing forward the same candidates and restoring the same exploitative system. Therefore, the first and most meaningful reform must be a change in the electoral process, with the inclusion of a “NOTA” (None of the Above) option.  Further accountability can be ensured by eliminating political appointments to certain positions. At present, even temporary (karar) appointments are made based on party affiliation rather than merit. As a result, even highly qualified experts are compelled to seek political approval. The recent appointments of Vice-Chancellors at B.P. Koirala Institute in Dharan and Gangalal Hospital are prime examples.  In addition to these issues, several other structural flaws persist. What we urgently require is a comprehensive systemic reform|||Gen Z laid them in the grave, and now they're shoveling the dirt themselves.|||# How to make Gen Z movement bullet proof ?

People watched her speech where she said stuff like, “What’s my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?”  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still don’t have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we don’t have the right connections.  We don’t get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, it’s still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? That’s probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  We’re out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor people’s kids not boil?  On top of that, there’s already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent. Because this have  been suppressed for so long, and now the mindset is like — “If we can’t reach anywhere through the system, then we might as well destroy it.”  And even if some third party tries to trigger people, the truth is, it was already there deep down in their subconscious.

I see only him as the one with intellect right now  According to me, Sushila Karki being former Chief Justice should held interim gov, and add the presidential style election, and the elections should be within 15days-1month. for which we gen-z's should help if we can destroy we should show we can also be a help|||Tiyo post ma garw chi chi chi chi Thu Thu Thu Thu chi chi chi chi Thu Thu Thu Thu gardi bascha 😂😂|||https://preview.redd.it/dlrjv8jm1gof1.jpeg?width=442&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97c0337eb5a438e5909e840f83db267f87a0b99a  found this making rounds in fb|||Mai hu malie sab aoucha vanne wana ego wala manchey ho  Ani yo kirati haru afno jaat vayera dherai furkirako ho  Muji haru lai tha chai kei chqina pachi k huncha vanera Dhunga bokera matra desh bandaina gu haru dimak ka cha ta haru ko|||Her keta ho.

Dr Baburam is also a good candidate. But he can lean towards Prachanda.|||Yeah, bro!  Now, the nation is seeing the true colors of the Harka.  There have been big changes since 2047, up to 2062-2063.  Public property and individuals were not targeted.  But this time, to suppress the voices, he used his goons to burn down the homes of the people who rose up against him.  He left the DRN to be PM, taking his so-called \"jhole.\"|||I'm from Dharan.   I know Harka from close, I voted for him. He isn't even capable of being the mayor. The position of Prime Minister is far beyond his dreams.He should have been elected as a ward member first, and then he should have practiced for a higher-level position.However, due to the frustration of the people, voters chose him. It wasn't because of his popularity, but because of that frustration.Look at his recent activity, he cannot coordinate with the 20 members and bring the budget in on time   And so called the Sharaman, it's the illusion, of the corruption|||Not being a racist, but most people who are blindly supporting him are from Mongolian ethnicity ( mostly Rai and Kirati) .|||Even Kulman is a corrupt person.

If anything he is worst.|||Isn’t educated re.yo muji lai vanndeu kaisile kp le 8 sama matra padeko thyo|||No, he is a missionary|||Yes Harka Sampang indeed and is the one right person for now, even A mother won't feed his baby, untill he cried out. He is asking people that he can bring the change so what the bid deal in that. So people need a leader who is just become a puppet of other, no transparency. The nation need a leader who can proudly say yes this is my country I will die or live for it. He is the one. My suggestion is do not judge based  on sentiments.|||His position is great till the mayor, no need to drag him any further.|||This needs to spread forward, he is a narcissist, somebody who has no sense of how to speak , god complex.  publicity stunt doesnot makes person a great leader.|||We’re falling into the same trap again. Don’t buy into the smooth talk and fake charm — check their track record instead. Balen and Harka might be moody, but at least they’ve been tested in real battles. I’m done with sugar-coated leaders; give me someone who spits facts and takes action. Doing the right thing in a rotten system is never easy, and that’s why tried-and-tested leaders matter. Supporting Rajesh Hamal? That’s just a fantasy.|||Harka Sampang? you guys cant handle now i am sure|||तिमीहरुको कुरा सुन्दा अचम्म लाग्यो ।प्रकृया के हो , कसरी चल्छ केहि थाहा रहेनछ । देश जोक हो? चुनाव गराउनलाई सम्रचना छैन , चुनाव सजिलो कुरा सोच्या छौं ?? भोली चुनावको बैधताको को कुरा आउँछ , देश बिदेश बाट inspection हुन्छ । हल्का रुपमा नलेउ है । जति चाडो डिसिजन गर्यौ बुझेर त्यति फाइदा हो अलिक पछि त यो पाराले पानी पनि भन्न पाउँदैनौं , बर्षौदेखि राज गरेका पार्टि र तिनका कार्यकर्ता निक्लन्छन नै, उनिहरुसँग नेक तिकडम हुन्छन जुन तिमिहरुले बुझ्न पनि सक्दैनौ । if you need right suggestion and whole process i can help to brief.|||Constituion should be ammended so politicians are no longer called leaders and they cannot enjoy a career.|||He would make a good dictator and actually do good for the country. But unfortunately for him, the public is educated. 100 years ago and this guy would have started the Sampang regime 😂|||Anyone who actively seeks power does so because they want to be seen and heard. That drive inevitably brings with it shades of narcissism and opportunism. So rather than fixating on intentions, it makes more sense to judge politicians by their results. On that front, Harka has proven he can deliver. His rough almost mobster-like style may be off-putting to some but in a city like Dharan which is home to hotheaded Kirati / Hill Janajati majority that kind of toughness isn’t just useful, it’s necessary.  That said, he is neither qualified nor capable enough to be considered an ‘ideal’ Prime Minister. Nonetheless, when compared to Rabi Lamichhane Harka represents a comparatively more credible alternative. Personally not a fan of either.|||Tei ta Mayor ko pani layak xaina veda janta lai pm chaiyo re|||Dherai yo jaat ko haru furkirako cha muji haru K hi pachi k huncha kei tha chaina gu bhareko muji haru ko|||Guys Primeminister is not joke role. It is representative of country. He must have some internal support and dealing capacity.|||The common thing between Harka and Balen is that both are independent and hardworking, and that is what people recognize and that is what the revolution wants. If a person has done good work, both of them will be appreciated hands down. You have to look at the picture from both sides. Secondly, please ask your senior citizens or elders from a different generation. They have seen history and faced the consequences. The real issue is bringing change in the constitution, i.e., a representative should not be above a certain age and should be allowed to seek votes only for one term. Take that in writing from the concerned representative, live, and show it to the world clearly. Also, please do not discriminate by saying someone is from the “Stone Age,” as such remarks can hurt the sentiments of people who are not from cities.|||Yes, I don't know what to. It feels like waste of my taxes. Now even democracy is undermined. I think this will repeat again in 10 to 15 year|||He is not educated, he does not have the capabilities of being head of government.

We need an honest leader with integrity and accountability who'll jail all corrupt officials.|||I think sushila karki for now|||Also there were claims of him being discriminating towards Aryans.|||so for your kind information these are why he  may be eligible candidate: 1) He isnt uneducated : He has passed bachelors in something like politicl science and he knows the most of the revolution how they worked and the principles of famous people , 2) He can relate : he is a person just like us from a middle class family and knows the value of society  3) Revolunatiory: We cant ignore how he and his team constructed a water project , a established (shram park) with local and nepalese funds ( donations) 4) accountability and sense of belonginess: unlike other politicians ,he takes his area as his own house and sees his areas citizen as his member of family , he is accountable and alwyas tries to show the proof of funds 5) His first prioriuty is to utilize his resources maximumly , Unlike federal gov and so called politicians who beg for international funds , enjoys commission and get the country into Debt trap . Even he ignored and disagree with the Loan to be used from ADB ( Asian Development Bank ) . 6) He speaks and protest on his own way BUT still he has some flaws unlike us even the moon has flaws then he is still human . ra usko flaws we can ignore .

U all r pretty blinded by jealousy and his popularity. Only in a lifetime we get such leader.

(**Bank run** is a situation where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a bank simultaneously, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or financial stability. This can lead to liquidity problems for the bank, as it may not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands. Bank runs can create a cycle of panic, potentially leading to the bank's failure.)  The real pain starts after the protests have calmed. Economic crash is certain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh both went through it. Stock market/real estate crash, inflation and what not.  Whoever takes charge next, likely Balen, will need to address the pointless 'Greater Nepal' rhetoric and become a moderate on this issue. Thanks to Trump, India-China relationship is stable for the first time in ages. The only way Nepal has a future is pledge allegiance to both neighbour's.  Bangladesh under Yunus has been a pain in the ass for India. Nepal cannot make the same mistake. Any wrong steps and a free floating Nepali rupee against the dollar would go from 140 now to 25,000 like similar countries in our GDP range. Probably worse since our economy is in much worse shape.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.   Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.   Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||How credible is this info?|||Use bitchat for conversation.

            "comments": "We are living in a moment where anger is boiling over. People are tired of corruption, censorship, and being silenced. Many of us are ready to take to the streets on Sept 8. But before we move forward, we must stop and think carefully.  History has shown us what happens when we rush in without preparation. In Bangladesh last year, in Sri Lanka not long ago, ordinary people gave their lives while corrupt leaders fled the country with protection and comfort. Their deaths were forgotten within weeks, while the guilty walked free. If we are not careful, Nepal risks becoming the next chapter in that same tragic story.  That is why this movement must be different. We cannot afford to be reckless. We must protect our people, keep our voices peaceful, and make sure the world is watching every step so that accountability cannot be erased.  Here is what we need to do before Sept 8:  * Get international human rights groups, UN observers, and peace monitors involved beforehand so there are eyes on the ground. * Publish clear and peaceful agendas so nobody can label us as rioters or mobs. * Document everything with photos, videos, and testimonies. Every arrest and every injury must be recorded and shared. * Avoid following local leaders who are affiliated with political parties. Big parties will try to infiltrate, hijack, and twist this movement for their own gain. * Know who is truly standing beside you. Trust matters because infiltrators can turn peaceful protests into chaos.  This movement is about dignity, rights, and accountability. It is not about violence. It is not about revenge. If we lose focus, if we let anger replace strategy, then we risk repeating the same cycle where the powerful walk free and ordinary people pay with their lives.  Nepal deserves better. The world must see us not as mobs, but as citizens united for freedom and justice. If we do this right, our voices will be impossible to silence. If we do this wrong, we risk being forgotten like so many before us.  Stay safe. Stay peaceful. Stay smart.",

Even the people who are getting inspired and speaking in favour of your protest are getting back lash (and recently a person has been charged under the law by the police)because this protest turned violent but ik that wasn't intended. We can argue about the pros and cons but the fact that you stood up against the system is a big achievement and inspiration. I wish you great luck guys and hope you find a better system than the one you fought against and draw a milestone for us.

Why can't we try to support eachother instead of blaming each other??   And No body knows. Since those politicians where chased. They have little chance to establish again.  And the hotel was belonging of politicians son. So, they could have made fake protestor's to do it, to claim insurance?  Why are indian and nepalese are fighting here about this matter?? This isn't time for fighting.   And about destroying properties, there are theories that the protest were hijacked by other political parties. Like wise, about governments offices, they wanted to destroy the proofs of corruptions. And public building and properties was collateral damages for those fake protesters to look it real.

I am just a sincere, hardworking youth who remained silent because too many opinions create a ruckus. That's what I believed till September 8.

I remained with the group who were peacefully protesting infront of the army van, I helped people with water to wash their face, tried picking up litters.

In retaliation, my protests became more louder. I came home late at night, tried my best to repost as many information I could. At one point, I felt like people should burn down the entire ministry down, all these nepo-babies should be brought to the streets to teach their parents how it feels to kill someone's child. I was furious, the word being an understatement. But seeing this people getting mob justice was what I never wanted. They don't deserve the least of anyone's sympathies, but we still have humanity in our hearts.

            "subreddit": "NepalSocial",
            "heading": "The Shrinkhala Khatiwada I knew at Harvard",
            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada’s classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.   We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking–much to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in  Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate - the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala’s approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.   Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn’t mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‘help’. One time, she even said airily, “I wash my own dishes, you know.” She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala–a beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth–lingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don’t intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‘nepo babies’ who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).   Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It’s a troubling idea to think that despite what’s happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

And a few after she became miss nepal... I can somewhat vouch for the \"I'm busy with this and that... Can you help me with this\" part...  People around her always had the same feedback.. and I quote as I recall \"Euta kaam pani garna parexaina yo kt lai.. jahile ni help help vanxa...  help magne pro vikhari..\"  😂 (she barely does a thing on her own, always keeps asking for help , she like pro-beggar ..)   I never liked her naak ma singan adke jasto boli.. And always felt she has a cunning personality that clings over you until she can no more use you for her advantage..  Sisan literally dodged a  bullet.. all thanks to her greed though..|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn’t some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was “beneficial” for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake “beauty with brains” narrative. Do you guys remember Niti’s big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let’s not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala’s prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it’s her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let’s be real- Sisan wasn’t perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they’d known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn’t even exist. This just proves it- they weren’t just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can’t just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala’s career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav’s narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What’s the lesson we can learn from here ?  Karma is real af & money can’t give you lifelong happiness, night Redditors|||Wish we had more tea like this on all nepo babies.|||She didn't get any fucking scholarship from the Nepali government. She was funded by her corrupt father.||| Damn I strictly feel its true|||I  never cared for her but hated her when she said ‘ we were not well off I had to share room with my house help ‘ and tried to relate to poor people like bro fuck off .|||Thanks for sharing. Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don’t even make sense to begin with. Don’t know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don’t even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It’s so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It’s astounding what the world has come to and it’s deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can’t be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn’t she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It’s better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has. It’s disheartening!|||[deleted]|||What do you expect from a pageant queen?

Every move, every word, every connection seems like part of a bigger calculation. While most people get dragged through the mud on social media, she somehow stays a step ahead. Of all platforms, she was clever enough to pull the LinkedIn card first. That’s not by accident, it’s calculation. She knows the bashing on Tiktok or Instagram doesn’t matter as long as her professional side stays spotless, especially where she might work with people internationally who will never know the side of her life in Nepal that’s been exposed and torn apart ever since the truth came out.  It’s like she’s playing this endless game of Ludo, always climbing the ladder, polishing her image as she goes. But at the same time, you can’t help but feel she’s only ever a roll away from hitting 98 and sliding right back down the snake.|||We wont know if what you claim is true. But I wouldn't be surprised if its true either or even worse. I would assume that she was in her best behavior since she was not in Nepal and probably wanted to portray the best of her image.  My moment of disdain for her came about when her father one of the members of the parliament who were on monthly housing allowance along with the monthly pay. The beinfit is probably meant for the MPs who had to move temprorarily to the capital or who didn't have their own residence. Iirc, they had to manually opt in to get that added housing allowance. When the news published, her father's reaction was something along the line of \"I didn't know, I was getting it. I am happy to return it.\"  Question for her, how come you dont know the source of wealth and your parent's ethics? I mean I know the answer, I just want to hear her say it.  https://preview.redd.it/z06jr4rj13pf1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8a20b685f7aae22f53a82b2ee284b7d2c72672f  [https://www.cijnepal.org/accommodation-allowance-for-landlord-lawmakers](https://www.cijnepal.org/accommodation-allowance-for-landlord-lawmakers)|||She is a gold digger.

It highlights how Shrinkhala, despite her public image and privileges, was not as collaborative or hardworking in academic settings as she appeared to be. It also touches on the contrast between her image and reality, as well as some concerns about nepotism and entitlement.|||there was a podcast recently, shrinkhala & 3 other women sittng down to talk with, his name may be anil shah.

Like realistically speaking, a middle class Nepali \"HUMBLE FAMILY” who did not come from money can’t afford even the tuition at Harvard even with loans CYZ it’s so Dyaum expensive let alone living expenses, traveling, food and other necessities we might not know of. I’m saying this as a Nepali because there are so many kids that have the potential to study there and even get into the school but can’t even afford it.

These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!! And the way she's silent when the country is bleeding says alottt too!!!!!!  And about the Nepal's government scholarship for harvard,this is not true, she is telling an entire different story about harvard scholarsip & how she paid fees there. She said she got 30% scholarship at harvard and the remaining 70% is paid through her brand endorsements money as she is brand ambassador to few company. We didnt buy that story, she tried hardest to sell it though and still fools people with this shitty madeup script about harvard's 30% scholarship & 70% funding through brand endorsement's money lmao. And lately she's being questioned on 50,000USD she got during miss world competition after winning \"beauty with the purpose\" title. Her ex exposed & questioned her in a very shady way and because of him we all knew this new layer of truth and i highly doubt it went on harvard's funding rather than for actual purpose|||One buy Harvard degree with that 50K and another one became a MAKUSE owner .

Continue on --|||Thanks for sharing your raw and real experience, thoughts and opinion. This is valuable for those of us who were shocked and skeptical about her success right from the day she got into limelight. I watched her view on Youtube yesterday and couldn't get past a minute of that video, she is clearly playing victim and trying to play the game.  Nope! she doesn't deserve any chance at all.  The students that I know personally who went to Harvard, MIT and many other prestigious institutions had grit, determination, belief in hard-work, may be little bit of luck but most of all they had \"humility\". They NEVER used their \"Harvard degree\" or Ivy league label to show off. It's those who want to fame and fake pride that put up social media posts to show off their diplomas. Honestly, it was very very clear even before she went to Harvard that she was on the wrong side of fame game.  For the longest time I thought it was a generational difference, since there are many other Harvard students who have publicized themselves in several Youtube videos and they are all Gen Z, and as a Gen Y (Millennial) observing this trend seemed justifiable.  However, Shrinkhala was building a house of cards and the fact that she had the audacity to publicize and put Sambhav Sirohiya in the limelight using Harvard freebies was just laughable a few years ago.  Like you pointed out, the fact that she still has 900K followers is troubling for sure but let's hope those are just her fake followers (some % are bought/in-organic followers, some her closest elite allies like \"Other Miss Nepals/ Businessmen/political affiliates etc. and some her enemies) as they say, **keep your friends close and enemies closer.**|||I heard that B.arch is the easiest subject to get at Pulchowk and that too for a girl as they have separate reservations for women. Yes she must be smart because to get that you need to work hard.  But the image she tries to portray being you know the perfect, hardworking,real and independent girl always sounded fishy to me.  Miss World organization saw through her, so didn't let her go to the final round. There is no substance in her words and it  sounds exactly like a politician speech. Idealistic statements with no action. Look at the legacy of previous Miss Nepal winners. Most of them marry rich businessman and secure a rich, lavish life. Miss Nepal itself feels like a joke...|||First of all, there was no government scholarship. She lied to you guys so she could appear smart.

Its not easy to get in there and even if you do its one of the expensive schools there. Talking about her Nepal bachelor’s days, my friends studied with her in KU in nepal in b. arch, and so many said she cheated on exams (A LOT) just to pass. later she worked for the nepal government and came to US for conferences and presentations 🤡. now she has started her master’s at UT austin, funded by corrupted money. she removed her instagram posts about her prior foreign visits and her recent UT Austin orientation day, and even deactivated her linkedin account.  Now she’s posting on instagram and facebook, after the new PM was appointed, congratulating her and thanking the president grand dad for this revolution. it’s crazy how these unethical people still have the audacity to do all this.

Plus, getting into Harvard is not everyone’s cup of tea no matter how much money one wishes to spend.

U r not bothered about the young lives lost ,Simp||| There are actually unwanted elements mixed in with Gen z using their name and shadow to commit all sorts of atrocities. Gen z never planned to burn or destroy public property and jails. I believe this happened due to the presence of other opportunistic groups.  Gen z’s true motive was to overthrow the government and that was achieved. they never intended to take up guns or engage in vandalism and that was not their goal. but many other people, parties or elements took advantage of the moment to cause destruction for their own selfish interests like Looting, hiding behind the anonymity of the crowd.  Because of this, even their own people are now suffering from security issues like the release of 1200 prisoners due to prison breaks. And now when crimes, harassment or problems occur, all of it is blamed entirely on Gen z  So please, stay cautious, awake, and.

You say their work has benefited generations “like me” but what about the millions still without quality education, clean water, jobs, or justice? If that legacy was truly built for the people, then why does inequality keep growing? Why is access to opportunity still limited to a select few families like yours?  No one is attacking your elders for their hard work but using that work to claim political or social superiority today is exactly the kind of dynastic thinking that holds progress back. Legacies don’t entitle children to power. Competence, accountability, and public trust do.  You’re not being attacked, you’re being questioned. And if your only answer is to call others “small-minded” and “ungrateful,” then maybe you’re not as prepared to face criticism as you think. Respect is earned in every generation, not inherited like land or a business.  The days of hiding behind the achievements of the past are over. If you want respect for your family, prove it through your own actions, not by silencing criticism or demanding loyalty based on history.|||French revolution Bata sikna paryo kei|||I fwwww it.

Where else in the world are citizens asked what their main problems are and what they want from the government? And later, citizens are asked how satisfied they were with the government's performance. I know it's a bit naive of me to make such a suggestion from afar, as a sheltered European who is not really familiar with the form of government in Nepal. But it seems to be similar in many, many countries. Those in power often hold office and positions of honor for decades through their family ties. And they are similar in their decadence. The most expensive clothes, the biggest cars, houses, and palaces. Flying to New York for dinner in a private jet, or to Monaco for F1, or around the globe in a yacht as long as a soccer field. And in the media, they try to appear close to the people, to be there for them, to advance the country by investing in infrastructure or new hospitals, etc. But no, a large part of your taxes ends up with the rulers themselves. The rich and powerful acquire more wealth and more power. Money rules the world!

Experience isn’t a flaw, it’s literally the one thing that tells you someone can handle the chaos.

We keep repeating the same mistakes because people get blinded by shiny new faces and ignore anyone who actually knows what they’re doing. Experience doesn’t mean someone is corrupt it means they’ve been in the trenches and survived. Throwing it away just to see if a “fresh face” can magically save everything is how you crash a country.  Nepal isn’t a playground. Leadership isn’t about hype, popularity, or being young and “green.” It’s about surviving the chaos, making tough decisions, and knowing where the landmines are. If you think a rookie can do that better than someone experienced, you’re dreaming and the whole nation will pay the price for it.",

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.   Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.   Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||Jaha Bhetyo tehi thok saley madarchod lai...|||Aaos na india ma ni nepali xan birsyo kya|||Bro timro yo pic use garey haii Tiktok ma vid halchu|||kun desh jala teta bebasta garnu parxa|||yo machikne lai samatna paryo jasari bhaye ni yellai bachne kunai adhikar xaina|||Bhagey ra canada nai ja la, canada ma nee xodnu hudaina.

Lets first make sure state security, tax, bureaucracy and banking system be under central government. Then every other remaining ministry which needs localization be under province government.    Let there be 1 president directly elected by everyone to handle state security and 7 governor to handle province security, and 1 premier and 7 Magistrate to handle state & province tax, banking and bureaucracy. This way we will have clean central government in which no one can capture state function and minimize corruption.    Since we don't have any functioning people in power, either let lower house to vote for temporary governor and magistrate. No minister, let bureaucracy handle them under strict scrutiny of Governor and Magistrate.    Then start a fresh election, 1 President, 7 Governors, 1 Premier, 7 Magistrates, Lower House or Province Parliament member, then from each Province send 10 representative in Upper House/Federal Parliament 3 voted by Lower House/Province Parliament, 5 directly elected in Upper House and 2 votes each from Province Governor and Province Magistrate. Let the bill for Upper House be registered by directly elected member of Upper House. Upper house will vote for foreign minister, ambassadors and diplomats.   For now, either make Mayor and Deputy Mayor of each capital of Province to be interim Governor and Magistrate to bring law and order in state-province security and function. After election they will go back to be Mayor and Deputy Mayor.     Why all this? So no dictator and political party can come in power to hijack this state again for their own gain.|||No not as PM, can rejoin as edu min tho|||Ahile lai.. interim prime minister Sushila Karki.. ahile Balen/Sumana ayo vaney interim PM le election ladna paudaina.. so ahile Sushila Karki is best and Elected PM Balen or Sumana Shrestha.  my opinion.|||WE DO NOT NEED A PARTY AFFILIATED REPRESENTATIVE.

I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both.

She is the one who has been abroad for so long and has so many foreign connections and relations that even if she  doesn't want interference, there will be far more foreign interference with her as a leader.

BTW, Gen Z doesn’t just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didn’t exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who weren’t even present for the protests claim we don’t know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldn’t even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, ‘We have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server you’re all listening to is just for public discussion’. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal. Now that it’s been confirmed everywhere and with Balen posting that the Gen Z’s choice former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Sushila Karki is the right choice for interim prime minister of Nepal, we look forward to what comes next.|||https://new-nepal-voting.vercel.app/  Vote here or suggest names I can add|||For interim formation CJ Sushila Karki would be the perfect choice.

He might be able to achieve more with a sensible government.  Sumana is smart and I feel like she has a level head on her. Head of state requires someone to be diplomatic as well as bold.

It’s rotting because everything: government, institutions and society itself is rotten to the core. There is no genetic psychopathy; there’s generations of: neglect, corruption, and betrayal. People aren’t spreading hate for fun, they’re bleeding from a system that chews them up and spits them out.  Your little moral lectures about “empathy” and “fairness”? Irrelevant. The world doesn’t run on kindness. It runs on power, survival, and who’s willing to fight or cheat to stay alive. Sitting there whining online, hoping people will listen, makes you irrelevant. You aren’t warning anyone, you’re screaming into a void while real fkin problems eat the country alive.  Get over your illusions man. The country doesn’t owe you, me or anyone morality. If you want change just like everyone else, stop fantasizing about hearts and minds and start confronting the brutal, ugly reality of a system designed to crush idealists.|||Every revolution is messy!!|||it is just a coping mechanism for many. now many criminals are released|||rajabadis or any other parties might try to take over. we need to be aware.|||ma ta herda herda thakisake  k vako???? euta ko wife lai jiudai jalako xa... gagan thapa lai testari kutna parne ta thyena|||Meanwhile this person is posting from toilet or abroad|||People are setting a Narrative, GenZ should lead GenZ.

Nothing was going to change if things didn’t go south. Personally, I didn’t see the government making any changes with a peaceful protest. Even when we look at history of the world, majority of peaceful protest start peaceful and end violently. No entity in power ever gives it up easily.  Change was what we asked for and change is what we are getting. Not exactly the way we wanted things to go but seems clear from the comments that we all knew, in the back of our minds, it was never going to be a straight road to Rome.  So I believe it’s high time we look ahead and bring the same energy we did to the protests to ensure that we see the change we want to see happen and bring in leaders we believe in. Easier said than done but accountability starts from us now. Let’s not settle for less than what we envision Nepal to be.|||Who are you telling this?

They are hot blooded. They can do anything with teen minds.  Look at your genZ, destroying their own land...  GenZ is a popular word on the internet.  Now whenever you talk about GenZ people will remember this amount of brutalism and rage against their own land own assets.|||**What next? thoughts from a fellow Gen Z**    The motherland burns, my heart aches, my mind ponders, is all hope lost? My soul hurts to see violence, arson, anarchy, and the loot and burning of our national properties. We, Gen-Z, seem to have won, yet feel lost. Hope feels lost. Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? I’ve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we can’t let our nation fail.** We can’t let our nation burn. We can’t let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**     **1) We lay down our weapons.**   We came in peace, we protested in peace, and we’ve always wanted peace. We shall end this in peace. Be it known that anybody inciting violence isn’t part of our movement.     **2) We extend love.**   Love towards our brothers and sisters, love towards our nation, love towards our neighbours, our society, and the opposing side. The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.     **3) We wear white.**   White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that we’ve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.     **4) We have hope.**   Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.     Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.     Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.     Sincerely,   Pantji, a Gen-Z |||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Why not sagar Dhakal?|||Yesss|||Just promote it in your social media handle|||K bhairacha yarr discord ma pm choose bhairacha|||Ahile non political manxe thik huncha...her or Dr सन्दुक Ruit.

Unconstitutional action will hurt Nepal on the long run. Thus, to make it constitutional;  1. Make some MP elected from Proportionate Representation System resign, 2. Make the president declare her lawful member of parliament through Proportionate Representation System, 3. Declare her the interim prime minister, 4. The president on her cabinet's recommendation dissolves the house of Representatives, 5. Her cabinet carries forward the corruption investigation and reconstruction. 6. The elections will be declared immediately. 7. The new parliament decides the constitutional amendments. (directly elected prime minister etc. and others ) 8. Then, the prime ministerial election happens. 9. She resigns as the interim prime minister. 10. New prime minister and the cabinet are sworn in. 11. The current president resigns. 12.

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen.

Rather than looking outwards to pin 📌 the chaos, it's important that we self reflect.

Its grand architecture and historical importance make it a true pride of Nepal.The news of Singha Durbar burning yesterday is more than just the loss of a structure it feels like the loss of a piece of our soul. This tragedy is a blow to our heritage, to our economy, and to our sense of unity as a nation. The damage cannot be measured only in money, but also in the irreplaceable cultural and historical value that has been destroyed.  I feel deeply saddened by this loss. Singha Durbar was more than walls and pillars it was a living monument of Nepal’s journey, struggles, and achievements.

            "body": "So apparently the reason YouTube got banned here is because the platform isn’t officially registered in Nepal. That’s insane. Millions of us depend on YouTube every day  for learning, for jobs, for communication with the world. Blocking it just because of some paperwork is such a backwards move.  If the government wants registration, fine — negotiate with Google, set up rules, whatever. But don’t cut off an entire nation from one of the most important platforms on the internet. This hurts students, creators, and businesses way more than it helps anyone.  Instead of solving the issue, they’ve basically told Nepali people: “too bad, no YouTube for you.” That’s not regulation that’s censorship.",

            "body": "Let me get straight to the point.  Nepal has a multy-party parliamentary system, which means it is a mixed election system. Which means when we vote, we vote for two things. One for the 165 candidates who are elected directly (first-past-the-post), other for the party. The votes that party gets determine the remaining 110 members via proportional representation.  so aba either we need new political parties to replace the existing ones by Falgun 21, or we have to vote for the same parties again. This is more complicated because Nepal is not just Kathmandu. The political players which we have termed jholey will be active outside Kathmandu.   So if we need the change in constitution, we have to be more careful. The mandates of the movement are more at risk now than before.",
