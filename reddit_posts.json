I respect him for his contribution in reformation in electricity of Nepal. But that don’t give him excuse to whatever theater he is creating now.  He was waiting for RSP meeting held in chitwan of central committee and when it was certain that none of them wants him as a president before Rabi either gets convicted of charges from court or finish his two tenure if not found guilty, then why won’t he accept any other role? Rabi and other made the RSP  from dust and he wants a free dinner with zero contribution. I cannot see any other reason other then his aim to bring destabilization in party and finally end this party as Ganesh kakrki revealed that in one recent interviews which also aligns with Balen too plans.  Why they desperately wants to end RSP just like congress and yemale has been trying so far?? Everyone is demanding to form coalition between RSP, Kulman and Balen to get more seats and can justice be given to family of martyrs. Why they are putting their ego first before country interest ??  All this theatrics indicates that kulamn could be still pawn on hand of prachanda and Balen either being manipulated by his close allys or fucking moron that cannot either embrace crowd, face press , or make decisions.

The same tactic Congress did with maobadi during election. After winning form an alliance which is the best thing to do. For that rpp rsp and new parties should agree on this. But the problem is will people trust these party chances are high they might change if favourable and good candidates are provided. Another thing CK raut did the worst mistake by completely showcasing the madesh separation thing. The thing is he would have ideal for collation to collaborate in madesh election. But one thing is for sure he lost his own madesh people club after gen z election and this statement have made him more hateful among madesh youth. Boy is gonna loose huge. Be sure three taukeys of madesh mahant thakur upendra and Rajendra are no way gonna go against uml and congress. They will completly support them and form government in madesh with majority seats. In the end rsp rpp kulman balen sagar harka are way direction less than I thought they are not united like uml and congress.

            "body": "Looking at the new parties these days, everyone wants to cash-in their popularity for political bargaining and/or seats!  But popularity does not equal to votes in politics! Not everyone can pull of RSP 2079.     New political movement, party formation and making worthwhile impact are not easy. You can't just rely on your popularity and expect to win seats just so......it requires lots and lots of campaigning, hard work, strategy, wit and most importantly LUCK.   You absolutely need to have: - excellent support-base --from cities to rural areas, youths to old gens, inside the country and diaspora... - in-depth understanding of politics - unweavering political will - charisma to gather followers - a large team of candidates, experts and councellers, from politics to economics, education...etc and every domain - gather and lead like-minded and excellent candidates - excellent PR network... - etc..etc  And yet you need rarest of LUCK to actually win anything consequential.   So I am confused with the plan of Kulman/Sumana/Balen/Harka/Sagar...etc.  Kulman opened up a party.  He may win one seat (i honestly hope he does regardless of the party), but isn't that all? If he is so hell-bent on politics and leading a party/movement himself, why is he in the government in the first place? Should he be out in the field campainging, having at least 4-5 gatherings per day, meeting with prospective candidates and uniting them, discussing and planning campaign strategies..etc..etc.   And superheros Balen/Sumana/Sagar dont seem to have even made up their mind yet!  The election is in 3-4 months. Clueless!   Harka at least seem to be trying/working hard. I bet he will actually get more votes then Kulman/Balen/Sumana... but wont make must of an impact either. Desperately trying to recruit any consequential person, even Punya Gautam ?? And that toodidn't even work!!   Popularity != VOTES   What Ravi/RSP pulled off in 2079 was a miracle. And that doesn't happen frequently and easily.  I honestly believe only RSP or RSP-led coalition has a realistic chance to challenge the established parties.   So I am going to: - Vote RSP for Samanupatik - Vote RSP if good/strong RSP candidtaes - Vote Balen/Kulman/Sumana/Sagar/Harka personally only over weak/unknown RSP candidates",

How do retail shops usually place their orders with wholesalers or distributors? (Phone calls, visits, agents?)  2. Are delivery systems managed by the wholesalers themselves, or do they use third-party drivers?  3. What are the biggest pain points retailers or wholesalers face when doing business day-to-day?  4. Do most wholesalers offer credit (udharo) or cash-on-delivery to retailers?  5. And lastly, Are there any digital tools or apps that businesses in Nepal are actually using for B2B trade right now?  I’m just trying to understand the system and where the gaps or inefficiencies might be. If anyone here works in retail, distribution, or logistics, your insights would be super helpful!",

On Reddit alone, there are tons of posts every day from folks offering web dev services or showing off their projects.  It makes sense, web development seems approachable at first. You pick up some HTML, CSS, and maybe some framework , and you can already build something that looks good. But once you dig a little deeper, things start getting complicated fast. Real web development isn’t just about putting pages together; it’s about understanding APIs, scalability, system design, security, and how all the moving parts connect behind the scenes.  A lot of beginners stop at that surface level and call themselves “web developers,” but frameworks can only take you so far. The real value comes from knowing what’s happening under the hood, that’s what separates someone who just builds websites from someone who builds reliable, scalable systems.  And honestly, it’s worth going even further. Explore backend engineering, cloud computing, DevOps, automation, or data systems. Those areas don’t just make you a better developer , they help you understand how the whole ecosystem works, beyond just how to make something look good on the screen.",

            "body": "I want to share my wife’s story because I hope it helps someone who might be going through something similar. It's been a tough two years for us, and I’ve learned a lot the hard way.  After 2 years of getting married to my wife. In December 2023, we got the news no one ever wants to hear. My wife had a tumor near her pituitary gland (large lobulated heterogeneously and vividly enhancing mass). The MRI came back showing it was about 33x29x26 mm basically, the size of a small egg. I don’t think I’ll ever forget that moment. The world felt like it stopped spinning, and I had no idea what to do.  I immediately went into panic mode and started researching everything I could. We were ready to go to Delhi and see the top neurosurgeons, but then a relative suggested we see Dr. Gopal Raman Sharma at Nepal Mediciti for suggestion and consultation. Honestly, we were skeptical, but we decided to give it a shot.  When we met Dr. Sharma, it felt different from the start. There was no sugarcoating it, he was very serious, and made it clear that the tumor was dangerous. He kept saying it had to come out immediately, that something could happen to my wife *right now* if we didn’t do anything. I won’t lie, his words hit hard. He made it sound like we didn’t have time to think.  So, without really questioning much, we agreed. We trusted him. The surgery was scheduled for the very next day, and everything moved so fast. We didn’t even have time to breathe.  The surgery took around 2 hours. When he came out, Dr. Sharma told me, “We removed what we could, but there was a lot of blood loss. It was complicated.” And that was it. There was no explanation beyond that. When I tried asking how much of the tumor had been removed, he didn’t really answer me. At that point, I should’ve pressed more, but I was just in shock. My wife was kept in the ICU for two days, and we just had to wait.  A few weeks later, she came home, but we were still uneasy. He dragged us for an year saying there was nothing that can be done. We just wait and watch. \"Wait and watch\" thats all we heard from him for an year. It didn’t feel like it was over, not by a long shot. So, we did another MRI in December 2024, and when we got the results, I couldn’t believe my eyes. The tumor hadn’t shrunk. At all. It was still about 34x26x25 mm.  I was furious. I felt like we’d just been taken for a ride. All that money, all that stress, all that hope, and nothing had changed. I was angry at Dr. Gopal Raman Sharma and his assistant Prashant for not being more upfront, and angry at myself for not questioning more. But, as much as I wanted to blame someone, I knew anger wasn’t going to fix anything. So, I decided to take a step back, calm down, and get a second opinion.  That’s when we decided to go to AIIMS in India. We met with a neurosurgeon there who really took the time to explain everything. He did MRI and looked into everything in detail. He told us that the diagnosis was wrongly done by Dr. Gopal Raman Sharma at mediciti. That was a tough pill to swallow, but it also gave us some clarity. He told us that the tumor is made up of nerves and its jelly like. At least now we understood why things hadn’t gone as planned. The second surgery was scheduled right away. It was a long one, about 8-10 hours. My wife lost almost 5 liters of blood, but the team handled it. They managed to remove 97% of the tumor.  After the surgery, Neurosurgeon at AIIMS told us that the first surgery didn’t work because Dr. Sharma had tried to remove the tumor from wrong place and also tried three different places, but couldn’t reach it properly. In fact, the repeated attempts had damaged the tumor, making it harder to remove. The tumor was now scattered, which is why it was so difficult to get rid of.  It wasn’t easy. She was in the ICU for 7 hours after the surgery, but eventually, she was moved to a private room, and after 3 days, we were able to go home. It was a huge relief, but there was still the small matter of the remaining 3% of the tumor.  We had to come back to India for gamma knife radiation to get rid of the rest. The procedure took about 5 hours, but in the end, it was successful. The last of the tumor was gone. We just returned to kathmandu today.  Now, my wife is doing well. She’s back to her normal self, and for the first time in over two years, I feel like we can finally breathe easy. It’s been an incredibly tough journey. I’ve never felt so much responsibility in my life. As the eldest son, you carry that weight, and it can take a toll on you in ways you don’t expect.  But looking back, there are a few things I’ve learned that I wish I’d known from the start:  1. **Don’t rush decisions**. We let urgency take over in the beginning, and that clouded our judgment. Don’t be afraid to take a step back and think things through. 2. **Get a second opinion**. I can’t stress this enough. Don’t just trust the first doctor you see, no matter how confident they sound. If something doesn’t feel right, ask around. get **Get third and forth opinion** too. 3. **Trust yourself and your instincts**. In those early days, I didn’t trust my gut as much as I should have. Trust your intuition and don’t be afraid to ask questions—even when the doctor seems like they’re the expert. 4. **It’s okay to be angry, but don’t let it control you**. I was angry at Dr. Sharma, and I still feel that way sometimes. But holding onto that anger didn’t do anyone any good. It’s better to focus on moving forward. 5. **Life is unpredictable**. You never know what’s around the corner. But even in the toughest times, there’s always hope.  We’re finally able to move forward with our lives. I’m grateful my wife is healthy again, and I’m thankful for the lessons this journey has taught me. I just want to share this so that anyone who’s in a similar situation knows that they’re not alone. Keep fighting, keep questioning, and trust that things can get better.",

Some lack knowledge, others just don’t care about patient. Most MBBS graduates can’t even get license in first try.

A Nepali doctor rushed us into surgery, which didn’t remove the tumor and gave us only “wait and watch” for a year. The tumor didn’t shrink. We went to AIIMS India, where we learned the first diagnosis and surgical approach were incorrect. AIIMS surgeons did an 8–10 hour surgery, removed \\~97% of the tumor, and then gamma-knife radiation cleared the remaining 3%. After two years of fear, stress, and uncertainty, my wife is finally healthy.

Vauju lai mero tarfa bata 1kg anar dinu hai|||If you have money, don't ever do anything serious medical stuff in Nepal. What happened to OP is unfortunately common. My aunt had a similar experience where the doc said immediate surgery but her family decided to wait and instead went straight to Thailand. The doc over there said that it WASN'T even serious. Some meds and she was perfectly fine. Btw this was more than a decade ago. She's healthy as an ox. Not saying that all doctors are bad here but anecdotes like OPs are more common than I realised.|||I think I had very similar case like your wife. A bit long but you can read. When I was 17 I had tumor in my right eye, I noticed my eye was diff. sometimes in mirror/photos so I went to Tilganga then did diagnosis then dr.Rohit Saiju of Tilganga said we need to do surgery and cut your bone of upper part, it is critical, if tumor turns to be malignant then it will be sad news, and there is risk of Vision loss, etc. they scared me, told everything that will help them to escape if things don’t go right later. But I said ok fine, there is no option, I have to do, I have another eye if sth goes bad. Looking back now, I can only salute that 17 yrs old brave guy. And operation happened, I was unconscious, they even showed tumor mass taken out. And thankfully, tumor was benign. Then slowly I focused on recovery, for 3 yrs I found nothing strange, but slowly I saw that same eye a bit different/strange, during this whole 3 yrs during follow-up with same doctor he did basic eye checks, and said it’s fine, you can come after 3 months like that. I mean he didn’t know or didn’t tell that I had tumor recurrence again. I went to diagnosis again and mri showed tumor again, I was shocked/speechless. That doc said we need to redo surgery, and said like this kinda tumor comes again, but I asked question like should I then again come back in few years to again do, that is hard, I had no idea at this time that operation could have been better, I just cried like why me god? Why did tumor reoccur? I thought enough, I am not doing operation here, I am going India, then researched then went to Aiims Delhi, there same as yours case, doctors said that it could have been success in first surgery, it’s a capsule kinda tumor and you can easily take out, how did that doc fail, kinda like that, only then I knew Dr. Saiju could have done better or could have recommended to India if he couldn’t, or could have diagnosed faster in second time, he failed in all this, I was more shocked than angry as it was my decision to do surgery with him, and mistakes could happen from any doctor so I thought like that. Then I discussed with many doctors, researched so much on that area that one doc even said did you also study medicine? So I dig deep, analyzed experience/capacity of all possible surgeons, as I knew only one thing: The only thing I have under control is to choose best surgeon, as after surgery they can do nothing, they will only tell it happens because of this case/surgery, so only that 2-3 hrs of surgery matters. I was so daring that once I asked to one so reputed doctor in face that, how many such my case kinda operations did you do till now? How confident are you, what are your thinkings, etc. because it’s my right, my life. I finally thought to do surgery with one reputed doctor dr.A.K. Grover , then he did operate. And i am 24 now, it’s 3 yrs after that second surgery, till now going good after that surgery, much sincere thanks to dr. Grover from my heart. Hopefully, I will be fine. Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies.|||I read the whole story and im glad that she has recovered and now you both are relieved and have normal life once again.

At least we should double check by visiting some government hospitals like bir or teaching, where we can get some honest advice.",

When a student isn’t even 18 and ends up with a grown teacher, that’s grooming, not romance. And even when they are 18 or 20, it’s still unethical. The emotional manipulation and power dynamic don’t disappear just because it’s legal and they gave consent. Stop normalizing this. It’s not love, it’s control wrapped in a fake story of consent. If you think it’s fine, maybe ask yourself why you’re okay excusing manipulation disguised as love.",

RSP kicked off talks to unite ‘alternative forces’ before the polls ([source](https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2025/10/31/rsp-kicks-off-talks-to-unite-alternative-forces-before-polls)).  Ganesh Karki was assigned to discuss with Balen and his team. Kumar Ben also went to Nakkhu and met with Rabi, who said he would be happy to step down as party chairman if Balen were to lead. RSP also conducted a seminar/discussion meeting with all new faces and alternative forces last week.  Instead of placing all the blame and pressure on RSP, why don’t we hold Balen, Sumana, and Kulman accountable? What have they done to unite new and alternative forces? How are they leading this movement? What have they accomplished so far? Why are they not agreeing to work with the same team?  If RSP were to be blamed for all this, then why didn’t Sumana and Balen join Kulman’s party? Pointing fingers at Rabi alone doesn’t solve anything. Even if Rabi is removed, can Sagar, Sumana, or others compensate for the votes and support he was supposed to bring?",

            "body": "Popularity not equal to VOTES!  Looking at the new parties these days, everyone wants to cash-in their popularity for political bargaining and/or seats!  But popularity does not equal to votes in politics! Not everyone can pull of RSP 2079.     New political movement, party formation and making worthwhile impact are not easy. You can't just rely on your popularity and expect to win seats just so......it requires lots and lots of campaigning, hard work, strategy, wit and most importantly LUCK.   You absolutely need to have: - excellent support-base --from cities to rural areas, youths to old gens, inside the country and diaspora... - in-depth understanding of politics - unweavering political will - charisma to gather followers - a large team of candidates, experts and councellers, from politics to economics, education...etc and every domain - gather and lead like-minded and excellent candidates - excellent PR network... - etc..etc  And yet you need rarest of LUCK to actually win anything consequential.   So I am confused with the plan of Kulman/Sumana/Balen/Harka/Sagar...etc.  Kulman opened up a party.  He may win one seat (i honestly hope he does regardless of the party), but isn't that all? If he is so hell-bent on politics and leading a party/movement himself, why is he in the government in the first place? Should he be out in the field campainging, having at least 4-5 gatherings per day, meeting with prospective candidates and uniting them, discussing and planning campaign strategies..etc..etc.   And superheros Balen/Sumana/Sagar dont seem to have even made up their mind yet!  The election is in 3-4 months. Clueless!   Harka at least seem to be trying/working hard. I bet he will actually get more votes then Kulman/Balen/Sumana... but wont make must of an impact either. Desperately trying to recruit any consequential person, even Punya Gautam ?? And that toodidn't even work!!   Popularity != VOTES   What Ravi/RSP pulled off in 2079 was a miracle. And that doesn't happen frequently and easily.  I honestly believe only RSP or RSP-led coalition has a realistic chance to challenge the established parties.   So I am going to: - Vote RSP for Samanupatik - Vote RSP if good/strong RSP candidtaes - Vote Balen/Kulman/Sumana/Sagar/Harka personally only over weak/unknown RSP candidates",

I learned that this course(BMS) is only provided by TU and what's even more tacky is it's only in my college. I believe this major originally came from India. But the college I am in is community college and is pretty reputed as well. But I checked TU's official website there was no hint of this course and I even emailed them about it and didn't get a reply. I choosed this course because I wasn't sure if I would stay in the country or no but now I will be staying here. And it is said that for masters abroad it doesn't really matter which particular course I took in bachelor so why hurdle with BBA or BBM. So, I am suspicious that if this will hinder any future growth.",

And 12th is alll about organic ,yup almost all.The same teacher will teach u organic chem till the last day of 12th ,yup u heard it right.However, its not the matter to be intimidated .Personally i practiced organic each day,some day i took a break obviously .So, ya u should revise it from the first chapter. My organic chap teacher was amazing ,calm and gave notes and also provided ideas to make it easier to study while i was in KMC . If u dont have those ,study from youtube.  Ya and i got an overall 3.8  and ya forgot to mention, If u dont understand a topic than u have youtube .To be frankly honest,i used to watch a lecture from youtube everytime a topic or concept or terms even if its subtle. Without the teachers from youtube, well i wouldnt have scored even a 3.6. Only a handful number of teachers teaches the best while others simply recite what is shown on the slides.|||Chem is all about consistency daily class na oadhako concept bujni ho ani al din aagadi mop up garera ni sakkincha|||Ma ta cheat chorera pass vako ho yaar :)|||Well 11 is not like 10, you have to study, hunatw ma ni ekdin agadi padera +2 katako ho, but chemistry ko lagi chai you need to revise reaction haru.

MAA KASSAM YESAI MA BIGRINE HO!  tried and tested, got like 68 in chemistry first term|||bro same chem ruined my streak too. what helped me was making reaction charts by topic and revising them daily for 10 mins. patterns started clicking after a while, especially when i wrote them not just read.|||same mann also i got hit by karma didnt study shi and now im gonna choke in re exams cuz i dont understand anything|||I think and I felt as well that chemistry is kinda easy if you know how the chemical reactions work rather than just memorizing it. Focus on breaking compound molecules and try to react with another compound like naturally. You will be able to do every reactions|||school level shit is still easy. You just gotta study consistently|||Go to a shop and buy a lot of sticky notes. Write a reaction on one side and and information on other aide. Carry it wherever you go and memorize the hell out of it even when you are shititng on the toilet . There are no other reasons. (There is one impossible technique, its called memory palace or method of loci which i used to pass my masters)|||Lekhera padhne bani basala ahile dekhi nai 12 ma Kam lagxa Inorganic ko reactions haru sab rough copy ma lekhera padhne gara + organic haru ni lekherai gara ani catalyst haru ,name of the compound pani yad garne gara lekherai Tespaxi hera kasari audaina chemistry|||ma ni testai thiye tara chem ko chai you need to start organic first j bhaye ni    din ko jabarjasti bhaye ni 10 oota reaction garirakha ani it gets easier.    scored chem ma A+ cause hamro organic chemistry ko sir le daily bihana ko class ma reaction lekhna dinthyo",

            "body": "Hello! Myself (20M), along with two of my friends and our families, visited Nepal during the Diwali holidays. We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8. Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)  (used chatgpt to refine my text)  (attached a video of sarangkot as i was mesmerised by the view)",

            "comments": "First of all, commendations for such well written and structured post, that too with all the additional info at the end. (For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".  During off season, it's easily manageable & fun because less people & no need to queue to get a selfie with some peculiar rock or a waterfall, butttttt, it's called off season for a reason, the majestic views might be compromised or not, it's a gamble.|||Dhulikhel rock view point, man why would they take you there! 🤦  Are you speaking 'Bangla'?|||Bhaktapur is the jewel 🙏|||kudos to camera work- given the health condition of your mum- i recommend you sepnd more time in chitwan- janakpur and lumbini-- may be 3 days each city- it covers pilgrimage and cultural aspect-|||Others have already suggested you some places to visit, so I just want to give you one important piece of advice. I have a relative who works as a travel agent, and he told me that many agents and shopkeepers tend to focus more on foreign tourists than on Indians, because they believe they can overcharge them easily. So, bro, be careful  there are many thugs and dishonest agents who might try to charge you extra. **Bargaining is the key.**  In almost every corner, if a hotel recommends you a place or a service, remember that the hotel usually gets a commission from it. The entire system in tourist areas like Thamel often runs on commission-based deals. So it’s always better to ask genuine locals for suggestions rather than agents pretending to be locals. In Thamel, you’ll find many such people who act friendly but are just trying to make money off tourists.  If you have Nepali friends, you can travel cheaply and safely otherwise, just be a bit cautious and smart while dealing with people. To be honest, a few uneducated people here may dislike Indian tourists, and that’s an unfortunate reality. But overall, we Nepalese are known to be **very hospitable, kind, and friendly**, and most people will treat you with respect and warmth. Just stay alert, bargain wisely, and you’ll have a wonderful time in Nepal.|||Bro, timi Darjeeling bata vayae taa, yo sabai Normal hola ni taa timro laagi taa?? 🤔|||where did u take that video bro? was it in pokhara?|||You skipped Bandipur en route Pokhara from Kathmandu.

Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||Have a great time here, enjoy it and after you go back to your home just think is it fair to take land of the country who provided you with such great hospitality?|||[deleted]",

            "heading": "A Night in Kathmandu — The Unexpected Bar Scam Experience",
            "body": "After completing our last destination in Kathmandu, our Nepal trip was almost coming to an end. We had planned to spend the evening shopping around local markets before heading back home.  But as luck would have it, the weather had other plans. It started raining heavily, and most of us decided to cancel the shopping plan and stay inside the bus, waiting for the rain to stop.  While we were sitting there, a Nepali guy — sort of an agent — climbed onto the bus. He started chatting with my friend, talking about dance bars, attractive girls, and fun nightlife in Kathmandu. My friends, curious and excited to explore something different, agreed to check it out. So, we went along with him from Gaushala Chowk.  ⸻  The Arrival  We reached around 7 PM. The place looked more like a small pub or lounge — dim lights, loud music, and barely anyone inside. There were just two Indian guys with a few Nepali girls, sitting at a corner table, smoking hukka and drinking.  We were a group of 12 people, so we took two tables (6 on each). I sat on the other table, while two Nepali girls from the bar joined my friends’ table. They were friendly, laughing, and talking in Hindi — chit chat, masti, jokes — sab Hindi mein.  After a few minutes, the girls said they wanted to have a drink. The same agent who brought us there told my friend, “Sir, bas 400 Rs ka juice hai.” They wrote the order on a small paper chit, took my friend’s signature, and soon two juices were served.  That’s how their system worked — write on paper, take a sign, and serve the order.  We also ordered 4 beers for ourselves. Out of 12, only 4 were drinking — the rest were just watching the dance show.  ⸻  The Show Begins  Soon, Nepali girls started dancing on Hindi songs, followed by a couple of male dancers and another girl joining the floor. The vibe felt okay at first — typical dance bar scene, music, lights, drinks.  But after the girls finished their drinks, a waiter brought a hukka pot to our table without even asking. We immediately told him to take it away. The girls got off from our table soon after that.  ⸻  Something Felt Off  After finishing the beer, me and my friend went to the washroom. There we saw those same two Indian guys who were sitting earlier — looked like North Indians (maybe Delhi or Haryana). They seemed tense, arguing with the bar staff.  Out of curiosity, I asked one of them, “Bhai kya hua?” He said, “Dekho na bhai, kuch khaya nahi, thoda piya sirf — aur bill 32,000 Nepali bana diya!”  That one line was enough to send chills down my spine.  I quickly went back to my table and told my friend what had happened. We immediately asked for our bill — but the damage was already done.  ⸻  The Shocking Bill  The bill came in Nepali currency: \t•\t4 Beers = 4000 \t•\t2 Drinks for girls = 8000 \t•\t23% Service charge = 2760 Total = 14,760 NRS (≈ 9,840 INR)  My friend was shocked. He said, “Ladies drink price to 400 bola tha,” but by then, the agent who brought us there had vanished.  There was no point arguing — the staff was large in number, and the situation didn’t look safe. Finally, we settled the bill for 9,500 INR and left the place quietly.  ⸻  What Happened Next  As we were leaving, I noticed those two Indian guys being locked in a small office, surrounded by bar staff demanding they hand over their mobiles or belongings to pay off the bill.  I felt genuinely bad for them — and guilty for not sitting at my friend’s table earlier, or checking the price list before signing that paper chit.  But at the same time, I was thankful that we escaped early — with just a 4-beer loss instead of a full-blown scam.  ⸻  The Reality Behind the Glamour  While we were stepping out, a few more Nepali guys entered, and immediately all the bar girls — including those who had been at our table — went to join them, smoking hukka and ordering drinks.  Just watching that, I could only think: “Isko to aaj 40,000–50,000 ka chuna lagne wala hai.”  ⸻  Final Thoughts  Our Nepal trip overall was beautiful — from Pokhara’s serenity to the spiritual vibe of Pashupatinath. But this one Kathmandu nightlife experience was a reminder that not everything that glitters is gold.  If you ever plan to explore nightlife in Kathmandu, be cautious: \t•\tNever sign anything you don’t understand. \t•\tAlways ask for the price upfront. \t•\tAnd if something feels shady — walk away.  This experience became a story to remember — not for the fun, but for the lesson it taught us.",

            "body": "A husband and wife posted a joyful TikTok video celebrating their new Australian citizenship. Soon after, Nepali users flooded the comment section with harsh criticism.  Some accused them of abandoning Nepal, saying things like “They should be banned from entering Nepal” or “Their Nepali citizenship must be immediately revoked.” Others even called them traitors and insulted the Nepali government for allowing it.  But in a surprising twist, it was later revealed that the couple weren’t Nepali at all—they were from Sri Lanka and had never even been to Nepal.  When the truth came out, both the Sri Lankan couple and the Nepali commenters were left shocked.  This incident, sparked merely by assumptions based on their Nepali looking faces, became a reflection of how quickly and blindly many react online without knowing the full story.",

But that’s not the main thing. Right after hearing the diagnosis, the he( the patient) then started asking about social health services or options for free treatment. Interestingly, he had a brand-new iPhone 17 Pro Max and he looked like someone who could easily afford the treatment. And remember, this is a government hospital, where the treatment cost is already minimal. It really makes me think why do people become so money-conscious when it comes to health? People will happily spend over a lakh on the latest phone, or thousands on dinners and movies. But when it comes to a doctor's fee of Rs. 1000 or a life-changing surgery, it's suddenly \"too much.\" My main thought wasn't even about the doctor's fee (though we do train for 10-15 years). It was about fairness. The subsidized system is a lifeline for people who genuinely have nothing. When someone who can comfortably afford to pay uses those limited resources, they might be taking that spot from someone who truly can't. Am I seeing this the wrong way? I'm genuinely curious to hear what others think about this.",

There are passionate guys, i know. The road looks greener on the other side, be it during CEE or during MBBS. The only thing that keeps most med students going in Nepal is the fact that you can earn a shitton load of money abroad. But that too, requires a lot of investment and efforts. I've seen a lot of students studying in paying who are doing academically good, but regret joining MBBS. I've seen scholars failing every internal exams too. I'm active on the indianmedschool subreddit and that's a different depressing tale of there.   If you want to study in paying and your yearly household savings is not more than 8L, DON'T. If you want to study in scholarship and you got your name enlisted, go for it. But it you want to drop a year just to be in this rat-race again, I would not suggest you to. Find passion in something, but medicine is not the place if you can't see yourself being anything other than a doctor. It is said easier than done, but medicine is definitely hard. That's why medics are respected everywhere (except india and nepal ofcourse).  Anyways, I wanted to share that doctors study 5.5 years, like no other course within medicine. There used to be a time when intern doctors were looked up to. But now, due to the fact that everyone has spread the wisdom that intern doctors have no hands-on experience, everyone looks down upon them. Even the nurses and pharmacists. Not trying to demean any course, but the volume others read in 2 years is presented to MBBS students to memorise within 1 year (judging by the volume).   Being from a well-to do family, I was always presented to anyone new as a \"future doc\". So, it never came to my mind that I could do anything other than medicine. Medicine itself is not bad. But the fact that there is no value in Nepal even after completing your MBBS has started to hit me too. There are 2 category of people I see around me. One who enjoy life, dont study much, search for shortcuts to pass the exams as if they joined medicine just to pass exams. Others who study well, are depressed, have not much social life and regret joining this course. Had I gone abroad, I wouldn't have had to anticipate my parents' money each month just for survival, I would've been able to send some cash home and uplift our overall standard. That thing haunts me, and I think it will be so till I get into MD or residency. But the fact that you can earn six figures is what is keeping me sane. I deeply love medicine, the fact that whatever I'm studying is somebody's life, each case I observe today, I might get to encounter it someday is what keeps me motivated. But I don't thing I can last long just like how my friends threw away standard textbooks to rot memorize fasttrack. I'm scared I might do it too, the question is: How long can I last?",

If you are creative, are rich plus you are really smart, Dont join medicine.  It is not the best strategy for the earn big life. Its for a stable, middle class to upper middle class life.  I see people joining medicine for that reason. No. If you are the right person, a businessman , IT person >>> Doctor. Thats why I am studying both as well in the side despite being a Doctor.   ----- But being a Doctor has this high ceiling. If You become an HA, or a nurse or a pharmacist. No high celing. When you take the MBBS route, the sky is the limit. There are many oppurtunities, many line of work you can get into, easy to travel and relocate etc.   --- Is the whole field of MBBS in Nepal doomed? No.  Its a battle.  Some people , ho they are victims. Medicine victimizes many. Residency can be toxic. Many do suicide attempts and so on. Auta battle ma k huncha? Does everyone die? Afai bujnus.  There is the other side as well. Not many get to experience it. But its also a case of luck, how well connected you are, how smart you are, not just book smart. Also getting a job is not that hard compared to others. From the start, you have this sense of being respected, earning decent (its just the start). The idea is you earn big as your experience and avlue increases.  When people dream of MBBS , this part is what they are dreaming of. But what they dont realize is its a battle. Afu victimize vayera a life long addictions dekhi self harm  dekhi liyera testo ma pani gaincha. Many do. Reality. But many also come alive, fit and fine.   But objective measures ma herni vaye, if you want a an upper middle class life style, stable, always needed, sense of meaning and purpose,  not just money, a chance to be a leader for patients, juniors, nurses, Doctor is okay. You are kinda the apex of healthcare.   But if you want to earn big -- Business, IT, Finance. But only if you are very very smart.  Dont know about other professions, but I know each has their own good and bad sides. You choose based on your own goals and needs.|||As another medstudent my suggestion is just don't listen to medinfluencers for your career. And don't get into it for money. Yes you will earn decent money but almost 6 to 7 years after you start you will see your friends who took a different route earn, enjoy their youth while you're still just maybe a little bit more then halfway across your journey .You will rot away in a room with Davidson and Bailey and it will be stressful. So take it only if you can see yourself through gritty stress during exams and almost spending 2 to 3 hrs everyday dedicated to your studies. It's not all sad though its chaotic fun as fuck too so weigh your pros and cons don't listen to others advice just think if you are ready to give up 6 to 7 years purely to studies. Now most med aspirants think that they will go abroad after their finals but let me give you a fair bit of warning and that is its the hardest course you can choose to go abroad you will not only be competing with Nepalese for USMLE or AMC or PLAB it will be best of the best across the globe . And on top of that just your intellect won't be helping you, going abroad is costly as fuck and it will be around 3 4 more years before you start getting paid. So think while everyone else is settling down after they enjoyed their youth you will still be a burden on your parents for about the next decade. So choose this course wisely and my only advice is you can coarse through it yes its brutal but its doable but only choose it for the service you will be providing to serve people around you if you just choose it for money then perhaps it would be dumb as there are many options where you earn more and early. This career here you won't vet to enjoy vacations , birthdays long holidays as much as other careers . And to end everyone doing whatever be it MBBS or anything else after results will make it in life so chin up everyone.|||Like MBBS padadai you can actually tutor Cee aspirant lots of money making oppuetunity, My own cousin is in 2nd year in this Dashain he earned so much!

It's free for life, will just cost you higher upfront (mine cost 8k). I recharged Rs.500 and it ran for 2 years. For advanced features(that require internet or calls), you will need to recharge often, maybe like 1500/year. But for basic tracking, Rs.500 will basically run the GPS until your validity expires, I think. You could even recharge lower - just upto the point where you maximize your validity.

After that, you might consider upgrading the RAM. However, some older laptops have limits on how much RAM they support. For example, my old Sony Vaio can handle up to 8GB, while an older Dell model only supports a maximum of 4GB. You can easily check online by searching your laptop model to find out if it supports SSD upgrades and the maximum RAM capacity.

I love your work! Kudos to you!!|||Do people want this? I'm not sure maybe they do maybe they dont, I love the UI of the website, but what do you offer more than existing sites other than cleaner UI? I like that you have SIP investment and Commodity like Gold/Silver, but if this is your edge over others then  you need to realise your uniqueness or your \"edge\" can be easily replicated.  I think your product would be more valuable if you can do some kind of analysis on the market itself but then that is a difficult thing because there are again a lot of websites that do basic analysis like nepsealpha. For basic portfolio summary there is a widget called \"Advanced Widgets for MeroShare\"  which gives you all those numbers like P/L%, daily P/L, overall P/L and the good thing is you dont need to pay anything or upload the data anywhere, it's integrated into the browser.  If this is done as a hobby project to show case your FE skills, well then it's a good one, but if this is done with the intention that people may use it, well then, ermm im not sure there's anything special for people to upload their data into your website.  If you want people to use this, maybe also incorporate some kind of advanced market analysis, and make sure it's thoroughly tested! Research about the market gap, atleast make sure you offer more than what nepsealpha does.|||damn eti saaro vibe code hanna milxa aile  daami xa bro|||> not a dev by trade  Hits different. Same boat.

Malai taw interview onsite hunxa ki vanera tension parethyo as mero clz rw tyo office alli tada xa but then got to know that interview was done through google meet.  And I joined the call Hr was on time (well already a green flag for me ) and then another senior was also on the call.  After basic convo the senior dai asked me uestion about my project. Interesting was I didnt do project on React but they didnt care becayse they say that for joining that internship you need to have drive than just knowldege of 100+ languages.  And then he started to ask me question like Why this ? Did you think of another approach ? Why or Why not ?  Now as I was confident in my project I could answer them quite easily. Then they said I was  a candidate with high probability and I woukd get response no matter my outcome.  Tespaxi I mentioned whats hybrid ? Then they say as college ko timing haru milauna garo hunxa so we dont force candidate people to come on fix time and that was such a relief as mero college alli tadai parxa and exams haru ni sochna paryo.  And the final question I asked why its called bootcamp but not internship ans they say internship vanyp vane final year ko matra auxan but this is for anyone interested wether its just student who crossed 12 or passed masters. Interested jati plus who show initiative they plan to take those.  Dar laerathyo because I thought its was a perfect fit for me. And now sigh of relief I just got an email that I was selected.

On Reddit alone, there are tons of posts every day from folks offering web dev services or showing off their projects.  It makes sense, web development seems approachable at first. You pick up some HTML, CSS, and maybe some framework , and you can already build something that looks good. But once you dig a little deeper, things start getting complicated fast. Real web development isn’t just about putting pages together; it’s about understanding APIs, scalability, system design, security, and how all the moving parts connect behind the scenes.  A lot of beginners stop at that surface level and call themselves “web developers,” but frameworks can only take you so far. The real value comes from knowing what’s happening under the hood, that’s what separates someone who just builds websites from someone who builds reliable, scalable systems.  And honestly, it’s worth going even further. Explore backend engineering, cloud computing, DevOps, automation, or data systems. Those areas don’t just make you a better developer , they help you understand how the whole ecosystem works, beyond just how to make something look good on the screen.",

She is trying to reach a demographic whose brains are rotted by deviant thoughts because of the constant stream of porn injected into their veins. It's attention-seeking for sure, but involving children into her bullshit is wrong. Take it up a notch and think if she was making OF content but with children next to her. It's not that making sexual content (or content in general with certain undertone) is wrong, it's wrong when you involve children into shit that they don't have the capacity to understand.

Do you even know what does that word mean? There is something called affection and being affectionate. Timro ghar xeuma weren't there ximeki didi when you were small? Werent they affectionate with you? She didn't do a hard kiss. It was a soft kiss. For women to be close to any kids it's normal. They're emotional and affectionate towards babies. If they're not, they're mentally abnormal. I don't wanna say anything about reddit women but to my understanding most girls here in reddit already have hatred towards men or some sort of toxicity. I've never seen any healthy feminine girls in reddit from nepal. They usually join to stress out or rant or listen to rants.  ​And this thread is a perfect example of that. People are just looking for something to be outraged about.  ​Not every single interaction between an adult and a kid has to be sexualized. That's a very Western way of thinking, and everyone here is quick to import it. It's all about intent. You can clearly see from the video there was no malicious or sexual intent. It was a brief, caring gesture, exactly like an aunt or an older sister would give.  ​Besides, the context of the video itself matters. As the song and caption show, it's clearly meant to be lighthearted, a 'loke.'  People are taking a 5-second clip out of context, projecting their own dirty minds onto it, and trying to make a huge issue out of nothing. Everyone needs to get a grip and stop looking for problems where there are none.  Also, In Nepal, the level of conservativeness depends on caste/community. For brahmins even dating seems taboo but while for other it's pretty much common. Even choice of clothes, what they dress, what they reveal, everything is totally dependent on their caste. She's seems Newar and I've seen newars being way open than that.   TLDR: Video is perfectly normal as it should, it's on social media, people are projecting their own fantasies over reality. It's all about your upbringing and it reflects you didn't get enough love from your elder sisters during childhood.  PS: Even a single touch can be bad and whole bape cosplay can be beautiful.  It's all about person and intent, remember that.|||what the helllll|||nah. I thought it was mom and son tiktok|||Poor kid.

This is an insane lifestyle, nothing less than Dahal family. If a local ward chairperson can amass such wealth, those at the level of IGP and mantri have looted us taxpayers a hundred times higher.   This guy is apparently the son of nepal’s most corrupt chief justice Gopal Parajuli, btw he had to resign because of fake citizenship. Openly flexing luxury cars and watches on social media. Arent we tired of them by now?  The poor doesnt have access to proper ambulances, meanwhile ankit khand the son of nepali citizenship seller balkrishna khand takes helicopters, everywhere he goes! Manju Khand ko chorra.  Shaniddhya Shaudharya Khanal, son of Ex IGP of APF, Shailendra Khanal. What is the salary of these officers to be able to afford these lifestyles?  Garima Paudel daughter of ex minister devendra paudel proudly faunting her international lifestyle. International tours, comfortable international lifestyle, business class travels while the poor are forced to use tuins for daily commute. Are we not tired of this? This is why we are exposing corruption in nepal  Sangita Pahadi has recently been sued by CIAA for 3 arba scam. Their children have been living a lavish lifestyle since ages. No shame. 30 hajar ko talab, 30 ota gharbari. Finish them all.  We found another generational corruption run. Khushi Pandey is the granddaughter of Ramesh Nath Pandey, he was the FORMER MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, INDUSTRY, TOURISM, ENVIRONMENT and COMMUNICATIONS. She is also the daughter of Nischal Nath Pandey, who served as a government employee during ramesh nath pandey’s long ministerial run. Look at this damn lifestyle. How is it possible to afford all of this when the family has nothing except civil service for the past 50 years?  Supriya Bohora, granddaughter of Deepak Bohora, former member of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and the House of Representatives, has recently come under the spotlight. Deepak Bohora was known for his strong hand in the Panchayat system and his unwavering support for the monarchy. His political journey is remembered not only for his allegiance to authoritarian structures but also for allegations of corruption. One of the most prominent accusations linked to Deepak Bohora is the illegal consumption of land where the Fun Park ice rink in Bhadrakali Road now stands. What was once a symbol of political maneuvering and alleged misappropriation of public assets is now being flaunted by his granddaughter as a mark of achievement, raising questions about how the spoils of corruption are normalized across generations.  Anusandhan khai ta comrade? Granddaughter living in europe to protect all the money stored in swiss bank. EXPOSE THEM ALL!  Most corrupted ones are the generals from police special dsp and upwards.👮 I have seen them using massive funds to get their sons n daughters abroad or in prestigious schools by paying hefty fees. their home looks like that of a king , literally narayanhiti jastai same and their sons n daughters are living the life of luxuries carrying iphones and designer dresses and bags . Actually what these officer do is they heavily launder money and budgets which comes to their department . They practice “milijuli khane” . They also take funds from criminals to manage cases. Then they use these funds to bribe politicians for getting higher post like dsp to dig , from DIG to IG and so on . They conduct massive weddings and ceremonies spending crore of rupees. this is same with army generals as well.  `-`  **TLDR - REGISTER AND CONVINCE YOUR FRIENDS, COUSINS IF THEY STILL HAVE NOT MADE VOTER ID**  Read an interesting blog on this. Hamro lato politician le k bujhla esto. Chorra chorri lai instagram delete garna chai layo dhanna teti chai buddhi raicha.  >The corrupt ruling elites of the Third World, who used to steal everything, destroy economies, and create hell for their own populations, have now added one more thing: they openly allow their children to flaunt the spoils of corruption on Instagram, right in front of their starving people. Something previous generations never witnessed.  >The new rich have never gone through a revolution so they don't understand not to flaunt their wealth like the old bourgeoisie who have witnessed multiple revolutions throughout history. It's ironic that the Maoists instigated a revolution yet the children of said Maoists are now living the luxurious lives posting everything not knowing whats simmering in society. It looks like at least the kids have understood not to flaunt their stolen wealth to avoid angering the masses.  >In any ways what happened in Nepal highlights a trend I’ve discussed on here before, which is how Instagram utterly radicalizes youth heavy developing societies.  >Suddenly you as a poor but striving young man or woman have full visibility to how the elite/upper class of your country + diaspora live, but you have little access or hope of ever living the same for the most part. The impact of this on mental health, societal stability, and also fertility rates cannot be underestimated.  >Imagine going from a society with five state channels and a few cable options in the 2000s to Instagram in just five years. That’s what happened to all of South Asia + Africa + a lot of Latin America.  These guys were being exposed to the lifestyles of the baddie daughters and Chad sons of the fucktards ruling their country,  >You see their trip to Japan and London for the summer. See their parties at their elite mansions in the most posh suburbs and neighborhoods and you realize you’re just fucked and not getting there ever, your country simply does not have the mechanism to enable that for you, you’re unemployed even despite a college degree.  >**Upward mobility is like a pressure valve. Nepal never had that. The elites taxed people, slapped tariffs on imports & ignored building institutions that foster upward mobility. Instead, they assumed that sending their populace to the Middle East would be sufficient.**  >What’s surprising is how the corrupt politicians allow their kids to flaunt stolen wealth so brazenly. Kids of politicians in developing countries flaunting their extravagant lifestyles on public Instagram accounts is so foolhardy. Exposure to social media and bragging about your luxurious lifestyle risks fuelling resentment and envy.  >It's how uprisings have always been. Old bourgeoisie don't show off their wealth like those Nepali elites did. This behavior is what got both the iranian and russian noble families killed. This also happened in Mongolia earlier this year, although less dramatically. The Prime Minister had to step down due to protests that kicked off because his son was showing off his luxury holidays and clothes too much on Instagram.",

My maiju works full time job, earn probably more than my mama and she has more tiring job than mama, they have 2 kids they are around 6 and 12. She wakes up prepare breakfast, then prepare/arrange everything for lunch, come back home from work and is greeted with dirty dishes in the sink, then she makes dinner. Amma cannot do much but mama on the other hand doesn't even bother to wash few dishes how the fuck is this fair. I mentioned the earning part cause some of you might think they are the PROVIDERS or whatever. She has exam tomorrow and hasn't even got one hour to herself to study. When will this stop? Why there is no equal contribution when its both of their house. All my mama are same. I am soo mad. I am here doing dishes and cooking thinking it will ease her off even if its for few days.",

            "heading": "A Two-Year Journey Through My Wife's Tumor Diagnosis, Surgeries, and Recovery: What I Wish I Knew and What I Learned",
            "body": "I want to share my wife’s story because I hope it helps someone who might be going through something similar. It's been a tough two years for us, and I’ve learned a lot the hard way.  After 2 years of getting married to my wife. In December 2023, we got the news no one ever wants to hear. My wife had a tumor near her pituitary gland (large lobulated heterogeneously and vividly enhancing mass). The MRI came back showing it was about 33x29x26 mm basically, the size of a small egg. I don’t think I’ll ever forget that moment. The world felt like it stopped spinning, and I had no idea what to do.  I immediately went into panic mode and started researching everything I could. We were ready to go to Delhi and see the top neurosurgeons, but then a relative suggested we see Dr. Gopal Raman Sharma at Nepal Mediciti for suggestion and consultation. Honestly, we were skeptical, but we decided to give it a shot.  When we met Dr. Sharma, it felt different from the start. There was no sugarcoating it, he was very serious, and made it clear that the tumor was dangerous. He kept saying it had to come out immediately, that something could happen to my wife *right now* if we didn’t do anything. I won’t lie, his words hit hard. He made it sound like we didn’t have time to think.  So, without really questioning much, we agreed. We trusted him. The surgery was scheduled for the very next day, and everything moved so fast. We didn’t even have time to breathe.  The surgery took around 2 hours. When he came out, Dr. Sharma told me, “We removed what we could, but there was a lot of blood loss. It was complicated.” And that was it. There was no explanation beyond that. When I tried asking how much of the tumor had been removed, he didn’t really answer me. At that point, I should’ve pressed more, but I was just in shock. My wife was kept in the ICU for two days, and we just had to wait.  A few weeks later, she came home, but we were still uneasy. He dragged us for an year saying there was nothing that can be done. We just wait and watch. \"Wait and watch\" thats all we heard from him for an year. It didn’t feel like it was over, not by a long shot. So, we did another MRI in December 2024, and when we got the results, I couldn’t believe my eyes. The tumor hadn’t shrunk. At all. It was still about 34x26x25 mm.  I was furious. I felt like we’d just been taken for a ride. All that money, all that stress, all that hope, and nothing had changed. I was angry at Dr. Gopal Raman Sharma and his assistant Prashant for not being more upfront, and angry at myself for not questioning more. But, as much as I wanted to blame someone, I knew anger wasn’t going to fix anything. So, I decided to take a step back, calm down, and get a second opinion.  That’s when we decided to go to AIIMS in India. We met with a neurosurgeon there who really took the time to explain everything. He did MRI and looked into everything in detail. He told us that the diagnosis was wrongly done by Dr. Gopal Raman Sharma at mediciti. That was a tough pill to swallow, but it also gave us some clarity. He told us that the tumor is made up of nerves and its jelly like. At least now we understood why things hadn’t gone as planned. The second surgery was scheduled right away. It was a long one, about 8-10 hours. My wife lost almost 5 liters of blood, but the team handled it. They managed to remove 97% of the tumor.  After the surgery, Neurosurgeon at AIIMS told us that the first surgery didn’t work because Dr. Sharma had tried to remove the tumor from wrong place and also tried three different places, but couldn’t reach it properly. In fact, the repeated attempts had damaged the tumor, making it harder to remove. The tumor was now scattered, which is why it was so difficult to get rid of.  It wasn’t easy. She was in the ICU for 7 hours after the surgery, but eventually, she was moved to a private room, and after 3 days, we were able to go home. It was a huge relief, but there was still the small matter of the remaining 3% of the tumor.  We had to come back to India for gamma knife radiation to get rid of the rest. The procedure took about 5 hours, but in the end, it was successful. The last of the tumor was gone. We just returned to kathmandu today.  Now, my wife is doing well. She’s back to her normal self, and for the first time in over two years, I feel like we can finally breathe easy. It’s been an incredibly tough journey. I’ve never felt so much responsibility in my life. As the eldest son, you carry that weight, and it can take a toll on you in ways you don’t expect.  But looking back, there are a few things I’ve learned that I wish I’d known from the start:  1. **Don’t rush decisions**. We let urgency take over in the beginning, and that clouded our judgment. Don’t be afraid to take a step back and think things through. 2. **Get a second opinion**. I can’t stress this enough. Don’t just trust the first doctor you see, no matter how confident they sound. If something doesn’t feel right, ask around. get **Get third and forth opinion** too. 3. **Trust yourself and your instincts**. In those early days, I didn’t trust my gut as much as I should have. Trust your intuition and don’t be afraid to ask questions—even when the doctor seems like they’re the expert. 4. **It’s okay to be angry, but don’t let it control you**. I was angry at Dr. Sharma, and I still feel that way sometimes. But holding onto that anger didn’t do anyone any good. It’s better to focus on moving forward. 5. **Life is unpredictable**. You never know what’s around the corner. But even in the toughest times, there’s always hope.  We’re finally able to move forward with our lives. I’m grateful my wife is healthy again, and I’m thankful for the lessons this journey has taught me. I just want to share this so that anyone who’s in a similar situation knows that they’re not alone. Keep fighting, keep questioning, and trust that things can get better.",

Some lack knowledge, others just don’t care about patient. Most MBBS graduates can’t even get license in first try. There’s also little consequence for doctor mistake because of doctor shortage in Nepal and all doctors protesting if anyone is prosecuted. Even doctors I know suggest to go to India or other country for any serious health issue. |||>After the surgery, Neurosurgeon at AIIMS told us that the first surgery didn’t work because Dr. Sharma had tried to remove the tumor from wrong place and also tried three different places, but couldn’t reach it properly. In fact, the repeated attempts had damaged the tumor, making it harder to remove. The tumor was now scattered, which is why it was so difficult to get rid of.  why Nepali doctors are like this, afule nasakne ho bhane.. aru doctor lai kina refer gardainan.. aru ko jindagi sanga kina helchekrai garchan ..  tetro time, pain.. mental health.. paisa.. tesai kharcha bhayena..  complain garna mildaina teo Dr. Sharma lai ??     good to hear your wife is healthy now and back to normal life|||So happy for you and your wife, Dai. It takes a huge toll on your mental health when someone you love is ill. This is equivalent to getting a new life. Also, I'm proud of you on how you handled the situation and how much you love your wife bhanera.|||Tapaiko jasto critical case ta thiyena mero. Back ko surgery hunu parne thiyo.

A Nepali doctor rushed us into surgery, which didn’t remove the tumor and gave us only “wait and watch” for a year. The tumor didn’t shrink. We went to AIIMS India, where we learned the first diagnosis and surgical approach were incorrect. AIIMS surgeons did an 8–10 hour surgery, removed \\~97% of the tumor, and then gamma-knife radiation cleared the remaining 3%. After two years of fear, stress, and uncertainty, my wife is finally healthy. Biggest lessons: don’t rush medical decisions, always get multiple opinions, trust your instincts, ask questions, and stay hopeful.  If you want, I can also help you turn your story into a **Reddit-friendly version**, or prepare titles like:  * *“2-Year Brain Tumor Journey: Why You Must Always Get a Second Opinion”* * *“Thought We Lost Everything. Turns Out We Just Needed One Better Doctor.”*  Want a more emotional version, shorter version, or a version without doctor names?|||Hope u are feeling better, brother. Vauju lai mero tarfa bata 1kg anar dinu hai|||If you have money, don't ever do anything serious medical stuff in Nepal. What happened to OP is unfortunately common. My aunt had a similar experience where the doc said immediate surgery but her family decided to wait and instead went straight to Thailand. The doc over there said that it WASN'T even serious. Some meds and she was perfectly fine. Btw this was more than a decade ago. She's healthy as an ox. Not saying that all doctors are bad here but anecdotes like OPs are more common than I realised.|||I think I had very similar case like your wife. A bit long but you can read. When I was 17 I had tumor in my right eye, I noticed my eye was diff. sometimes in mirror/photos so I went to Tilganga then did diagnosis then dr.Rohit Saiju of Tilganga said we need to do surgery and cut your bone of upper part, it is critical, if tumor turns to be malignant then it will be sad news, and there is risk of Vision loss, etc. they scared me, told everything that will help them to escape if things don’t go right later. But I said ok fine, there is no option, I have to do, I have another eye if sth goes bad. Looking back now, I can only salute that 17 yrs old brave guy. And operation happened, I was unconscious, they even showed tumor mass taken out. And thankfully, tumor was benign. Then slowly I focused on recovery, for 3 yrs I found nothing strange, but slowly I saw that same eye a bit different/strange, during this whole 3 yrs during follow-up with same doctor he did basic eye checks, and said it’s fine, you can come after 3 months like that. I mean he didn’t know or didn’t tell that I had tumor recurrence again. I went to diagnosis again and mri showed tumor again, I was shocked/speechless. That doc said we need to redo surgery, and said like this kinda tumor comes again, but I asked question like should I then again come back in few years to again do, that is hard, I had no idea at this time that operation could have been better, I just cried like why me god? Why did tumor reoccur? I thought enough, I am not doing operation here, I am going India, then researched then went to Aiims Delhi, there same as yours case, doctors said that it could have been success in first surgery, it’s a capsule kinda tumor and you can easily take out, how did that doc fail, kinda like that, only then I knew Dr. Saiju could have done better or could have recommended to India if he couldn’t, or could have diagnosed faster in second time, he failed in all this, I was more shocked than angry as it was my decision to do surgery with him, and mistakes could happen from any doctor so I thought like that. Then I discussed with many doctors, researched so much on that area that one doc even said did you also study medicine? So I dig deep, analyzed experience/capacity of all possible surgeons, as I knew only one thing: The only thing I have under control is to choose best surgeon, as after surgery they can do nothing, they will only tell it happens because of this case/surgery, so only that 2-3 hrs of surgery matters. I was so daring that once I asked to one so reputed doctor in face that, how many such my case kinda operations did you do till now? How confident are you, what are your thinkings, etc. because it’s my right, my life. I finally thought to do surgery with one reputed doctor dr.A.K. Grover , then he did operate. And i am 24 now, it’s 3 yrs after that second surgery, till now going good after that surgery, much sincere thanks to dr. Grover from my heart. Hopefully, I will be fine. Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies.|||I read the whole story and im glad that she has recovered and now you both are relieved and have normal life once again.

At least we should double check by visiting some government hospitals like bir or teaching, where we can get some honest advice.",

They see things online, get influenced, and start imitating behaviors they don’t really understand. It’s like skipping from grade 1 to grade 5 without learning anything in between the foundation just isn’t there.Many girls also get drawn to guys who talk like they have everything figured out confident, ambitious, “world conqueror” types. But often (not always), those guys turn out to be narcissistic and end up leaving or abandoning them. Unfortunately, most girls don’t realize it until it’s too late.So it’s important to be careful. If someone seems too good to be true, take a step back. Check their background, maybe look at their social media or talk to their close friends (without telling them). If he seems genuine, great but never rush into trust. A lot of the victims you see in those kinds of videos ended up there because they trusted the wrong person too quickly so i think this is important for every girls to not view every guys as bad guy and not trust every guy who approach like they know it all.|||nepal k*anda in big 2025? f no.|||this sub is being used to train horniest nepali ai|||Don’t go to those sites or stop watching these kind of shit bro.

Attention within the Nepali Congress–CPN-UML alliance has now shifted to deciding who will be appointed the next Chief Election Commissioner.  >With Congress obtaining the governor’s post, UML leaders have argued that the position of Chief Election Commissioner should go to their party. Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba had previously stated during a conversation with journalists on May 6 that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had agreed to allow Nepali Congress to choose the central bank governor.  >In line with that agreement, Dr. Biswo Nath Poudel was appointed governor on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Election Commission has been operating under an acting head for over a month. Ram Prasad Bhandari, who himself is facing a legal challenge in the Supreme Court over his own appointment, has been serving as acting chief commissioner.  >Currently, the commission is operating with only three out of its mandated five officials. One chief commissioner and one commissioner position remain vacant. The commission had seen a sweeping round of appointments when the previous Oli-led government amended the Constitutional Council Act via ordinance and appointed 52 officials to various constitutional bodies in a single move.|||Jaba parxa rati taba budi tati|||hell nahhhhh.  was thinking of making it at lalitpur office.

Equality means giving both genders the same rights, responsibilities, and opportunities, not extra privileges. A separate seat for women might have been created for safety and comfort when society was not safe for them, but if we are moving toward real equality, then continuing this only shows that women still need protection instead of being seen as capable and strong. True equality should mean creating a society where everyone feels safe and respected without needing special seats or treatment.|||Equality vanera male Lai chai khoi ta equality?K mahila seat matrai hunu paryo aba yr (pregnant,old age,periods) lady Lai as a basic manners le jasley ni help garnu parxa but male Lai chai gaaro hunna ra ??Ik female Lai ni garo hunxa but male Lai chai hunna ani ?Correct me if I am wrong always ready to learn...",

I barely made it onto the second nomination list and ended up in a college that’s just “okay.” But honestly, I don’t blame the college I blame myself. There were others who got into better colleges than me, even though they had lower grades. So, I can’t say grades don’t matter, but the first term really showed me how tough things can get. I know I need to improve, and I’m determined to do so. I got an A+ in Computer Science, even though I didn’t study as much as I should have. I love Computer Science and building a lot of skills in the field. Right now, though, I’ve decided to take a break from everything every extracurricular activity, including learning JavaScript, React, and other things. I know I probably shouldn’t, but I feel like it’s necessary for now. Starting today, I’ll be locking my phone and using my laptop strictly for studying. I need to focus on my second terminal exams, and it’s time to set boundaries.If I’ve said anything wrong, I apologize. I don’t blame anyone or anything but myself, even though I studied harder than I ever have. My lack of proper note-taking has cost me. Right now, I’m just looking for advice from seniors who have gone through this and come back stronger, getting good results in the end.",

Reasoning: ABCD is a parallelogram (from the figure). Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. That means the diagonal AC and BD intersect each other at point P such that AP = PC and BP = PD. Now, in the parallelogram, Triangles △APD and △BPQ are on the same base PD (or same diagonal portion) and they lie between the same parallel lines AD and BC. Hence, Area of △APD = Area of △BPQ.|||Trauma, dhattt|||ABD and ABQ has same area. now ABP is common triangle in both of them. Thus remaining halves i.e sodheko duita triangles should have same area 🔥😉",

My organic chap teacher was amazing ,calm and gave notes and also provided ideas to make it easier to study while i was in KMC . If u dont have those ,study from youtube.  Ya and i got an overall 3.8  and ya forgot to mention, If u dont understand a topic than u have youtube .To be frankly honest,i used to watch a lecture from youtube everytime a topic or concept or terms even if its subtle. Without the teachers from youtube, well i wouldnt have scored even a 3.6.

And for, writing section. I think there are three section. 7,8 and 10 marks question . For 7 and 8 marks writing write 150-200 words with right content. If the content is good you will get marks And for 10 marks 250-300 is recommended. But this doesnot imply everywhere. Its totally up to teachers how they veiw .

Limited variety of linking words  repeating “However” or “Moreover.” Abrupt transitions  jumping between ideas with no smooth link.

I learned that this course(BMS) is only provided by TU and what's even more tacky is it's only in my college. I believe this major originally came from India. But the college I am in is community college and is pretty reputed as well. But I checked TU's official website there was no hint of this course and I even emailed them about it and didn't get a reply. I choosed this course because I wasn't sure if I would stay in the country or no but now I will be staying here.

They outsource their jobs to poorer countries where people are happy to accept a meager $2800/month, whereas a domestic worker in the US would have to be paid at least double that. So the company saves 50% of their costs pretty much immediately. Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to. If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.   I hope the US government puts into place policies that make outsourcing jobs much more expensive/restrictive than hiring domestic workers.|||Bhik me kuch dedo humko bhaisahab|||What you planning to do with the money saved|||what do you recommend to get the skill on ?|||What courses/sites helped you the most in developing your skills?|||Daily work hour?|||is it that common to find a remote job that pays in dollars or is it very rare? just curious bcz planning to study cs|||Is it too little too late to start at final bachelors year.

            "body": "Hello! Myself (20M), along with two of my friends and our families, visited Nepal during the Diwali holidays. We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8. Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)

            "comments": "First of all, commendations for such well written and structured post, that too with all the additional info at the end. (For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".

I have a relative who works as a travel agent, and he told me that many agents and shopkeepers tend to focus more on foreign tourists than on Indians, because they believe they can overcharge them easily. So, bro, be careful  there are many thugs and dishonest agents who might try to charge you extra. **Bargaining is the key.**  In almost every corner, if a hotel recommends you a place or a service, remember that the hotel usually gets a commission from it. The entire system in tourist areas like Thamel often runs on commission-based deals. So it’s always better to ask genuine locals for suggestions rather than agents pretending to be locals. In Thamel, you’ll find many such people who act friendly but are just trying to make money off tourists.  If you have Nepali friends, you can travel cheaply and safely otherwise, just be a bit cautious and smart while dealing with people. To be honest, a few uneducated people here may dislike Indian tourists, and that’s an unfortunate reality. But overall, we Nepalese are known to be **very hospitable, kind, and friendly**, and most people will treat you with respect and warmth. Just stay alert, bargain wisely, and you’ll have a wonderful time in Nepal.|||Bro, timi Darjeeling bata vayae taa, yo sabai Normal hola ni taa timro laagi taa?? 🤔|||where did u take that video bro? was it in pokhara?|||You skipped Bandipur en route Pokhara from Kathmandu.

Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||Have a great time here, enjoy it and after you go back to your home just think is it fair to take land of the country who provided you with such great hospitality?|||[deleted]",

I'm no expert but I  do come with a few facts . The actual knowledge I feel like I know it better than anyone here. Not bragging .  So take it as a means of education. I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it. Capitalism and communism don't antagonises each other. They coexist in a healthy modern economy.|||Ask a regular min wage worker in the US if capitalism is working for them.

            "heading": "A Night in Kathmandu — The Unexpected Bar Scam Experience",
            "body": "After completing our last destination in Kathmandu, our Nepal trip was almost coming to an end. We had planned to spend the evening shopping around local markets before heading back home.  But as luck would have it, the weather had other plans. It started raining heavily, and most of us decided to cancel the shopping plan and stay inside the bus, waiting for the rain to stop.  While we were sitting there, a Nepali guy — sort of an agent — climbed onto the bus. He started chatting with my friend, talking about dance bars, attractive girls, and fun nightlife in Kathmandu. My friends, curious and excited to explore something different, agreed to check it out. So, we went along with him from Gaushala Chowk.  ⸻  The Arrival  We reached around 7 PM. The place looked more like a small pub or lounge — dim lights, loud music, and barely anyone inside. There were just two Indian guys with a few Nepali girls, sitting at a corner table, smoking hukka and drinking.  We were a group of 12 people, so we took two tables (6 on each). I sat on the other table, while two Nepali girls from the bar joined my friends’ table. They were friendly, laughing, and talking in Hindi — chit chat, masti, jokes — sab Hindi mein.  After a few minutes, the girls said they wanted to have a drink. The same agent who brought us there told my friend, “Sir, bas 400 Rs ka juice hai.” They wrote the order on a small paper chit, took my friend’s signature, and soon two juices were served.  That’s how their system worked — write on paper, take a sign, and serve the order.  We also ordered 4 beers for ourselves. Out of 12, only 4 were drinking — the rest were just watching the dance show.  ⸻  The Show Begins  Soon, Nepali girls started dancing on Hindi songs, followed by a couple of male dancers and another girl joining the floor. The vibe felt okay at first — typical dance bar scene, music, lights, drinks.  But after the girls finished their drinks, a waiter brought a hukka pot to our table without even asking. We immediately told him to take it away. The girls got off from our table soon after that.  ⸻  Something Felt Off  After finishing the beer, me and my friend went to the washroom. There we saw those same two Indian guys who were sitting earlier — looked like North Indians (maybe Delhi or Haryana). They seemed tense, arguing with the bar staff.  Out of curiosity, I asked one of them, “Bhai kya hua?” He said, “Dekho na bhai, kuch khaya nahi, thoda piya sirf — aur bill 32,000 Nepali bana diya!”  That one line was enough to send chills down my spine.  I quickly went back to my table and told my friend what had happened. We immediately asked for our bill — but the damage was already done.  ⸻  The Shocking Bill  The bill came in Nepali currency: \t•\t4 Beers = 4000 \t•\t2 Drinks for girls = 8000 \t•\t23% Service charge = 2760 Total = 14,760 NRS (≈ 9,840 INR)  My friend was shocked. He said, “Ladies drink price to 400 bola tha,” but by then, the agent who brought us there had vanished.  There was no point arguing — the staff was large in number, and the situation didn’t look safe. Finally, we settled the bill for 9,500 INR and left the place quietly.  ⸻  What Happened Next  As we were leaving, I noticed those two Indian guys being locked in a small office, surrounded by bar staff demanding they hand over their mobiles or belongings to pay off the bill.  I felt genuinely bad for them — and guilty for not sitting at my friend’s table earlier, or checking the price list before signing that paper chit.  But at the same time, I was thankful that we escaped early — with just a 4-beer loss instead of a full-blown scam.  ⸻  The Reality Behind the Glamour  While we were stepping out, a few more Nepali guys entered, and immediately all the bar girls — including those who had been at our table — went to join them, smoking hukka and ordering drinks.  Just watching that, I could only think: “Isko to aaj 40,000–50,000 ka chuna lagne wala hai.”  ⸻  Final Thoughts  Our Nepal trip overall was beautiful — from Pokhara’s serenity to the spiritual vibe of Pashupatinath. But this one Kathmandu nightlife experience was a reminder that not everything that glitters is gold.  If you ever plan to explore nightlife in Kathmandu, be cautious: \t•\tNever sign anything you don’t understand. \t•\tAlways ask for the price upfront. \t•\tAnd if something feels shady — walk away.  This experience became a story to remember — not for the fun, but for the lesson it taught us.",

From your iPhone / iPad:  Open Find My → Devices → tap your Mac.  Options: Play Sound, Directions (if location available), Mark as Lost (Lock), Erase This Device.   From any browser:  Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID → Find iPhone → select your Mac from All Devices and use the same options.   What each option does:  Play Sound — helps if it’s nearby.  Mark as Lost / Lock — remotely locks the Mac with a passcode and shows your message/phone number on screen. It also disables Apple Pay.  Erase Mac — wipes data. Use only if you’re sure you can’t get it back; after erasing you can no longer track it.   2) If Find My was not enabled  Tracking is much harder. Still:  Check your Google account (if Chrome was signed in) for recent device activity.  Check services you used (Dropbox, Microsoft, email) for recent logins — they sometimes reveal IP/location.  Look at any linked accounts for device lists under your Apple ID (appleid.apple.com → Devices) — it shows serial numbers and last seen info.   3) Gather identifying info (do this now)  Serial number of the Mac (found on original box/receipt, Apple invoice, or appleid.apple.com under your devices).

After that, you might consider upgrading the RAM. However, some older laptops have limits on how much RAM they support. For example, my old Sony Vaio can handle up to 8GB, while an older Dell model only supports a maximum of 4GB. You can easily check online by searching your laptop model to find out if it supports SSD upgrades and the maximum RAM capacity.  Also note that in Nepal the shop are asking upward of 2-3,000 NPR for each 4gb RAM module, claiming a 6-month warranty.   Since my brother studies in India, he managed to get me an 4/4gb - total of 8GB RAM for a much cheaper price, around 249 INR.   Best of luck|||firstly that laptop looks ancient. and youre running windows. you can optimize windows to run faster on low end devices but its still windows, its shit. adding RAM will help. you will soon find out that you have a lot of processes running in the background (coz windows) and will cause you problems during multi process workloads. if youre up for it install a linux mint or ubuntu. get some more RAM and if your laptop supports it an SSD|||buy a ssd 128 gb, insert 4 gb ram. that will be the cheapest way to make laptop faster.|||Let your laptop rest in peace.|||go Linux.

So here's the dilemma: I’m wondering if I should still go back and get a Bachelor's degree, it feels that not having a degree is dragging me behind or if my current work experience and skills are enough to keep growing in my career.

At the very least she is knowingly or unknowingly grooming kids. This is neither an isolated event nor out of context. Almost everything she has posted has a clear sexual undertone. She is trying to reach a demographic whose brains are rotted by deviant thoughts because of the constant stream of porn injected into their veins. It's attention-seeking for sure, but involving children into her bullshit is wrong. Take it up a notch and think if she was making OF content but with children next to her. It's not that making sexual content (or content in general with certain undertone) is wrong, it's wrong when you involve children into shit that they don't have the capacity to understand. Let's say she does not understand that involving children in her sexually-charged videos is wrong, is that supposed to automatically make it right? Ignorance, \"oopise, I didn't know\", \"it's not a big deal\", \"she probably doesn't know\" is not a defense.

Do you even know what does that word mean? There is something called affection and being affectionate. Timro ghar xeuma weren't there ximeki didi when you were small? Werent they affectionate with you? She didn't do a hard kiss. It was a soft kiss. For women to be close to any kids it's normal. They're emotional and affectionate towards babies. If they're not, they're mentally abnormal. I don't wanna say anything about reddit women but to my understanding most girls here in reddit already have hatred towards men or some sort of toxicity. I've never seen any healthy feminine girls in reddit from nepal. They usually join to stress out or rant or listen to rants.  ​And this thread is a perfect example of that. People are just looking for something to be outraged about.  ​Not every single interaction between an adult and a kid has to be sexualized. That's a very Western way of thinking, and everyone here is quick to import it. It's all about intent. You can clearly see from the video there was no malicious or sexual intent. It was a brief, caring gesture, exactly like an aunt or an older sister would give.  ​Besides, the context of the video itself matters. As the song and caption show, it's clearly meant to be lighthearted, a 'loke.'  People are taking a 5-second clip out of context, projecting their own dirty minds onto it, and trying to make a huge issue out of nothing. Everyone needs to get a grip and stop looking for problems where there are none.  Also, In Nepal, the level of conservativeness depends on caste/community. For brahmins even dating seems taboo but while for other it's pretty much common. Even choice of clothes, what they dress, what they reveal, everything is totally dependent on their caste. She's seems Newar and I've seen newars being way open than that.   TLDR: Video is perfectly normal as it should, it's on social media, people are projecting their own fantasies over reality. It's all about your upbringing and it reflects you didn't get enough love from your elder sisters during childhood.  PS: Even a single touch can be bad and whole bape cosplay can be beautiful.  It's all about person and intent, remember that.|||what the helllll|||nah. I thought it was mom and son tiktok|||Poor kid.

When you cut off the expectations, you feel more happier and contained with yourself. You begin to prioritize, be selfish and learn more about people. I have the same situation. Accept that I left home 2 years back. First year was really difficult. This year also, I shifted in a new city. My aunty just bought me dry ass cookies and call it a day. I begin to hide my birthday and treat myself biryani,  ice cream and stuff. And why just birthday? I try to make my every moment special. I try to treat myself the most special person in this world. And people are getting attracted to me these days. But I don't care at all. I am just focused on my goals. People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within. And people don't understand that simple thing.🤣🤣🤣|||Yesterday it was mine birthday too but same situation.|||Happy belated birthdayyyyy|||mero nii birthday aaudai xaa wish gara la mallai on  November 4 nai birse bro . anyways dhillo bhaye Pani wish gare haii Happy birthday dai/dd|||Happy Belated Birthday <3|||Meroni thyo hijo.

Even those who visit India often are treated as if we’re some kind of threat to the country. Sometimes, I feel it’s because of our weak passport and the way they perceive our country. I’ve heard many disrespectful remarks directed at fellow Nepali travelers, even for the smallest mistakes like something as simple as pressing a thumb incorrectly.|||Mad because they were colonised and we didn't|||Man this is infuriating.

It seemed like they had never seen a Nepalese carrying dollars for travel expenses. After working on cruises for nearly 35 years and traveling extensively across the USA and Europe, he only faced this treatment at Indian airports. As a result, he now completely avoids traveling to or through India.|||Bangladesh airports are worse and their service is shit, but the it is still better.|||Very unfortunate and sorry this happened to you, traveling through India is definitely a terrible experience and I myself have experienced the worst experience of traveling through India for a NRN but just to play devils advocate, Indian government is probably trying to stop any underground routes to US and lot of people travel through South America to US, either way they should be clear on communicating to you why they stopped you and what their process are because they can’t stop someone without proper documentation of why they are stopping someone at the airport.|||Doesn't matter the whole world hates India. I live in Aus and these days the hate sentiments against Indian is too much. Sometimes even I feel bad for them. |||I heard this from my relative; they went to India. It wasn't first time. They knew a hotel used to stay there because it was known. But few weeks ago when they went there, they were told that government has said don't allow any Nepali to stay at any government hotel or lodge!

No, yet most nations frown or ban them from being raised for slaughter.  The same is true here. Cows are important part of their religious or cultural identity for most Nepalese people.

No, frankly I don't care as long as it does not impact humans or the species themselves on a conservation scale.  But I don't think this can or should be implemented nation wide.

We are Hindu majority. Nepalese of all religion are already normalized to not consuming beef, this will start a conflict amongst our own majority. Us not consuming beef has kept Muslims and Christians in low numbers- they are major consumers of beef and send missionaries everywhere to increase their numbers. If there are two similarly sized groups with different people- that will create political conflict and add to our issues. We already see this play out in western countries- they have major political issues around Muslims and recently Indians (who they associate with Hinduism which they've already begun to hate in Canada, and if you a brown Nepali- you are Indian to them) Don't make moves that will drive your own group's numbers low. We have to keep the status quo in regards to issues like this.   Not eating cow has not created any issue that is worth our attention. Focus on tackling actual issues like further eradicating this baun, chettri nonsense which is the bane of Hinduism- we can and are doing it while keeping our culture, traditions and identity.|||just say chamal ko bora ta paako this , visa ni paaulas ni and move on|||So much for a secular nation|||lets eat beef guys",

She is also the daughter of Nischal Nath Pandey, who served as a government employee during ramesh nath pandey’s long ministerial run. Look at this damn lifestyle. How is it possible to afford all of this when the family has nothing except civil service for the past 50 years?  Supriya Bohora, granddaughter of Deepak Bohora, former member of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and the House of Representatives, has recently come under the spotlight. Deepak Bohora was known for his strong hand in the Panchayat system and his unwavering support for the monarchy. His political journey is remembered not only for his allegiance to authoritarian structures but also for allegations of corruption. One of the most prominent accusations linked to Deepak Bohora is the illegal consumption of land where the Fun Park ice rink in Bhadrakali Road now stands. What was once a symbol of political maneuvering and alleged misappropriation of public assets is now being flaunted by his granddaughter as a mark of achievement, raising questions about how the spoils of corruption are normalized across generations.

Actually what these officer do is they heavily launder money and budgets which comes to their department . They practice “milijuli khane” . They also take funds from criminals to manage cases. Then they use these funds to bribe politicians for getting higher post like dsp to dig , from DIG to IG and so on . They conduct massive weddings and ceremonies spending crore of rupees. this is same with army generals as well.  `-`  **TLDR - REGISTER AND CONVINCE YOUR FRIENDS, COUSINS IF THEY STILL HAVE NOT MADE VOTER ID**  Read an interesting blog on this. Hamro lato politician le k bujhla esto. Chorra chorri lai instagram delete garna chai layo dhanna teti chai buddhi raicha.  >The corrupt ruling elites of the Third World, who used to steal everything, destroy economies, and create hell for their own populations, have now added one more thing: they openly allow their children to flaunt the spoils of corruption on Instagram, right in front of their starving people. Something previous generations never witnessed.  >The new rich have never gone through a revolution so they don't understand not to flaunt their wealth like the old bourgeoisie who have witnessed multiple revolutions throughout history. It's ironic that the Maoists instigated a revolution yet the children of said Maoists are now living the luxurious lives posting everything not knowing whats simmering in society. It looks like at least the kids have understood not to flaunt their stolen wealth to avoid angering the masses.  >In any ways what happened in Nepal highlights a trend I’ve discussed on here before, which is how Instagram utterly radicalizes youth heavy developing societies.  >Suddenly you as a poor but striving young man or woman have full visibility to how the elite/upper class of your country + diaspora live, but you have little access or hope of ever living the same for the most part. The impact of this on mental health, societal stability, and also fertility rates cannot be underestimated.  >Imagine going from a society with five state channels and a few cable options in the 2000s to Instagram in just five years. That’s what happened to all of South Asia + Africa + a lot of Latin America.  These guys were being exposed to the lifestyles of the baddie daughters and Chad sons of the fucktards ruling their country,  >You see their trip to Japan and London for the summer. See their parties at their elite mansions in the most posh suburbs and neighborhoods and you realize you’re just fucked and not getting there ever, your country simply does not have the mechanism to enable that for you, you’re unemployed even despite a college degree.  >**Upward mobility is like a pressure valve. Nepal never had that. The elites taxed people, slapped tariffs on imports & ignored building institutions that foster upward mobility. Instead, they assumed that sending their populace to the Middle East would be sufficient.**  >What’s surprising is how the corrupt politicians allow their kids to flaunt stolen wealth so brazenly. Kids of politicians in developing countries flaunting their extravagant lifestyles on public Instagram accounts is so foolhardy. Exposure to social media and bragging about your luxurious lifestyle risks fuelling resentment and envy.  >It's how uprisings have always been. Old bourgeoisie don't show off their wealth like those Nepali elites did. This behavior is what got both the iranian and russian noble families killed. This also happened in Mongolia earlier this year, although less dramatically. The Prime Minister had to step down due to protests that kicked off because his son was showing off his luxury holidays and clothes too much on Instagram.",

Physical punishment is not an appropriate way to communicate with a five‑year‑old.

At the end of the day, even though I scored 3.97 GPA, In the Kathmandu Metro Scholarship exam, I choked. I barely made it onto the second nomination list and ended up in a college that’s just “okay.” But honestly, I don’t blame the college I blame myself. There were others who got into better colleges than me, even though they had lower grades. So, I can’t say grades don’t matter, but the first term really showed me how tough things can get. I know I need to improve, and I’m determined to do so. I got an A+ in Computer Science, even though I didn’t study as much as I should have. I love Computer Science and building a lot of skills in the field. Right now, though, I’ve decided to take a break from everything every extracurricular activity, including learning JavaScript, React, and other things. I know I probably shouldn’t, but I feel like it’s necessary for now. Starting today, I’ll be locking my phone and using my laptop strictly for studying. I need to focus on my second terminal exams, and it’s time to set boundaries.If I’ve said anything wrong, I apologize. I don’t blame anyone or anything but myself, even though I studied harder than I ever have. My lack of proper note-taking has cost me. Right now, I’m just looking for advice from seniors who have gone through this and come back stronger, getting good results in the end.",

Now, in the parallelogram, Triangles △APD and △BPQ are on the same base PD (or same diagonal portion) and they lie between the same parallel lines AD and BC. Hence, Area of △APD = Area of △BPQ.|||Trauma, dhattt|||ABD and ABQ has same area. now ABP is common triangle in both of them.

            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I’ve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don’t know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

The funding that has been availed through Carbon Purchase as well as NGOs and INGOs have also played a critical role. I don't remember exactly, but UNDP or something published a really great report on the success of community forests and improvement of forested areas in Nepal.   Actually Nepal despite everything and has had excellent metrics when it comes to nature and biodiversity conservation.|||Folks who grew up in the 90s may remember efforts put into forest conservation through media. Maha Jodi ko BannPale. Impressionable ads like an old woman carrying doko vari ko daura and wondering “Aja lai ta taryo voli k garne?” We have done a lot in the field of forest and wildlife conservation.

Hamro Community based Forest Preservation program (Samudayik Bann) is a leading example in the world.|||\"Hariyo ban Nepal ko dhan\" massive initiative is Main reason. This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it. You can hear the news for development work and of NEA cannot cut down the trees easily, yup that is because of same strong protective law.|||It’s because of movement of people and reliance on gas, concrete instead of timber.|||No , it’s a result of migration of people from hills to concentrated cities and Terai .

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts. So, yeah definitely a result of afforestation but there is more to this and would be a great topic to delve deep into.|||what about terai ko char koshe jhadi?|||It’s meant to highlight the loss of ice and glaciers.

Nepal still waits.   And many of us wonder: how different might things have been?      If Bipin were from a more powerful nation, would the world have moved faster?   If he held a different passport, would there be answers by now?   If every life were valued equal, would this post even need to exist?      Bipin’s story is not just one of tragedy.   It is a reflection of how quiet lives are often overlooked,   how conflict steals not just people, but peace itself.      We continue to hope.   We continue to speak.

They called the “earn and learn” program an internship, likely just to bypass foreign employment laws. In reality, it was pure exploitation. From what I’ve read, students were made to work five days a week in questionable conditions and study only one. I wouldn’t be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.  I just hope this changes with the new government.|||i thought hamas was fighting gaza right after they kill him i think they just sick isreal PM both are shit they just want control people.. fucking hate hamas|||Sad|||I'm Israeli, sadly his DNA was diagnosed and was believed to die in the first months of the war R.I.P Bipin|||Vayo vayo pugyo,  He is dead, confirmed by Israel and hamas both.

They outsource their jobs to poorer countries where people are happy to accept a meager $2800/month, whereas a domestic worker in the US would have to be paid at least double that.

Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to.

            "body": "Hello! Myself (20M), along with two of my friends and our families, visited Nepal during the Diwali holidays. We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8. Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)  (used chatgpt to refine my text)  (attached a video of sarangkot as i was mesmerised by the view)",

            "comments": "First of all, commendations for such well written and structured post, that too with all the additional info at the end. (For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".

I have a relative who works as a travel agent, and he told me that many agents and shopkeepers tend to focus more on foreign tourists than on Indians, because they believe they can overcharge them easily. So, bro, be careful  there are many thugs and dishonest agents who might try to charge you extra. **Bargaining is the key.**  In almost every corner, if a hotel recommends you a place or a service, remember that the hotel usually gets a commission from it. The entire system in tourist areas like Thamel often runs on commission-based deals. So it’s always better to ask genuine locals for suggestions rather than agents pretending to be locals. In Thamel, you’ll find many such people who act friendly but are just trying to make money off tourists.  If you have Nepali friends, you can travel cheaply and safely otherwise, just be a bit cautious and smart while dealing with people. To be honest, a few uneducated people here may dislike Indian tourists, and that’s an unfortunate reality. But overall, we Nepalese are known to be **very hospitable, kind, and friendly**, and most people will treat you with respect and warmth. Just stay alert, bargain wisely, and you’ll have a wonderful time in Nepal.|||Bro, timi Darjeeling bata vayae taa, yo sabai Normal hola ni taa timro laagi taa?? 🤔|||where did u take that video bro? was it in pokhara?|||You skipped Bandipur en route Pokhara from Kathmandu.

So stunning!|||Kudos for well organized post. Go to Mustang, you can reserve scorpio or take your own vehicle. It will be worth it since you are mesmerised by Sarangkot.  Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||Have a great time here, enjoy it and after you go back to your home just think is it fair to take land of the country who provided you with such great hospitality?|||[deleted]",

While most countries have been struggling with deforestation, Nepal somehow managed to reverse the trend.  A few key reasons:  * **Community Forestry Program** — locals manage and protect their own forests instead of the central government. * **Rural-Urban Migration** — many farmlands were abandoned as people moved to cities or abroad for work, letting nature reclaim them. * **Alternative Energy** — more use of biogas and LPG means less dependence on firewood. * **Reforestation & Conservation** — national parks, reserves, and local planting drives helped too.  Now nearly **45% of Nepal’s total land** is covered by forests — up from around **25% in the early 1990s**.  Pretty wild, right?   What do you think — is community-led management the real key here, or did urban migration play a bigger role?

I'm no expert but I  do come with a few facts . The actual knowledge I feel like I know it better than anyone here. Not bragging .  So take it as a means of education. I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it.

            "heading": "A Night in Kathmandu — The Unexpected Bar Scam Experience",
            "body": "After completing our last destination in Kathmandu, our Nepal trip was almost coming to an end. We had planned to spend the evening shopping around local markets before heading back home.  But as luck would have it, the weather had other plans. It started raining heavily, and most of us decided to cancel the shopping plan and stay inside the bus, waiting for the rain to stop.  While we were sitting there, a Nepali guy — sort of an agent — climbed onto the bus. He started chatting with my friend, talking about dance bars, attractive girls, and fun nightlife in Kathmandu. My friends, curious and excited to explore something different, agreed to check it out. So, we went along with him from Gaushala Chowk.  ⸻  The Arrival  We reached around 7 PM. The place looked more like a small pub or lounge — dim lights, loud music, and barely anyone inside. There were just two Indian guys with a few Nepali girls, sitting at a corner table, smoking hukka and drinking.  We were a group of 12 people, so we took two tables (6 on each). I sat on the other table, while two Nepali girls from the bar joined my friends’ table. They were friendly, laughing, and talking in Hindi — chit chat, masti, jokes — sab Hindi mein.  After a few minutes, the girls said they wanted to have a drink. The same agent who brought us there told my friend, “Sir, bas 400 Rs ka juice hai.” They wrote the order on a small paper chit, took my friend’s signature, and soon two juices were served.  That’s how their system worked — write on paper, take a sign, and serve the order.  We also ordered 4 beers for ourselves. Out of 12, only 4 were drinking — the rest were just watching the dance show.  ⸻  The Show Begins  Soon, Nepali girls started dancing on Hindi songs, followed by a couple of male dancers and another girl joining the floor. The vibe felt okay at first — typical dance bar scene, music, lights, drinks.  But after the girls finished their drinks, a waiter brought a hukka pot to our table without even asking. We immediately told him to take it away. The girls got off from our table soon after that.  ⸻  Something Felt Off  After finishing the beer, me and my friend went to the washroom. There we saw those same two Indian guys who were sitting earlier — looked like North Indians (maybe Delhi or Haryana). They seemed tense, arguing with the bar staff.  Out of curiosity, I asked one of them, “Bhai kya hua?” He said, “Dekho na bhai, kuch khaya nahi, thoda piya sirf — aur bill 32,000 Nepali bana diya!”  That one line was enough to send chills down my spine.  I quickly went back to my table and told my friend what had happened. We immediately asked for our bill — but the damage was already done.  ⸻  The Shocking Bill  The bill came in Nepali currency: \t•\t4 Beers = 4000 \t•\t2 Drinks for girls = 8000 \t•\t23% Service charge = 2760 Total = 14,760 NRS (≈ 9,840 INR)  My friend was shocked. He said, “Ladies drink price to 400 bola tha,” but by then, the agent who brought us there had vanished.  There was no point arguing — the staff was large in number, and the situation didn’t look safe. Finally, we settled the bill for 9,500 INR and left the place quietly.  ⸻  What Happened Next  As we were leaving, I noticed those two Indian guys being locked in a small office, surrounded by bar staff demanding they hand over their mobiles or belongings to pay off the bill.  I felt genuinely bad for them — and guilty for not sitting at my friend’s table earlier, or checking the price list before signing that paper chit.  But at the same time, I was thankful that we escaped early — with just a 4-beer loss instead of a full-blown scam.  ⸻  The Reality Behind the Glamour  While we were stepping out, a few more Nepali guys entered, and immediately all the bar girls — including those who had been at our table — went to join them, smoking hukka and ordering drinks.  Just watching that, I could only think: “Isko to aaj 40,000–50,000 ka chuna lagne wala hai.”  ⸻  Final Thoughts  Our Nepal trip overall was beautiful — from Pokhara’s serenity to the spiritual vibe of Pashupatinath. But this one Kathmandu nightlife experience was a reminder that not everything that glitters is gold.  If you ever plan to explore nightlife in Kathmandu, be cautious: \t•\tNever sign anything you don’t understand. \t•\tAlways ask for the price upfront. \t•\tAnd if something feels shady — walk away.  This experience became a story to remember — not for the fun, but for the lesson it taught us.",

Like, where was all this energy when students were being beaten or when Oli was selling out the country’s interests?  It’s like he selectively targets whoever’s in power now, just to look “anti-establishment,” while conveniently staying silent about the past. If he really cared about truth and justice, he’d call out *all* sides — not just pick easy targets for clout.

You can check statistics over the world, its a real issue. We humans dont respect the native habitants (animals) and this is just one of examples. Like, is the loud sound more important than a divine life (as all life is divine)?  Can that simbolism be expressed in a better way, by singing, instruments etc...  Luckily, as the world is slowly becoming aware of this, so the regulations starts to exist. In many countries there are now regulations that prohibit fireworks and firecrackers, exactly because of this reason (not to mention distress to some humans that exist too..).|||I am so so sorry.

I'm not trying to be rude or to devalue your loss. It must be sad for you, yes, but I feel worse for that rabbit who lost its life because you made it live with humans and could not accommodate its needs. Firecrackers didn't take his life.

From your iPhone / iPad:  Open Find My → Devices → tap your Mac.  Options: Play Sound, Directions (if location available), Mark as Lost (Lock), Erase This Device.   From any browser:  Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID → Find iPhone → select your Mac from All Devices and use the same options.   What each option does:  Play Sound — helps if it’s nearby.  Mark as Lost / Lock — remotely locks the Mac with a passcode and shows your message/phone number on screen. It also disables Apple Pay.  Erase Mac — wipes data. Use only if you’re sure you can’t get it back; after erasing you can no longer track it.   2) If Find My was not enabled  Tracking is much harder. Still:  Check your Google account (if Chrome was signed in) for recent device activity.  Check services you used (Dropbox, Microsoft, email) for recent logins — they sometimes reveal IP/location.  Look at any linked accounts for device lists under your Apple ID (appleid.apple.com → Devices) — it shows serial numbers and last seen info.   3) Gather identifying info (do this now)  Serial number of the Mac (found on original box/receipt, Apple invoice, or appleid.apple.com under your devices).

I used to work for a Nepali Marwari owner here in the US who had around 30 stores under one of the biggest wireless companies in the country. Dude was loaded the brand name itself brought in enough business to make him filthy rich.  But man, the micromanagement was on another level. He believed employees should always be under pressure. Two minutes late? You’d get sent home with 2–3 follow-up emails. He had cameras everywhere and watched every move if you touched your phone for even a second, you’d get an email warning.  We had to message the group chat every time we clocked in, went on break, and clocked out while doing same in an app. It was ridiculous. The managers around him were total yes-men with no real management skills or education, just doing whatever the boss said.  Most of us employees were Nepali, Indian, or other South Asians, and we just tolerated it. But eventually, they started pulling the same nonsense with the white employees constant monitoring, weird punishments, and micromanaging everything. Those folks didn’t stay quiet.  When they complained, he retaliated by transferring them to faraway locations (which, by the way, is illegal in the US I didn’t even know that back then). They ended up suing the company.  After months of legal battles, the owner lost big time. He had to settle for almost $1 million, and worst of all, he lost his business licenses. Now, he can’t make any major business decisions without approval from the state attorney.  Man had everything going for him a successful business, money, connections but greed and micromanagement destroyed it all|||Wow, the folks over at SCN really do seem to be speedrunning labor law violations.

Tech adaptations are wide and quick, but regulation and accountability are close to non-existent. There is also a steep decline in the quality and camaraderie of the developer community.   Ultimately, the possibility and goal of earning well compared to other professions is and has been the motivation for lots of young graduates getting into software/product development/design. With the field now getting more complex and overwhelming to start as a beginner, and the unstable tech-job market, it puts more pressure on newcomers to integrate.  For these kinds of companies (mostly newly started, providing services as consultants for foreign companies), there's a low probability of growing to the scale of other established tech companies in Nepal. But I'm not trying to undermine and paint a negative image here. Rather, it can be the best opportunity and environment for a motivated individual to learn and grow together with team members.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So, here are a couple of points I'd like to suggest to newcomers/students getting into this profession:  * **GROWTH**: Always keep your individual growth as the main motivator. Keep it as a core \"essence\" of being a developer. Comparing yourself with your own past self will help you a lot in the long run. Secondly, a good payslip is always great to have as a +motivator. * **Incremental & Iterative**: Anything you'll learn or want to improve upon will take time. You'll need to make mistakes/errors, analyse why and how they occurred, and do it again with the correction. * **EMPATHY**: It's what most people lack in every field, and I like to believe that people can change. An empathetic co-worker makes the working environment more pleasant just by being in the office. They will see their team members as a collaborator in their work rather than their 'juniors' or just 'people who work under their command'.  If the 'co-worker' or 'supervisor', who'll be involved with your onboarding/daily tasks, lacks any understanding of these aspects, then I believe they're not quite fit for a LEADERSHIP role, despite their years of experience and how much BETTER of a developer they are.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|||[deleted]|||\\#CompanyProfiling   noted!|||This is exactly what happens abroad lol.",

First of all, India has a 1bn population. Given the hostility between the US and china, most of the big tech have their satellite offices in India, and that gets so much of techs from India. Because, people see scope in tech, many Indians go for BTech, CS.  But - how much of tech innovation do you see from India vs China or the US?  There was a time once when you could hire 5 people in India with a budget for 1 in the US. Now that is slowly going away, so many of the tech companies are now expanding in Africa and Latin America.|||Lol I work with Indians in a US company, don't get me wrong there are a lot of quality indians software engineers but this premise about Indians being the only one who are crazy tech talented is a joke, if that was the case we'd see some innovative indian tech company comparable to the ones from China/US.|||'America Kya keheta tha' ?|||Bill Gates also said he would rather hire lazy people to his company because they would find an easier way to do difficult task.|||I once interned at one of the FAANG (now MAANG) companies, and from my experience, I can say without a doubt that Indians play a massive role in the top American tech firms. They’ve become an inseparable part of the U.S. IT industry a huge portion of the real engineering work is done by them. These companies rely heavily on Indian talent, and because of that, Indian Americans have grown to become quite influential, even in U.S. politics. It’s no surprise that they’re now the highest-earning ethnic group in the entire country.  I remember one senior engineer I worked with a German once told me, *“Indian Americans are the 21st-century Jews of America.”* That line stuck with me.  But it does make you wonder if Indians are so talented, why isn’t India as developed as the U.S.? The main issue is the lack of a strong support system and consistent government backing for innovation and startups. For a long time, India didn’t create the right environment to make full use of its skilled people.  Now, about whether India is catching up to China in tech not quite yet. Chinese engineers are incredibly skilled, and China still has a big edge in infrastructure, funding, and startup ecosystems. Right now, India sits at number three, behind the U.S. and China, in the global tech scene. But give it another 20–25 years, and India could very well take the second spot, right after China.  That said, India’s future looks bright. The liberalization policies and the country’s strong emphasis on education have built a solid foundation. Institutions like the IITs, AIIMS, and IIMs have produced some of the best minds in engineering, medicine, and business. These people are driving not just India’s growth but also global innovation. With an open economy, a thriving startup culture, and millions of ambitious young people, India is steadily moving toward becoming one of the leading technology and economic powers of the world behind China.|||Is there another Microsoft in China though?|||India chai haina China le chai banauxa arko MS    They are good at creating and that works too   India on other hand will send huge skilled resources tara banauna chai sakdaina hai   India ko IT market thulo xa    ani China ko le ta duniya nai chalya xa hai   reminded of some so called nepali techfluencers haru    Nepal lai IT hub banayera tech revolution lyaune    some dude from NASIT (shitty association of IT comanies of Nepal)|||Well Indians are great at tech that's a fact we can't deny that.

You will find Nepali, Iranian, Indian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, and others working in the US.  From my experience, I can tell you that the Chinese are the most competent ones. My advisor is Chinese, and she is so demanding and well-versed that I can't explain. Indians don't even come close to their skills and competence. So, to answer no, they aren't.|||“People believe anything when it’s put between quotation marks.”   — *Abraham Linkon*|||India's vaunted software industry has outsourced the least technologically demanding and most labor-intensive parts of the European and American software industries. The reality is that India lacks internet giants, nor does it have widely used software applications. Even the major software applications developed domestically are from the US. While you could argue that Indians participated in the development of these applications, it's still not Indian software. This isn't entirely bad, however. The internet industry is dominated by only two major players: the US and China. Even Europe and Japan have seen their internet industries and talent drained by the US. For example, in the electric vehicle industry, Chinese electric vehicle companies are internet giants, while German electric vehicle companies are industrial giants. Germany's lack of internet talent forces it to partner with Chinese companies for technology, whereas 30 years ago, China partnered with German automakers due to a lack of technology. Before his death, Henry Kissinger expressed concern about Europe's extreme lack of long-term strategic planning. Many Europeans still fail to grasp this reality, their thinking still mired in outdated Cold War thinking, which sees a Soviet Union as the scapegoat for all their mistakes. India and many other countries haven't fared any better than Europe.|||Bro been working with Indians for last 2 years. 90% of them are \"Kaam chorr\".|||1. Indians are indeed good at replicating pre-existing products. 2. With a population of 1.4 Billion - India has the market  for growth not just for tech companies but any international company looking to increase their revenues (CAGR and what not). 3.

Confident xaina vanya you can take it to repair store.|||ashambhav|||If the laptop can be upgraded to an SSD, it will improve the boot time and make it somewhat faster. After that, you might consider upgrading the RAM. However, some older laptops have limits on how much RAM they support. For example, my old Sony Vaio can handle up to 8GB, while an older Dell model only supports a maximum of 4GB. You can easily check online by searching your laptop model to find out if it supports SSD upgrades and the maximum RAM capacity.  Also note that in Nepal the shop are asking upward of 2-3,000 NPR for each 4gb RAM module, claiming a 6-month warranty.   Since my brother studies in India, he managed to get me an 4/4gb - total of 8GB RAM for a much cheaper price, around 249 INR.   Best of luck|||firstly that laptop looks ancient. and youre running windows. you can optimize windows to run faster on low end devices but its still windows, its shit. adding RAM will help. you will soon find out that you have a lot of processes running in the background (coz windows) and will cause you problems during multi process workloads. if youre up for it install a linux mint or ubuntu. get some more RAM and if your laptop supports it an SSD|||buy a ssd 128 gb, insert 4 gb ram. that will be the cheapest way to make laptop faster.|||Let your laptop rest in peace.|||go Linux.

I earn in lakhs even with just a few years of experience, which I’m grateful for, but I can’t help wondering how long this will last.  Sure, I could aim for higher-paying roles or even start my own company, but honestly, that feels too risky right now. The market doesn’t seem very promising, and the uncertainty makes it hard to plan for the future.  At the same time, I know this routine: waking up early, going to work every day, coming home late, getting two days off won’t stay exciting forever. Sometimes I feel like I’m just running on autopilot.  Part of me envies people with government jobs. The pay might be lower, but there’s stability, no pressure to constantly learn new tech, and no fear of layoffs. Just a simple, secure, and peaceful life.  Does anyone else feel the same way? How do you deal with the uncertainty of IT jobs here?",

All the work to make someone else rich and with rapid growth of AI, job uncertainty is at it's peak. Already done with corporate.

Nepali local companies are too exploiting. Finding a remote job is not easy either. Everyday you learn new things apply to jobs and think good will happen. The pay in nepali company just sucks they pressurize employees and then in return you get 25-30k per month. One company even had a clause of 10 lakhs fine if you work in direct or indirect competition to that company for one year. Doesn't direct indirect means every tech company exist ?

Everyone was told not to mix, so families did the matchmaking. Also, Nepal actually has more women than men, so statistically it’s not a supply issue, even without arranged marriages, people will still get married because, well, people are gonna to get married.|||Our society is weird on relationships and all. I agree with this.  Wanna hear something more controversial? If we are deconstructing societal values around marriage then women will have it harder than men because society today places implicit \"value\" in women. I know it sounds like red pill bs, but women can use (arranged) marriage for upwards mobility, men can't.  The solution to that is workplace equality, but that's easier said than done. But a lot of women don't even want that. So arranged marriage is a compromise between women who don't wanna get involved in the workforce and the men OP described. Op is unaware of the kind of women who agree to arranged marriage, so they think getting rid of arranged marriage will disproportionately affect men.|||https://preview.redd.it/ay5l0evksfxf1.jpeg?width=498&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12290f0b4e385e82f1aa9d2858ce84863c93fa42  Gender war here we go again|||Remove the concept of Nepali women marrying NRN and green card holders, and you’ll see how easily Nepali women will settle for the same type of men that this post is describing.|||Can't relate.

Marriage is a two way street. I can also say that a lot of women have inflated egos but I'm not gonna make such statements.   People need to understand that when two people live together, both need to compromise a bit. What they compromise on and how much depends on their partners.  This post is extremely one sided and not representative of reality because love marriages are almost as common as arranged marriage. Some communities have more, others less.   Also, if arranged marriages are removed from societies, women would need to get married to someone who's not yet settled in life. If not, they'd have to marry someone who's much older or wait till they're in their late 20s - mid 30s. Almost nobody is well settled in their careers in their 20s.|||Omg, why men get so much hate for no reason let them live a peaceful life leave them alone|||https://preview.redd.it/mgw54f3ymgxf1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=2354d343c7a3e21eecae47b92b774715cd28c2a1  at least comeup with some originality and authencity.

To further clarify:   Upper echelon men and women mostly date at their level of wealth, attractiveness and power.  Average men and women will date on their level as well but an average women has higher chance of dating upper echelon of men and women in comparison to average men.   Lower echelon men and women also date each other most of the time but lower echelon women also have higher chance of dating average men and women in comparison to lower echelon men.  This should not be about man vs women if we are  in a relatively good society than Nepal but we are not in a equal society.

Also, if men don't get married, women automatically don't get married too.|||This is why I believe in dowry concept it might sound rude but this is what it is. Since, most of the people have their past life and multiple relationships even before marriage these days. And that relation sometimes seems so so deeply rooted that it becomes difficult to forget. Some are involved in extramarital affairs as well. Then there's bitterness in the present married life and relations with family of husband. Now assume if her husband was single till the marriage for a perfect wife but what he got? Nothing but mental tension afterwards.   The psychological impact a normal people can't even bear. And sometimes girls even planned to marry a rich guy just for money and then divorce and get alimony which she'll spend with her lover. Sometimes, she even plans to kill her husband to get out of that thing. This is freaking crazy how people are thinking this way. I'm not justifying that she's the only culprit here but also her ex cum present hidden lover is equally involved.   Now in this situation it's better to live unmarried or take a grand amount as collateral if you are doing an arranged marriage. So that it will be easier for alimony.   You might call me bias but the thing is different. If we alternate the situation like a groom will have to leave his home and settle with bride forever, and if alimony should be paid by the bride after getting divorced, yeah a groom should have to give dowry as the collateral.   Fun fact: Love marriages crash faster than arranged ones. It’s like 1 v 1 versus many v many, so too many players in the latter provide team support 😅 during clashes.

At the very least she is knowingly or unknowingly grooming kids. This is neither an isolated event nor out of context. Almost everything she has posted has a clear sexual undertone. She is trying to reach a demographic whose brains are rotted by deviant thoughts because of the constant stream of porn injected into their veins. It's attention-seeking for sure, but involving children into her bullshit is wrong. Take it up a notch and think if she was making OF content but with children next to her. It's not that making sexual content (or content in general with certain undertone) is wrong, it's wrong when you involve children into shit that they don't have the capacity to understand. Let's say she does not understand that involving children in her sexually-charged videos is wrong, is that supposed to automatically make it right? Ignorance, \"oopise, I didn't know\", \"it's not a big deal\", \"she probably doesn't know\" is not a defense. Idiots.|||fuck this shit and everyone who post & include their kids in photo and videos and make them do trend and shit for social media reach & clicks. #keepChildrenAwayFromSocialMedia|||Xee lip maa kiss tah atti vayenah rah jati nai bachha ko maya lagay ni|||[deleted]|||Views ko lagi k k garxan hau 😭 he is Just a kid  Isn't she supposed to teach good and bad to that kid|||here is her [profile](https://www.tiktok.com/@samishres345?_r=1&_t=ZS-91DbiR5twtW)|||Ok but why the lips chuppa to a student?

Do you even know what does that word mean? There is something called affection and being affectionate. Timro ghar xeuma weren't there ximeki didi when you were small? Werent they affectionate with you? She didn't do a hard kiss. It was a soft kiss. For women to be close to any kids it's normal. They're emotional and affectionate towards babies. If they're not, they're mentally abnormal. I don't wanna say anything about reddit women but to my understanding most girls here in reddit already have hatred towards men or some sort of toxicity. I've never seen any healthy feminine girls in reddit from nepal. They usually join to stress out or rant or listen to rants.  ​And this thread is a perfect example of that. People are just looking for something to be outraged about.  ​Not every single interaction between an adult and a kid has to be sexualized. That's a very Western way of thinking, and everyone here is quick to import it. It's all about intent. You can clearly see from the video there was no malicious or sexual intent. It was a brief, caring gesture, exactly like an aunt or an older sister would give.  ​Besides, the context of the video itself matters. As the song and caption show, it's clearly meant to be lighthearted, a 'loke.'  People are taking a 5-second clip out of context, projecting their own dirty minds onto it, and trying to make a huge issue out of nothing. Everyone needs to get a grip and stop looking for problems where there are none.  Also, In Nepal, the level of conservativeness depends on caste/community. For brahmins even dating seems taboo but while for other it's pretty much common. Even choice of clothes, what they dress, what they reveal, everything is totally dependent on their caste. She's seems Newar and I've seen newars being way open than that.   TLDR: Video is perfectly normal as it should, it's on social media, people are projecting their own fantasies over reality. It's all about your upbringing and it reflects you didn't get enough love from your elder sisters during childhood.  PS: Even a single touch can be bad and whole bape cosplay can be beautiful.  It's all about person and intent, remember that.|||what the helllll|||nah. I thought it was mom and son tiktok|||Poor kid.

When you cut off the expectations, you feel more happier and contained with yourself. You begin to prioritize, be selfish and learn more about people. I have the same situation. Accept that I left home 2 years back. First year was really difficult. This year also, I shifted in a new city. My aunty just bought me dry ass cookies and call it a day. I begin to hide my birthday and treat myself biryani,  ice cream and stuff. And why just birthday? I try to make my every moment special. I try to treat myself the most special person in this world. And people are getting attracted to me these days. But I don't care at all. I am just focused on my goals. People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within.

But let me remind you some cases : Maina Sunuwar, Rabi Lammichanne and other where everyone praised the court and claimed justice stood.Even you might know many of the cases  What I find uncomfortably troubling is that  People have been shifting their narrative about the court in whatever comforts them. Literally what Rabi did : When big politicians got GUITY from the court he said \"adalat le vaneko namanne?\"  When it was his turn he said every court is corrupt trying to get away. We are facing a same scenario here. Firstly the case was approached from a minor consent. And as far i believe the age couldn't be proven to be under 18.

Your post is gpt generated garbage, with no human critique or elements be a man, be a human instead of a corporate slave being paid next to nothing.|||jealousy makes ppl crazy|||All you blaming Sandeep are either girls or just boys that are sore losers in life. Aba they’ll say I’m being sexual ki rude eta uta. Okay let’s go thru facts one by one.   Firstly the whole case looks fabricated as hell. The day that couple spent the night together, next day aayera afnai room mate sanga ekdum excited bhayera Kura gareko cha. A few weeks later gayera case haleko cha. Usko roommate ko statement sunnu paila.   First ma statutory rape bhanyo, which was a massive one. Tyo case ho Bhane Sandeep should rot in jail. Tara that wasn’t the case, ani age ta 18 above cha raicha Bhanera tha paye pachi case chai rape ko ma change bhayo. Tyo pani when you go through the whole thing, it is pretty easy to make it out that the girl was trying to mint money out of Sandeep. It was a honey trap Bhanera ta sabai lai tha cha.   I don’t know Sandeep personally and don’t care if he’s arrogant or k k. It doesn’t matter. Because that’s not why he’s defamed.   Aba you’ll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re. Harek din naya bayaan and naya kahaani. Kt party ko main intention nai was to get as much of compensation as possible rather than punishing Sandeep.   And brought shame to our cricketing fraternity rey? Yo statement batai it’s easy to assume ki yo post garne eauta kti ho, ki jindagi ma lukera basne kta ho or Bharkhar ko fucche ho.  Even Cristiano Ronaldo was accused of rape numerous times. Eauta case ta it’s ekdummai severe. That girl immediately told her friends and filed lawsuit walla. Sandeep ko ta proper honeytrap thyo, Ronaldo had an actual case against him. But bail payo, where he still continued with his career. Unlike Sandeep, Ronaldo continued with his career. Pachi final verdict afnai favor ma payo.   So did he bring shame to Portugal? To Real Madrid? (at the time of the case) Ani Sandeep le chai kasari?   You put yourself in his shoes. You go out on a date with someone. Everything seems perfect, you guys kiss hug and spend an amazing time together. Belka you guys stay out ani make out. Bholi you drop her home. Then you go out for your work, ani bahira huda nai after a few weeks you find out that girl has filed a complaint for rape against you. What would you do?   I’m more than happy that our recent constitution and policies are in full support of women. Patriarchal society where girls were always oppressed, we finally have laws that protect and safeguard women. Tara yei law lai misuse Garne haru ni Chan.

I have great respect for Nepal and its culture. If it were upto me, I'd support strengthening ties between India and Nepal.|||I am really sorry to hear that but the way they treat first-time visitors from Nepal in India is even more disgusting than how they treat frequent visitors. Even those who visit India often are treated as if we’re some kind of threat to the country. Sometimes, I feel it’s because of our weak passport and the way they perceive our country. I’ve heard many disrespectful remarks directed at fellow Nepali travelers, even for the smallest mistakes like something as simple as pressing a thumb incorrectly.|||Mad because they were colonised and we didn't|||Man this is infuriating.

It seemed like they had never seen a Nepalese carrying dollars for travel expenses. After working on cruises for nearly 35 years and traveling extensively across the USA and Europe, he only faced this treatment at Indian airports.

No, yet most nations frown or ban them from being raised for slaughter.  The same is true here. Cows are important part of their religious or cultural identity for most Nepalese people.

We are Hindu majority. Nepalese of all religion are already normalized to not consuming beef, this will start a conflict amongst our own majority. Us not consuming beef has kept Muslims and Christians in low numbers- they are major consumers of beef and send missionaries everywhere to increase their numbers. If there are two similarly sized groups with different people- that will create political conflict and add to our issues. We already see this play out in western countries- they have major political issues around Muslims and recently Indians (who they associate with Hinduism which they've already begun to hate in Canada, and if you a brown Nepali- you are Indian to them) Don't make moves that will drive your own group's numbers low. We have to keep the status quo in regards to issues like this.   Not eating cow has not created any issue that is worth our attention. Focus on tackling actual issues like further eradicating this baun, chettri nonsense which is the bane of Hinduism- we can and are doing it while keeping our culture, traditions and identity.|||just say chamal ko bora ta paako this , visa ni paaulas ni and move on|||So much for a secular nation|||lets eat beef guys",

She is also the daughter of Nischal Nath Pandey, who served as a government employee during ramesh nath pandey’s long ministerial run. Look at this damn lifestyle. How is it possible to afford all of this when the family has nothing except civil service for the past 50 years?  Supriya Bohora, granddaughter of Deepak Bohora, former member of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and the House of Representatives, has recently come under the spotlight. Deepak Bohora was known for his strong hand in the Panchayat system and his unwavering support for the monarchy. His political journey is remembered not only for his allegiance to authoritarian structures but also for allegations of corruption. One of the most prominent accusations linked to Deepak Bohora is the illegal consumption of land where the Fun Park ice rink in Bhadrakali Road now stands. What was once a symbol of political maneuvering and alleged misappropriation of public assets is now being flaunted by his granddaughter as a mark of achievement, raising questions about how the spoils of corruption are normalized across generations.

Something previous generations never witnessed.  >The new rich have never gone through a revolution so they don't understand not to flaunt their wealth like the old bourgeoisie who have witnessed multiple revolutions throughout history. It's ironic that the Maoists instigated a revolution yet the children of said Maoists are now living the luxurious lives posting everything not knowing whats simmering in society. It looks like at least the kids have understood not to flaunt their stolen wealth to avoid angering the masses.  >In any ways what happened in Nepal highlights a trend I’ve discussed on here before, which is how Instagram utterly radicalizes youth heavy developing societies.  >Suddenly you as a poor but striving young man or woman have full visibility to how the elite/upper class of your country + diaspora live, but you have little access or hope of ever living the same for the most part. The impact of this on mental health, societal stability, and also fertility rates cannot be underestimated.  >Imagine going from a society with five state channels and a few cable options in the 2000s to Instagram in just five years. That’s what happened to all of South Asia + Africa + a lot of Latin America.  These guys were being exposed to the lifestyles of the baddie daughters and Chad sons of the fucktards ruling their country,  >You see their trip to Japan and London for the summer. See their parties at their elite mansions in the most posh suburbs and neighborhoods and you realize you’re just fucked and not getting there ever, your country simply does not have the mechanism to enable that for you, you’re unemployed even despite a college degree.  >**Upward mobility is like a pressure valve. Nepal never had that. The elites taxed people, slapped tariffs on imports & ignored building institutions that foster upward mobility. Instead, they assumed that sending their populace to the Middle East would be sufficient.**  >What’s surprising is how the corrupt politicians allow their kids to flaunt stolen wealth so brazenly. Kids of politicians in developing countries flaunting their extravagant lifestyles on public Instagram accounts is so foolhardy. Exposure to social media and bragging about your luxurious lifestyle risks fuelling resentment and envy.  >It's how uprisings have always been. Old bourgeoisie don't show off their wealth like those Nepali elites did. This behavior is what got both the iranian and russian noble families killed. This also happened in Mongolia earlier this year, although less dramatically. The Prime Minister had to step down due to protests that kicked off because his son was showing off his luxury holidays and clothes too much on Instagram.",

People romanticize going abroad, but they don’t realize it’s a full reset! Your last name, your family status, your struggles back home, none of it matters. What counts is how disciplined and valuable you are in that new system.  I’d add, learn to manage your emotions too. It’s not just physical or financial survival — it’s mental. You’ll feel lonely, rejected, homesick, but those who turn that into fuel grow faster than anyone else. Also, you don’t have to be the smartest person, but be reliable.

            "body": "I always thought my life was done for. I was a bad son and a bad brother. I let my family down so many times that they eventually kicked me out. Fair enough, I couldn’t offer them anything except shame and duniya ko tana. I’ve heard things like “Yesto xora janmaunu vanda na janmekai thik hunthyo”. Those words used to hurt me a lot, but still I couldn’t change.  I’ve done many wrong things in life which i regrets . Been to jail a few times, have criminal charges, got rusticated from college because of fights, couldn’t complete my bachelor. Friends betrayed me too they were only there when they could use me. As time passed, I got more depressed. Most of the time, only suicidal thoughts used to come to my mind. I had no place to stay, used to sleep where I worked or sometimes on the street.  One day I finally decided I’d had enough. Bought a mouse poison, tried to take my life. But at the very last moment I was too scared to die. I cried for a long time that night. I realized how miserable I had become to even think of doing that.  But that night I also realized something  maybe I’m not done yet. Maybe there’s still a small ray of hope. I still wanted to live, and live a good life. I had only two options: either change myself completely or kill myself. I couldn’t choose the second option.  So I started working hard doing different odd jobs. Quitted smoking and drinking at once it was so hard. I used to get worst panic attacks, but I managed.   Now I’ve been clean for a year. I have my own small room to live in, my own second-hand bike, and I earn through a ride-sharing app. I also started self-studying because I couldn’t finish my bachelor. Been learning programming from YouTube for two months now. It’s tough, but I’m thinking of joining classes soon. Someone told me you don’t need a college degree to become a software developer, and that really motivated me.  I even tried to apply abroad, but because of my police record it wasn’t possible. So now I just want to become someone respectable in my own country. I want to prove my father wrong. They still don’t know where I am, but one day I’ll go to them when they can proudly call me their son.  It feels unreal sometimes that I have my own room, my own food, my own bike , own laptop(second hand😁) all this within just one year. I can’t believe it. A year ago, I wanted to die. Now I just want to live better. Even though I'm alone , It really feels like dream to live like this.   Happy Happy tihar everyone and happy  bhaitika. Aja didi ko kasto yaad aayo!!

If nothing is done, the problem will likely get worse and could lead to harm to himself or others. Do not let him slip into a darker path. Take initiative and recommend behavioral therapy now. Physical punishment is not an appropriate way to communicate with a five‑year‑old.

I barely made it onto the second nomination list and ended up in a college that’s just “okay.” But honestly, I don’t blame the college I blame myself. There were others who got into better colleges than me, even though they had lower grades. So, I can’t say grades don’t matter, but the first term really showed me how tough things can get. I know I need to improve, and I’m determined to do so. I got an A+ in Computer Science, even though I didn’t study as much as I should have. I love Computer Science and building a lot of skills in the field. Right now, though, I’ve decided to take a break from everything every extracurricular activity, including learning JavaScript, React, and other things. I know I probably shouldn’t, but I feel like it’s necessary for now. Starting today, I’ll be locking my phone and using my laptop strictly for studying. I need to focus on my second terminal exams, and it’s time to set boundaries.If I’ve said anything wrong, I apologize. I don’t blame anyone or anything but myself, even though I studied harder than I ever have. My lack of proper note-taking has cost me. Right now, I’m just looking for advice from seniors who have gone through this and come back stronger, getting good results in the end.",

I understand it looks a lot worse to you (and maybe your guardians) coming from 3.97 to 3.10 and your feelings are very valid.

There could be others, who scored 1000, 999 and 998 before you. So, competition is tough, repeating same thing multiple times doesn't mean, good score.

            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I’ve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don’t know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

So go to a good collage, there is still time.

I thought I’d go into IT, then I got fascinated by physics and decided to pursue that… but now, I don’t even feel like staying in science. Lately, I’ve been more interested in social sciences or subjects related to diplomacy.  I’m not the type to sit in a room all day buried in books. I love exploring the world, meeting people, understanding life, and actually working for society. Engineering feels like endless calculations, IT and physics don’t excite me anymore, and law… I just can’t spend years memorizing articles and stressing over licenses. I also don’t want to do BSW/BASW because too many people struggle to find work after that.  I want a bachelor’s where I can study and work at the same time since my family do not earn well and I definitely have to look after my family after 12.

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can’t get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

Go there only if you have years of experience in a particular field. And Canada, UK and  Australia are not like they used to be.  Perhaps, Germany is a good choice, but you have to learn german.  If you are fine with India, you could go there too, but only if you can spend 50-60 lakhs, so that you can get into a good private college.|||Ma tw bhanxu abroad nai try gara|||Abroad try garney vaena vaney yetai ramro course padhney.|||If you want to go for studying and make a career then don't stay in Nepal.
