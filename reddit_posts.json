The vehicle has been **allegedly** identified to belong to son of health minister of bgmati provience:  Kiran Thapa. (this has not been proven yet but the locas believe this to be true. i still have doubts) Even after 24hours of accident, the police hasn't been able to contact the tipper owner.    As a compensation for death, the family's initial demand was 30L, but this might sound like a joke but : the driver's association wanted to give 7L in total : 5L from government beema + 2L from their side, this was their offer. How fucking disrespectful is that.      [statement link](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1BuAXRQVsJ/)      But after further negotiations an agreement was reached at 16L. The nawadurga  family was reluctant to accept the offer as Navadurga jaatra is going on at bhaktapur and today was the day of tole parikrama (every year navadurga goes to every tole of bhaktapur, performs dances and nyalakhe. tole parikrama specifically means taking the gods to different places of that tole for the resident to worship).  Why the negotiation needed to end fast? the man that died was Mahalakxmi. He wore the mask of Mahalakxmi and until his final rites are done, Mahalakxmi mask cannot be handed over to anyone else, hence obstructing the jatra. And obstructio of jaatra is believed to bring bad luck not oly to bhaktapur but to whole nation as well.      One story i heard was about huge fire kanda in banepa  where many houses were burnt down (i dont know when it happened but i have heard about it before, i will update if i find any more info on this, there was this one documentary as well i will link it if i find) it is believed that it happened because the chudi(bangle, haat ma lagaune) worn by one of navadurga broke during navadurga jaatra in banepa.     I haven’t seen this incident covered by any major media outlets yet, so I decided to share the information here.",

Nepal strength lies in Tourism, Cheap-labor and energy (also in space of hydrogen fuels). Nepal to improve tourism, it has to make good infrastructure and more streamlined, standard services. Nepal should be focusing on adventurous tourism more, provided with challenging terrain and appealing views. Religious tourism also has huge prospect in both external and internal tourism.  Energy, with world moving towards renewable energy and south-asia being booming region, it should be focusing on selling energy in various countries in south-asia. India being fastest growing major economy, it is huge opportunity. Regarding excess energy (also with cold temperature in himalayas), it should provide rate cuts for establishing data centers and providing energy in low cost during monsoon, which uses our excess being wasted energy also and would develop industry with huge demand in whole world.  Cheap-labor, is huge opportunity. Such sectors with no logistics required (IT, fintech, outsourced offices), will create more jobs, and bring in more foreign reserves. Nepal can be globally competitive in this, which will also increase FDIs and jobs.   In this globally demanding sectors, only government assistance would pump up the investment   Agriculture's opportunity is also huge, but that would be slow transition. Transitioning 60% population, mostly doing it traditionally, will be slow and much more time consuming. It would be in long-term  So, according to me, for Nepal's economy to grow aggressively in coming time fastly, government should concentrate it's focus in these sectors than  fragmenting it's focus in other less rewarding sectors. What you guys think of this? Should we be pushing new to be elected-government for this?",

            "comments": "Nepal's labor is not cheap. They are just easy to exploit|||Correct. With cheap and abundant energy, we can focus on energy intensive manufacturing like steel production.|||You're correct.In addition to your thoughts, for protecting and rise in the economy. We should not be more dependable for stuffs like: crops, rice, wheat, flour, vegetables etc from our neighboring countries. Export and all the stuff you mention is excellent but we should also focus on managing and correcting the import which we can grow for us ourselves.|||Green data centers, wellness tourism, herbal based luxury cosmetics (with some R&D, see korea), export substituting manufacturing could be some areas. Government doesn't invest there though. They invest in public goods like defense, security, health, education, social security. They instead make the investment environment better for the private sector both domestic and international to pour in capital and technology. Unfortunately, events like Gen Z movement don't help much. It has raised fear among investors about the security of their investments. More than project return (IRR), investors see protection of investment and consistency/predictability of government policies in deciding whether to invest.|||Being in the shade of china and India cheap labour is not the solution. But still opportunity for skilled remote worker will be better.   With world pushing towards ai and robots, I think handmade products are going to be popular in the future specifically from place where the sweatshops bias doesn't come. Nepal can use advantage of this if it can decentralize the market to small scale and still export around the world.|||I agree with the comment that labor is not cheap in Nepal, therefore, we cannot realistically become a manufacturing powerhouse like Bangladesh or Vietnam (which benefit from massive population density). One reason labor is not cheap is that it remains relatively unproductive. So, over the next ten years, Nepal needs to invest heavily in education and research to make our labor more productive and competitive in the international market.  Instead of low-end manufacturing, Nepal should focus on high-value, service-oriented sectors such as luxury tourism (similar to Bhutan or Switzerland), software development (like Singapore), and acting as a trade facilitator between India and China. We should also pursue medical tourism (like thailand and I believe Nepal has a high-quality medical sector because the medical education field has seen significant investment.  Regardless of the industry chosen, for any of these sectors to function properly and create an economic boom, we will need strong, functioning institutions to build high-quality infrastructure, which includes roads, airports, and ports, and to establish high-standard trade and tourism laws. This is why we truly need a visionary leader to spearhead this transformation.|||Not an economics guy but I do think energy will be huge. Nepal using renewable source of energy is a huge win seeing how a lot of countries have historically been dependent on oil and gas. We still have a lot more to go, the usage haven't been diversified. One thing I am interested in is we shouldn't be dependent on hydro only. The urban solar will be so interesting. There should be institutional level solar with net metering system which would be beneficial for private sector on the cost that they keep complaining about to NEA.  Pumped hydro has huge potential, although I don't know technical intricacies. Green hydrogen is again another interesting things, although it will require lot an lots of investment (money as well as people's time and curiosity about technology). We will need an entire hydrogen ecosystem too.  On outsourcing cheap labour, I see some limits. I believe this sort of industry also needs some domestic demand. Internationally we are not only competing with india but also from south east asia market. The engineers in Nepal are really talented, competitive to anyone globally but the market reach is still not that great. Not only if we would have the domestic market for different services how great would that be. I see some devs earning high salary but are disappointed because nepal is the same and there are a lot of things lacking as we haven't reached a point of development yet but already exposed to how things are outside. Our own market is too small and poor.",

            "body": "Look around, you’ll find most people wearing the same styles of clothes, the same haircuts, and the same shoes. It has all come down to the concept of simplicity. The term “keep it simple” is so glorified that if you look from the 2000s to now, it seems like nothing has changed. This particular era has no uniqueness, unlike previous eras like the 90s, etc.  From company logos to brand.ing and design, everything has such minimal design that it has lost the beauty of making art. If you notice architecture from previous generations, buildings were complex in themselves. Even basic things like water taps and lamps were made with so much effort that they looked aesthetically beautiful.  And if you look at social media, most people’s behavior seems almost identical, from the emojis they use to convey messages to the way they talk.  With the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT, almost everyone is using them, from college applications to social media posts to everyday conversations as well. Every post, thought, and idea seems similar. Humans are becoming lazy to think through their own minds.  Humans are social animals. Our boring environment makes us even more stressed. The human mind wants beauty, it wants aesthetics. If it didn’t, you wouldn’t even want to go into nature after stressful work. There is aesthetic complexity and beauty out there, which we used to reach that level and make our own creations, but we are slowly losing that ability.  Because of all this, everyone and everything is almost identical. There’s no uniqueness or beauty to look around. To be human is to be imperfect, but we’re afraid to show our imperfections through art, so we’ve chosen the term “simplicity.”  Read this essay on Medium: https://marcuspandey.medium.com/the-world-has-become-almost-identical-259e224ea994  Thanks for reading!",

            "body": "Nepal’s traditional parties failed at three basic tasks: internal democracy, leadership renewal, and credible service delivery. When institutions stop reproducing competence, voters go shopping for substitutes. That’s how alternative politics becomes electorally attractive. It’s less an ideology and more a rejection reflex.  Why alternative politics wins now:  \t•\tVoters distrust party hierarchies that feel hereditary.  \t•\tYouth wings function as foot soldiers, not future leaders.  \t•\tLocal governments were weak for decades, so charisma filled the vacuum.  \t•\tSocial media rewards clarity and anger, not committee work.  In that environment, alternatives don’t need a perfect plan. They only need to look less rotten.  But here’s the trap.  Alternative politics in Nepal currently relies on centralized moral authority — one leader symbolizing honesty, efficiency, or rebellion. That is emotionally powerful, but structurally fragile. Once everything flows through one figure, you’ve recreated the same problem under a new logo.  History is ruthless on this point:  Movements that don’t institutionalize either collapse or mutate into the thing they replaced.  What actually determines whether alternative politics lasts:  \t•\tDoes it build internal elections that can remove its own leaders?  \t•\tDoes it train second- and third-line leadership at ward and municipality levels?  \t•\tDoes it tolerate disagreement without calling critics “anti-change”?  \t•\tDoes it survive its founder being wrong, tired, or gone?  So far, Nepal’s alternative forces are excellent at disruption, mediocre at institution-building.  Anger and frustration opens the door.  Institutions decide who stays.  The most realistic outcome for Nepal isn’t “alternative politics replaces old parties.”  It’s this: alternative politics forces old parties to reform, or cannibalizes them selectively.  If alternative movements evolve into institutions, they’ll win long-term.  If they remain personality engines, they’ll peak, fragment, and be absorbed.",

I have led treks in June/July amidst monsoon period and once we were on higher elevation, the landscape was truly magical. For reference, this photograph from June. Due to rainfall, we experienced some snow at Thorong Pass while rest of the trek was warm and comfortable with occasional drizzle at lower elevation. Adequately prepared with GTX Shells or Rain Poncho, the hikes are doable and for me one of the best time to experience the Himalayas. The landscape is green, lush alpine meadows with wildflowers, hide and seek of clouds and snow-capped peaks. The scenery could not be more magical.

Rest of them are around my age and have been together since the beginning. I get this feeling that I'm invading their space ever since I've joined the group. They keep whispering, gossiping and giggling all the time and don't involve me in their shenanigans (maybe because I'm new or sth no idea). I see them laughing and then suddenly stopping as soon as I enter in the space. Happened to me yesterday, literally walked out for like a min and as I came back they immediately stopped giggling and talking. It's as if they were bitching about me. I really tried to calm myself down peptalking but I just cannot shake this feeling of not belonging there. I feel unwelcomed, heavily bitched, and a total outcast. I really think they hate me and don't want me there. Everything bothers me regardless of how much I try to ignore.   I don't know if I'm overthinking or it's a reality. Makes me feel so bad and sad seeing how I get treated. Doesn't seem like a big deal but trust me it really is. Since I'm an introvert, being around new people and working with them takes a lot of mental prep. Not even been a week and it's hard on me already.",

There aren’t many good options in my country to receive international payments, so I used Binance P2P to convert USDT to local currency and send it to my bank account. This money is my salary, not trading profits or third-party funds.  This morning my bank froze my account without warning. These were my hard-earned savings that I was slowly building to someday build a home, so this hit me really hard mentally.  Tomorrow I’m going to the bank in person, but I’m unsure:  What exactly should I say to them?  What should I not say?  What documents usually help in these cases?  Has anyone here gone through something similar and successfully unfrozen their account?  Is there a real risk of losing the money, or is this usually just a compliance review?  I’m not trying to avoid laws or do anything shady. I just didn’t have a better way to receive my income.  Any advice or shared experiences would really help right now. Thanks for reading.",

Her main uses will be:   • MS Office   • Internet browsing & YouTube   • Some bank management software   • Movies & everyday use  Nothing too heavy (no gaming or video editing). I’d prefer something that’s **lightweight, fast, good battery life**, and that will **last around 5 years**.  My budget is around **NPR 80,000**, but I’m open to going up to **\\~90k** if it’s worth it.  **Questions:**  1. What laptops would you recommend in this range? 2. Where in Nepal (physical stores or online) is best to buy from? Any places with good deals and reliable service?  Thanks in advance! 😊",

And Nepal is actually glazed for how easily nepal was able to eradicate polio, connected everybody with roads, expanded the electricity line, eradicated child mortality. Nepal got better despite of Economic progress, and it is solely due to the bureaucracy and planning it was placed after being republic.    Nepal is landlocked, and doesnt have natural resources. we neither have good iron deposits, nor any other deposits that are stable. thats why we sold so much trees and early days of modern history of nepal. (dont come here with water resources. i meant raw materials), it is mountainous, and logistics will always be challenging, even tourism business expansion will be bottlenecked with number of aviation that could go from indian air. (air above country will be owned by that country). so, say why nepal isnt richhh is self answering quesstion.    But you should ask, why nepal improved HDI despite of having bad economy. thats what Human Development Report Office asked. and did through research.   the progress is slow, not gonna debate that. but PPP is wrong way to analysize the progress. |||should thank the Communist social democratic people for sucking up all the economy of the country over the decades and still continue to do so.|||Of course, it is the same.

People can have their own views and they can put forward their views whatever they like, but can't infringe upon other individual people's personal lives.

I suggest you critique ideas, if you believe,  somebody's idea is wrong and unconstitutional, press charges in court. Please don't name all people and defame them.  You just can't go around emotional blackmailing by stating number of dead people. I bet you didn't read the clearly listed demands of the protest. It was never against any party. It was against corruption.

That doesn’t mean vote manipulation, but it does inform strategy.  Where this matters is narrative control. A media house can adjust coverage, framing, interviews, and visibility based on what performs poorly or well, and even create bandwagon effects by highlighting perceived popularity.  So the real concern isn’t that they’ll steal your vote. It’s how media uses engagement data to shape perception and public discourse before elections.  Curious to hear others’ opinions.

When the US threatens 25% tariffs on Germany and France over a land deal, the old \"Allies\" playbook is officially dead. Where does this leave Nepal? We’re the \"Yam\" between two boulders that are suddenly moving much faster. Our $20B reserve is a solid war chest, but it’s sitting in a currency that’s being weaponized. If you want to understand the 2026 vibe, look at the Tariff Tussle: we are moving from a world of \"cheap global goods\" to \"expensive local security.\" For Nepal, the goal is simple but brutal: don't choose a side, sell electricity to whoever pays in hard assets, and pray our \"Non-Alignment\" holds while the giants fight over the Arctic and the Dollar",

Isn't that really obvious though?|||Thats like asking, “Was Jesus a christian?”. Jesus was born as a Jew, but later promoted his own teachings. Likewise, Karl Marx was born in some form of monarchial bureaucracy, and later promoted his own philosophy( or idea). IMO, he was a communist because his belief lead to hundreds of communist revolutions throughout.|||K k ho yo communist ani yo aru k k ho socialist jata tatai xa aaile but don't know its meaning|||Ts ain’t tuff bub…|||[deleted]|||Was Adam Smith Economist?|||https://preview.redd.it/heqwwqodiffg1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c083dc45d51b17d83926436f0ff4538f13bac12b|||Did Hitler hate Jews 🤔|||\"Is KP Oli a child killer ?\" ahh question|||tait muji reddit ma ni sab pakhe nai hune raixan. basic humour ni bujhdainan. comment section checks out|||Is Bruce wayne Superman ?|||Yeah. Communism is really stupid if you look back at humanity now.|||This should be categorised as fictional book|||some deep shit ! ... op is not asking for superficial answer|||Technically, yes, he wrote the manual. But, Marx was a man who saw a disease but prescribed a medicine that was more toxic than the sickness. He wanted to fix the world by changing who owns the \"stuff\" without changing the \"human being\" who uses the stuff.  ​When you try to enforce \"equality\" through a state, you don't get a paradise; you get a prison. This is why Marxism has failed wherever it was tried as a rigid political tool.  ​Why \"Harkabad\" is the Antidote TODAY:  ​The reason we look toward a philosophy like Harkabad (Prakriti, Samskriti, Pravidhi) instead of Marxism or Western Capitalism is because it addresses the foundation, not just the \"economics.\" Harka Smapang has time and again said it has nothing to do with his name. He is suggesting a solution that isn't a western copy but suitable to the soil we stand on.   ​Marxism says: \"Who owns the factory?\" ​Capitalism says: \"How much can the factory produce?\" ​Harkabad says: \"Do we even need the factory if it kills the river (Prakriti) and destroys the community's soul (Samskriti)?\"  If you ask me if we need \"Harkabad,\" I would say we need Consciousness.  ​Harka Sampang is essentially bringing consciousness to governance. When he goes out and carries stones with his own hands (Shramadaan), he is moving from the \"ugly\" socialism (taking from others) to the \"wonderful\" socialism (giving of oneself).  ​We don't need a \"Communist\" revolution where blood is spilled to change the law. We need a \"Harkabad\" style evolution where sweat is spilled to restore the land. ​You don't need a book from 19th-century Germany to tell you how to live. You just need to look at the earth beneath your feet and the people around you.",

It doesn’t feel like tourism anymore it feels careless.On top of that, the local leadership has also disappointed me.

In terms of personal finance, I was only taught to save and nothing more. So, I had to learn about the stock market, budgeting and planning for my financial future on my own. But I think in terms of personal finance, my brother and I got about the same knowledge from family.   While my experiences may differ, I want you to know that your experiences are valid.

            "body": "I am being honest and critical here. For those who genuinely want Nepal to become a better place and be recognized as a developed nation, we must acknowledge that we are critically failing. Lets start with history here, If we look at the result of Chitwan Constituency No. 1 in the 2079 election, our level of awareness becomes painfully clear. On one side stood Bishwanath Paudel — a PhD graduate from the University of California, Berkeley, with experience in national and international policymaking, university teaching, advisory roles in institutions like the ILO, and currently serving as the Governor of Nepal Rastra Bank. On the other side stood Hari Dhakal, who represented rebellion and “newness,” despite not meeting the commonly accepted standards of excellence by which Paudel would normally be judged.  If competence, experience, knowledge, and contribution had truly been the criteria, the result should have been one-sided. But it was not. Dhakal won by a large margin, and Paudel finished third. This happened because people did not vote for a candidate; they voted out of anger toward old politics. Paudel did not lose because he lacked ability, but because he was seen as a symbol of the old party and of Sher Bahadur Deuba.  This reveals a deeper problem: our consciousness is only half-awakened. We are frustrated with the old parties and the system, yet we still fail to apply proper standards when choosing alternatives. We vote in anger, not with reason. We react, but we do not evaluate. Competence is not defined by a degree alone; it is built from education, knowledge, experience, contribution to policymaking, character, and integrity.  When a person with such qualifications loses solely because of party identity, it is not that person who loses — it is the country. Preventing capable individuals from losing elections is not an emotional demand; it is a demand of the time. A nation is built or destroyed not inside the ballot box, but inside the voter’s awareness. That awareness is not measured by speeches or slogans, but by the choices made during elections.  From now on, people must decide with judgment, not with the momentum of the crowd. They must judge with the mind, not with the anger of the heart. The day voters begin choosing candidates based on knowledge, ability, experience, character, and intention, opportunists will leave politics in shame, capable individuals will step forward naturally, and democracy will finally belong to the people.   Let us remember this: when good people begin to win, the nation never loses.",

Not just the party, not just the slogan, but the person. What have they done in the past? What do they stand for? How do they plan to speak for us in parliament?  Right now, we have MPs who show up only during elections. They ask for votes, promise everything, and once they win, they disappear. No contact, no accountability. That’s not representation.  I’m not saying every MP needs to be a Harvard graduate or some top expert. That’s not the point. Even someone who regularly talks with their voters, listens to their problems, raises local issues in parliament, and stays reachable would already be doing better than most.  Instead, many MPs start acting like they’re above the people once they get the title “माननीय.” They forget who gave them that title in the first place. A representative who forgets the people is not a representative at all.  Democracy isn’t about perfect leaders.

Mostly high level ex police army and top level officials and leaders own private gun form what I can see.  But in case of antiques there might be some exceptions specially if its made inert.  P.S. Even people with licence cant hold gun till mid april due to election. and guns are often held by DOA during election months.|||[Are guns legal in Nepal? - 2026 Laws and Regulations](https://legalitylens.com/are-guns-legal-in-nepal/)|||Yes, you can legally own a gun in Nepal, but only with explicit government approval, since firearms are not treated as a personal right and all possession is licensed under the Arms and Ammunition Act. In practice, this means you would need both an import permit to bring the firearm into the country and a separate ownership license issued after arrival, and while foreigners can receive permits ( especially for historical or collectible pieces ) the process is discretionary, slow, and not guaranteed, so before moving you would need to contact the Nepali authorities to confirm procedures and ensure the heirloom is not treated as contraband.|||No sir, you aren't allowed to carry firearms and there's no loophole or an exception made in that regard.   It'll be better to give it to a trusted friend or family member for safekeeping back in the states.   Good day.|||Safest bet is to leave the gun in safe hands back in the states. Talk to authority at the Kathmandu Airport and bring/leave it next time you come around.|||Free guns for the police👍🏼|||You can only have a Gun license if you have enough proof of your life being in so much danger that not even the Police can protect you and you yourself have to have a gun to protect yourself. That applies to Nepali Citizens only. As you're a Foreigner it's illegal for you to get a gun under our Law.. Even if you bring in a Gun Shaped jewellery from abroad and get found out in TIA it can lead to prosecution.|||Very strict gun laws.   Not just for foreigners but also for Nepali citizens.  I know that you can bring a gun if you are hunting, there is one hunting reserve in Dhorpatan.  But you will likely not be allowed to bring it and keep it in the country.  Furthermore pistols and side arms are considered to be for self defense and not hunting therefore the controls are stricter.   It will be 100x easier for you to find a place for your gun in the USA than to bring it to Nepal.  Not worth the hassle|||We don’t want your guns in here .|||long live 2nd amendment!!!  to answer your question, not worth the hassle , just leave it with someone there.|||[deleted]|||How can stolen property be heirloom?",

            "body": "I want to know from Gagan Thapa supporters or his IT cell people, genuinely why should we vote for him. Here are my questions:     **1.  What has he done till date??**  Gagan Thapa has been a member of Parliament continuously since 2065 BS, first as PR MP and then he has won 3 times. He became Health minister once. So, what exactly did he do as MP?? How many amendments did he offer in Parliament?? Did be bring any private bill himself to pass in Parliament?? Yes he gave good speeches but where is action? He introduced health insurance system many say but it has almost collapsed right now. I am sure the excuse is gonna be well he was minority in the party and couldn’t do anything but, how can we be sure he will do anything big now that he is party chair??     **2. Part of the same highly politicised corrupt system:** Anyone who even has basic understanding of Nepali politics knows a huge part of lack of development in Nepal is that system has become super politicized with party unions in schools and hospitals, in civil service. You cannot get a good political appointment without having a party affiliation. Gagan Thapa himself came from Nepal students union. We need to try to break this system and how can I trust Gagan and his NC party even trying to change this?? Gagan Thapa alone can’t do everything and would his party members allow him to dismantle a system they have enjoyed for decades?? Like Gagan has said he wants to appoint people based on merit, but Can he do that when he has so many party members who will pressure him to give them appointment??  FYI.. RSP has no student or trade unions so far.     **3. Corruption investigations:** We know a lot of NC leaders have serious allegations of corruption. Even Gagan Thapa was forced to give ticket to Bijay Gacchadar who has been accused of corruption. So, Can we trust that he is gonna initiate corruption or other criminal investigations on various party members that may weaken his hold on the party??     These three reasons are enough for me not to vote for Gagan Thapa and his NC party this time around.",

There whole agenda is to discredit RSP or Balen. That's it. No  Oli, prachanda or sherey. RSP / Balen sambandhi kura ho vane matra active hunu parne adesh hola jhol haru lai.|||Not a Gagan Thapa IT cell but I think you may not understand some parliamentary processes and how party functions.   Private Bills almost never pass in the parliament. You can bring bills but it will never pass unless ruling coalition and few other parties all collectively agree that it can be passed but with significant changes and compromise. Also there is party whip, you can disagree but never go against the party during parliamentary vote. You will get disciplined, ousted from the party and never get another chance.   That is fair criticism but did health insurance collapse under his leadership? I think consecutive government lack of funding and management also played a huge role. Personally I have benefited from the program. Also he did create legal, regulatory and financial structure for the program. It was a fragmented idea, but it did become concrete under his leadership and millions benefited from. Even if it collapsed but the framework is still there, it can be started again with some structural change and dont think the blame lies on Gagan on this one. There have been multiple other health ministers and multiple government after him whom each played a part in mismanagement.   Student politics is not necessarily bad. Also the history of student unions in Nepal is a bit different. Panchayat ma party nahuda, and lack of social media back then, the only way to organize politically was in universities and campuses. Also praya jasto sabai janta were illiterate back then, so politics was obviously only happening within educated circles, professors and students. The way gen z protest were organized in social media because people have access, navako vaye the only way would be to be form groups in school and colleges right? Natra kasari organize gartheu. Also before student politics sabai neta ko udpadan Indian university ma hunthyo, this did bring leadership opportunity inside Nepal. Also democratic society ma timile union ra group banaunai paudaina vannai mildaina. If me and few other RSP supporters want to make a club in my college for the upcoming election who can stop us? Also trade union ra bidhyathi sangathan navayera ta ho RSP le different ideology vako manche tara facebook follower ra celebrity status ko manche lai ticket badheko.

Kei garnai nasakine. Yo pali pani ticket was already distributed before the leadership change happened. So I do understand that new leadership did not have much time to finalize the tickets and he has admitted so too that there have been mistakes but the good thing is they passed a new set of laws regarding tickets during the mahaadhivesan. Starting next election the person will go through like a primary where NC members from a election region will elect who gets the ticket, savapati le sign gardai badhne din chai hatakai ho but logistically yo pali navyako vanya I think thats fair.

            "heading": "Why is Balen so avoidant of public debate?",
            "body": "I want to start by saying this clearly: I am not anti-Balen.  I respect many things he has done and I understand why people see him as a symbol of change.  But BECAUSE he represents something new, I think it’s important that we hold him to a higher standard NOW, not later.  It is the only way democracy survives.  Recently a journalist proposed interviewing multiple leaders together in a public debate format. Balen rejected the idea, saying he would not share a stage with someone he considers a murderer. In his comment under KP Oli’s post, he wrote a long rant framing public debate itself as morally unacceptable.  This raises a few serious questions.  **First: Does debating someone mean you endorse them?**  If a scientist debates an anti-vax person, does that make the scientist anti-vax? If a human rights activist debates a war criminal, does that mean they support war crimes? Of course not. Debate is not endorsement.  Debate is how the public tests ideas, intentions, and competence. By refusing to debate, Balen is not morally isolating bad leaders. He is isolating himself from public scrutiny.  **Second: If Balen avoids debates, how do we know his agenda?**  So far, we mostly know what he is against.  We don’t clearly know:  * What kind of Prime Minister he wants to be * What his economic priorities are * How he plans to handle federalism, foreign policy, corruption, or social issues  **Third: Inflating numbers weakens moral arguments.**  In his comment, Balen says 76 children were killed.  But according to most credible sources, the number is closer to around 40. Forty murdered children is already horrific. Why inflate it?  When a leader who is “janne-bujhne, padheko” exaggerates facts, even for a moral cause, it damages credibility. Truth matters, especially when you claim moral superiority.  If we do not question our “good leaders” now, we are quietly preparing the ground for the next KP Oli or the next Prachanda. Unaccountable leaders don’t appear suddenly.  They are created by supporters who stop asking hard questions.  How should citizens evaluate him without hearing him defend his ideas? If he doesn’t explain these in a public, confrontational setting, then what mandate are people actually supporting? Are we voting for a plan Or just for a personality?  Are we supporting a vision or just an image?",

            "comments": "I feel like with Balen, the core issue is this: he’s a populist leader, and we’re living inside ahis populist wave. He knows it. He plays it well. And honestly, that’s not new in Nepali politics. Oli was a populist once. Prachanda too both rode massive emotional waves before settling into the same old politics.  So when Balen refuses to debate, he frames it as a moral position. In his mind, sharing a stage with someone he sees as corrupt or violent makes him look like he’s lowering himself. That works for his brand. It fits the image he’s built.  But underneath that, I think the context matters. Nepal is extremely divided after the recent protests. UML people have not recognised the martyrs , and anti-corruption protestors got labelled as foreign agents or anarchists .  So when Balen avoids debates, I don’t think it’s only moral disgust. I think he knows he’s riding a media-driven populist wave. He knows the youth are with him. He knows social media amplifies him more than anyone else. And he knows that an open debate where his statements can be pulled out of context, clipped, twisted could puncture his momentum.  He’s smart. He understands optics better than any politician in the country right now.  Meanwhile KP Oli is not operating on the same wavelength. Different generation, different communication style, different political instincts. Balen knows he benefits from contrast, not confrontation.  What I don’t fully get is the extreme skepticism toward Balen as if he’s already the next dictator-in-waiting. What do people want? Should we dive straight into chaos and pretend we don’t need any leader at all? Should we pretend there’s a magical alternative hiding somewhere?  If we distrust every single new face, then who exactly are we left with? UML? NC? Maoists? Or the monarchists’ fantasy of a saviour king? Because that’s basically the menu.  Nepal is a very young and very unstable country. I genuinely think we need a new symbol for a little while someone who can surf the populist wave without sinking the country. Four years, not a lifetime. Someone who isn’t carrying the entire weight of the old system.  I think Balen is avoiding debates because he’s protecting his narrative. And in this phase of Nepali politics, narrative is everything.|||Bhedas follow loud mouths coz they are too lazy to use their brain or just straight-up dumb to understand intellectual arguments. Just see indian netas giving speech. It's just a manipulation game. Doesn't matter whatever bullshit you spew. If you are confident and loud enough, dumb people will follow. And if Balen tries the same tactic as being loud mouth, and spewing insubstantial bullshit, he is gonna lose his current supporters.|||If anyhow the debate even initiates , balen would be the first victim of that debate coz oli and gagan would certainly make him nanga . Coz their whole life has been revolved around debates ,manipulating and false promises ones.  they would certainly raise some issues where balen would be speechless and the others will consider this as their win and  helping in  their election campaign.  For me ,Rabi would be far better than balen to face other possible pm candidates .|||At some point around 2020 US election, I used to follow the candidates, debates etc. I came across a video of Al-Gore conceding defeat, because apparantly there was some court issues etc. That rabbit hole lead me to a video, where they were analyzing how debate performance enhanded/diminished the changes of a presidential candidate. They found out that every very unrelated topics to policies and fitness of office affected candidates' chances. Like if they coughed at some point, started to fidget with something or things like that. Its because debates like this have too much spotlight in one (or few) events. And your margin of error is extremely low, and that is risky. And Balen at least seems to have understood this.  It is possible that Balen thinks he can't win in policy discussions. He has massively overpromised in the mayor election and underdelivered (common across world political scene I think). Although as Rabi dai said, \"Daaktar saap, bajet lekhna thalnus\", they certainly have capable person to make economic policy, Balen might fear accurately representing daktaar saap's work.  Another possibility I think is his public speaking ability. I was underwhelmed by his Janakpur presentation. Understandable that he came to such large crowd to speak for the first time in his life as a politician, he had massive pressure. In that 2020 or 16 may be not sure, US election I followed, there were people thinking somebody called Marko Rubio as a potential candidate and people say Trump just absolutely devoured him because Rubio was nervous.  Another one, that most people here in reddit are assuming, is that, a known charlatan in Oli will overpower him in terms of speaking. Oli might use this to whitewash his name and get more validation for himself.  It could be one or combination of these to avoid debate. The logic he posted in Oli's comment certainly seems weak in my eye. He should rather have not commented at all in his classic silence fashion.  Its not correct to assume that we wouldn't know his agenda if he doesn't come to debate. We have ghoshanapatra system in nepal. Me personally, I'd like my PM to at least face media. Be confident enough to speak confidently to the public. Its absolutely frustrating that we haven't had Balen answer any question from the public media ever.|||A public debate among all parties PM candidate should happen. Hamro questions haru answer garne. Afno plan and policies clearly vanne, yo sab debate bata tha hunchha.|||I agree with your first point.      \\> **Second: If Balen avoids debates, how do we know his agenda?**  Debates are not the primary source of a party's agenda. There are other ways of knowing his (RSP's) agenda. Balen is RSP now. And you can find lots of things on their website.   Also, RSP leader Swarnim Wagle said that they're purposefully delaying their election manifesto because they don't want it to be copied, which kinda makes sense.  You can check RSP's website and see if it answers questions. If it doesn't, I think they'll add more stuff in the election manifesto.  \\> **Third: Inflating numbers weakens moral arguments.**  I don't think the age of the number that were murdered is the issue here. So I'm gonna pass on that one.|||Kinaki public maa appealing huna unrealistic jhuta kura bolnuparchha hagane ra hatyara le jastai teivara.|||manxe le overestimate garexi mukh kholnu stupidity ho ni bro|||I also personally don’t think that he is a good orator.

I am not saying 2 points, just 1 place and 10m radius from the point.   He will say: KP oli is corrupt, thats why there is nothing.|||He can still debate with Gagan and Sampang. There needs to be a well experienced facilitator and few prompts could be provided prior to debates for preparation. If you are going to be a public leader, you need to come out and speak in public. If you are uncomfortable with debates, maybe politics is not a right sector for you. Balen has well educated team who can support with preparation. Yes, you need to study and make notes. With too many things going on, it might be overwhelming but that's the job you have chosen and people have expectations.|||He wants UML voters on his side. He is on the \"dont hate anyone\" train.

I was working for one of the renowned company.. they made us use the cursor. They kept telling us to have 2x productivity.

But recently I switched company. Here we are now building smaller smaller project and sending it to the mass to get subscriptions as fast as possible.. and guess what we are using lovable to build the system. Lovable + supabase + stripe = boom product.   So in this case the point is that if the system you are building is simpler and you have clean vision even people from marketing can now build the system.

So then I realized what I have in hand that an inexperienced ones have - already useful skill, product knowledge and codebase knowledge. That is helping me in productivity. But the real growth and survival will happen if I gain the skills of a lead like a team lead, a manager, a product owner, or solution architect or any kind of lead is fine. And you won’t see many leads in a team. Leads are already out standing. So You have to figure out how you can be the lead.|||All|||AI will **replace a significant portion of developers**, and not in some distant future. This is already happening, and it will accelerate rapidly over the next 12–24 months as AI tools get mass-adopted inside companies.  That said, the outcome isn’t as simple as “developers are done.”  What’s actually happening is a restructuring of value.  As companies begin laying off junior and mid-level developers, they won’t eliminate development teams entirely. Instead, they’ll rely on fewer, highly reliable developers who can handle much more work with the help of AI. This creates a paradoxical situation: layoffs on one side, high demand on the other, but only for the right people.    If you come from a development background, the smartest move right now is simple:  * Become exceptional at using AI as a force multiplier. * Just knowing how to code won’t be enough anymore. That used to be the differentiator; now it’s table stakes.    **What matters now is:**  * Knowing how to think in systems * Translating vague requirements into clear specs * Using AI to generate, refactor, test, debug, and ship faster * Understanding architecture well enough to spot what AI gets wrong * Owning a specific niche deeply enough to solve high-value problems quickly    Companies won’t pay top dollar for someone who can “do everything moderately well.”  They will pay very well for someone who can fix a very specific, painful problem reliably.  And let’s be honest: saying “AI won’t replace humans” is already outdated. It has started replacing roles; not because AI is perfect, but because it’s good enough when paired with the right person.  If a non-technical person, like myself, someone who loves tech but never formally learned coding, can now build a full-fledged system using tools like ChatGPT and Replit, then the competitive bar has fundamentally shifted.  AI isn’t coming for jobs.   It’s coming for generic skill sets.    **So the choice is clear:**  * Either level up into a top-tier senior developer who designs systems, makes decisions, and leads execution * Or become a highly specialized mid-level developer with deep expertise in one niche and excellent AI leverage  Anything in between is the danger zone.  This isn’t a threat, it’s an opportunity.  But only for those who adapt early and intentionally.  Cheers!|||Lmao CRUD/landing page ta garihaalxa ni.

It helped me explore ideas faster, remember syntax I hadn’t used in a while, and move smoothly from thought to implementation. Over time, I stopped noticing it as a separate thing—it just became part of my workflow.  Until one day, I couldn’t access it.  For some reason, Cursor just wasn’t available. No quick fixes. No workaround. Just… gone.  At first, I thought it would be fine. *I’ve been coding for years,* I told myself. *I should be able to handle this.*  But then something unexpected happened.  I couldn’t code.  Not in the dramatic “I forgot everything forever” sense—but in a much quieter, scarier way. My mind felt blank. Things I *knew* I knew weren’t coming to me. Simple patterns felt distant. I stared at the screen, unsure how to begin. Even planning the solution felt harder than it should have been.  It felt like trying to write with a pen after years of typing—except the pen was there, and my hand just wouldn’t move.  What bothered me most wasn’t the slowdown. It was the realization of how dependent I had become. Cursor hadn’t replaced my skills, but it had been carrying a lot of cognitive load for me: memory, structure, momentum. Without it, I had to face the raw version of my thinking—and it wasn’t as sharp as I assumed.  That day forced me to sit with an uncomfortable question:  **How much of my ability was mine, and how much was outsourced?**  This isn’t a post against tools. I still believe tools like Cursor are incredibly powerful. They make us faster, more confident, and more creative. But that experience reminded me that tools can quietly reshape how we think—not always in obvious ways.  Since then, I’ve tried to rebalance things a little:  * Writing rough logic before touching code * Letting myself struggle longer instead of immediately reaching for help * Rebuilding trust in my own memory and problem-solving  I still use Cursor. I probably always will.  But now I’m more aware of the line between **augmentation** and **dependence**.  Losing access for a day didn’t just block my workflow—it exposed a blind spot. And honestly, I’m glad it did.  Sometimes, a blank screen isn’t a failure.  Sometimes, it’s a mirror.",

The current world is evolving and we are actually getting productive with AI. On the other hand imposter syndrome and fear of AI taking the job and all is normal i believe.  Cursor isn’t just autocomplete.. it holds context and your coding patterns.. when that disappears suddenly, it’s normal to feel blank for a bit. I think it’s your brain missing its external cache.  If it was down for few more days, I’m pretty sure you will still get the work done with another tool, just slower. The scary part is the interruption. I agree that awareness is valuable.

I’ve been working in this industry for the past 3 years although not in software side but on the infrastructure side.   I can assure you that this is definitely the case. Not all the companies will fail but 98% will for sure. The industry is super saturated, no new innovation is happening the chatbots won’t be sufficient as we now know how dumb and rudimentary they are. Of course some will survive like grok Gemini OpenAI Claude as they have massive corporations backing them up. And every other “AI tool” is basically a wrapper of one of these.   The head-cost of data centre operating alone is enormous not even counting the compute and hardware just utilities alone apart from GPUS, RAM, Server and Storage is more than what most companies can afford.   Ad is another factor that could change things but remember how many AIs there are, the ads have to super cheap as there’s always another company in china  with the same capabilities that’ll undercut your prices. So it’s not a stable solution either.   After the boom of social media there were 1000s of new social media platforms but 99% failed that is the same case here. Only the ones that are specialist in their broad field will succeed that is the ultimate fate.|||AI as a whole ta failed ma na halum j hos considering how dependent people are in generative AI, tyo chai fail teti easily na hola except chatGPT cuz holy moly they are going recklessly baru google le rmaro apporch gari rako xa espically apple wala deal where they just provided them model ani host garne and all sab apple le nai hernu parne re soo no additional overhead cost.  tara it will be interesting to see how these AI companies will make the best out of it cause aile ko condition herda ads halo vane ni its a chatbot soo  firstly ta people will keep asking ani secondly tyo jun answer generate garna lagne cost xa tyo level ko return ads le dela ki na dela tei mathi kati chai halxan hola ra ads ni.

Tomorrow I’m going to the bank in person, but I’m unsure:  What exactly should I say to them?  What should I not say?  What documents usually help in these cases?  Has anyone here gone through something similar and successfully unfrozen their account?  Is there a real risk of losing the money, or is this usually just a compliance review?

Most people are lazy. they will apply to 100 different jobs with same cvs. if you start tailoring your cv per job application. your odds shoot up high. if you apply to jobs with 0.5% odds of landing a job per application. then you will have a 63% of landing one in 200 apps, 77% in 300 apps,86% in 400 apps and 91% in 500 apps. Its all a volume game. and if you tailor your cvs right the odds can shoot up from 0.5% to higher. I use statistics and probability to cope .|||It is normal to feel stuck and feel like time is slipping. But we can't learn everything in a day. It takes time and consistency.

I don't know what works anymore. On the flip side it seems like more and more work is getting outsourced as the skill of people outside of the western countries have started to level up and with AI it seems like people everywhere are going to level up massively or equally.  What I see is crucial for the future is AI literacy, being able to leverage coding agents and be productive with it. But from my experience you need experience building applications to have good intuition with these AI agents. So if I was to give advice to people who want to stay in this field learn system design, architecture and build projects to implement them. Don't one shot applications/project. Build something complicated enough with these coding agents that you are forced to review the code, and if something feels unmaintainable learn to drive these agents in a way that you understand what you are building. And if you want to really stand out just build in public X, YouTube, tik tok but easier said than done cause us engineers by default are introverted. Just know that it's not you the market is just brutal, less hiring AI fear mongering holding new hires.  I spend too time in the X AI bubble so might not relate but this is where I see things heading. Maybe AI will be the level up that will bring more jobs to countries like ours so if I have hedge my bets it will be coding agents, system designs and building your own stuff.  It's one of the worst time to be a software engineer and also one of the best time both are true chose which reality you want to pick.",

Despite being independent, Balen was able to work with them and produce results.   Now Balen has whole RSP behind him and he can be even more effective.   Arko most important thing is no corruption allegations against Balen.|||https://preview.redd.it/dwlm7a9sv0gg1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6235b0fc08dcc9d98fb462fc1373baa63f7c92b5  Dont say anything else this didi will cry that balen did nothing|||The works mentioned aren’t very much transformative and these works are done by most of the mayors across the country. Here’s point wise breakdown of things he has done that are more media boosted to show fairytale: 1. Scholarships: there was an existing rule that all private schools should give 10% scholarships to poor and talented students. I don’t deny some of schools tried to not meet 10% quota as the law but balen hasn’t done that all by himself. 2. Book free fridays are a good initiative from him and a new concept that students should focus on different aspects rather than only books. I like this decision of him. 3. Student lunch of rs25 is given from municipalities across nepal and it is mandated by local laws and noone can give less than 25 but they can increase based on spending capacity of the local government. So this is not the magical thing only he has done it is an automatic process by law. 4. Hospital beds: same story as scholarships, 10% beds should be subsidized according the law. He hasn’t done it but the existing laws have done, however the concern is some of the hospitals try to skip this csr. It is also implemented in most of the local governments across nepal. 5. He has done a good job to keep waste out of the city but as mentioned in this post “recycling “ as he had agenda to produce electricity upto 5MW from waste daily. Where is the electricity or a recycling plant? All the waste are dumped into banchare danda which effects severly to locals and their health. He fould have done better! 6. Tukucha and other rivers: there was a lot of hype arond these, but he just broke some infrastructure and left. No any restoration or pretective progress around those broken infrastructure. Such damaged infrastructure affects local residents in their daily life what about that? Could have done better! 7. He has built some falchas which look good! But the catch is the issue that came up with the amount of budget used to make falchas. There was a news that a falcha was made out of about 60 lakhs? He hasn’t clarified anything regarding this also. I agree heritage works are expensive but how was the tender process gone? As much i know mostly mahanagar handed out contracts directly without tender/bidding processes. It’s a grey zone for corruption and I can’t defend him in this context.  8. A very good work of him is retaining the encroached lands!! It was a vote bank for communists from a long time and noone could dare touching those sukumbasis and he dared. However he faced a lot of backlash but I appreciate his work in this matter. 9. He has managed parking and footpaths well! But the footpaths claim aren’t much visible on ground as claimed to be 250 places. It’s mostly around newroad and other areas still have narrow or no footpaths. It’s a media manufactured noise so he could have done better. 10. New busparks? Really? Where are the new busparks? Please enlighten me anyone. 11. Street lights: it’s not a huge number a mentioned in the post as ktm city is very big compared to these number and he could have done better! However he has installed some fire hydrants in inaccessible places which is very admirable. Also he had promised to install cctv across ktm while election campaigns, he could have done that at least  a pilot project in some places?  12. Digital: his live meetings is appreciable as transparency however it’s more of his favorable thing as he could have faced pressure inside a room full of oldies! Now he’s not facing any media or questions ?   Conclusion His delivery is below average than most municipalities in the country. However some of the efforts are genuinely impressive but most of the needed works can’t be done in his tenure. As ktm has budget of 25 arba+ yearly it couldn’t invest/spend a bare minimum of 25% each year! It’s far beyond national spending which is around 38%. He could have done better! For the present context he should face media do debates and present his idea of development and plans for it to the public. Everyone should be accountable and noone is”GOD”  This was a critical analysis of balen shah’s mayoral tenure.|||This too when the whole system was against him  Top dheki bottom kasaile kaam garna didaina thiye|||Actually hamlai physical development vanda pani suru ma policy level ma changes ra existing rules ko implementation chaiyeko cha!|||102 ko ambulance was a great help .

Him reclaiming public property and the waste management is way better. But he still underdelivered on a lot of his campaign promises. Kathmandu still remains one of the most polluted city in the world and he did nothing to help improve that. He promised improvements to the public transport, but didn't do anything. There are dozens of other promises like more accessible public toilets, improving drainage system, roads, environments, etc all of which he fell short on. I understand that not all of the campaign promises can always be achieved. But the problem is that he has such a cult of personality that people act like he's beyond questioning. And that always leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  I hope that he wins, we're long overdue on big leadership changes. These old corrupt politicians have to be weeded out and Balen feels like a best opportunity to do that. But when he wins, I hope people start holding him accountable to his duties and his words. Otherwise, we'll just be repeating the same cycle.|||Let's not still try to hype him more than he deserves. This man has done things that no one dared to do but everything that he did was very ground-level stuff that the public can easily see and praise him for. It is understandable to try and make changes while you have the authority so I do give him the benefit of the doubt. If he does win this election and does things that can really paint a picture for a better future for Nepal then I'll be convinced that we have finally found a leader. Until then I would like to be skeptical. I do not want to give myself up to the idea of him being the perfect leader for our country, I do not want to grow up with this fantastical image of him in my mind and turn into a blind follower like much of the oldies. I admire him and his attempts but nothing that has actually won me over. Still better than anyone else though.|||What is did is not the question. The question is how many promises he implemented. The work listed here are some done by central government. He did the work for creating contradiction. I have not seen anything that is sustainable. Of being a mayor of the biggest metropolitan city people have expected much more.|||Balen is one of those rare leaders who didn’t come from the usual political pipeline and that’s exactly why people trust him. He speaks straight, works on the ground, and isn’t afraid to upset powerful interests if it means doing the right thing. Whether it’s cleaning up Kathmandu, enforcing rules equally, or calling out corruption, he leads with action more than words. You may agree or disagree with some decisions, but you can’t deny his courage, independence, and intent to change the system rather than benefit from it…he may not be perfect, but he is the best among the current political leaders.|||Tyo education ko each and every point already existing chij ho sarkar le nai dinxa Lunch money ta..

It was the norm everybody accpeted. That culture changed. Anyone who lived in Kathmandu in last 9-10 years can feel the difference.  Second, he gave people hope.

Communism is really stupid if you look back at humanity now.|||This should be categorised as fictional book|||some deep shit ! ... op is not asking for superficial answer|||Technically, yes, he wrote the manual. But, Marx was a man who saw a disease but prescribed a medicine that was more toxic than the sickness. He wanted to fix the world by changing who owns the \"stuff\" without changing the \"human being\" who uses the stuff.  ​When you try to enforce \"equality\" through a state, you don't get a paradise; you get a prison. This is why Marxism has failed wherever it was tried as a rigid political tool.  ​Why \"Harkabad\" is the Antidote TODAY:  ​The reason we look toward a philosophy like Harkabad (Prakriti, Samskriti, Pravidhi) instead of Marxism or Western Capitalism is because it addresses the foundation, not just the \"economics.\" Harka Smapang has time and again said it has nothing to do with his name. He is suggesting a solution that isn't a western copy but suitable to the soil we stand on.   ​Marxism says: \"Who owns the factory?\" ​Capitalism says: \"How much can the factory produce?\" ​Harkabad says: \"Do we even need the factory if it kills the river (Prakriti) and destroys the community's soul (Samskriti)?\"  If you ask me if we need \"Harkabad,\" I would say we need Consciousness.  ​Harka Sampang is essentially bringing consciousness to governance. When he goes out and carries stones with his own hands (Shramadaan), he is moving from the \"ugly\" socialism (taking from others) to the \"wonderful\" socialism (giving of oneself).  ​We don't need a \"Communist\" revolution where blood is spilled to change the law. We need a \"Harkabad\" style evolution where sweat is spilled to restore the land. ​You don't need a book from 19th-century Germany to tell you how to live. You just need to look at the earth beneath your feet and the people around you.",

Were those AI-generated, as your party president and many party leaders were claiming?  - You have raised the Sahakari Kanda involving Rabi Lamichhane, but when will you raise the same question about your own party member, Maya Rai, who was also a member of the same sahakari in Kathmandu (I’ve forgotten the name)? What about the Dhanraj Gurung sahakari case?  - You were part of the Government Efficiency team when the recent UML–Congress coalition government was formed. Will you question or take responsibility for the recent GenZ killings? Your party member Ramesh Lekhak was also the Home Minister at that time—have you questioned him about this?  - You have been a Member of Parliament four times, and during your tenure, the Congress has formed the government multiple times. Can you point to any concrete, policy-level achievements you delivered during your party’s time in government?  - What about Aftab Alam case during your party's government was he rightfully being prosecuted or your party's government have him impunity from jail, what about that case?",

Free from:  All blame linked to Arzu  All accusations about money in Deuba’s house  All baggage related to Bhutani saranarthi  All the kandas, Teramox, and backroom deals  All blame connected to Lekhaks and their networks  These were never Gagan’s sins to carry.  So why should he keep answering for other people’s cults? Why should a reformist voice be held hostage by the corruption, compromises, and power games of an old guard that refuses to let go?  If anyone needs to answer, it’s the system that protected those networks for decades—not the one who finally challenged them.  Gagan doesn’t need to answer anymore. The Mahadibesan already did.|||He can give you wai wai, not sure about answers.

Don't get me wrong there are shortcomings from him and nobody is perfect but most of the questions you raised here are poor attempt to make him look bad.  You have to realize that even though Gagan is a prominient member of Nepali Congress, he was never the executive. Every decision the party makes as a whole, the chairman (Deuba) has the supreme authority and he is little to no say in any of the decisions.  Even then, he has clearly spoken against all wrongdoings. And you say \"just speak\". But that's the problem of not being in executive power, he can only speak.  You trying to  make the money burnt in Deuba's house somehow a crime by Gagan Thapa clearly tells me that you are just trying to hate. Otherwise as everyone else has said, there is a special probe commission formed to specifically study the burnt money case and all we can do is wait for their report and the government will file the case if there is wrongdoing (which we all believe there is). And Gagan has clearly affirmed this, as any sane person would. You should read him and listen his many public interviews/videos and not just assume he didn't say anything.  He has clearly said multiple times that any and all involved in sahakari kanda should be investigated including naming people from his own party by name, again multiple times in multiple of his public appearences and writings, you should read/watch/listen those. The government should file cases. I don't understand how this would be his fault.  If you again watch his comments in good faith and listen to his parliament speeches, he as said multiple times that  the public is angry, they need delivery. He said he opposed the coalition and publicly opposed it multiple times. But he is not the executive, deuba is. When there is coaliation, he has the moral responsibility to make the government successful. He was indeed in the efficiency team and he said he tried is best to make the government successful because he knew people needed delivery even though he opposed the coalition. He publicly told long before the Gen-Z protest that he couldn't get the government to do what the efficiency team was supposed to do, and he left it. So I don't think that makes him culpable for the massacre during gen-z protest.  But still he has taken moral responsibility for what happened during the protest. He has apologized multiple times for any moral culpability he has. He said he immediately asked the party leadership to break coaliation in the first day of protest and asked Lekhak to resign. Lekhak did resign but the party didn't leave coalition because again Deuba is executive and makes the decision.  He has been parliament member four times. The first time and he failed to deliver the constitution as promised which he was elected for. The second tenure was again the CA election, which delivered the constitution and you can't deny he played crucial role in making the constitution, and he (among all others) delivered the constitution. The next term he went to the parliament again and became health minister and people say he delivered some reforms in health sector (again refer to public catalogues of his works during this tenure). And you have to grant that he has been constant voice in the parliament on various issues, which the MP is sent for. This last time was a short tenure, but as everyone he has played crucial role in voicing concerns in the parliament. Ironically he strongly demanded there be independent probe in sahakari case and there have been multiple arrests and cases filed against some major fraudsters. You should grant that this was successfull. But we can always demand more. I am not his prabakta but to me seems like he could have definitely done more here and I am sure he agrees.  Yeah what about the case? Alam was a proven convict. But congress did dirty by lobbying to release him. I haven't seen him support Alam's release. Again, I am not sure the details of his release but how is Gagan culpable for the crime Alam committed?  Again I am not his prabakta. I try to speak with reason. You could certainly question that he didn't do enough at policy level as MP to propose new laws and pass them. You could ask him that he could not do enough to break Deuba stronghold. But he precisely did that recently.  Now I am watching him closely, he is now in the position to deliver at least from his party level. Make him accountable ask him tough questions. But the aforementioned questions seemed more like an attempt to make him bad (except may be how many policy changed did he make in 1 1/2 tenure as MP except CA MP which they delivered constitution).

Clearly power structure within congress “was” too centralized, and being able to dismantle chokehold of elderly folks on Congress power alone wins my kudos. Regarding the issues you mentioned, great if he can denounce them but at least if it is not repeated again I will see it as progress.|||Congress will be a good opponent in the parliament.   Also, what's up with Rakshya Bam joining Congress?|||He might be worst than Deuba. At least Deuba doesn’t speak himself, but he is worst in all scenarios. He will mask everything with his words and media management.|||go email him and ask him directly. it is fair to question the person involved instead of turning everything into noise. tiktokey neta haru le barbad garne nai vayo at this point. all i can say is gagan is a well versed politician, still young, and someone who could probably handle being prime minister twice pretty flawlessly. not some fantasized rapper turned politician, wildly inconsistent, barely diplomatic when on ganja, and clearly not serious half the time. another one is purely opportunistic kavi lamichhane, the way he jumped into a ghatiya party just to grab griha mantralaya and settle scores with kantipurey says everything. no clear vision. he was genuinely good as a reporter but that does not translate to governance. in nepal,, politics honestly looks like the better career now, everyone villainizes wealth blindly while actors and influencers walk straight into parliament. for god’s sake, what are kaji or hakukaley planning next, film shooting inside parliament? it blows my mind.

It doesn’t feel like tourism anymore it feels careless.On top of that, the local leadership has also disappointed me.

I know why he is liked by so many given how dysfunctional your political system as been lately, but Balen's performance during his stint wasn't that great either. Sadly, no culture of constructive criticism in Nepal.|||I am satisfied with his work because I know it’s not easy. The system itself is messed up, so obviously one person alone can’t fix everything on their own. There will be tons of hurdles, especially in the capital city of the country. Not just the capital, honestly, you can even say Kathmandu as Nepal itself, because it has become the center for everything. No matter what work you have, you somehow have to come to Kathmandu for it. So yeah, I understand his situation.  The one thing I really criticize him for is his lack of communication. That is something I am very disappointed about. During his entire campaign, he kept saying that he wouldn’t be like previous mayors and that he would stay in constant communication with the public. But after winning, he almost completely stopped connecting with people. There is no proper accountability, just one-sided Facebook status updates. This is the part where I am extremely disappointed in him and openly criticize him.  Other than that, I think he has actually shown that work can be done. He has also given inspiration to young people to enter politics.|||Done In some ways  . Even non Exciting programs .Some Jhara tareko type. Some Unfeasible .. some better options appear and done.

In that case, tax is deducted twice: first by the platform itself (approximately 3.5%), and then another 5% TDS is deducted here.

First, you’re told to learn:   HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, Python, C, C++, SQL, React, Angular, Vue, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL.

Sure, it is not realistic to overlook the economy or the job scarcity that is so prevalant now, maybe for the longest time yet but it doesn't adjucate to the premise of Software Engineering isn't feasible as a career anymore, at least to the degree people are making it out to be. AI-driven development may very well be a 'bubble', and when it pops and the dust settles, the next big thing will provoke a similar reaction. While it is evident that people with years of experience are at a loss right now, and even more so for students trying to make it in tech, undergrads or young aspirants.  I believe it was never about how greatly any technology overshadows the current technology even if it transforms areas of it by overwhelming amounts but the ability to use it to your advantage. That is how you thrive here. You embrace, and not reject. AI cannot replace engineering but it does accelerate aspects of it that if you don't keep up, you get left behind. I mean, with AI-driven development so rampant right now, startups are at an all time high. People adapt and make it work. That mindset is obligatory now more than ever. Well, I could be speaking regardless of facts that I have yet to know, but I stand firmly on my grounds of not rejecting engineering as it has never been easier than now.|||I have 4 YOE.

An industry can only take so many people before saturation, especially in face of disruption / paradigm shift as is the case now. As with any other field, you have to dedicate time and effort to be good and stay good. If you are a computer engineer worth your salt, you know it's a lot more about structured and critical thinking, problem solving skills and architecting solutions than coding in the field, and if you have the basics right, tech stack changing shouldn't scare you as much.  As with any other field, only the most committed, knowledgeable and competent people will remain in the industry and that should always be the case. The gold rush is over.|||Difficult times? Yes.

AI leh job lehla tara aileh chai dherai sajilo vaxa 🤣|||So start standing out. I am a 2 years experienced backend developer and I did this sprints task in just 2 days. Everything was finalized with the product owner and I researched a bit in the code base what existing tested methods exist. Then boom, give cursor clear instructions. Done in 10 minutes. So then I realized what I have in hand that an inexperienced ones have - already useful skill, product knowledge and codebase knowledge. That is helping me in productivity. But the real growth and survival will happen if I gain the skills of a lead like a team lead, a manager, a product owner, or solution architect or any kind of lead is fine. And you won’t see many leads in a team. Leads are already out standing. So You have to figure out how you can be the lead.|||All|||AI will **replace a significant portion of developers**, and not in some distant future. This is already happening, and it will accelerate rapidly over the next 12–24 months as AI tools get mass-adopted inside companies.  That said, the outcome isn’t as simple as “developers are done.”  What’s actually happening is a restructuring of value.  As companies begin laying off junior and mid-level developers, they won’t eliminate development teams entirely. Instead, they’ll rely on fewer, highly reliable developers who can handle much more work with the help of AI. This creates a paradoxical situation: layoffs on one side, high demand on the other, but only for the right people.    If you come from a development background, the smartest move right now is simple:  * Become exceptional at using AI as a force multiplier. * Just knowing how to code won’t be enough anymore. That used to be the differentiator; now it’s table stakes.    **What matters now is:**  * Knowing how to think in systems * Translating vague requirements into clear specs * Using AI to generate, refactor, test, debug, and ship faster * Understanding architecture well enough to spot what AI gets wrong * Owning a specific niche deeply enough to solve high-value problems quickly    Companies won’t pay top dollar for someone who can “do everything moderately well.”  They will pay very well for someone who can fix a very specific, painful problem reliably.  And let’s be honest: saying “AI won’t replace humans” is already outdated. It has started replacing roles; not because AI is perfect, but because it’s good enough when paired with the right person.  If a non-technical person, like myself, someone who loves tech but never formally learned coding, can now build a full-fledged system using tools like ChatGPT and Replit, then the competitive bar has fundamentally shifted.  AI isn’t coming for jobs.   It’s coming for generic skill sets.    **So the choice is clear:**  * Either level up into a top-tier senior developer who designs systems, makes decisions, and leads execution * Or become a highly specialized mid-level developer with deep expertise in one niche and excellent AI leverage  Anything in between is the danger zone.  This isn’t a threat, it’s an opportunity.  But only for those who adapt early and intentionally.  Cheers!|||Lmao CRUD/landing page ta garihaalxa ni.

Limit the number of projects. As you said, if it's a small notebook only and you provide link to the project it devalues your profile.  Bring skills below the about me section.

Swap 2 of them for something else (like Finance or E-commerce) to show you can handle different types of data. Flex that MLOps project: Move the ICU Deterioration one to the top! It’s your best flex because it mentions monitoring and drift (Prometheus/Grafana). That’s exactly what remote MLOps recruiters are looking for. Make Demos \"One-Click\": Make sure those [Demo] links go to a live site (Streamlit/Hugging Face). For remote jobs, if they can't see it working in 5 seconds, they might skip it.

This has now gotten out of hand, and this type of behavior will surely spread to other tourist areas, especially those closer to the border like Sauraha and others. I have seen these 'tourists' in Thars and other SUVs riding recklessly on our highways, mocking our rules and laws. In my local area in the Terai, there have been a couple of incidents where such SUVs have hit locals, including traffic police, and fled to India.  Let's continue to do what we can from our end - I have reported the videos and his channel, and let's keep reporting those videos wherever we find them, and from any other Indian 'YouTubers'. Influencers from Pokhara need to raise their voices collectively on other popular social media channels like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Local influencers need to unite and raise this issue from their platforms in their individual capacities. Otherwise, we might be just one incident away from breaking news.  I will share this thread with a popular Indian YouTube journalist-The Deshbhakt. I have been following him, and he has made videos on such stupidity by Indian tourists.

We talk about decentralization, Federal system, we claim to have provincial capitals, yet when it comes to real power, real identity, and real rights, we are still forced to knock on Kathmandu’s doors. Why should that be? Kathmandu should be a place we visit by choice to walk its Streets, to bow our heads at Pashupatinath, Swayambhnath... not a place we are compelled to go just to be heard.|||I have seen his public speeches, they have never sounded as good as he does here.

Minor improvements to streets and basic municipal actions are being celebrated as extraordinary achievements, while far more serious national issues are at stake.  Nepal is a country with a deep-rooted identity, culture, and values that have existed for centuries. Yet today, we seem to be losing our sense of judgment, influenced heavily by social media popularity rather than thoughtful evaluation. In the process, we are slowly drifting away from our ethics, integrity, and understanding of how we should act as citizens and how we should choose to be governed.  Governance should not be reduced to visibility and viral moments. Appreciation must be based on substance, responsibility, and long-term impact, not hype. Otherwise, we risk mistaking short-term popularity for genuine leadership|||Balen will win for sure |||सबका सब हामीलाई वेवकुफ बनाईरहेछ… बाले भाईले पनि बनायो।|||Isnt RSP against provincial system.|||But wtf is he saying ? 😭",

RaSaPa ko ki Mutton Kaji Farm ko?|||Lol, honestly I didn’t even know he had uploaded something yesterday, but my post had perfect timing and it blew up. Even Bibek Thapaliya was hiding his affiliations, and KMAG still hides theirs. This guy just picked up that post and used it to make himself look good again.  I know how biased he is or maybe he doesn’t even realize how he got used. This is how Gagan operates. He invites these influencers, keeps them close, so they don’t post or make content against him. By doing these meetings, he slowly creates a soft corner in their mind and heart. So later, when Gagan messes up, they hesitate to criticize him because they’ve met him personally and think, “He’s a good guy.”  This is also how Gagan has managed to influence journalists across different media houses. Not all of them are in his inner circle, but he subtly shapes how they think. He invites them, talks to them, and slowly pushes the narratives he wants—who’s bad, what’s bad, and how to counter certain people.  The social media ban happened when Congress was in government, right? He won’t openly say, “Support me” or “Make things favor me,” but indirectly he keeps planting ideas like, I’m the only one who can fix this, and stuff like that.  This is a very familiar pattern with Gagan Thapa. First, influencers like these create noise online, and once it starts getting attention, he jumps in and talks about the issue as if he really cares. If he genuinely cared about social media, he could’ve spoken up against the social media ban when Congress was in power.  Even during the Gen Z protest, he subtly planted leaders like Tanuja and Rakshya Bam through his media outlet, Setopati. Their interviews were pushed again and again, filling the feed with news about what Rakshya and Tanuja were saying. Slowly, that turned into posts supporting Gagan Thapa. In the end, neutral and unaware people start feeling like, oh, Gagan is the hero we were looking for, just because these figures they follow are also backing him.  Ask him if he made any contents on Gagan Thapa?  \\-  Did he made video when Congress tried to sneak in a loophole in the cooling period? What happened to Khatiwada then after?  \\- Did he made how gagan thapa surviving without doing a single job?  \\- When Congress/UML tried to pass 5 years corruption expiry bill.  \\- Even to debunk PACT corruption where Gagan Thapa was alleged, even to debunk the allegation. (he wont, cz truth or not, many will know about this case and will have -ve perception of Gagan)  \\- Why is he surrounded and hangs out with Goons?  \\- Why WikiLeaks has Gagan Thapa as key embassy contact?  No, he won’t do that, because he’ll always have a soft corner for Gagan Thapa. That’s how Gagan Thapa works he spreads narratives through influencers like him, who knowingly or unknowingly end up producing such content.  Another example is Gagan doing small meetings on “populism” and then letting influencers create content around that topic to “spread awareness.” For influencers, it looks like he’s thinking about the nation. But from Gagan’s point of view, he knows those influencers will create content that ends up being subtly targeted at new faces.  https://preview.redd.it/x4nqjclj1veg1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=5303b0b09e8b772195bbc2a80116bd3b9f25bdb5|||RONB le tetro Balen ko chusekai chusai cha ta 3 4 barsa bata yo vanda badi jholagiri ta kai dekhechaina kunai media le koi lai gareko.

Otherwise we would still be living in a society where caste comes before everything else. If you read the constitution you'll realize inclusiveness is given the highest importance. Our current constitution is the proof that maoist revolution has succeeded socially. Yeah in the economic aspect it has failed but socially I don't think we would be where we are today without the maoist revolution.|||Yo budo rukum bata uutheya cha|||Yo buda ta mastermind ho mastermind kp vanda 10 guna mastermind|||Wydm jail for 17k death.

Isn't that really obvious though?|||Thats like asking, “Was Jesus a christian?”. Jesus was born as a Jew, but later promoted his own teachings. Likewise, Karl Marx was born in some form of monarchial bureaucracy, and later promoted his own philosophy( or idea). IMO, he was a communist because his belief lead to hundreds of communist revolutions throughout.|||K k ho yo communist ani yo aru k k ho socialist jata tatai xa aaile but don't know its meaning|||Ts ain’t tuff bub…|||[deleted]|||Was Adam Smith Economist?|||https://preview.redd.it/heqwwqodiffg1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c083dc45d51b17d83926436f0ff4538f13bac12b|||Did Hitler hate Jews 🤔|||\"Is KP Oli a child killer ?\" ahh question|||tait muji reddit ma ni sab pakhe nai hune raixan. basic humour ni bujhdainan. comment section checks out|||Is Bruce wayne Superman ?|||Yeah. Communism is really stupid if you look back at humanity now.|||This should be categorised as fictional book|||some deep shit ! ... op is not asking for superficial answer|||Technically, yes, he wrote the manual. But, Marx was a man who saw a disease but prescribed a medicine that was more toxic than the sickness. He wanted to fix the world by changing who owns the \"stuff\" without changing the \"human being\" who uses the stuff.  ​When you try to enforce \"equality\" through a state, you don't get a paradise; you get a prison. This is why Marxism has failed wherever it was tried as a rigid political tool.  ​Why \"Harkabad\" is the Antidote TODAY:  ​The reason we look toward a philosophy like Harkabad (Prakriti, Samskriti, Pravidhi) instead of Marxism or Western Capitalism is because it addresses the foundation, not just the \"economics.\" Harka Smapang has time and again said it has nothing to do with his name. He is suggesting a solution that isn't a western copy but suitable to the soil we stand on.   ​Marxism says: \"Who owns the factory?\" ​Capitalism says: \"How much can the factory produce?\" ​Harkabad says: \"Do we even need the factory if it kills the river (Prakriti) and destroys the community's soul (Samskriti)?\"  If you ask me if we need \"Harkabad,\" I would say we need Consciousness.  ​Harka Sampang is essentially bringing consciousness to governance. When he goes out and carries stones with his own hands (Shramadaan), he is moving from the \"ugly\" socialism (taking from others) to the \"wonderful\" socialism (giving of oneself).  ​We don't need a \"Communist\" revolution where blood is spilled to change the law. We need a \"Harkabad\" style evolution where sweat is spilled to restore the land. ​You don't need a book from 19th-century Germany to tell you how to live. You just need to look at the earth beneath your feet and the people around you.",

The feeling of lying in the bed with inherent thoughts of disperse happiness and the want to be able to understand if that happiness is as true as it seems is not new and it's also not wholly mine   I look at all these motion picture hoping to find something. And what that might be is as ananomus to me as it is to you. I look at these things, listen as they talk, but the existence of this feeling of watching doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm lying on this virgin earth, unmolested and untouched, devoid of any feeling of any sort except for one; consciousness. The consciousness reigns supreme within and without all within the vicinity of my existence.  At this point, life as you call it feels not a moments passing by or time flowing like my thoughts.  My head feels particularly heavy, as if I'm thinking but a thought is yet to process. But how can this be? Without a thought, how can you think? How can one live, without knowing the value of death? But that's not right either. For one to know the value of death,.one must first know of its qualities, it's feature in all it's dimensions. The inherent idea of a thought being, and to think not sounds stupid as if not funny enough. But you can't overlook the idea behind such ponder.   I take very long breaths as I think. My heart beats loud enough for me to hear it. And all my bodily functions seems very much obvious to me. This isn't new but it's not wholly mine.   Ahh now my head hurts a little to. But this shall too pass.   Theres this lingering feeling of solitude that I feel very sensationally. For solitude has been my friend far longer then any. The silence that made me feel alone after some years felt not pleasing but good enough to make me feel a bit stingy if it got disturbed.  But now this solitude engulfs me, strangles me so that I choke these thoughts out of me which are yet to be. But it was this very solitude that made me form a thought but now it want it back. Like how death waits right Infront of you, lingers above you with it's hands around neck, and then takes you through the stairs of lifelessness while you climb oblivious. Similar is the solitude that I experience right now, but instead of lifelessness, I climb and climb but towards nothing, I climb and climb but climb on empty thoughts.

            "body": "This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

My dad brought quite a few for me from KTM every few months, and I used to colour, solve crosswords etc. I event sent crossword solutions (never got published). This is where I knew about sudoku and still love sudoku to this day. I have read a lot of stories in this magazine and some of them  have been life changing for me. I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.  Few years later, through sheer luck (and a bit of reputation in my Nepali class), I got to be the guest editor of one edition of this magazine. Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र). I still absolutely vividly remember that letter, the paper, the handwriting, almost the content (almost 20 years later). The sender had found my information from the guest editor section.

They tend to look down on Nepali people from Nepal, and that attitude clearly comes out in conversations.|||[removed]|||Let's not place the victory of white supremacy on the feet of (in our cases) brown people. Yes, these sorts of Nepali people do exist, as the saying goes \"not all skin folks are kin folks\" but that doesn't mean they represent all nepali immigrants.

That said, Plenty of Nepali immigrants, their kids, etc. are pissed as hell about it and are pushing back in what capacity they can.  Also, this is one of the worst times to go to the US as a brown person. I'm pretty worried about all my Nepali community members stateside right now.  Nothing but love for our nepali people, Whether in Nepal, US or anywhere else in the world.|||[removed]|||Yestai hudo rachecha, tbh idc. They got voting rights, aba nepali buddhi lagayera america lai ni nepal kai bato ma jharna lageka chan. So enjoy the show |||Hmm generalizing blatantly. So typical.   I am in US, and I can say 98% of my friends don’t support his policies. There are a few who do but there’s always an exception.   Now many, including myself, do support some level of checks and restrictions on immigration. Those who didn’t get in take that as being opportunistic or slamming the door after I got in. Far from it.   What I don’t support is people coming through illegal means. What I don’t support is people cheating and providing 100% false representation while applying. Then once they get in, they try to game the system and just be a leech sucking in the benefits without contributing. They are making it harder for the legitimate immigrants and that’s exactly what we hate.  Now I don’t support the current position of not granting any immigration visa indefinitely to Nepal. But you know why this happened? Because almost 40% of Nepalis, about 70-80k take welfare benefits from the US government. You don’t need it if you are a contributing member of the society (except for in some disability/age related case).   There are people coming to US to get free medical treatment. One performer got the treatment and left the Us without paying the medical bills- that person is now banned from coming. Another famous pair got the DV and justified their entry by saying they get free medical for their kid (their case may be legit, but I am just giving an example of what people have been doing).   The administration is going to the other extreme to curb this- but some of it is because the past administration didn’t do anything to prevent it from happening.|||I seriously doubt the accuracy of this sentiment. Nepalis who have settled in America invariably work to bring other family members here. The effort is long and hard, and many are still in process, meaning that spouses, siblings, and others are now cut off from coming over. My brother in-law was able to finally secure his wife's visa a few weeks ago, after working on it for 2 years.  a few weeks later and she wouldn't get to come, so no, Nepali uncles and aunties aren't supportive, and there is no indication that most nepalis voted for trump.  The other thing to consider is the message behind the visa suspensions.  The trump administration is basically saying that immigrants who have come here have not improved conditions, but rather they have made it worse by taking advantage of government programs that they are not entitled to. In other words immigrants are lazy, and thieves. Not a lot to take pride in about that.|||Let me know what you are smoking..seems like good stuff.|||Just like the viral trend chori manchey ko khutta tanney chori manchey naai huncha.

I've worked with Nepali people for years at my job, they work remotely from Kathmandu. I got the chance to visit Nepal this year and loved your country. Everyone is so nice, the food is great and there are so many interesting and beautiful places.   I was a little nervous since it was only a few weeks after the Gen Z protest, but everything seemed pretty calm. I thought to myself, wow it'd sure be cool if we could overthrow our government, get rid of trump and be back to normal in a few weeks.   The Nepali living in the us would not feel happy or safe if they lived in my city I guarantee it. Legal or not they're grabbing anyone off the street that isn't white and taking them to a detention center. If they can prove their residency they get released, maybe. It is completely white supremacist Nazi shit. It's horrible and I'm ashamed to be an American. These are my friends and neighbors, I don't ask people what their immigration status is, I could care less.   It's usually portrayed that undocumented immigrants are a drain on government services, but that is a lie. They pay taxes since it's automatically deducted from the paycheck to a social security number that doesn't belong to them. If they try to use the services they're caught and deported  We're fighting back but our leaders are ineffective, the police are working with ICE and if we call in the military we're unsure of whose side they'll take.   Trust me you don't want to visit the US anytime soon|||I am also very happy.|||Same reason you and others who are aspiring to migrate toUS are sad. Immigration is not good for lot of citizens. Higher housing prices, rent, more competition for jobs. Companies benefit from supply of cheap labor while workers suffer from depressed wages.

Why would anyone be happy about the current situation ? All of you who agree with the statement are in Nepal who couldn’t make it to the US.|||May I dare present a different perspective?   Not everyone who votes Republican is \"hiding the ladder since they've made it\". That claim is lazy, false, and ignores basic economic reality.  Some of us vote based on numbers, not slogans. When you are paying over $100,000 a year in taxes (household)—income tax, state tax, property tax, sales tax—and you don’t see proportional benefits in return, fiscal policy starts to matter a lot. At that level, voting conservative isn’t ideological—it’s rational. Lower taxes, limited government, and accountability in spending simply align better with that reality.  Paying six figures into the system and being told you’re “privileged,” “selfish,” or morally inferior for questioning where that money goes is not persuasive—it’s alienating. Wanting to keep more of what you earn does not make you hateful. It makes you financially literate.  Many Republican voters reject racism and extremism outright. What they do reject is runaway taxation, bloated government, and being constantly generalized or morally lectured by people whose policies they fundamentally can’t relate to. The same way not all Democrats are extremists, not all Republicans are villains.  And yes—we are also tired of being lumped together with fringe elements just because we don’t align with extreme progressive ideology. Disagreeing with activist politics, identity absolutism, or ideological purity tests does not make someone anti-human. It means they prioritize practicality over performative outrage.  People vote based on lived experience. For households paying $100k+ in taxes every year, conservative policies often make more sense. That’s not hate. That’s math.",

            "body": "It’s 2026 now, and we’re still having to deal with this.  A few days ago, early in the morning, I was on the street and saw a public bus with people literally hanging from the door. It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

This problem needs to be adressed and public transportation should be well organized and planned.|||Finally, someone spoke about this. This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this. This issue really needs more attention and more noise.|||KTM has enough budget with 40 percent going unused. these transportation comes under metropolitan ko authority. ask Mayor balen.

Were those AI-generated, as your party president and many party leaders were claiming?  - You have raised the Sahakari Kanda involving Rabi Lamichhane, but when will you raise the same question about your own party member, Maya Rai, who was also a member of the same sahakari in Kathmandu (I’ve forgotten the name)? What about the Dhanraj Gurung sahakari case?  - You were part of the Government Efficiency team when the recent UML–Congress coalition government was formed. Will you question or take responsibility for the recent GenZ killings? Your party member Ramesh Lekhak was also the Home Minister at that time—have you questioned him about this?  - You have been a Member of Parliament four times, and during your tenure, the Congress has formed the government multiple times. Can you point to any concrete, policy-level achievements you delivered during your party’s time in government?  - What about Aftab Alam case during your party's government was he rightfully being prosecuted or your party's government have him impunity from jail, what about that case?",

Deuba, as an individual, may once have been a true leader—but over time, the gang culture around him is what turned everything rotten and made him look bhrasta.  From this point onward, Gagan is free.  Free from:  All blame linked to Arzu  All accusations about money in Deuba’s house  All baggage related to Bhutani saranarthi  All the kandas, Teramox, and backroom deals  All blame connected to Lekhaks and their networks  These were never Gagan’s sins to carry.  So why should he keep answering for other people’s cults? Why should a reformist voice be held hostage by the corruption, compromises, and power games of an old guard that refuses to let go?  If anyone needs to answer, it’s the system that protected those networks for decades—not the one who finally challenged them.  Gagan doesn’t need to answer anymore.

Don't get me wrong there are shortcomings from him and nobody is perfect but most of the questions you raised here are poor attempt to make him look bad.  You have to realize that even though Gagan is a prominient member of Nepali Congress, he was never the executive. Every decision the party makes as a whole, the chairman (Deuba) has the supreme authority and he is little to no say in any of the decisions.  Even then, he has clearly spoken against all wrongdoings. And you say \"just speak\". But that's the problem of not being in executive power, he can only speak.  You trying to  make the money burnt in Deuba's house somehow a crime by Gagan Thapa clearly tells me that you are just trying to hate. Otherwise as everyone else has said, there is a special probe commission formed to specifically study the burnt money case and all we can do is wait for their report and the government will file the case if there is wrongdoing (which we all believe there is). And Gagan has clearly affirmed this, as any sane person would. You should read him and listen his many public interviews/videos and not just assume he didn't say anything.  He has clearly said multiple times that any and all involved in sahakari kanda should be investigated including naming people from his own party by name, again multiple times in multiple of his public appearences and writings, you should read/watch/listen those. The government should file cases. I don't understand how this would be his fault.  If you again watch his comments in good faith and listen to his parliament speeches, he as said multiple times that  the public is angry, they need delivery. He said he opposed the coalition and publicly opposed it multiple times. But he is not the executive, deuba is. When there is coaliation, he has the moral responsibility to make the government successful. He was indeed in the efficiency team and he said he tried is best to make the government successful because he knew people needed delivery even though he opposed the coalition. He publicly told long before the Gen-Z protest that he couldn't get the government to do what the efficiency team was supposed to do, and he left it. So I don't think that makes him culpable for the massacre during gen-z protest.  But still he has taken moral responsibility for what happened during the protest. He has apologized multiple times for any moral culpability he has. He said he immediately asked the party leadership to break coaliation in the first day of protest and asked Lekhak to resign. Lekhak did resign but the party didn't leave coalition because again Deuba is executive and makes the decision.  He has been parliament member four times. The first time and he failed to deliver the constitution as promised which he was elected for. The second tenure was again the CA election, which delivered the constitution and you can't deny he played crucial role in making the constitution, and he (among all others) delivered the constitution. The next term he went to the parliament again and became health minister and people say he delivered some reforms in health sector (again refer to public catalogues of his works during this tenure). And you have to grant that he has been constant voice in the parliament on various issues, which the MP is sent for. This last time was a short tenure, but as everyone he has played crucial role in voicing concerns in the parliament. Ironically he strongly demanded there be independent probe in sahakari case and there have been multiple arrests and cases filed against some major fraudsters. You should grant that this was successfull. But we can always demand more. I am not his prabakta but to me seems like he could have definitely done more here and I am sure he agrees.  Yeah what about the case? Alam was a proven convict. But congress did dirty by lobbying to release him. I haven't seen him support Alam's release. Again, I am not sure the details of his release but how is Gagan culpable for the crime Alam committed?  Again I am not his prabakta. I try to speak with reason. You could certainly question that he didn't do enough at policy level as MP to propose new laws and pass them. You could ask him that he could not do enough to break Deuba stronghold. But he precisely did that recently.  Now I am watching him closely, he is now in the position to deliver at least from his party level. Make him accountable ask him tough questions. But the aforementioned questions seemed more like an attempt to make him bad (except may be how many policy changed did he make in 1 1/2 tenure as MP except CA MP which they delivered constitution).

At home, my bags were 23 + 22 kg, and my carry-on was 20 kg.  At the check-in counter, the agent told me to move some items from my carry-on into one checked bag so I’d only have to pay excess for one bag. I did exactly that and reduced my carry-on to 12 kg.  Magically, after this:  •\tChecked bags became 32 kg and 25 kg    •\tCarry-on became 13 kg  Somehow, between weighing the bags at home, weighing them again at the counter, and then re-weighing them a third time, my bags gained weight out of nowhere.  I was exhausted and didn’t have the energy to argue, so they charged me for two excess bags — $80 each. No leeway, no consideration.  To make things worse, the agent openly suggested that if I paid cash and didn’t need a receipt, they could lower the price. At that point it was obvious they were trying to pocket the money. Absolutely shameless.  I paid by card, waited until they gave me a proper Turkish Airlines receipt, and made sure everything was legit.  If you’re flying Turkish Airlines out of Tribhuvan International Airport, I strongly suggest avoiding the chubby girl working at the Turkish Airlines check-in counter. She was incompetent from the start — struggling to even open the computer system and issue a boarding pass, while agents at nearby counters were processing passengers with ease.  Extremely bad service and blatant attempts at corruption. This kind of experience is one of the many reasons I seriously hesitate to visit Nepal anymore.",

Happened to me in airport outside nepal as well.  The main difference is that airport scales are \"trade-legal\" industrial devices required by law to be regularly calibrated for high precision, whereas home scales are consumer-grade gadgets that use cheaper sensors and are almost never recalibrated. Additionally, the environment distorts the numbers; weighing a bag on a soft home carpet or trying to balance a large suitcase on a small bathroom scale often creates a \"lighter\" reading than reality, unlike the airport's large, stable platforms embedded in hard concrete. Because of this, the airport scale is generally accurate, while your home scale is just an estimate that tends to drift.|||[removed]|||Are we allowed to video record our interactions there?

Stood for political, social and economic justice throughout his life and didn't compromise for anything.    He took most of the responsibility and he did make mistakes (and he has accepted them gracefully in is biography).      You see, the problem with our generation is we read too less to judge a person and almost fail to account the then social and political scenario of the country. So, my suggestion would be you read yourself and don't judge him based on my opinion or other few incidents or stories mentioned in the comments.   Personally, He gave me the definition of democracy. Here is one story of his conversation with his nephew Naresh Koirala.   *Naresh himself had been puzzled by his uncle’s decision to accept the result. On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP. Mahendra and Birendra believed themselves to be the savior of common \"*naive\"* Nepali.    While BP simply believed that Nepali people irrespective of their education, culture, caste, religion, sex or whatsoever are capable to choose their leaders themselves and make them responsible.|||One of the greatest writers, Nepal has ever produced.|||This guy high moral values unlike present  Congress.

And this is a clear case of Domestic violence which has been allowed by your emotional attachment with him.|||This is projection.  He's projecting his own cheating behaviour onto you. You said he goes for night outs as well, it's pretty obvious he cheats and when you are late, he automatically assumes you did the same.  Hire a private detective and make your case strong and confront him with evidence.  But if you're actually cheating, that's a completely different scenario.|||It seems like there is more to this story, we heard your side only. Either way you two are done, if you decide to keep together one of you will need to make a huge compromise.|||Seems like you don't have any children, that's a blessing in disguise.

As you have mentioned that even you use to hit him back , you need to understand that if the thing he did was domestic violence than you hitting him back too is a violence, self defence is protecting oneself.  And you have also said ma pani farkauthe ani maan santa parera basthe, if you make him deport or complain about it , it would be hypocrisy.  Either separate with him just never look his face back again or go to a couple therapist.  He have anger issues and he is patriarchal you both guys need therapy and a proper communication.   Seeing people with fake feminism and trusting one side of the coin made me realise what would be your husband's perspective on the topic .  I just you to look for a good therapist because you guys have been together for a long time as you have mentioned that it had been 1.5 years that he had not raised his hands on you    What he did was wrong but don't be hypocrite be  mature and deal with everything maturely|||Domestic violence (yes just one incident counts too) and cheating should be absolute non-negotiable and grounds for divorce. I would divorce in an instant if my husband ever did any of the above to me.|||I am married as well I do have dispute with my wife but your husband behaviour is not tolerable. No matter what at the end I am always the one that go to my wife and say sorry and I have never hit her.

The next steps depend on what you want the outcome to be.   1. If you want mediation and your relationship to continue, have a serious discussion with your husband and let him know what the stakes are, either to work on the relationship together, or to end it. Couples therapy is also helpful for many. There's no point fighting forever. Has anyone else witness the violence, do you have kids? Does your husband drink? Does he have his own social life? Does he have any mental health issues? Many things factor. But a discussion with your husband should be your first thing to do and let him know boundaries and also reflect on yourself too.   2. If you want to end it, depends on where you are. Think through everything and then only decide. If you have kids or not. You need to contact a lawyer as well. What is your financial situation. Do you have any social support nearby as things can get stressful and messy.|||You work so it seems you're independent. Report him to the police. After that live your life as you wish.|||Poila gaideu|||Divorce, police report.|||My suggestion is to leave his ass and file for divorce as well as file a police case for domestic abuse. This is 21st century to be that barbaric; it is normal to be jealous or to have fights as couple but it is never okay to raise hand against each other; and not many functional partners raise hand.   Having someone my close family member go through similar situation before, never believe that abusers will change, kukurko puchhar 12 barsa dhungro ma rakhne ukhan estai manxe lai banaeko ho. Assuming you are in 20s/30s, do you want to spend next 40 or so years of your life with such abuse?    Many people will try to convince you to stay and tell you that he will change but ask to yourself do you truly believe that?  Also you mentioned that “maile pani farkauthe”, if he hits you don’t hit back but report it to police (unless it is life threatening) and also talk to your parents/relatives/friends about it don’t bottle up till too late.  I know sometimes it is difficult to let go because of many reasons (eg. visa issues or money issues) but what if in the heat of the moment he hits you and you get a lifetime disability or even die; so for your own safety, i suggest to dump his ass.|||Leave before its too late|||Hi OP, garo huncha thulo decision lina divorce jastai.

Men are not like this..... Your partner is mentally sick, and you cannot fix him..... Please save yourself.... If he had good soul he'll understand with time, but for now please leave him...... Please find ways to get out from there..... Even if your parents don't support trust me and many others, this is not normal..... For the love of yourself, you should leave asap.|||I just realized you said tmle pani haat haltheu, hmmm.... If you both truly want to work it out.... Now I'm thinking about it after reading your comments that you really love him....   In that case, talk to him what is bothering him, if he has had lot of childhood trauma, stress, unprocessed emotions, it really does affect a person, they become like time bomb and a small trigger can make them very angry ..... Now note that I'm saying this in hopes that you both truly want to work it out..... Talk to him, let him know anger at this level is not normal and he can gently start a talk therapy or men's circles, or somatic healing sessions, emdr therapy (if it's a part trauma), etc. there are so many options in today's time to start a healing journey. I'm in full support for people to move this route, even if you are violent in the past. It's not easy being human and I get it. Please consider, I hope this helps. But please remember, if you are going to lead this journey for both of you, remember to be patient, kind, and loving. Sometimes you will have to let the other person be so angry and be able to watch them (it's a specific emotional release session) without you absorbing their emotions. For him, and for you too probably, when emotions come, you both have to remember it's NEVER about the other person. If you would like each other to do something, you can request but nobody is obliged to follow, just having this much boundary will help you both to process your emotions on your own. Start therapy or just start writing on your own, you will notice you stress or anger is often coming from something else within yourself, not from people around you.   I hope this help a little bit. Take care, pass love to each other. If it's easier, bring serious talk when you are getting romantic, I think that helps you both absorb and understand better. Take care please. It's not impossible to change yourself and your relationships in this time, especially with so much options, start meditation, therapy, dance, especially moving body helps move your emotions too. Take care.|||Just have a conversation with your husband. Ask him why is he is acting like that? IS he insecure about you or what? make everything clear. Why is he acting in that manner? Also, clearly state what you feel about his behaviour. You both will get a chance to understand each other. Make sure he is not going to do it again or what you think will be better. If it get repeated what action will be taken? Let him know. Its either reporting to police or having converstaion with both of your parents or divorce.|||Leave him ask for divorce report to police dont stay|||This is what an emotional vampire is. You've not given any details about his social life, but from your post it can be seen he isn't pleased with you having a social life and is sucking all the joy you've had with your social interactions.  Basically I think he is insecure with himself, but this shouldn't justify him hurting you. It is a whole new country, you might be more scared and feeling like you're in a dark place.

The system itself is messed up, so obviously one person alone can’t fix everything on their own. There will be tons of hurdles, especially in the capital city of the country.

No matter what work you have, you somehow have to come to Kathmandu for it. So yeah, I understand his situation.  The one thing I really criticize him for is his lack of communication. That is something I am very disappointed about. During his entire campaign, he kept saying that he wouldn’t be like previous mayors and that he would stay in constant communication with the public. But after winning, he almost completely stopped connecting with people. There is no proper accountability, just one-sided Facebook status updates. This is the part where I am extremely disappointed in him and openly criticize him.  Other than that, I think he has actually shown that work can be done.

The content is rarely original. It is compiled from existing news articles that anyone could find doing Google. It’s a summary service, not investigative journalism.  2. As it relies on secondary sources, it never goes deep. It stays on the surface of issues, prioritizing smooth editing over raw facts.  3. The channel’s main narrative is simple: 'The country is doomed.' This is a lazy narrative. Telling us that politicians are bad or the system is broken is stating the obvious. It validates anger but offers no insight.  If you want to be entertained, it works. But if you want to be informed, this is a waste of time.",

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.  I (21M) and my sibling (15F) are taking care of our parents during the day and our cousins help at night. Because of this, we’ve missed months of classes but we don’t really have a choice right now.  If anyone is able to help even a small amount, it would mean a lot to us.  I’ve verified the case with two of the mods and I’ll be posting medical reports in the comments as well.  Please DM or comment if you can help in any way. Even sharing this post would really help.",

My friend has come from rural area where she works for winter vacation in KTM. My friend group consists of both male and female and my parents know them all, I talk about them to my parents often. So, plan was made to meet in the evening, I go home, put my bags, tell them I am going to meet this friend, they are angry tell me not to go, I contemplate for a while, but I do want to go so I go to meet them because I don't want to get out of my house on sat which is the only rest day for me. I reach to restaurant, my mother video calls me to show her the \"proof\" that I am meeting this friend. I show her the \"proof\". I am quite angry and disappointed that she doesn't trust. I reach home at around 9pm and now both my parents give me silent treatment, like they don't shout at me but give me silent treatment which I think is even worse... well I think this IS normal in nepali household I just wanted to vent",

He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

I left my job after a year because of a toxic culture. I swear, I couldn't find a position (I was even applying for internships) at any tech company in Kathmandu. I thought it wouldn't be that difficult since I have decent projects and a year of experience, but I remain jobless for next three months. It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

(Should I personally ask them to deduct 5% TDS?)  I also receive USD payments from an EU-based company. In that case, tax is deducted twice: first by the platform itself (approximately 3.5%), and then another 5% TDS is deducted here. When the funds arrive, my bank automatically converts the USD to NPR based on the prevailing exchange rate and credits it to my account in Npr.  I opened a USD account (dollar card) using my PAN. The annual limit is USD 500, but as far as I understand, this limit is only for payments/spending. Is it possible to increase this limit or ask the bank to keep incoming USD directly in that USD account instead of converting it to NPR?  Another question is that, if i’am to receive payments from a subscription based service from a platform apps i made, i basically can’t from nepal, for that i either need the LLC or C-Corp registered in US banks that accepts remote workers no ?  Up to how much extent can nepal banks provide services to be able to pay and receive payments internationally ? Or which banks ? That can win over the limitation of dollar cards ?

But motivation usually comes from showing the path, not just the end result. A screenshot shows where you landed, not how you got there.  People here asked genuine questions about niche, stack, timeline, experience, etc because that’s the part that actually helps others move in that direction. That’s where the value would have been. Without that context, the post ends up reading more like a soft flex than mentorship. Nothing wrong with flexing, just don’t call it motivation if you’re not giving people anything they can learn from or replicate.  With 5+ years of experience you’ve seen enough of the field to know that the “how” matters more than the “what,” especially for people in Nepal who are trying to break into the global market.

Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.

My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights.

As with any other field, only the most committed, knowledgeable and competent people will remain in the industry and that should always be the case. The gold rush is over.|||Difficult times? Yes.

That’s what I suggest.   Decent apps can be build in a day if you know the requirements, understand system design and  logic needed. You need to understand things like how apps are build, deployed etc.  At least in US, Ai replacing engineerings is not exactly false.   With Automated workflows and Ai agents, team needing 100 members could only need couple members. That does mean Ai replaced 98 people among 100. That’s how I see.",

            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

If I have the time, I might join if I'm free. If they were inviting Harvard professors, it'd cost you 10x more to attend. Events take time and effort. Many costs. Let's switch the focus to you. Have you organized an event? Was it easy? Who did you invite as a speaker?   If you're a student, why care about an enterprise AI event? I fail to see your criticisms. Not everybody needs to start a business to prove their credibility. It literally takes <20k.  I don't expect them to cover hf peft best practices. It's an event for enterprises. I don't have expectations for food. If I meet somebody interesting, that's good enough for me.  I think you're being confused between training courses and networking events. Plenty of events if you want to learn. ANAIS, NAAMII charged 12k for students this year. Was fine. Good stuff. Made many friends.  I dislike AI non-profits that claim to do research and fail to have any publications or research projects, yet say they're open to collaborations. But the AI association isn't a research body, probably does just events. Executives don't open up VS code and grind all day. That's a very small minority. They're skilled, just not in a way that appeals to you. They bring in investors, organize events, lots of things. If you ask me, there's a lot more to a product than PRs and merges. If you're not already the Lead for some MNC, some humility helps. It's dumb to say a CEO doesn't have skills because they don't code like you do, don't you think?  I'm not affiliated with naamii or any non-profits.|||On one hand, I can see the low effort poster with multiple mistakes and the fluffy pointless nonsense that is the main paragraph probably written by ChatGPT with a 6 word prompt.

Maybe offer anecdotes? Some tangible verifiable reason to justify your \"nrs 350 for 2.5 hours is a massive waste\".  Organizing an event comes with some cost, and some of that must be passed to the visitor. NRS 350 is some money, it is definitely not a lot of money. It is most definitely not \"expensive\" for an event in any sense of the word.   Justify your claims. Why is this a \"scam\"? What other way can a person \"use nrs 350 to learn by yourself\" (your words)? Who are the speakers and why are they unqualified to speak on this program?  *disclaimer: not affilaited to this org or event*, *just a random angry redditor*",

AI leh job lehla tara aileh chai dherai sajilo vaxa 🤣|||So start standing out. I am a 2 years experienced backend developer and I did this sprints task in just 2 days. Everything was finalized with the product owner and I researched a bit in the code base what existing tested methods exist. Then boom, give cursor clear instructions. Done in 10 minutes. So then I realized what I have in hand that an inexperienced ones have - already useful skill, product knowledge and codebase knowledge. That is helping me in productivity. But the real growth and survival will happen if I gain the skills of a lead like a team lead, a manager, a product owner, or solution architect or any kind of lead is fine. And you won’t see many leads in a team. Leads are already out standing. So You have to figure out how you can be the lead.|||All|||AI will **replace a significant portion of developers**, and not in some distant future. This is already happening, and it will accelerate rapidly over the next 12–24 months as AI tools get mass-adopted inside companies.  That said, the outcome isn’t as simple as “developers are done.”  What’s actually happening is a restructuring of value.  As companies begin laying off junior and mid-level developers, they won’t eliminate development teams entirely. Instead, they’ll rely on fewer, highly reliable developers who can handle much more work with the help of AI. This creates a paradoxical situation: layoffs on one side, high demand on the other, but only for the right people.    If you come from a development background, the smartest move right now is simple:  * Become exceptional at using AI as a force multiplier. * Just knowing how to code won’t be enough anymore. That used to be the differentiator; now it’s table stakes.    **What matters now is:**  * Knowing how to think in systems * Translating vague requirements into clear specs * Using AI to generate, refactor, test, debug, and ship faster * Understanding architecture well enough to spot what AI gets wrong * Owning a specific niche deeply enough to solve high-value problems quickly    Companies won’t pay top dollar for someone who can “do everything moderately well.”  They will pay very well for someone who can fix a very specific, painful problem reliably.  And let’s be honest: saying “AI won’t replace humans” is already outdated. It has started replacing roles; not because AI is perfect, but because it’s good enough when paired with the right person.  If a non-technical person, like myself, someone who loves tech but never formally learned coding, can now build a full-fledged system using tools like ChatGPT and Replit, then the competitive bar has fundamentally shifted.  AI isn’t coming for jobs.   It’s coming for generic skill sets.    **So the choice is clear:**  * Either level up into a top-tier senior developer who designs systems, makes decisions, and leads execution * Or become a highly specialized mid-level developer with deep expertise in one niche and excellent AI leverage  Anything in between is the danger zone.  This isn’t a threat, it’s an opportunity.  But only for those who adapt early and intentionally.  Cheers!|||Lmao CRUD/landing page ta garihaalxa ni.

After +2, I applied to Canada and the USA for further studies, but my visa got rejected. Instead of wasting a year, I joined BBS , and now I’m in my 3rd year.  When the visa didn’t work out, I decided to take responsibility for my own future. I started learning about AI, automation, and new technologies. Over time, I picked up practical skills, experimented a lot, and eventually started freelancing. Right now, I work as an AI Developer on Upwork, and even in the early stage, I’m earning more than 1 lakh NPR per month.  I’m not an expert and I still have a lot to learn but I know my strengths. I’m good at managing things, people, sales, content, and marketing, and I can execute fast. I have learned most of this by consuming real-world information online and applying it through actual work.  I have big plans in the AI space, but I also know that building something great alone is very difficult. That’s why I am looking for a technical co-founder, someone strong on the engineering side so we can build, learn, and grow together.  The idea is to:  * Start very small and lean * No heavy investment * Focus on AI services / automation / agency-style work * Only basic costs like hosting or APIs * Aim to generate revenue within 2–3 months  I currently live with my parents in Butwal, but I want to move to Kathmandu, take a small flat, and fully focus on building. I also plan to start creating content alongside the business.  I’m looking for someone who:  * Is disciplined and focused * Serious about long-term growth * Not into unhealthy habits * Wants a simple lifestyle with deep work * Has strong technical skills or is deeply committed to developing them  Most importantly, I want a co-founder who understands that things won’t always work. There will be hard times, failures, and uncertainty. During those phases, we should push and motivate each other, stay consistent, and keep moving forward. Even if something fails, we should come out smarter, stronger, and more experienced than before.  We don’t need much money to start just enough for basic living expenses. I have savings that allow me to manage accommodation and food for a long time, and I strongly believe we can make this sustainable within a few months.  The goal is simple:   Live together. Build together. Learn together. Grow together.  If you’re technically strong, disciplined, and serious about building a real AI business from Nepal, let’s connect.",

Limit the number of projects. As you said, if it's a small notebook only and you provide link to the project it devalues your profile.  Bring skills below the about me section.

Swap 2 of them for something else (like Finance or E-commerce) to show you can handle different types of data. Flex that MLOps project: Move the ICU Deterioration one to the top! It’s your best flex because it mentions monitoring and drift (Prometheus/Grafana). That’s exactly what remote MLOps recruiters are looking for. Make Demos \"One-Click\": Make sure those [Demo] links go to a live site (Streamlit/Hugging Face). For remote jobs, if they can't see it working in 5 seconds, they might skip it.

This has now gotten out of hand, and this type of behavior will surely spread to other tourist areas, especially those closer to the border like Sauraha and others. I have seen these 'tourists' in Thars and other SUVs riding recklessly on our highways, mocking our rules and laws. In my local area in the Terai, there have been a couple of incidents where such SUVs have hit locals, including traffic police, and fled to India.  Let's continue to do what we can from our end - I have reported the videos and his channel, and let's keep reporting those videos wherever we find them, and from any other Indian 'YouTubers'. Influencers from Pokhara need to raise their voices collectively on other popular social media channels like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Local influencers need to unite and raise this issue from their platforms in their individual capacities. Otherwise, we might be just one incident away from breaking news.  I will share this thread with a popular Indian YouTube journalist-The Deshbhakt. I have been following him, and he has made videos on such stupidity by Indian tourists. I will leave his Instagram link here so that everyone with evidence can share information.

In the process, we are slowly drifting away from our ethics, integrity, and understanding of how we should act as citizens and how we should choose to be governed.

RaSaPa ko ki Mutton Kaji Farm ko?|||Lol, honestly I didn’t even know he had uploaded something yesterday, but my post had perfect timing and it blew up. Even Bibek Thapaliya was hiding his affiliations, and KMAG still hides theirs. This guy just picked up that post and used it to make himself look good again.  I know how biased he is or maybe he doesn’t even realize how he got used. This is how Gagan operates. He invites these influencers, keeps them close, so they don’t post or make content against him. By doing these meetings, he slowly creates a soft corner in their mind and heart. So later, when Gagan messes up, they hesitate to criticize him because they’ve met him personally and think, “He’s a good guy.”  This is also how Gagan has managed to influence journalists across different media houses. Not all of them are in his inner circle, but he subtly shapes how they think. He invites them, talks to them, and slowly pushes the narratives he wants—who’s bad, what’s bad, and how to counter certain people.  The social media ban happened when Congress was in government, right? He won’t openly say, “Support me” or “Make things favor me,” but indirectly he keeps planting ideas like, I’m the only one who can fix this, and stuff like that.  This is a very familiar pattern with Gagan Thapa. First, influencers like these create noise online, and once it starts getting attention, he jumps in and talks about the issue as if he really cares. If he genuinely cared about social media, he could’ve spoken up against the social media ban when Congress was in power.  Even during the Gen Z protest, he subtly planted leaders like Tanuja and Rakshya Bam through his media outlet, Setopati. Their interviews were pushed again and again, filling the feed with news about what Rakshya and Tanuja were saying. Slowly, that turned into posts supporting Gagan Thapa. In the end, neutral and unaware people start feeling like, oh, Gagan is the hero we were looking for, just because these figures they follow are also backing him.  Ask him if he made any contents on Gagan Thapa?  \\-  Did he made video when Congress tried to sneak in a loophole in the cooling period? What happened to Khatiwada then after?  \\- Did he made how gagan thapa surviving without doing a single job?  \\- When Congress/UML tried to pass 5 years corruption expiry bill.  \\- Even to debunk PACT corruption where Gagan Thapa was alleged, even to debunk the allegation. (he wont, cz truth or not, many will know about this case and will have -ve perception of Gagan)  \\- Why is he surrounded and hangs out with Goons?  \\- Why WikiLeaks has Gagan Thapa as key embassy contact?  No, he won’t do that, because he’ll always have a soft corner for Gagan Thapa. That’s how Gagan Thapa works he spreads narratives through influencers like him, who knowingly or unknowingly end up producing such content.  Another example is Gagan doing small meetings on “populism” and then letting influencers create content around that topic to “spread awareness.” For influencers, it looks like he’s thinking about the nation. But from Gagan’s point of view, he knows those influencers will create content that ends up being subtly targeted at new faces.  https://preview.redd.it/x4nqjclj1veg1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=5303b0b09e8b772195bbc2a80116bd3b9f25bdb5|||RONB le tetro Balen ko chusekai chusai cha ta 3 4 barsa bata yo vanda badi jholagiri ta kai dekhechaina kunai media le koi lai gareko.

And everyone knows it is because of high vote share madesh have, and they want to capitalize it. Even beside Balen today every other RSP leader mostly focused on the state matter of Madesh rather than the whole of Nepal, so it is evident that they want to capture proportional candidate vote as much as they can. Every party has some way to approach the election and RSP is following this way.|||हर हर बालेन, घर घर बालेन !|||Yeti ta garnai paro ni PM huna painxa vane.|||KTM ko mayor bhako 3 years bhayecha.. 50% total expense every year...

She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

My nephew, **Liam Thapa**, is battling **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)**.  It is a rare, cruel genetic disease that causes muscles to waste away. Without intervention, boys with DMD lose the ability to walk by their early teens, and many don’t survive past their 20s.  But, there is a ray of hope: A one-time **Gene Therapy (Elevidys)** that can stop this progression. But the cost is a staggering **$2.9 Million USD**.  I am posting from a business Reddit ID to maintain total transparency and accountability.  Yes, we know $2.9M sounds impossible, but we are fighting for every cent.  * Total Goal: **$2.9 Million USD** * Cost in Nepalese Rupees: **Approx. रु 41,92,00,000 (41.92 Crore NPR)** * Raised so far: **$85909** * Remaining: **$2814091**  Liam is nearly 4. This therapy is most effective the earlier it is given. We are racing against time and biological markers that could disqualify him if we wait too long.  I have compiled all medical records, hospital documents from Australia, and identity proofs in a transparent folder for anyone who wishes to verify our story: [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1BHeXMPMnw7DZFLJZM3bBLWGqn7Rp8wc8](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1BHeXMPMnw7DZFLJZM3bBLWGqn7Rp8wc8)  If you can’t donate, please share.

DMD is heartbreaking, and I genuinely hope he gets the care he needs 🙏  Just sharing information for awareness (not to diminish the importance of Elevidys): there are FDA-approved medications available for DMD today that can slow progression and improve outcomes, depending on the child’s mutation and age. These include corticosteroids (like deflazacort or vamorolone), exon-skipping therapies (for specific mutations), and non-steroidal options like givinostat, in addition to gene therapy.  Of course, treatment choice depends on genetic testing, eligibility criteria, and specialist guidance, and early intervention is critical, which I understand is why Elevidys is being pursued.  Posting this only so families reading this thread know there are multiple therapeutic pathways worth discussing with a neuromuscular specialist. Wishing Liam strength, access, and support and hoping this campaign reaches the right hands. 🤍|||.|||I’m so sorry your family is going through this. Liam is lucky to have people fighting this hard for him. 💛    Huge respect for how transparent you’re being with records + receipts! That matters a lot when people want to help. And yes, thank you Elevidys (and the teams behind it) for giving families a real shot at hope.    Boosting this: if you can’t donate, please share. Even one repost can reach the right person/community. Wishing Liam and your whole family strength + a miracle-fast finish line. 🙏🧡|||I am sorry, baby. He is so cute.

Communism is really stupid if you look back at humanity now.|||This should be categorised as fictional book|||some deep shit ! ... op is not asking for superficial answer|||Technically, yes, he wrote the manual. But, Marx was a man who saw a disease but prescribed a medicine that was more toxic than the sickness. He wanted to fix the world by changing who owns the \"stuff\" without changing the \"human being\" who uses the stuff.  ​When you try to enforce \"equality\" through a state, you don't get a paradise; you get a prison. This is why Marxism has failed wherever it was tried as a rigid political tool.  ​Why \"Harkabad\" is the Antidote TODAY:  ​The reason we look toward a philosophy like Harkabad (Prakriti, Samskriti, Pravidhi) instead of Marxism or Western Capitalism is because it addresses the foundation, not just the \"economics.\" Harka Smapang has time and again said it has nothing to do with his name. He is suggesting a solution that isn't a western copy but suitable to the soil we stand on.   ​Marxism says: \"Who owns the factory?\" ​Capitalism says: \"How much can the factory produce?\" ​Harkabad says: \"Do we even need the factory if it kills the river (Prakriti) and destroys the community's soul (Samskriti)?\"  If you ask me if we need \"Harkabad,\" I would say we need Consciousness.  ​Harka Sampang is essentially bringing consciousness to governance. When he goes out and carries stones with his own hands (Shramadaan), he is moving from the \"ugly\" socialism (taking from others) to the \"wonderful\" socialism (giving of oneself).  ​We don't need a \"Communist\" revolution where blood is spilled to change the law. We need a \"Harkabad\" style evolution where sweat is spilled to restore the land. ​You don't need a book from 19th-century Germany to tell you how to live. You just need to look at the earth beneath your feet and the people around you.",

The feeling of my heart having faster and my stomach twisting like an eel holding it's prey is not new to me but still it's not wholly mine.   The feeling of lying in the bed with inherent thoughts of disperse happiness and the want to be able to understand if that happiness is as true as it seems is not new and it's also not wholly mine   I look at all these motion picture hoping to find something. And what that might be is as ananomus to me as it is to you. I look at these things, listen as they talk, but the existence of this feeling of watching doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm lying on this virgin earth, unmolested and untouched, devoid of any feeling of any sort except for one; consciousness. The consciousness reigns supreme within and without all within the vicinity of my existence.  At this point, life as you call it feels not a moments passing by or time flowing like my thoughts.  My head feels particularly heavy, as if I'm thinking but a thought is yet to process. But how can this be? Without a thought, how can you think? How can one live, without knowing the value of death? But that's not right either. For one to know the value of death,.one must first know of its qualities, it's feature in all it's dimensions. The inherent idea of a thought being, and to think not sounds stupid as if not funny enough. But you can't overlook the idea behind such ponder.   I take very long breaths as I think. My heart beats loud enough for me to hear it. And all my bodily functions seems very much obvious to me. This isn't new but it's not wholly mine.   Ahh now my head hurts a little to. But this shall too pass.   Theres this lingering feeling of solitude that I feel very sensationally. For solitude has been my friend far longer then any. The silence that made me feel alone after some years felt not pleasing but good enough to make me feel a bit stingy if it got disturbed.  But now this solitude engulfs me, strangles me so that I choke these thoughts out of me which are yet to be. But it was this very solitude that made me form a thought but now it want it back. Like how death waits right Infront of you, lingers above you with it's hands around neck, and then takes you through the stairs of lifelessness while you climb oblivious. Similar is the solitude that I experience right now, but instead of lifelessness, I climb and climb but towards nothing, I climb and climb but climb on empty thoughts.   My agitated muscles ache in the silence of my breath while my breath gets shorter and heavier each micro instant.",

The goal wasn’t to teach a full curriculum in an afternoon; it was to show these kids that technology isn't out of reach.  As a student-led initiative, we don't have a big corporate engine behind us. We’re just a group of peers showing up and leading where we can. This reel captures some of the curiosity we saw that day—it’s a small start, but a meaningful one.
