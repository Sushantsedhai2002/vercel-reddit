            "body": "Namaste rNepal,  My name is Mahendra. I wanted to share an update about my father’s health and the situation my family is currently facing.  My father has been diagnosed with metastatic gallbladder cancer, which is a very aggressive form of cancer. Since the diagnosis, our days have been filled with hospital visits, tests, medicines and treatment plans. On 30 November, he completed another round of chemotherapy. He is fighting bravely, but the side effects and the emotional strain have been extremely difficult for him and for all of us.  we come from very lower middle class family but with a dream to make me engineer and a good human my dad put all his life and sacrificed everything. He worked as a security guard in india din vari ubhiyar kaam garnu vo , hamro sapna pura garna lai and  i still  wonder \"why us\" ? He never consumed alcohol,cigarette, tombakhu or anything that is said to cause cancer now when he is admitted at hospital the main head of the family and i have to lookafter all the expenses i understand why all it happen. the burden of money to manage for studies, run family and survive was really hard for us but he never show us. That dherai chintaa about managing money became the cause for the cancer ig , chintaa le ni cancer hudo raicha. My dad is now ,, he's a cancer patient god!! I was a guy learning and doing everything to pass exams nthg more than that and still use to feel sometime \"life kati garo cha yrr,, Yo sem  ma pass vaidiana and all,,  and suddenly life put me in a place where I had to become the pillar of the family. being student and not even earning it's being extremly hard for us.  I am doing everything possible  via writing, reaching out, asking for help — because I don't want to lose my father. He is still hopeful. He still smiles even on the hardest days.  We have already used all our savings and borrowed money to continue his treatment. The cost of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, scans, tests and medicines has become overwhelming for our family. With the help of kind people, we have managed to raise a little over NPR 3 Lakhs so far, which helped cover the initial cycles, but we still have many more ahead.  I am sharing this post to provide a clear and honest update about our situation. I am not asking anyone to do work on my behalf. Anyone who wishes to support us in any form may do so if they feel comfortable. Even reading this and keeping my father in your thoughts means a lot to us.

            "body": "everyone's watching gagan thapa's interview but watch this [https://youtu.be/7t6avFyUdlQ](https://youtu.be/7t6avFyUdlQ) video of him speaking in parliament just weeks before bhadra 23 happened. only if the government had listened to him.   Gagan thapa from what I see was always fighting within the party and was always corned because he didn't have grab on the party like deuba did. in party system, you've got to be a party leader before you can have a chance to get executive role and walk the talk. but finally he has the chance to lead the party. i really hope he does.  Gagan thapa who once used to be beacon of hope doesn't have that flair anymore. Nepali society has that tendency to make someone hero every once in a while. 2063 was Prachande, 2072 was Oli, 2080 was Rabi. Gagan Thapa was somewhere there all along as youth face until Nepali society got another hero in face of Rabi. People these days criticize Gagan Thapa for failing to deliver and not meeting the expectations. I remember people wanting Gagan Thapa to be Prime Minister back then but there's no hope from him anymore.  I personally think Gagan Thapa wasn't ready to be PM back then. Yes, his speeches sounded good, yes he had that craze , yes he was a young face in politics but he didn't have experience. Politics isn't as easy as populists think. It needs understanding of how government actually functions. If you've followed gagan thapa for past 6-7 years, he's finally being a mature political face.   after 2074, though congress lost the elections badly against NCP (oli+prachande) , Gagan thapa was constantly saying that party was going to break down on their own.  Later when Congress decided to form coalition with maobadi for 2079 elections, Gagan Thapa constatly stood against that decision and look how that turned out to be. Though Congress became first party, not a single chance to be PM.   Gagan Thapa stood against giving vote of confidence to Prachande when Oli and prachande formed government after elections. Later Prachande betrayed congress and went back to Oli.  Gagan thapa focused that congress should then be a strong opposition until next elections and shouldn't play to form government but deuba didn't listen and supported oli to form government. How that worked out for him - exit from politics by getting pun\\*ched by bunch of gen Zs and public humiliation.  When congress was in government, Gagan Thapa worked relentlessly for a couple of months on few ordinances - the one to let nepali companies invest abroad was significant one and welcomed. but soon the government started losing track and gagan thapa started criticizing the government his party was part of. just a couple of weeks before bhadra 23 happened, gagan thapa was there criticizing government by speaking in parliament. only if government had listened to him lol.  only if deuba had listened to gagan when he was suggesting deuba to take support out from government when oli decided the social media ban, thing would've turned differently.  gagan gets a lot of hate from RSP supporters for being critical about rabi's sahakari case - well, if there was no substantial proof, all 3 tiers of courts wouldn't have put him in custody. I'll say let court decide the case (and thats going to take lots of years , thats how court works in nepal).",

            "comments": "I think Nepal is generally considered safe for travelers, including solo female travelers. However, you have to follow common sense precautions as you would elsewhere.  The normal places that travelers go to, like the popular trekking routes, will be safe besides maybe some petty tourist scams. Off the beaten path, I'd be cautious of scammers more than of safety.   It's a very different situation when compared with India.|||I've been to Nepal on five treks, and think that the Nepalese are some of the nicest people I've met.  I'm an older American male, so my experience may not match yours, but my impression is that you'd be OK.  That said, it's really easy to find travel/trekking companions and guides are very reasonably priced, at least in Western terms.  If you're going on a trek, I'd strongly advise getting a guide for any number of reasons.  A solo female traveler from Germany died just last week, apparently because she followed a route that was on a map but had been abandoned in favor of a less dangerous route.  A guide would have taken her on the correct path.|||It's relatively safe for travellers. But do use caution regardless, even if majority are harmless, the small minority could end up harmful.|||Super safe. Try to avoid overcrowded space just to be safe else you will be fine|||Nepal is safe for foreigners regardless of any gender.|||Yep quite safe actually, you might be scam at some places. Remeber you don’t need to hire guides for a lot of places. Also foreigners usually get charged more so only go to a pkace after checking the review. Also use ride sharing app: indrive, pathao etc etc which will cost you lot less than just hiring taxi from the road. Please avoid public transportation if possible. And no streed food. Incase of diarrhea eats lots of water mix with ORS and not antibiotics or anti diarrhea stuff. Seek medical help if you feel sick.|||Most likely yes except a few regions I believe like some regions of madeshi province and few more backward and underdeveloped  regions because of conservative society.   It doesn't apply to tier 1-2 cities in nepal as people have majorly accepted modernism. Beside scammers I barely feel any threat for female travellers. Nepal is much safer country comparatively and more safer compared to South Asian countries.|||Are you looking for biased-opinions? You shouldn’t be asking it here.|||Avoid bordering towns with india.    Rest of Nepal is safe. Overcharging tourists here and there, petty scams. Avoid creepy places as you'd in any places, basic cautions taken. It's safe.|||Absolutely safe. But there are pickpockets and scammers in the overcrowded \"tourist\" areas so you gotta be vigilant there.|||It is. I see lot of solo travelers in Pokhara. Get away from the creepy guys|||yes|||Be cautious, carry pepper spray let you loved ones know your updated locations. It is safe but can’t trust human nature or natural calamities.|||is safe but there always scammers and some who look at you like crazy .. don’t wear anything too revealing unless you are in club|||Yes, Nepal is generally very safe for solo travelers, including women, as others have mentioned. That said, it’s always wise to stay cautious especially in tourist areas near temples since a few people may try to sell cheap items at inflated prices.  Occasionally, someone might offer help in a friendly way but later expect money, though this is rare. Younger Nepalese, in particular, are usually genuinely friendly and happy to help without expecting anything in return, so don’t hesitate to approach them. Some older or poorer individuals might expect a small tip, but that’s not the norm. Most Nepalese are incredibly warm and welcoming win their heart, and they might even offer you food.  My country is an amazing place to visit. There’s so much to see and experience, and it’s truly worth your time once you go, you won’t regret it!|||Crime against foreigners is very rare in Nepal because there is a saying in Nepal - \"Athiti devo bhawa\". That literally means -  treat  your guests like Gods. Welcome to Nepal. Enjoy your trek.|||Poles apart from India.|||Just don't go to the south|||Yes ! Solo means solo ! Don’t let anyone tag you ! Always tell people that your friend move ahead so you are going to meet them.|||Yep safe. But be smart anywhere.|||Nepal is extremely safe. The only thing you should avoid is being in the woods at 12. You'd get scammed that's almost unavoidable as a tourist; but for physical safety, it's not a concern.|||I've stayed in Nepal for 4 months few years ago with my wife, and she also stayed there 2 months alone.

Here's a YouTube video explaining it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE)    With this system, we can freely vote the candidate of our choice without getting worried about that vote being wasted. Dherai candidate huda vote katine chance dherai hunchha, and someone whom only minority of the total candidates votes will win. Jati dherai party hudai gayo, jati dherai independent candidate hudai gayo, teti nai vote katinchha.     In that case, Alternative Voting handles it pretty well by ranking the candidates, and even if your top candidate won't win, your vote will still be counted for your next candidate in line. We should vouch for Alternative Voting instead and that's where we should head as a multi-party democracy.     TL;DR: Alternative Voting is better, watch this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE)     TL;DW:   Wikipedia   \\> **Instant-runoff voting** is a single-winner [ranked voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting) election system where [one or more eliminations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_loser_method) are used to simulate multiple [runoff elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runoff_election). In each round, the candidate with the fewest [first-preference votes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-preference_vote) (among the remaining candidates) is eliminated. This continues until only one candidate is left.",

            "body": "This might be a long post . Please give opinions though.  I have social anxiety and need quiet to function. My new roommates are extremely loud, dismissive when asked for consideration, and continued even after a noise complaint to the warden backfired. I’m now the target in my own room, anxious, and barely eating. I just need to know if I’m wrong here.  Full story:  I moved into my college hostel last year.I have social anxiety and I was just getting adjusted to my hostel even after a year. My first year was fine my roommates were considerate.  This semester, two new batchmates moved in. Even though I told them I had exams, they and their friends were still very loud. I gave them the benefit of the doubt (new place excitement) and went to a relative’s to study for my backlog exam.  When I returned, nothing changed. One roommate takes hours-long calls every day with a very loud voice. I’ve tried earplugs + headphones + music, and I could still clearly hear every word. It destroyed my focus and sleep. I’ve politely asked twice for more quiet, especially at night. The second time, I was dismissed and told they “pay to live here too.”  Feeling desperate, I went to the warden. Big mistake. They issued a general notice, then a more specific one. It immediately identified me as the complainer. The loud roommate now openly talks about how they don’t care and will keep being loud, and has made the room socially tense and hostile.  I’m now anxious in my own room. I only leave when they’re gone, eat one meal a day off-campus, and feel like a prisoner. I’ve decided I have to move, but I’m left with this heavy feeling—like I’m overreacting, or that I handled everything wrong.  My question is simple: Looking at this situation,am I actually in the wrong somewhere? Was it wrong to ask for quiet, or to go to the warden when direct talks failed? And how do you let go of the guilt and shame when you’ve been made out to be the problem for just wanting basic peace?",

I had to go to Gwarko (which was a new location for me), so I decided to use Indrive. The fare was way too high, so I dropped it down to a rate that I thought was okayiish. Smhow, I found a guy who accepted the proposed fare. He was an 18 yr old student living with his brother, doing +2/Indrive side by side with his Honda Shine. He’d only been doing it for 2 weeks because his brother had fractured his leg while riding for Indrive. Bro was so unfamiliar with the roads (as in, he didn’t know how to use G-Map and reach specific locations), and the old Honda Shine kept stalling itself in the middle of the road. After 30 minutes of riding, he said, Paisa pardaina, ma arko Indrive khojdinchu hajur ko lagi, but I insisted, Dhilo bhaye ni chalcha. He kept taking longer routes for shorter ones (I actually had fun, tho). After 1:30 hours, with traffic jams and his longer routes fetish, we somehow made it to the destination. I was the victim here, but I felt bad for the guy since he was new to the job, trying to be a responsible brother, and helping his brother out in need. Sometimes, it’s important to read the environment. You don’t really know what someone else is going through. I gave him an extra 100, and he thanked me four times lol.  Tldr:- Took an Indrive to Gwarko with a new rider, an 18 yr old student. The ride was chaotic, he didn’t know the roads, his bike kept stalling, and he took longer routes. After 1:30 hours, we finally reached the destination. I was the victim here, but felt bad for him since he was just trying to help his brother(injured). Gave him an extra 100, and he thanked me four times.",

University level   The education should be a mixture of Theoretical knowledge, Practical Knowledge, Skills and mannerism (include civic sense).  The number of students in a class should be fixed. (To maintain teacher to student ratio).  5 days schools + 2 day holiday (no homework or anything)   The syllabus should be small so that students can get small but proper knowledge and know the use of the knowledge in real life.   The practical concepts like finance, banking , business, agriculture, election, constitutional rights should be a part of education system.   The syllabus should more focus on critical thinking, questioning and curiosity based.   The questions in exam should not based on memory power. The questions should be related to real life use of the knowledge.    Regarding teachers:  There should be a teaching licence test for teachers. Teachers should have knowledge of child psychology, anger management, teaching skills and knowledge of modern tech and it's implemented to make students understand about certain topic.  There should a ranking:  A = Someone who has good teaching skills + deserve higher salary  B = Someone who is eligible for teaching.  C = Re test next year.  D = Rejected for 2 years from test (if lacks the knowledge of child psychology and have anger issues.)",

I have heard people gossip about him saying misogynist, pedo, creep, uncle etc. etc. A lot of you have grudges against him because he banned you from the subreddit, claiming that he used his power as a mod or removed or approved extreme comments. Some have experienced him, and most of you don't like him hachuwa ko rumors ko var ma. But the bitter truth is NONE OF YOU KNOW WHO HE IS. None of you know what he is going through.  I, on behalf of Red-D-Thor, would like to clarify that although stuffs have happened in past and he isn't a saint, he never meant to hurt anybody on purpose. Whatever he was going through in real life was challenging and he was fighting his own battle in life. Despite, he used to take reddit seriously and always wanted the best. Trust me when I say this, he had no personal grudges with anyone. He was changing, turning into a better person and never realized people would still hate him so much. Every comments getting downvotes, every blame on him. Only calling out his name when something happens even tho there are other people to blame too. Anyways, today he has left reddit and discord to find peace at the end of his days after reaching the terminal phase of sickness.  Wherever he is, I hope he finds peace and happiness. I hope he feels better. I hope a miracle happens and he lives more years. I hope he comes back. But, if he doesn't, I hope his final days are easy. I will always stand by your side with or without you <3.",

I believed so strongly that God was watching over me, that no matter how hard life got, something divine would make it all better. I trusted that goodness always won in the end.  But growing up changed everything.  The more I saw the world, the more it broke my heart. I saw people suffering everywhere children begging for a handful of food, families struggling just to survive, innocent lives caught in violence and it confused me. It shook me. Because I kept asking myself Where is God in all of this?  I see food being offered to idols, piles and piles of it, even though it will eventually be thrown away while real people, real kids, sleep hungry every night. I don’t understand why I have to give money to a pandit just to receive a blessing. I don’t understand why my mom or sisters are told to stay away during their periods as if being a woman, or bleeding, is something impure.  I don’t understand why God needs offerings or gifts or money to be “pleased.” Why do we have to give so much, just to hope for something good in return?  And what hurts me the most is this: How can a God exist and watch thousands of children die from hunger and violence every day? How can a God allow people who do horrible things to live comfortably, while people with good hearts struggle endlessly?  If there is a God, they are nothing like the comforting, kind, protective figure I believed in as a child. They don’t seem to help the people who need it most. They don’t stop the suffering.  And now, I’m left questioning everything. Because I can’t understand how a God who is supposed to be loving could watch all this pain and be okay with it.",

That's just people exploiting your belief, selling you 'scum light' telling you to stay under it for your good instead of helping with you lighten up yourself so you could see the world and learn yourself.   We bow to the eternal and walk its path to become eternal, not stay under it forever to be shadowed — Treat God(everything) as a teacher to learn from, not a lord to be worshipped.  >How can a God exist and watch thousands of children die from hunger and violence every day? How can a God allow people who do horrible things to live comfortably, while people with good hearts struggle endlessly?  I doubt such god governing human race/lifeform exists, but even if it does, it's the cost of freedom. Either it can take away your freedom and you living on its happy script or give you freedom to live however you can.  Also, you think it's bad because it's against your values, so it's for you to solve by yourself, not for some god 'cause both parties are human and it's a result of human system.  >If there is a God, they are nothing like the comforting, kind, protective figure I believed in as a child.

            "body": "Every breath feels like inhaling shattered glass, each inhale cutting a little deeper into the places you once kept warm with your love. The air used to feel soft around you, gentle, almost forgiving, but now it drags itself into my lungs like broken pieces of yesterday sharp enough to remind me that losing you did not happen only once. It happens again every time I try to breathe.  You once made the world feel less cruel, less heavy, less impossible to hold together. Your presence softened the edges of everything, as if life became a little less violent just because you existed beside me. But now every corner is sharp again, every silence echoes, every moment stings with the reminder that the gentlest person I ever knew is gone because of me.  I breathe, but it feels wrong. It feels like I am pulling winter into my chest, a cold so brutal it cracks every part of me that once trusted warmth. You were the season I never learned to protect, and now I wake up to a world that bites instead of embraces, a world that punishes instead of forgives, a world where even the air hurts.  Some nights I hold my breath without meaning to, as if my body is terrified of letting more pain inside. But eventually I inhale, and the shards rush in again reminding me of the price I pay for every mistake I made with you. This is the consequence of loving someone badly and losing them completely the air becomes punishment, and living becomes endurance.  I never knew heartbreak could be physical, that grief could sit so heavily in my chest it felt like drowning from the inside. You taught me how to breathe softly, how to trust the rhythm of being alive, and I destroyed the very thing that sustained me. Now nothing is gentle, not even my own lungs.  Sometimes I swear that if I could cough hard enough, I might spit out your name, the one lodged in the back of my throat like the largest piece of broken glass I will never be able to remove. But instead it stays, cutting me each time I whisper your memory, each time I say your name to no one, each time I imagine you in a life where I loved you right.  If breathing is the proof that I am still alive, then I do not know how much longer I can keep proving it in a world where you do not exist beside me. Every breath hurts. Every inhale wounds. Every exhale mourns.  And yet I keep breathing, because somewhere beneath the shards is the truth I cannot escape. I hurt you, I lost you, and now the air itself makes sure I never forget it.",

            "body": "Namaste rNepal,  My name is Mahendra. I wanted to share an update about my father’s health and the situation my family is currently facing.  My father has been diagnosed with metastatic gallbladder cancer, which is a very aggressive form of cancer. Since the diagnosis, our days have been filled with hospital visits, tests, medicines and treatment plans. On 30 November, he completed another round of chemotherapy. He is fighting bravely, but the side effects and the emotional strain have been extremely difficult for him and for all of us.  we come from very lower middle class family but with a dream to make me engineer and a good human my dad put all his life and sacrificed everything. He worked as a security guard in india din vari ubhiyar kaam garnu vo , hamro sapna pura garna lai and  i still  wonder \"why us\" ? He never consumed alcohol,cigarette, tombakhu or anything that is said to cause cancer now when he is admitted at hospital the main head of the family and i have to lookafter all the expenses i understand why all it happen. the burden of money to manage for studies, run family and survive was really hard for us but he never show us. That dherai chintaa about managing money became the cause for the cancer ig , chintaa le ni cancer hudo raicha. My dad is now ,, he's a cancer patient god!! I was a guy learning and doing everything to pass exams nthg more than that and still use to feel sometime \"life kati garo cha yrr,, Yo sem  ma pass vaidiana and all,,  and suddenly life put me in a place where I had to become the pillar of the family. being student and not even earning it's being extremly hard for us.  I am doing everything possible  via writing, reaching out, asking for help — because I don't want to lose my father. He is still hopeful. He still smiles even on the hardest days.  We have already used all our savings and borrowed money to continue his treatment. The cost of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, scans, tests and medicines has become overwhelming for our family. With the help of kind people, we have managed to raise a little over NPR 3 Lakhs so far, which helped cover the initial cycles, but we still have many more ahead.  I am sharing this post to provide a clear and honest update about our situation. I am not asking anyone to do work on my behalf. Anyone who wishes to support us in any form may do so if they feel comfortable. Even reading this and keeping my father in your thoughts means a lot to us.

And, me thinking to return nepal with not enough savings feels like im letting go of a chance of making my family happy and helping financially.  i’m also no too sure about what im gonna do after i return, but im thinking of doing something of my own.",

Nepal is really unstable now, given the political conditions. I myself am now thinking for leaving the country. Wont recommend you to come here at all.|||I’m Chinese, and I understand the difficulties and pain you’re going through. But I strongly do not recommend that you return to Nepal directly, because you mentioned that your family’s income is low and you don’t have a clear or feasible plan for going back. That would be a very unwise choice.  I mean no offense, but if you eventually manage to stay in Australia and become a citizen, that could very well be the greatest contribution you make in your entire life,for yourself and for your family.  Let’s calmly think about your situation: your family doesn’t earn much, yet you went to Australia to work. Think about the support and expectations your family has for you, as well as the effort you’ve put in. If you choose to return now without even knowing what you would do for a living, and considering that with your current situation you might be able to obtain Australian residency, then giving that up and going back might be the biggest mistake you ever make.  I know your journey hasn’t been easy, and maybe it feels difficult to keep going, but think carefully about the situation you and your family—and even future generations—may face if you return. You will most likely regret it.  That’s all I have to say.|||Lets be realistic no ones doing well in this country.

But still I am doing it and doing it for the family! It sounds all gloomy when they say you should do something for yourself! I found out that being totally wrong! The lone life here in the UK despite having friends to roam around and party with pushed me to thinking Family is everything at the end of the day. I don't know what the future beholds ! May be ALLAH swt has good things for me ! But one thing I know is InShaAllah, I will stay here until I and my family become financially well! And then only I will return! I am into 2 and half years of that job and when I look at everything that I have done for myself and family, I am very proud and it wouldn't have been possible if I had gone back to Nepal!

I have few friends who are planning to return to nepal after getting PR, they are already starting to plan about what they want to do after returning to nepal.|||Tell you what, for now just stick with the job, you’re fortunate to get sponsorship here many struggle to get atm, try to get PR first then you’ll have a backup plan even if you return Nepal and can’t do anything, so be patient and struggle hard brother!|||Hey brother, thanks for opening up and sharing all of this with us. What you’re going through is something many Nepali students in Australia and abroad can relate to — the pressure for PR, job uncertainty, and also the weight of family expectations back home. It’s a lot to deal with, mentally and emotionally.  One thing I want to say for sure: your worth is not measured only by PR or money. You’ve already shown courage by going here alone, studying, and working hard these four years. That itself is a big achievement.  About your dilemma — returning home vs. staying — there’s no right or wrong choice here. What matters is what gives you a future that feels meaningful and sustainable. If the job doesn’t feel right and the sponsorship comes with years of compromise, it’s okay to step back and rethink. And if doing something of your own in Nepal excites you more, that’s a real option too. Nepal needs young people with global perspective and courage to take risks.  Your parents will always want your happiness first. Yes, money matters — but your peace of mind matters too. Whatever decision you take, take it with confidence, not fear. And remember, success doesn’t have only one path.  Take your time, think calmly, and choose the life you truly want. You’re going to do great — whether that’s in Australia or back home. 💪🏼💛|||Afu nai khus na bhaye k, but for your parents ma lai hatayerah ba, ma lai herah an do not return if you do not have a solid plan.|||Don’t return without money and PR/citizen   Natra life damage huncha|||Lol dont return here please.|||My honest opinion don't return to nepal for 3-4 years because of political instability !!!

It can cause more than 50% error. We need to increase voting booth by five times. And counting vote is extremely hard.  What will we do if someone is 2nd priority of 90% but 1st priority of 5%.

But if you’re starting from zero, it will be challenging. The good thing is, you’ve got a Master’s from Australia, and depending on your field, you can either jump straight into job hunting or start something on your own. Give yourself a few months to study the market and understand the trends. It's swim or sink there. People are either making filthy money, or barely keeping their above water.    Ignore the naysayers..at the end of the day, it’s your path...your grind, your life, period! People love to gossip/bitch there, but don’t let that noise affect ya.   I recently spent almost two years in Nepal, and honestly, I was jealous seeing how relaxed and comfortable my friends, including my brother's lives were, while I’m here grinding every day. I’ve had PR for 12 years now (never bothered with Citizenship, never will), and I’m seriously considering moving back to Nepal. We shall see.|||If it is your last option, welcome back bro !

I wish you very well.|||I came to Australia for my Master’s and recently graduated. I’m on my TR now with around two years left.  To be honest, it only took me about a year to realise that Australia isn’t where I see myself long term. Since then, I’ve been focused on building networks, skills, and connections that I can use later in Nepal. I’m confident I can start from scratch there and build something meaningful with the experience I gained here.  Through this whole journey, I’ve noticed that Nepali students who come to Australia usually fall into one of two mindsets: \t1.\tThe “I’ll do whatever it takes for PR” mindset. This path needs long-term commitment, smart planning, and patience. There are multiple routes, but you have to be ready to follow them consistently. \t2.\tThe “Use Australia as a resource and return” mindset. Some people come here to gain skills, experience, money, or professional networks not necessarily to settle. If used wisely, Australia offers a lot that you can take back home and build a career with.  Neither mindset is wrong. The problem is when people don’t think strategically and end up stuck in between spending years here without building anything solid in either country.  This is just my experience, but I hope it helps someone who’s trying to figure out what they actually want.|||Go to banglore and find some work in IT.|||I’ll give you a very practical advice.

The normal places that travelers go to, like the popular trekking routes, will be safe besides maybe some petty tourist scams. Off the beaten path, I'd be cautious of scammers more than of safety.   It's a very different situation when compared with India.|||I've been to Nepal on five treks, and think that the Nepalese are some of the nicest people I've met.  I'm an older American male, so my experience may not match yours, but my impression is that you'd be OK.  That said, it's really easy to find travel/trekking companions and guides are very reasonably priced, at least in Western terms.  If you're going on a trek, I'd strongly advise getting a guide for any number of reasons.  A solo female traveler from Germany died just last week, apparently because she followed a route that was on a map but had been abandoned in favor of a less dangerous route.  A guide would have taken her on the correct path.|||It's relatively safe for travellers. But do use caution regardless, even if majority are harmless, the small minority could end up harmful.|||Super safe. Try to avoid overcrowded space just to be safe else you will be fine|||Nepal is safe for foreigners regardless of any gender.|||Yep quite safe actually, you might be scam at some places. Remeber you don’t need to hire guides for a lot of places. Also foreigners usually get charged more so only go to a pkace after checking the review. Also use ride sharing app: indrive, pathao etc etc which will cost you lot less than just hiring taxi from the road. Please avoid public transportation if possible. And no streed food. Incase of diarrhea eats lots of water mix with ORS and not antibiotics or anti diarrhea stuff. Seek medical help if you feel sick.|||Most likely yes except a few regions I believe like some regions of madeshi province and few more backward and underdeveloped  regions because of conservative society.   It doesn't apply to tier 1-2 cities in nepal as people have majorly accepted modernism. Beside scammers I barely feel any threat for female travellers.

That said, it’s always wise to stay cautious especially in tourist areas near temples since a few people may try to sell cheap items at inflated prices.  Occasionally, someone might offer help in a friendly way but later expect money, though this is rare. Younger Nepalese, in particular, are usually genuinely friendly and happy to help without expecting anything in return, so don’t hesitate to approach them. Some older or poorer individuals might expect a small tip, but that’s not the norm. Most Nepalese are incredibly warm and welcoming win their heart, and they might even offer you food.  My country is an amazing place to visit. There’s so much to see and experience, and it’s truly worth your time once you go, you won’t regret it!|||Crime against foreigners is very rare in Nepal because there is a saying in Nepal - \"Athiti devo bhawa\".

It is **sacrosanct** and must not be touched for the Classic 350.  # Step 2: The Core Investment (50% - approx. ₹2,50,000)  * **Action:** Systematically invest **₹2,50,000**.    * *Suggestion 1:* Start a few **SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans)** in well-performing Equity Mutual Funds (50-60% of this amount).    * *Suggestion 2:* Invest the rest in blue-chip Nepali stocks (NEPSE) or a solid bank FD if you are extremely risk-averse. * **Purpose:** This money is for your future financial freedom. Your money is now working harder than you are.  # Step 3: The Classic 350 Fund (30% - approx. ₹1,50,000)  * **Action:** Place this **₹1,50,000** into a separate, easily accessible fund. * **The Compromise:** The Classic 350 typically costs upwards of ₹5 Lakhs, which means your ₹1.5 Lakhs is the perfect **Down Payment**. * **The Adulting Test:** Take a **manageable loan** for the remaining amount (₹3.5 Lakhs). Since you are already earning, you can pay this off over 2-3 years.  # 👑 Conclusion:  By executing the **Hybrid Compromise**, you achieve all your goals:  1. **You get the Classic 350** (satisfying your heart) without wiping out your entire savings. 2. **You begin your investment journey** and start building real wealth (satisfying your brain). 3. **You have an emergency fund** (₹1,00,000) for security.  The smartest move is to **Invest 50% / Down Payment 30% / Save 20%**.|||Petrol haldai ruinxa|||Deepseek:   💡 **Bottom line:**  Your 5 lakhs is a safety net + seed capital for future you.   Don’t blow it all on a bike unless biking is your core happiness.   Don’t ignore investing—future you will thank present you.   Don’t jump into business without a plan.  **Maybe the smart move is:**   \\*Invest 70%, keep 20% liquid, use 10% to treat yourself (maybe a second-hand bike or a trip to clear your head).\\*  And remember—financial literacy isn’t about denying yourself joy; it’s about affording your dreams without panicking later.

Then you have this whole concept of patibrata dharma in texts like Swasthani which is just plain misogyny and designed to keep women down. Add to this, there’s this whole nonsense about karma, reincarnation, and caste system, where they say that lower caste are born this way because they committed horrible sin in past lives, so they deserve to be treated bad. This religion is full of fraudsters and scam artists: dhongi babas, jyotoshis, fake unproven ayurvedic medicine, matas, gaumutra ley sabai thik huncha  Hindu supremacists and chauvinists, before criticizing other religions and cultures, perhaps take the time to look at the evil within our own religion and culture. Please stop basking in mythological glory like paschima haru jangal ma bhautarirahada, hamra mahan rishi muni haru (insert outlandish claim here) gariraheka thiye",

People don't follow the core context of religion. 2. People refuse to self critism. 3. Blame game is bliss ...  Applies for all religions of people|||Nah we don't ignore anything. Unlike some religions, almost nobody wants to bring back sati or other backward traditions.   If anything, Hindus have been very progressive, changing their ways and practices with the time. You may debate if the change has been fast or slow but you cannot deny that there *has been* change and most Hindus are okay with it for the most part.|||Because Hinduism isn't a religion like others .. it's a way of living . Sanatan dharma has too many interpretations and ways of following that a lot of people do not associate themselves with the practices of other people who identify as Hindus. Ek tira vayo vane sabaitira naramro hudaina .. I'm a practising \" Hindu \" and I do not follow a lot of the practises my parents think I should follow. I don't discriminate people on caste or whatever , I don't care about who visits temples or when and I don't eat non veg and I don't support sacrificing animals in the name of religion. I'm still a Hindu .. calling out others for wrongdoings shouldn't be a question for whataboutery.|||Why are you overly critical of Hinduism? When most of atrocities and genocides in the name of religion are done by Abrahamic religions.    From Terrorist groups to Crusades, don’t you think they don’t need to be criticized?|||How have you been practicing Hinduism?|||Hypocrisy does not invalidate critique. |||Ngl modern hindus in nepal are overly self critical. We are taught of satu pratha, mysoginy, caestism early in school.  I don't think no young person in nepal supports caestism in palpable level.  Also modern nepali think that caestism, sati pratha, slavery was worse than it actually was. Compared to other religions like islam or Christianity. We had much better ethical codes.  Slavery in nepal wasn't anywhere near as bad as islamic or Christian world. Not even 5% of it. Slavery here was more akin to servitude. They weren't treated as badly. And had some personal rights. And much rare in numbers.  Also karma is one of the most beautiful concepts i have ever seen. It encourages ppl to do good deeds. Hindusim doesn't teach to treat badly. If you look at history. Hindusim and buddhism had developed very good morality since a long time. It was about karma and dharma and treating everyone good.   Also caste wise, lower caste ppl weren't discriminated economically. They hold very important economic jobs like burning bodies, blacksmiths, etc.. It was more of a social and spiritual division. Still bad but there were way more apertheid societies. In nepal it was peaceful as long as they lived separately. This is probably why there was social harmony and they lived in peace for thousands of years.  Sati pratha in nepal in the ancient times was as rare as honor Killing is in Uk now. And most of it was through consent.   Avg nepali's idea of these thing are overblown and they criticize alot. Imo.   But if they learn about the type of shit that was happening in euorpe, middle east and north africa in the name of religion.   Also one big difference. Hindus texts aren't taken as the ultimate truth something they should follow through stuff like sharia laws. Its too vast and too open for interpretation.  It's hard to see a muslim esp criticize any of the ill doing in their religion of which there are so many even in this modern days. Im so thankful that that's not the case in nepal. They overly self criticize imo.  For the record, im very athesit i don't believe in religion. I was raised a Hindu and i hated and got annoyed by religion growing up. But now that im Learning more about other cultures. I think our morality was superior. Which is making me appreciate is more what's even more lovely is, people widely criticize the bad part while taking on the good ones. I like how our religion isn't dogmatic and how vast it is.  This says all. For eg: noone in nepal would support misogyny. In Bangladesh, ppl were rallying and beating effigy of women cuz the government reformed some laws for women.  I don't want to create bad stereotype for other religions too. But ehhh, my view is, statistically they do way too many fucked up things it has more fundamental problems for like islam and Christianity. Their religious texts are way too dogmatic. Tbf Christian society have reformed but its being hard for islamic societies to do so.      If you look at their history its so fucked up too. Religious wars, killing, enslaving, raping ppl from other religions sanctioned by their religious text. This was way too common.  Look at that and look at hindu history.|||Wdym by you’re practicing hinduism? Are you switching religion or exploring hinduism? Nonetheless every religion has its flaws so I suggest you to not just follow books but also use common sense and see weather something written in book are true or not. Also every religion teaches you to be good human being if you enjoy stories read those dharmic books if you are self aware of good and bad you really don’t need religion at all. Buts it’s your choice so have fun either way your free will. 😊|||Stop pretending dude|||What exactly are Hindus criticizing about other religions?|||What you're saying is like Science is a means of destruction just like War Arts, while it's a way of studying and understanding everything, just cause some use it to create means of destruction doesn't make it worthy of ill criticism. Hinduism is the same, it's a way of life and was accepted by many and was eternally changing. Some exploited that to turn practices means of better life and slowly ill-interpreted them to turn this into means of control. This wrong-turn branch was created by powerful peoples and widely spread, that's why it looks like it's Hinduism, but it's a mere branch of many branches of Hinduism.  If you cannot accept Hinduism, you're either a fool or ill-intent individual or someone good enough to be atheist.|||Hinduism nabhako bhaya secularism ni hudaina thiyo ni....hami hamrai naramro chalan Lai khandan garchhau Ra swikarchhau Pani.|||Sexiest? Bro? How can Hinduism be sexist when the Vedas have the contribution of women scholars, name one religion other than Hinduism whose holy book has women scholars and their contribution, Hindus consider 108 upanishads as the source of highest of knowledge out of which 18-25 are written by women scholars how is it sexist?  If you've learned just polygamy and slavery from those texts than I believe you're a the most bigoted man. The most worshipped Hindu God till today is Mahadeva he is said to be incomplete without his wife, thus it's said that husband and wife are complementary to each other where one complements the other and thus we have the complete form of Shiva the ardhanarshwor. And if it were so misogynistic the great of text which is even called the fifth veda, Ramayana does it always talk about Patni dharma or it more explicitly talk of Pati dharma, because Rama crossing an ocean and forming the way in ocean to get his wife for which he was ready to face the most fearful person on the planet of that time just shows me a glimpse of how we men should be, it is said that Rama never looked at other woman other than Sita, does this show you misogyny or does it show you Pati dharma of Rama. In other religion marriage is a contract between two bodies, Hinduism is the only one which says marriage is a bond between two souls to complement each other for not just life but also after life and even beyond that, during the marriage you circle around the agni where for first 3 you are at front and promise in front of agni deva that you will protect her no matter what the situation and later than she come in front and you promise her to include her in every decision making of your life. How is the Hindu tradition misogyny? About the caste factor, just think of it for a sec that Chinese Buddhist Scholars who had come to Bihar for Buddha's teaching never quite have mentioned the word jati or jaat, infact they have described it as an inclusive society which allowed them to study, but when the Europeans came they came up with their own caste trauma and when they saw Brahmins, Kshytriya Vaishya and Shudras they immediately went on to go ahead and form a chronology, because of their own historical trauma what is the surname smith, it's the one who worked with metals, it's a European thing transcended upon Hinduism by the Europeans, for us it was the muluki ain of JBR which reduced the fluidity between the varnas and stagnated it to make it a jati, rather than what it was, the varna system geeta talks of equality and says that all four varnas are equal in the society. You are just pointing out the modern day problems which I agree exists within Hinduism which is why we should promote hindutva ideology to rise  beyond caste, to rise beyond sects and all the things that are dividing Hindus. |||We as a society are trying to correct the bad things that has existed and trying to teach our children that the essence of religion is peace and humanity through education system. Change in social mentality doesn't come overnight but in no way casteism, immorality and sexism are getting ignored. What makes you feel so? And if there is fault in other practices, they should try to improve their practice as well. I think it is okay to criticize the thought if they are not willing improve and change. Western society has corrected their evil and illogical things and have much improved as society now, and we were late but are in correction phase right now. By your post, I assume you are defending Islam's criticism right now- but it is sadly indeed true that even in today's time, fascism, terrorism, genocide are happening various muslim society right now, and lots of problem are growing too. If you search about what's happening in nigeria, sudan right now or some other radical muslim society, you'd know. Chaos is on whole another level that Nepal's issue would seem insignificant. And no, we won't accept muslims starting to idealize such path in Nepal. It's obvious that criticism will be thrown when the actions and words remind people of that radical ideology.",

            "body": "everyone's watching gagan thapa's interview but watch this [https://youtu.be/7t6avFyUdlQ](https://youtu.be/7t6avFyUdlQ) video of him speaking in parliament just weeks before bhadra 23 happened. only if the government had listened to him.   Gagan thapa from what I see was always fighting within the party and was always corned because he didn't have grab on the party like deuba did. in party system, you've got to be a party leader before you can have a chance to get executive role and walk the talk. but finally he has the chance to lead the party. i really hope he does.  Gagan thapa who once used to be beacon of hope doesn't have that flair anymore. Nepali society has that tendency to make someone hero every once in a while. 2063 was Prachande, 2072 was Oli, 2080 was Rabi. Gagan Thapa was somewhere there all along as youth face until Nepali society got another hero in face of Rabi. People these days criticize Gagan Thapa for failing to deliver and not meeting the expectations. I remember people wanting Gagan Thapa to be Prime Minister back then but there's no hope from him anymore.  I personally think Gagan Thapa wasn't ready to be PM back then. Yes, his speeches sounded good, yes he had that craze , yes he was a young face in politics but he didn't have experience. Politics isn't as easy as populists think. It needs understanding of how government actually functions. If you've followed gagan thapa for past 6-7 years, he's finally being a mature political face.   after 2074, though congress lost the elections badly against NCP (oli+prachande) , Gagan thapa was constantly saying that party was going to break down on their own.  Later when Congress decided to form coalition with maobadi for 2079 elections, Gagan Thapa constatly stood against that decision and look how that turned out to be. Though Congress became first party, not a single chance to be PM.   Gagan Thapa stood against giving vote of confidence to Prachande when Oli and prachande formed government after elections. Later Prachande betrayed congress and went back to Oli.  Gagan thapa focused that congress should then be a strong opposition until next elections and shouldn't play to form government but deuba didn't listen and supported oli to form government. How that worked out for him - exit from politics by getting pun\\*ched by bunch of gen Zs and public humiliation.  When congress was in government, Gagan Thapa worked relentlessly for a couple of months on few ordinances - the one to let nepali companies invest abroad was significant one and welcomed. but soon the government started losing track and gagan thapa started criticizing the government his party was part of. just a couple of weeks before bhadra 23 happened, gagan thapa was there criticizing government by speaking in parliament. only if government had listened to him lol.  only if deuba had listened to gagan when he was suggesting deuba to take support out from government when oli decided the social media ban, thing would've turned differently.  gagan gets a lot of hate from RSP supporters for being critical about rabi's sahakari case - well, if there was no substantial proof, all 3 tiers of courts wouldn't have put him in custody. I'll say let court decide the case (and thats going to take lots of years , thats how court works in nepal).",

            "heading": "The Rabi story isn’t winning because it’s true. It’s winning because it’s surgically designed for the Nepali psyche.",
            "body": "I’m just an observer who has watched this unfold from the sidelines for some time now, neither a supporter nor a hater, but the pattern is now crystal clear. There is a reason every 40-page fact-check thread on Twitter or an elaborate news article gets 38 comments while a 12-second TikTok of Rabi walking out of custody gets 4M views and rivers of tears.It’s because the RSP narrative is one of the cleanest, most lethal political myths ever built in this country. Strip it down, and it’s three sentences:  1. A man from outside the club started winning. 2. The club panicked. 3. The club weaponised the courts to stop him.  That’s the entire gospel. Nothing else is required. And it is unstoppable for five structural reasons that have almost nothing to do with evidence.  1. It reuses villains that 90% of the population already despises. The story doesn’t have to invent enemies. It just points at the same three parties and the same dozen surnames that have been on the evening news since people were born. Defending “the judicial process” in 2025 automatically casts you as a foot-soldier for those exact villains, even if you spent the last ten years cursing them yourself. 2. It turns Rabi into a human mood ring. He is no longer a politician with files and cases. He is the physical container for every private rage Nepalis are not allowed to voice in polite company: rage at having to beg for a Malaysian visa, rage at seeing ministers’ kids studying in London. At the same time, your own degree gathers dust, rage at the simple fact that nothing ever works here. When you attack him, people don’t hear “this man might have broken laws.” They hear “you are dismissing my pain.” 3. It replaces a 400-page legal maze with a single sentence anyone can remember. Try explaining the difference between “investigation,” “remand,” “chargesheet,” and “final verdict” to a vegetable vendor in Kalimati or a mother in Jumla. You will lose them in thirty seconds. “They jailed him because he was becoming too big” is shorter than a WhatsApp forward and feels 100 % true the moment it lands. Cognitive ease beats cognitive accuracy every single time. 4. It is an infinitely customisable therapy. Every frustrated Nepali gets to insert himself as the protagonist: • The youth who prepared for lok sewa for six years and still failed? Same story. • The entrepreneur strangled by red tape and bribes? Same story. • The family that lost everything when the cooperative collapsed? Same story. The narrative is a blank template that lets millions of people scream “this is about ME” without changing a single word. 5. It is the perfect drug for a nation addicted to learned helplessness. Nepal’s modern identity is built on a thousand small and large humiliations: the blockade, the passport ranking, the airports, the brain drain, the daily proof that ordinary effort is never enough. When your entire lived experience is “the system crushes anyone who stands out,” then the sentence “they jailed him because he stood out” doesn’t sound like a conspiracy theory. It sounds like the most honest thing any politician has ever said.  This is not a media-literacy problem. This is not even mainly a class or education problem. This is a story that was reverse-engineered to fit the exact emotional wounds of an entire country . Until someone builds a counter-story that is equally simple, equally personal, and similarly cathartic, something that gives people dignity instead of just documents, the current myth will keep winning. And right now, no one is even trying. That’s the part that should worry everyone who still believes that facts alone will eventually prevail. They won’t.   Not against a myth this well-crafted.",

He isn't proven guilty but still has to go to prison. What happened to innocent until proven guilty?? Even if he was a bad guy, why does he need to stay in jail while the state gets to extend his case indefinitely?    They tried to defame him before by questioning his citizenship status.  Balen is now Lucifer and agent of India.  Kulman is now a corrupt official and needs to be arrested.  Harka is now a Christian pastor trying to spread hate and destroy our culture.   See the pattern??|||No need for your philosophical yapping about Nepalese people. Don't make things too complicated, it's as simple as following: 1. Either he is discharged innocent. 2. Or he is proven in all of the charges that are currently on going 3. Or, he is only ordered to be found guilty over minor stuffs within his entire case, which looks most likely for now for anyone who has closely read his case.   It's not that complicated, if Rabi is truly involved in fraud, the court is free to punish him, else Rabi would be so immense of a figure that no one would be able to stop, in that situation this entire prison time would be seen as an investment of fighting the unjust system all by himself.   And, personally after careful reading all the hearings of courts regarding him, it's safe to say that he won't be charged with fraud, although he won't come out as innocent either, his only mistake would be to remain in an important position and not being aware of certain clauses and regulations, that's all I think would happen to him, rest of the stuffs aren't even close to truly charge him.   and, I don't even like him, as for me, I think as a politician he is too soft, weak and sometimes naive, I don't like weak people as new faces in politics, that's my personal thoughts about his political career.   No matter whether people like him or not, they better work super hard to charge him, else he is becoming so big that these old bastards could never hope to beat him.|||Came without murdering 17k people, without money bundles buried inside house, without killing people in his way (Don't say su!c!de case)....still people have audacity to say him bad.

As for GenZ protest, he went back anyways by the way, and it was the condition of riot, when entire jail authorities fled, how can you expect rabi can politely say please folks I am going out, don't come with me. ??

No one is perfect, No one is a God everyone makes mistakes the ones they're accusing him of anyone in his place could have done that (Nagrita and shaakari both). Ani I don't care if Rabi is bad person or whatever but He's the only one in this scneario who can do something postiively at scale. He'e being framed by the old school parties cause he's a threat which is more than enough sign that he will bring some change.  Why isn't he the protagonist? If not he than who lol. He didn't rise to popularity by giving speeches he did good work as a journalist, opened his own party, gave chance to educated young deserving people, we all know the quality of MPs he had vs other parties. He openly challenges the system bravely, tried doing positive stuff when he was in power.  How about you give me anyone else who has done the same being a popular political figure?  Then why is he being jailed when there's litreally no evidence of he directly manipulating funds, 100s of crore ko issue ho sahakari ko Rabi le loan leko dekhexa that's the biggest proof they have lol ani he is being denied bail while kasto kasto cases ko manxe get bailed easily.  May be work on your observation a bit lol, Its very easy to point out problems anyone can do that, How about you give some solutions?  Or just look at the bigger picture what's the best alternative and support them instead? Cause that's our only hope for some positive change.|||Hot damn, that's an excellent analysis. He was always an opportunist but he did some excellent work regarding the migrant workers. Cooperative fraud case was politically motivated, no doubt.

A developed Nepal is very good for China’s geopolitics.|||What we should do is balance out relationship between India and China. This being the century of china and it being a superpower now, we need their investment and support now more than ever. Also since we have cultural and people to people ties with india, it is only crucial to keep them with us as well.

But today simply giving out loans just doesn't work u also have to advertise urself as a benefactor and a savior. to this regard i think US and China r simply miles ahead of other countries simply because they have money to spend on their public image and can influence people simply by saying or just doing a cyber operation and we won't know a thing.|||The thing about China is the fact that they are not a complete democracy, the Chinese communist party is the government. There is no other option, any leader that can be the president or premier of china will always be from the CCP.

Only braindead idiots make such statements. China extends it's control and influence through development projects just like how US extends it's influence through media, INGO/NGOs and social advocacy. Africa is a great example of this. Development projects is closely followed by Chinese companies buying mines and other resources which conveniently have an infrastructure project to complement the extraction.   Any Chinese interest in Nepal is purely to reduce Indian influence. A country as big as China doesn't need Nepal 2nd or 3rd smallest neighbor for any of its ambitious global plans.   Don't get drunk on self importance. China and India literally fought a war and Nepal was an unaffected, uninvolved 3rd country.   Balancing the relationship is the only solution.

I loved the sites and the people were kind and welcoming. The American dollar went really far!  Cab rides were amazingly inexpensive.  Souvenirs and food were really cheap.  Also… I couldn’t wait to leave.  It was oppressive. Cameras EVERYWHERE…dozens upon dozens…  The airplane ride there warned that any damage to the plane would be “punished”. I had my translator app on in the cabs and the directions app were constantly warning drivers about punishments and cameras.  There were also police everywhere.  We also said we wanted to return from where we came from at the airport…and they sent us to another room with glass barricades.  We had to go to another country for our transit visa-which we didn’t understand.  We ended up buying ticket to Japan before we could return to Korea.   It’s also a nearly cashless society.  You want to buy a $1 pair of gloves from a street vendor…you use an app.  We did not take pictures of many things we saw…just the tourist sites.    We sighed in relief when we arrived in Japan, and even more when we were able to finally return to S Korea.|||China wants to control nepal directly/indirectly that's it, development and infra all this and that is just an excuse, take examples of other few countries which china helped, it's influencing their government, policies and geo politics kinda like debt traps. During oli regime I read somewhere that china has claimed/ occupied some parts of nepal territory. An insect starts decaying wood from inside so does china by offering sugar coated help then starts interfering with the government. Currently we have many mega projects done by china like pokhara airport ig and many projects in nepal like roadways construction etc are undertaken by Chinese companies, we are heavily dependent on them. The government should take actions/ measures so that we can reduce our dependence from other countries. Such infra and progress might look good but doesn't offer long term stability.|||None.

Steam has greatly invested in this. Windows jastai feel chainey vaye try Zorin, it’s based on Ubuntu so it will be familiar. Or you may try cutefishOS which is also based on Ubuntu.    Good reasons to switch to linux, if you are using windows 10 and your pc doesn’t support 11, you should switch to Linux. You get to learn a lot about open source softwares. You’ll reduce your dependence on Microsoft.  Almost all games run on Linux, it even runs better on Linux.  Good reasons not to switch is if you’re not tech savvy and want things simple, you shouldn’t.|||Choosing Linux is the best choice. As a Linux user, I initially used Parrot OS, which is quite good, mainly for cybersecurity purposes, with a minimal and straightforward, non-complicated user interface. As you've mentioned, you are beginners, so you can try Linux Mint or Ubuntu, which are lightweight and offer a Windows-like experience within a Linux environment.  If you truly want to have your own fully customisable setup, you can use Hyprland WM in your preferred distro.  It has a strong active community.  Btw rn I'm using hyprland too.|||go for pop os or fedora|||The only good reason not to switch to Linux are that many of apps and majority of games are made only for windows.      **However** you can still use wine and proton for the apps and games (compatibility will differ). You can check for your games here: [https://www.protondb.com/](https://www.protondb.com/)  You can start with linux mint, ubuntu or even zorin os if you want windows-like feel.|||Most steam games can run on linux and with tools like wine you can run windows apps as well but it's a hassle for some software or so i've heard . If you work with adobe software they are not available but you have  linux alternatives. If you are  a programmer or work in IT linux will most certainly help you. Most of the distros are configurable via GUI nowadays. I'd recommend starting with Linux Mint if you want windows like feel or pop os because it has  good nvidia support and gaming is easier on pop os.Both are ubuntu based so any problem faced in them can be fixed with fixes suggested on ubuntu help threads.|||minecraft works natively (cuz java), roblox can run on andriod emulator (waydroid is the most popular), steam games run flawlessly unless they have kernel level anti cheat (check protondb to see if the game runs or not).  for distro, im currently running cachyOS with KDE. arch based, so it has it's quirks and learning curve. but much easier to setup since most things are taken care of (most notably nvidia drivers). do look into nobaraOS and fedora as well.  id recommend dual booting, but it has its own headaches. i broke the bootloader a few times fucking around lmao.  for windows application, there's winboat. runs windows virtual machine underneath but makes it seems like there's no vm. it can do most things but doesn't have GPU passthrough yet so no gaming, vid & img editing. better to find linux alternative. davinci resolve for vid editing, affinity for pic editing.  everything i mentioned is free.|||Install steam os|||98% percent of servers run on Linux, tara that doesn't mean linux distros for desktop, that means 98% of the servers are in linux server distros like ubuntu server , redhad , centos , linux sikna mann xa vane euta Virtual bos ma vm banau, static ip rakha , putty hanera chalau , appications , tools deploy gara na|||let me give you very honest answer, I was using Linux since I was 13 year old and I used it for almost 10 years, I also developed linux application and also experience system admin and it was very much good time. My favorite distro was debian because of stability, apt (a great package manager) and large collection of packages. I was pretty much happy. Then a year and half ago I bought a gaming laptop (i don't game much, mostly I used gaming laptop for Data Science work) and there pre-installed window was there, so i thought to remove windows and switch back to my old debian but my friend told me to give it a try. I remember last time I was using windows 8 and now on windows 11. After one and half year I think my life become more easier than using just using that old linux because of windows experience, I got pre built tools that almost optimize all the application, plus nvidia graphic driver works great on windows than linux and plus I can game too. For any linux tasking I got the wsl2 which work flawless. So using wsl I never felt like going back to linux because of windows experience and there is some shitty saying like If you are a developer than use linux or if you want privacy than use linux. Look windows is great from developer's point of view. You need to code than every OS is fine for you (expect building on iOS or MacOS) and for privacy stuff you can switch to Window Pro or Enterprise and microsoft is taking money for your windows experience.   It is a choice, If you want to learn system admin or server management than I think you need get your hands dirty on Linux Distro in bare metals but if you are an experience developer than you know what to do.  Btw I am not going to switch back to linux soon because of windows experience and why I don't choose MacOS .. because of pricing|||Use mint or Ubuntu but mint is better for beginners imo. Dual boot if you're just starting out but default to linux is what I recommend.  Most of the other replies have covered how gaming is but in short: Yes, it's mostly possible and very much usable, but often not natively. If some of the tiny quirks and exceptions end up being an issue for you, stick to windows.  It's well worth just dipping your toes in and learning the basics but you will reach a point where you have to ask yourself, \"Do I need linux?\"   Everyone has their own reasons, for most windows users it's simplicity, reliability and usually the default choice. For lots of linux people, it's the community and sense of being in control. Some might have completely different reasons.  In the end, it depends on what your use case is. Choose the right tool for the job. But it is very much worth it to at least try it out. Good luck!|||Garuda linux chalau keii problem aayo bane u can txt me.kde Dragonized use garnw pretty interface with lot of functionality|||use linux like a man|||If you are the beginner then i would suggest you to first know about dual booting with Windows and Linux because this will give you some time to transit between windows and Linux.

I still dual boot between Windows and Linux.

            "body": "A clear vision for a truly digital Nepal  If I were entrusted with the responsibility of leading Nepal’s Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, my first priority would be to build a fast, reliable, modern digital ecosystem for every citizen. Today, people waste hours in queues and face endless frustration because our government systems are slow, outdated, and poorly maintained. This must change.  1. High-speed, modern servers for all government services  Citizens should not have to wait 30 minutes to 1 hour just to load a form. I would upgrade outdated servers to modern, scalable cloud infrastructure so that: websites don’t crash services open instantly users don’t see “server busy” or “system down” Speed and reliability would become the standard.   2. High-quality websites built by skilled private IT companies Government platforms are often slow, heavy, and full of bugs because they go to the lowest bidder. I would ensure development contracts go to top private IT firms, focusing on quality, security, and long-term performance—not cheap shortcuts.   3. Strong in-house IT teams for maintenance Every major digital platform would have a dedicated team of developers, designers, database managers, and cybersecurity specialists with: proper salaries training responsibility for monitoring and improving systems 24/7 support during peak usage No more outdated portals that never get updated.   4. A powerful, secure, fully centralized Nagarik App  The Nagarik App would become the heart of digital governance. All major documents would be stored securely inside it: citizenship passport academic certificates tax documents PAN driving license health records social security details It would also include a complaint submission section, so people can report issues directly. For those unfamiliar with digital systems, complaints could be filed through ward offices.   5. Fast online services for forms and applications  Citizens would be able to submit applications for: driving license passport police report birth registration taxation land documents with zero lag — from the website or through Nagarik App.   6. Auto-filled forms from centralized data  Once data is linked and verified, any form you open will automatically fill itself with your information. No more entering the same details a dozen times.   7. Skilled ICT technicians in every ward and municipality  Every ward office would have at least one trained computer technician who can: guide citizens fix basic errors help with online applications operate digital systems This reduces queues and makes government offices efficient.   8. Fully digital, efficient government hospitals  One of the most painful problems citizens face is in government hospitals, where even after having computers and internet, staff say: “System slow cha, online chaldaina, wait garnu parcha.” This causes people to wait for hours just for:   OPD ticket lab report payment receipts doctor appointments patient record updates   To fix this, I would: ✔ Install fast, dedicated hospital servers So patient data loads instantly without lag. ✔ Use digital queue management systems Tokens, OPD numbers, and reports would appear online or on the app—no more pushing in crowded lines. ✔ Introduce Electronic Health Records (EHR) When a patient visits any government hospital, their entire medical history loads instantly from the central system. ✔ Build a Hospital Digital Support Team Trained IT technicians in every major hospital to fix internet, system errors, and software issues immediately. ✔ Guarantee 24/7 internet uptime Hospitals would have backup connections so service never stops due to network problems. This would save time, reduce frustration, reduce corruption, and improve the entire healthcare experience.   9. Move toward a paperless digital government  Government operations would shift from physical files to secure digital systems. This reduces: corruption delays lost documents unnecessary travel wasted time Everything becomes transparent and traceable. Why this transformation is necessary Currently Nepalis suffer because of: slow servers outdated systems long queues lazy maintenance no accountability untrained staff poor hospital digitalization An entire country cannot progress with such a weak digital backbone. My commitment If I became MoCIT Minister, I would build a Nepal where: technology works smoothly government services are fast hospitals are efficient citizens don’t waste hours standing in line and every Nepali can access digital services with confidence and dignity A truly Digital Nepal — not just in words, but in real life.

            "heading": "My childhood Muslim friend from Sarlahi had to flee Nepal after reading the Quran in Arabic",
            "body": "A few days ago, I got a call from an old Muslim friend from Sarlahi, Nepal. He was calling from Germany. He had left Nepal three years earlier, and we hadn’t spoken in over a decade. We ended up talking for nearly two hours, and toward the end he shared something that has stayed with me since.  He was born and raised in a devout Muslim family. From childhood he was taught to pray five times a day (though, like most teenagers, he often missed a few). After school, he used to go to the local madrasa to memorize the Quran. I still remember asking him once, “What does it mean, the part you’re reciting?” He recited a few lines in beautiful Arabic and then admitted, “I don’t know. They don’t teach the meaning here. They just teach the recitation.”  After SLC, we both moved to Kathmandu for higher studies but ended up at different colleges. Whenever we met for tea in New Road or Ratna Park, he was still the same religious boy. He told me his dream was to learn Arabic properly so he could finally understand the Quran in its original language.  Then life happened, and we lost touch for more than ten years.  When he called the other day, we started with the usual catching-up: jobs, marriage, parents, health. Then, quietly, he said, “Brother, I finally learned Arabic. I read the Quran myself, cover to cover, in the language it was revealed.”  He paused for a long time.  What he found inside shattered him. Verses permitting sex slavery, verses cursing Jews, Christians and polytheists, verses he could never imagine were part of the book he had memorized as a child. He thought maybe he had bought a defective copy. He checked five different editions. They were still the same. In panic, thinking his Arabic wasn’t good enough, he opened translations in Nepali, Urdu, and English. Every single one said the same thing.  His iman, the faith he had guarded his whole life, collapsed. He went to local scholars, to imams he respected, begging for explanations that could save his belief. Nothing they said helped. The verses were too clear.  Finally he gathered the courage to tell his family. Their reaction? Death threats. “If you leave Islam, we will kill you ourselves. We can’t live with the shame of an apostate son.” His younger brother told him plainly, “Better you die than bring this disgrace on us.”  Nepal is not Saudi Arabia or Pakistan. We proudly call ourselves a secular republic. Yet here was my friend, a Nepali citizen, forced to flee his own country because he asked questions about his religion and found answers he could not accept.  He now lives in Germany, safe but heartbroken. He still loves his parents, his siblings, his village, the taste of mutton sekuwa at the Sarlahi haat, the smell of rain on the Bagmati plains. But there is no home for him here anymore.  I knew apostasy could be dangerous in some Muslim-majority countries. I never imagined it could happen to someone I grew up with, in our own Nepal.  Why should a person be disowned, or worse, threatened with death, just for changing his mind about religion? How is this still happening in 2025?  I am sharing my friend’s story (with his permission) because silence won’t fix this. If even one family in Nepal thinks twice before issuing a death threat to their own child for leaving religion, this post will have been worth it.  Let’s talk about it openly, honestly, without fear. Our country is big enough for people of all beliefs and none. No one should have to choose between their conscience and their life.",

Kids who question Islam or want to leave are sometimes killed by their own parents. Many girls are murdered just for rejecting strict, patriarchal rules and wanting freedom. It’s horrifying that seeking independence can cost someone their life.   A lot of people say Islam is perfect but Muslims are bad. No, Islam is nowhere perfect. It is a very regressive religion.|||All thing are not equal. All religions are not equal too. Hinduism with it's setbacks is a more liberal religion. Not defending Hinduism though.

But South Asians for generations have been told Muhammed is the only one worshippable which is why radicalization is highest in here. |||Secularism in Nepal is a joke.

So what are you? are you Muslim or you atheist or are you hinduvta?? One thing is clear that your whole motive is trying to throw dirt on Muslims , that's all your profile history shows. You go on parade as Muslim and say we Muslim do this and that like \" 𝙞 𝙝𝙤𝙥𝙚 𝙖𝙥𝙤𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙨𝙮 𝙞𝙨 𝙞𝙡𝙡𝙚𝙜𝙖𝙡\" or going to British subreddit and saying\" 𝙬𝙚 𝙬𝙤𝙪𝙡𝙙 𝙙𝙤 𝙖𝙣𝙮𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙛𝙤𝙧 𝙤𝙪𝙧 𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙖𝙝\"  trying to incite hate to get that validation when people show hate in return because that's what your ultimate goal is.

Everyone’s pockets and bags were checked still nothing. Then our teacher started checking our shoes, and that’s when she found it.  It was one of the boys. He came from a pretty problematic family and didn’t have his mother. Even after knowing he had stolen it, she didn’t scold him or embarrass him. She quietly took him to a corner, spoke to him gently, gave him some of her own money, and hugged him. Then she asked him to apologize to the girl and promise he wouldn’t do it again. She also told all of us to keep our mouths shut and not mention it to other students, teachers, or even at home.  No one talked about that incident after that.  At that time, I wondered why she would protect a thief… but now I get it, lol.",

            "body": "So I was in Kathmandu for a week and was frequently using Indrive because I had to go fast, or you could say I was too lazy to catch a bus. I had to go to Gwarko (which was a new location for me), so I decided to use Indrive. The fare was way too high, so I dropped it down to a rate that I thought was okayiish. Smhow, I found a guy who accepted the proposed fare. He was an 18 yr old student living with his brother, doing +2/Indrive side by side with his Honda Shine. He’d only been doing it for 2 weeks because his brother had fractured his leg while riding for Indrive. Bro was so unfamiliar with the roads (as in, he didn’t know how to use G-Map and reach specific locations), and the old Honda Shine kept stalling itself in the middle of the road. After 30 minutes of riding, he said, Paisa pardaina, ma arko Indrive khojdinchu hajur ko lagi, but I insisted, Dhilo bhaye ni chalcha. He kept taking longer routes for shorter ones (I actually had fun, tho). After 1:30 hours, with traffic jams and his longer routes fetish, we somehow made it to the destination. I was the victim here, but I felt bad for the guy since he was new to the job, trying to be a responsible brother, and helping his brother out in need. Sometimes, it’s important to read the environment. You don’t really know what someone else is going through. I gave him an extra 100, and he thanked me four times lol.  Tldr:- Took an Indrive to Gwarko with a new rider, an 18 yr old student. The ride was chaotic, he didn’t know the roads, his bike kept stalling, and he took longer routes. After 1:30 hours, we finally reached the destination. I was the victim here, but felt bad for him since he was just trying to help his brother(injured). Gave him an extra 100, and he thanked me four times.",

I’m Mahendra. I had posted earlier about my father, who has been diagnosed with metastatic gallbladder cancer. It’s an aggressive cancer, and every day since the diagnosis has felt like a battle we’re fighting with everything we have.  On 30th November, my father went through another round of chemotherapy. He’s trying his best to stay strong, and we’re doing everything we can to keep him comfortable and hopeful.  Thanks to your kindness — your donations, your prayers, your messages — we’ve been able to raise a little over NPR 3 Lakhs so far. From the bottom of my heart, and on behalf of my entire family: thank you. Every rupee, every share, every word of support has meant more to us than I can ever express.  But the fight is still far from over.  His treatment is ongoing, and the costs continue to rise with every cycle. Chemotherapy, immunotherapy, tests, scans, medicines — everything is painfully expensive, and we’ve already stretched our savings and borrowings to the limit. We still have a long way to go before we can cover the full cost of the treatment he needs.  So once again, with whatever strength I have left, I’m asking for your help.  as suggested by many people living outside i have started gofundme too , but i couldn't raise much amoutnt here . if you could donate or help me to post on the fb grps or wherever there is bidesh maa basni nepali dai/didi haru . it would really mean to us in  this difficult situation.  [https://gofund.me/ff2c6dbfc](https://gofund.me/ff2c6dbfc)  ani r/Assistance pani strong community to get help for gfm but i don't have much comment karma 400 minimum chaido raicha. so pls everyone upvote my comment so i could post there too.. it'll surely help.  can anyone help me to post on fb,ig,x or linkedin too. since i was not active on those social media i used to use reddit only back then. i'm not getting reach on these.  Please support us if you can.   And if you cannot donate, even sharing the fundraiser can make a real difference.   And please  keep my father in your prayers. Your kindness is what is keeping us going.  Thank you for standing with me and my family during the hardest days of our lives.   With gratitude, hope, and love.

My father has been diagnosed with metastatic gallbladder cancer, which is a very aggressive form of cancer. Since the diagnosis, our days have been filled with hospital visits, tests, medicines and treatment plans. On 30 November, he completed another round of chemotherapy. He is fighting bravely, but the side effects and the emotional strain have been extremely difficult for him and for all of us.  we come from very lower middle class family but with a dream to make me engineer and a good human my dad put all his life and sacrificed everything. He worked as a security guard in india din vari ubhiyar kaam garnu vo , hamro sapna pura garna lai and  i still  wonder \"why us\" ? He never consumed alcohol,cigarette, tombakhu or anything that is said to cause cancer now when he is admitted at hospital the main head of the family and i have to lookafter all the expenses i understand why all it happen. the burden of money to manage for studies, run family and survive was really hard for us but he never show us. That dherai chintaa about managing money became the cause for the cancer ig , chintaa le ni cancer hudo raicha. My dad is now ,, he's a cancer patient god!! I was a guy learning and doing everything to pass exams nthg more than that and still use to feel sometime \"life kati garo cha yrr,, Yo sem  ma pass vaidiana and all,,  and suddenly life put me in a place where I had to become the pillar of the family. being student and not even earning it's being extremly hard for us.  I am doing everything possible  via writing, reaching out, asking for help — because I don't want to lose my father. He is still hopeful. He still smiles even on the hardest days.  We have already used all our savings and borrowed money to continue his treatment. The cost of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, scans, tests and medicines has become overwhelming for our family. With the help of kind people, we have managed to raise a little over NPR 3 Lakhs so far, which helped cover the initial cycles, but we still have many more ahead.  I am sharing this post to provide a clear and honest update about our situation. I am not asking anyone to do work on my behalf. Anyone who wishes to support us in any form may do so if they feel comfortable. Even reading this and keeping my father in your thoughts means a lot to us.

In winter the cold air keeps pollution trapped, neither blowing away nor washing down. Everything contributes here - India contributes according to its size and population, and so does Nepal. We can't even manage the few thousands of vehicles we have in Nepal. If we could at least stop the black smoke gushing from exhausts in Kathmandu maybe we could act noble, but we can't even do that due to corruption. So with what moral superiority can we look down on the chaos in India? We could act superior if we weren't dependent on the same polluting industries and agriculture of India. We depend without limits upon food grains, vegetables, medicines, fuel, vehicles, appliances that same polluting India creates. Just because your mom or wife is in a smoky kitchen doesn't mean you can act smug and call them polluters while you are still eating the food they cooked.

            "body": "Okay I need to rant for a second.  As someone who has lived in South Korea for 10+ years—a country with one of the best public transportation systems on the planet—coming back to Nepal feels like entering a different century.  The buses? No schedule. No reliability. Half the time you don’t even know if the bus is going to stop or just fly past you like you’re invisible. And when it does stop, you’re basically fighting for your life trying to get inside.  Microbuses? I swear these things break the laws of physics. Somehow they pack 25 people into a space designed for 12, and the conductor will still shout “aaja aaja, thau chha!” like it's a joke.  Routes? Good luck. Wanna go somewhere? You better pray you know someone who knows someone who once took that route when they were 16. Google Maps? Lol. Schedules? Double lol.  Traffic? I’m convinced Kathmandu traffic is a social experiment to test human patience.  After living in Korea—where buses arrive to the minute, subways are clean, safe, on time, and everything just makes sense—Nepal’s transportation feels like torture.  I’m not saying we need bullet trains or ultra-modern subways. I’m just saying… can we at least get buses that come when they say they will? Or like… signs? Information? Anything?  End of rant. I just needed to scream into the void.",

There are two realistic pathways you could take if you stayed in Nepal.  - work at private  - work at government   I have tried working at private. But the amount of discrimination being done in private companies really blew me up. As someone who was also preparing for government jobs, I had noticed lots of underprivileged folks participating in government jobs exam(for computer engineer as well). I used to ponder what made them do this since this is not a very lucrative job compared to what a \"certain community\" person makes at private or \"certain community\" person grows at private job. But later realized that private companies are not interested to hire these \"underprivileged\" folks.   Lots of people might argue (although they know it is not true) private jobs hire on merit. No they do not do so in Nepal. It is completely based off connections. It does not matter your knowledge. It is about who you know 100%. I am not ignorant that this might be the case outside, but I swear to god everyday, esto garera USA ma jasto innovative companies cha tyo ta pakkai hudainthyo..   The reason for such favoritism is mainly because the work they do is so shit. Leaving few companies who developer softwares that Nepalese use on daily basis(Not ludo), other jobs are not very interesting to do either. It is the same low quality menial job with meagre pay.   The companies who have a business are handful already. Investor ko money burn garne jasto nepal ma kei hudaina as there are no investors. So you see these bitchy ass companies hiring full stack developer every day for the salary of an intern.     I could not really be bothered with working under someone and taking all nonsense blames for 30,000 per month on hand. With no future and no growth and dismissing my self esteem. My aviman is and was huge.   The second pathway is to work at government corporations. I looked at the salary of computer engineer at Nepal Army, Nijamati and it is decent. But the upwards mobility is just not there. What I mean by that is salary is not growing when you grow your experience. Aba ta government employee specially nijamati lai dekhne bittikai yo bhrastachari raicha bhanne lagcha. Kinaki bhrastachar nagari ta khana basnai napugne. Pradhan Sena Pati ko talab cha 67000. Social security benefits cha good and all but cash in hand ni aileko market rate anusar ta dinu paryo ni. 67000 ma kam garne pradhansenapati le ghus nakhaye k garera palne? lol.  I looked at corporations salary. And it seems that if you manage to get a handle at a corporation(Sansthans), you can make be sure to make average of 60-70 thousands per month even as a 6th level officer. At this point of my career, this seems fair enough. But it will not be enough after 5 years, if my increment is just 1 thousand per year.    A huge reform is required in government services. Government services (specially nijamati) are the core to how people feel about the government. If we cannot make it attractive and lucrative, it does not matter how rich we are saving on their salary.  Next option is moving abroad.  Aba ko market ma abroad ma PR paune/GC paune biswas ta chaina. Unless you do the jobs that Americans do not want to do (or foreigners) like teaching for 60k/year, nursing old people etc.  15 years bidesh ma basna jane. Kam garne and coming back to Nepal. It seems the most plausible way forward. Nepal ma ayepachi k garne bhanne hunasakcha however.  The countries in option to stay for so long are Japan, India. Do not want to surrender my passport to Dubai sheikh. Also middle east is terror and war prone so do not want to end up there.   Europe tira padna gaye matra ho. It seems bleak for immigrants nowadays. And I do not think they earn that much in Europe (for someone planning to return back to Nepal and not stay there). Teta nabasne bhayepachi social security ko teti matlab bhayena.   How about USA? USA seems fine and all. but I do not think getting a work permit after Masters degree is going to be easy. Or that you are going to make big bucks and save big bucks as an immigrant in this economy. Since PR/GC is not guaranteed, you are basically playing a zero sum game. The experience that you get in abroad and education bla bla is huge investment however.",

I want to build a real career in IT so I can eventually work remotely or move abroad. I want something realistic that I can learn in about a year and turn into a stable, good-paying job.  Honestly, I’m not interested in freelancing or full-stack because (personally) it feels oversaturated and too creative (for each project) and portfolio-heavy, but I’m still open if I’m wrong. I don’t wanna sound picky, and desperate, like “I only want X, not Y.” Please don't get me wrong. I'm willing to learn and work. I’m flexible - I just want something that's worth my time and effort.

I literally don't care if it's hard or impossible, coz now it's a necessity.. I am ready to sacrifice my time. I wanna invest in myself (my skills).  So, please, I need your help to choose the right direction.  I’d really appreciate any honest suggestions, roadmaps, or personal stories from people who started in a similar place.  Thanks a lot.",

QA is the easiest and fastest way to get a job because it’s not too saturated, Nepal hires many freshers, and you don’t need a portfolio or degree. IT support is the most stable long-term option because it’s beginner friendly, companies always need support staff, and it naturally leads to higher-paying roles like SysAdmin or Cloud Engineer. Cybersecurity is the most future-proof, global, and high-demand field, but it requires more effort in the first few months.  Things like frontend, full-stack, and freelancing are not the best starting point when you’re broke and need stability fast; they take longer and require portfolios or creativity. A simple one-year plan would look like this: for QA, learn manual testing first, then SQL/API testing, and later basic automation. For IT support, learn computer basics, networking, and ticketing tools, then move towards cloud platforms. For cybersecurity, start with networking and Linux, then learn security basics and practice SOC labs.  If you want something fast, choose QA. If you want something stable and practical, go for IT support. If you want long-term growth and international opportunities, choose cybersecurity. Any of these three can realistically change your life within a year if you stay focused|||You’re only 23, so you have time on your side.

What did those first few months feel like — mentally, financially, emotionally? * Do you ever regret your decision to move? If yes, what moments made you feel that way? And if no, what kept you motivated? * What was the reality from day one? Did you struggle to find part-time work? Was balancing study and work harder than you expected? How lonely was it, if at all? * Did your journey turn out the way you had imagined? Or did things change once you arrived? * Are you still working in IT now? If not, what pulled you away from the field? Did you find your way back eventually? * Looking back, was the move worth it for you — personally, professionally, and financially? * What would you genuinely tell someone in Nepal who is earning decently in IT and is thinking of coming to Australia as a student? Should they do it? Should they wait? Should they stay? And what should they prepare for? * How did this move impact your mental health? Did you feel lost, homesick, or confused about your career at any point? * What was the biggest shock you faced after coming here? (job market, rent, workload, lack of time, loneliness, culture, etc.) * Do you feel you’ve grown as a person after moving — or do you feel stuck? * If you could talk to your “old self” back in Nepal before coming, what advice would you give?",

Bahrut stup - 2300 years old.   Buddha's story is  sculpted in this Stup. Mahamaya (Buddha's mother) is seen protected by Elephant. Another art shows her dreaming an elephant. There is also a story where buddha tamed Mad Elephant. So elephant holds importance in buddhism. You can google it.   As the time fly, scholars began their own narration and interpretation.  Mahavairocana tantra -7th/8th century. One of the foundational texts of esoteric buddhism. Here Ganesha appears as Vinayaka, often portrayed as an obstacle creating diety sub dued by the buddha's mantra. Yet once pacified. He becomes a protector.  Kanguyar - the tibetan buddhism canon, preserves several tantric texts where Ganapati is invoked. Toh 666, Toh 665 heart of mantra appears here.  Sadhanmala -a vast collection of tantric sadhanas compiled between 10th to 11th centuries include detailed rituals of Maha rakta Ganapati and other ganesha forms. These practice invoke Ganesha as a wealth bestowing and obstacle clearing diety.  In buddhism, the ganapati hridaya sutra also known as the arya maha ganapati hridaya dharani, is a sacred mantra given by shakyamuni buddha to his desciple Ananda.  Mostly Ganesha is seen in Tibetan and Vajryan with more than 4 hands.  All the buddhist countries as Japan, Thailand , indonesia (former), China see elephant head diety as buddhist god.  Ganesha images in China occur between 6th to 7th century.  Lets see where Ganesha appears in Brahmin religion (hindu).  Rigveda - 1464AD is the oldest surviving manuscripts (30 pages or folios of birch bark) submitted by Indian Governmet to UNESCO.  Ganesha does not appear in it.  And in later rigveda version also, Ganesha vagueley appears. In short, hindu Ganesha does not exist.  They may claim Veda is million years old, but we must stick with history not theories.  Ganesha Purana - 13 to 17 th century. It explains the story of Ganesha.  However , it seems the ganesha cult started form 9th/11th century.|||“Kaaaaa yesto Kura gareko hera,   Yo tah hamro Saan ani dharma ho ni ,  Hami ajhai every tourist destination ma religious sites banau parcha ,  Nepal and its natural beauty jawos Kholai khola .tyo ek dui Jana tourist naayera k huncha Hami Lai.”|||Desh tikekai India ra Indian tourists le ho ta saathi.

Most of the tourists that these places receive are mostly internal tourist, which is Nepalese, and majority of Indians, and buddhist. These places aren't attracting any secular tourists as such, plus just because they suddenly declared Nepal is a secular country, doesn't erase it's civilizational history, any western tourist when he thinks of Nepal, the things that comes in his mind are mountains, buddha, temples, monastries and stuffs, that's what they expect.  So, when there is already enough reason, Temples are automatically going to be built.  Plus, we have more and enough evidences that after building temples or statues in such places, the tourism has actually gone up.  So, it makes no sense why you are mad here.  Regarding the shoes, except the main area of Temple, it's wrong to just dictate to open shoes, that's something we all can raise voice.  Regarding Bhajan, that's definitely wrong, no one can just blast any Bhajan in such open place whenever they like it. And, this issue is also solvable.  It's sad that just because of these two issue of shoes and Bhajan, you went on to attack the existence of Mandir and statues themselves without actually understanding the overall context.|||I was there this summer, they never said to take off my shoes and there wasn't any bhajan and stuff.|||What’s the meaning behind this is Pokhara not Janakpur?|||keta keti haru jun thau pani romanticize garne lul.

Trendy: they're brainwashed, selfish, came for masubhat  Reality: UML has strong foundation and institutions in every sectors, from education to workers, farmers, employees, businesses.   These organizations/institutions although have bad reputations, have done some apprecianle deeds too. From volunteering, blood donations, scholarship schemes etc. For eg. UML's student union was the first one to reach to Kalapani and put Nepal's flag on the land.   What we're doing is just bashing them on the internet with mostly baseless accusations. (Mostly, not all). That's not how you defeat an established and strong organization.

I wanted to take a moment to share something from the heart, especially for the Gen Z community here. I’m not here to lecture, judge, or pretend that I “know better.” In fact, it’s the opposite—I’m here because I genuinely admire a lot about Gen Z, and I’d love to learn from you if you’re open to talking or sharing your perspectives.  What I really respect about your generation is the honesty. The courage to say things out loud that older generations kept buried. The way you call out what doesn’t feel right, whether it’s in society, culture, work, or even in yourselves. The world is changing fast, and you all seem to face it with a unique blend of humor, vulnerability, and resilience. And honestly, that’s inspiring.  I’m not perfect, and I don’t pretend to fully understand everything about today’s trends, language, mindset, or struggles. But I’m here with an open mind. If any Gen Z member is willing to talk—to enlighten me, challenge me, laugh with me, or even correct me—I’d sincerely appreciate it.  I’m reaching out with respect and humility. I’m here to listen, not impose. Thank you to anyone who takes a moment to respond. 🙏🏽|||yesto sanskar vaka le kasto desh banauxan hola?

I’m truly grateful. Recently during an interview, I shared my personal political standpoint. I mentioned that I do not personally recognize K.P. Oli as a leader whose ideology I align with. I say this not out of disrespect, but from a place of accountability and responsibility toward our nation. After the recent Gen Z protests, I believe many of us expected honest conversations, acknowledgment of public concerns, and accountability for the injustices that occurred under his administration where many lives were lost. When leadership is unable to take responsibility for such serious matters, it becomes difficult for me to support or follow their ideology. My intention is not to attack individuals, but to stand for truth, transparency, and a future where leaders are answerable to the people. I believe Nepal deserves leadership that listens, learns, and upholds justice for every citizen. Thank you once again to everyone who resonated with my thoughts. Let’s continue pushing for a better and more responsible political culture together.|||So many Incel chicks in comment, are we even safe?|||Nepal is literally full of chutiyas like these, logic fact kei chaina 😂 .

            "body": "I swear, the more I watch Miraj Dhungana’s actions after the Gen-Z protests, the more pissed off I get. This guy went from saying “I’m not the leader, this is a collective movement” to suddenly announcing a whole political party under the Garikhana Deu banner like it’s some kind of personal promotion. Do you even realize how ridiculous that looks? We were told this movement was leaderless, built on the frustration of an entire generation, and now the SAME person who said he wasn’t leading anything is stepping into politics like he’s been preparing the whole time. It feels like the movement’s energy was used as a ladder.  And don’t even get me started on the way he handled the October 9 protest confusion. When young people were panicking, waiting for clarity, ready to go to the streets again because the country is literally suffocating under corruption, what does he do? He steps back. He shrugs it off and says Gen-Z wasn’t involved. Bro, if you’re going to speak for the movement when it’s convenient, then show up when shit gets chaotic too. That’s literally what leadership is. Instead, he pops up when the cameras are rolling and disappears the moment things get risky. That kind of pick-and-choose activism makes me angry because that’s exactly the political behavior we protested against.  Then there’s the whole “our office was attacked” episode. He went public with it, made it sound serious, and then the police said there was no official complaint, and everything was calm when they arrived. What are we supposed to believe? Either be transparent or don’t dramatize it. People actually suffered during these protests. People bled. People DIED. And watching someone drag the movement into half-explained drama with zero clarity is honestly insulting.  What makes me the most furious is how he keeps talking like he represents the entire generation, giving big speeches about unity, direct elections, overseas voting, and political reform, while his actions keep zig-zagging all over the place. You don’t get to call yourself the voice of Gen-Z while making moves that look inconsistent, self-centered, and convenient. The Gen-Z protests weren’t a TikTok trend. They weren’t a branding opportunity. They were a desperate cry from a generation that’s tired of being silenced and robbed of a future.  Watching someone turn that into a messy political ambition is heartbreaking and infuriating. We didn’t risk our safety so one guy could walk around looking like a “youth politician.” We marched for real change. For accountability. For a country that doesn’t chew its future generation alive. And right now, Miraj feels like he’s drifting so far from the soul of that movement that it’s honestly painful.  If he actually wants to stand for Gen-Z, then he needs to stop playing this half-activist, half-politician game and show some damn consistency, clarity, and courage because right now, all I’m seeing is another person using the movement’s energy to put himself in the spotlight.  Anyone else feel like this? Because I’m seriously done pretending this is okay.    And here are the straight-up questions people genuinely have for him:  Who is funding your movement, your events, and now this new political party?  Why did you claim there was “no leader” during the protests but suddenly step into a political role afterward?  When exactly did you decide to form a party during the protests or after?  If you didn’t intend to be a leader, why are you acting like one now?  Why do you vanish or disengage whenever things get tense, unclear, or dangerous?  Why was the October 9 situation handled so confusingly by you?  Why talk about an attack on your office but file no clear, formal police complaint?  Who keeps you accountable? Who checks your decisions?  What gives you the right to speak on behalf of an entire generation?  Are you building a movement or building a personal political brand?",

So support those who want corruption free nation, not a certain generation|||here's my 2 cents(you can check my post history to determine the kind of person I am)  He's from a well-off family. He's been doing 'media' stuff like making videos and shit from a while ago but he hasn't been 'in the streets' as a kid and it shows. Call me backwards or whatever but if you never got into fights as a kid, or even as a teenager, you don't have that 'bite'. That's him. That softness combined with good looks and branding made him the perfect mascot for non-violent 'gen-z'. He's great as a model but as a ruthless and calculating leader that can lead hundreds of people to bring a certain outcome? Nope.. he's a weak kid inside. Aba ko political events le uslai daro banauna chai sakcha hai in that regard.  He got scared after the sep 8/9 incidents, fearing that his good life could get stripped away from him. He's someone with a lot to lose. His family and relatives probably held him back. Tespachi he probably came back to the front ali pachi with some kind of a plan. Aile chai I just think he's trying to do what he thinks and knows is right - play by the political system's rules. And since we all have severe trauma related to anything 'political party' related, we hate to see it.  Sudan is the opposite of miraj - he's been in the field, has scolded corrupt officials to their face since 2015, has had literal dirt and blood on him. But he's not an eloquent speaker like miraj, he's got 'a look' but the kind of person he has become, branding himself online is not sth he cares about. Whatever he is, is his brand.  In any case, we gotta be careful and discerning and support where needed and criticize where appropriate.

Intentions sahi hola but yinarle anarchy matra badauxan.|||Not a Zenzee and while I appreciate the revolution and all, they have slowly becoming Oli gang. What it demonstrates is the blood we have - thirsty for oneself, power, money, opportunity. I am particularly upset with Sudan Gurung who is hell bent at removing Home Minister and this guy called Miraj Dhungana. I will dismiss Miraj right off the bat because I don't see anything in his eyes and his face. He is a selfish person and anyone who is following him and all should think many times. Sudan Gurung - the guy is hell bent on removing home minister on such a stupid demand that he wants to arrest Oli and Lekhak. What the hell guys ? are you looking for rawanraj? we have laws and we want to enforce it fairly and strictly. Om Prakash is a lawyer and he is not trying to protect Oli or Lekhak - anyone thinks that is such a stupid Zenzee. Do you guys want to arrest someone just on a whim? without gathering sufficient proof? In western countries law enforcement officials spend years if not decades monitoring and gathering evidences against someone they think is culprit - they just don't  arrest someone and investigate - that wouldn't be rule of law. Om Prakash has that schooling. I don't care who Om Prakash is and all but he is definitely a capable guy and has proved it time and again - after all, he is chosen by PM.  Now, are you guys looking to change ministers and government leadership when we only have 4 months to go ? Its such a shame when every so called Zenzee goes to Singhadarbar and disturbs our government's actions. Just think if all the time they spend is meeting you guys.     Now listen to what Mahabir Pun said - please go to your constituencies and help new  political parties that align to your views win - why are you spending so much energies trying to meet the PM ? The Miraj Dhungana is such a scam guy - He is driven by his own ambition, I feel. I did like Sudan but he is also active childish and not a thing in near future.  Whatever everyone says and does listen and watch what Rachha Bam says and does. She is the one who walked out with Army Chief when he seemed to infer democracy was in danger. She is acting with passion and patience. I would recommend everyone to support behind Raswapa, Sagar Dhakal, Baburam, Kulman,  Sumana Shrestha. Sumana is the real deal.     Now if you believe in democracy and free and fair election, support Rabi. How can a person so beloved by people can be in jail without having an opportunity to go to people? is democracy is for the people and by the people?     I recommend please read. Watch what Swarmin Wagle said few days that Deuba was Zenzee, Oli was Zenzee and every popular leader was zenzee when they started politics. There has been tremendous progress but it was not enough. Just because you feel young and under 25 doesn't mean its your government and can do anything. Nope - no way until we have rule of law.     Now this government gotta focus on election and it has to happen. When I hear Miraj and Sudan that say it can't happen in current condition are not only naïve but foolish. They gotta go read what democracy is. Nothing happens without people's mandate which is vote.     And don't forget its not you guys who brought this change - it was a coincidence.  Someone else did on 24th so you really shouldn't overwhelmingly take any credit, especially Miraj who didn't even take part in the protest ! Hope it helps.|||Ani aaja bholi singa durbar bhitra baseka haru protocol follow garera aako hun ta ??|||miraj and party >>>>> yemale and other similar parties|||Yea the protest was headless/leaderless but we need people to lead you can't complain he gained from this protest of course he did and we want a capable leader to run office not military the argument that he was not in the protest is stupid this is exactly why we failed as national because we put fighters as leaders they can be leaders while fighting but in office we need people who lead office not mobs and arms   Not taking his side but this was a common argument against him and I disagree so this ...

They did not achieve anything despite such massive movement except toppling Government.   Miraj Dhungana came into realization. An organised group is must to move forward. The most important thing a leader should have is a clean image and clear vision. The maturity he has shown not being political figure is admirable.   One of the good thing coming out of Gen Z movement is the youth having interest on politics and stepping forward to be incharge.  We should not discourage them, in the same time help them by giving healthy and constructive criticisms.|||आज उनीहरूले गरेको माग केपी र लेखक लाई सजाए को दायरा मा ल्याउनुपर्छ भन्ने विषयमा थियो। सायद त्यो माग राख्नु गलत भयो होला है।|||Yo sub pani flip bhaira hunxa harek bela.

Muslims of Nepal posted about their happiness when Taliban came back to power, they side with muslims be it anywhere in the world, buddhist burmese vs rohingya muslims they will take sides with muslims, indian hindus va muslims, they will pick muslims, syrian Christians vw muslimw they will pick muslims and so on… When Palestinians atatcked israel , Many musims living in Nepal celebrated it but then they never condemned the murders of 11 innocent Nepali citizens by Hamas.  They will always make reasons like we are Nepali muslims and we are different but their genetics, history is the same as that of Indian muslims as majority of musilmw living in Nepal migrated from Kashmir, UP, Bihar and Bangladesh .  For Muslims, religion comes first before nationality. Many groups within nepal have differences between them but for them the nation comes first, you will see a hindu nepali protesting against India and Buddhist protesting about illegal citizenship to Tibetan refugees. But a muslim will never say anything about illegal migration of Rohingyas .   Also, these people are real fanatics and radicals . ApM ssaid something that’s true, many arab nations don’t provide equal opportunities to women. Saudi just maid it legal for women yo obtain driver’s licenses just a year ago, many of the women can’t travel alone, islam allows mens to have multiple wives but why isn’t the same applied towards women?  Also, PM mentioned that in the past muslims women in muslims nation faced far much difficulties and there was no reason to be triggered about it.  They literally made movies about Sati practices withng some community but no one came put to protest against the release, had it been something about muslims they will flood the streets .  At the end, its upto nepali to believe that muslims of Nepal are different from rest of south asian muslims. I wonder when most of the madarsas, mosques have bangaldeshi, paksitani imams and scholars how will the teachings be any different?

Around a year worth of income of an average Nepalese just for a 2 years of teen's study.  My experience with Kavya was that my mom went there just to check it out (ofcourse it was out of our budget) and sadly she entered her number in some survey they had.      The number of calls those nggas made during 2 whole weeks, fk. We kept on declining and blocking their numbers but everytime it was a new number lmao. When we first asked for discount, they declined for even a rupee but later on they started giving offers themselves, despo times for them ig.

            "body": "Namaste rNepal,  My name is Mahendra. I wanted to share an update about my father’s health and the situation my family is currently facing.  My father has been diagnosed with metastatic gallbladder cancer, which is a very aggressive form of cancer. Since the diagnosis, our days have been filled with hospital visits, tests, medicines and treatment plans. On 30 November, he completed another round of chemotherapy. He is fighting bravely, but the side effects and the emotional strain have been extremely difficult for him and for all of us.  we come from very lower middle class family but with a dream to make me engineer and a good human my dad put all his life and sacrificed everything. He worked as a security guard in india din vari ubhiyar kaam garnu vo , hamro sapna pura garna lai and  i still  wonder \"why us\" ? He never consumed alcohol,cigarette, tombakhu or anything that is said to cause cancer now when he is admitted at hospital the main head of the family and i have to lookafter all the expenses i understand why all it happen. the burden of money to manage for studies, run family and survive was really hard for us but he never show us. That dherai chintaa about managing money became the cause for the cancer ig , chintaa le ni cancer hudo raicha. My dad is now ,, he's a cancer patient god!! I was a guy learning and doing everything to pass exams nthg more than that and still use to feel sometime \"life kati garo cha yrr,, Yo sem  ma pass vaidiana and all,,  and suddenly life put me in a place where I had to become the pillar of the family. being student and not even earning it's being extremly hard for us.  I am doing everything possible  via writing, reaching out, asking for help — because I don't want to lose my father. He is still hopeful. He still smiles even on the hardest days.  We have already used all our savings and borrowed money to continue his treatment. The cost of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, scans, tests and medicines has become overwhelming for our family. With the help of kind people, we have managed to raise a little over NPR 3 Lakhs so far, which helped cover the initial cycles, but we still have many more ahead.  I am sharing this post to provide a clear and honest update about our situation. I am not asking anyone to do work on my behalf. Anyone who wishes to support us in any form may do so if they feel comfortable. Even reading this and keeping my father in your thoughts means a lot to us.

            "body": "Hello! Myself (20M), along with two of my friends and our families, visited Nepal during the Diwali holidays. We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8. Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)

            "comments": "First of all, commendations for such well written and structured post, that too with all the additional info at the end. (For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".  During off season, it's easily manageable & fun because less people & no need to queue to get a selfie with some peculiar rock or a waterfall, butttttt, it's called off season for a reason, the majestic views might be compromised or not, it's a gamble.|||Dhulikhel rock view point, man why would they take you there! 🤦  Are you speaking 'Bangla'?|||Bhaktapur is the jewel 🙏|||kudos to camera work- given the health condition of your mum- i recommend you sepnd more time in chitwan- janakpur and lumbini-- may be 3 days each city- it covers pilgrimage and cultural aspect-|||Others have already suggested you some places to visit, so I just want to give you one important piece of advice. I have a relative who works as a travel agent, and he told me that many agents and shopkeepers tend to focus more on foreign tourists than on Indians, because they believe they can overcharge them easily. So, bro, be careful  there are many thugs and dishonest agents who might try to charge you extra. **Bargaining is the key.**  In almost every corner, if a hotel recommends you a place or a service, remember that the hotel usually gets a commission from it. The entire system in tourist areas like Thamel often runs on commission-based deals. So it’s always better to ask genuine locals for suggestions rather than agents pretending to be locals. In Thamel, you’ll find many such people who act friendly but are just trying to make money off tourists.  If you have Nepali friends, you can travel cheaply and safely otherwise, just be a bit cautious and smart while dealing with people. To be honest, a few uneducated people here may dislike Indian tourists, and that’s an unfortunate reality. But overall, we Nepalese are known to be **very hospitable, kind, and friendly**, and most people will treat you with respect and warmth. Just stay alert, bargain wisely, and you’ll have a wonderful time in Nepal.|||Bro, timi Darjeeling bata vayae taa, yo sabai Normal hola ni taa timro laagi taa?? 🤔|||where did u take that video bro? was it in pokhara?|||You skipped Bandipur en route Pokhara from Kathmandu.

If you love mountains then visit Muktinath temple in Mustang.||| Travel Package link?|||Chitwan lumbini Nagarkot Panauti all the 4 durbar squares are good too|||Wow! Look at those towering mountains. So stunning!|||Kudos for well organized post. Go to Mustang, you can reserve scorpio or take your own vehicle. It will be worth it since you are mesmerised by Sarangkot.  Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||Have a great time here, enjoy it and after you go back to your home just think is it fair to take land of the country who provided you with such great hospitality?|||[deleted]",

Awareness 2. Bans, stronger rules 3. Traffic police checks  What has worked and what will work is pricing. Get rid of rules that promote cartelling and let capitalism solve the issue.   If you had the choice to pay 20 rupees more but travel with slightly more comfort, and with a nice seat, maybe 30-40% of people would be willing to pay, which in result means more businesses willing to invest in public transport as they seek profit, more competition, better services. Those who offer neither good service nor good pricing then deserve go out of business.  This weird government backed cartelling with fixed artifical prices will never work.|||We should implement a metro-style system for local transport in Kathmandu. Currently many buses operate within the ring road but cannot travel beyond it due to narrow and congested lanes. Even when they do it only results in traffic jams.  What if we introduced autos in the valley that follow the same routes as local transport and carry 3–4 passengers per ride? Buses and vans could be restricted to the ring road and every bus stop along the ring road could have designated autos and rickshaws to drop passengers to their destinations at the same fare.  If implemented all the microbuses and hiaces could be replaced with standard buses which would likely cause less congestion than the current smaller vehicles.|||The metropolitan and the yatayat syndicate are the problems. There should be a limit on the number of passengers each vehicle can carry. For large buses, it should not be more than 110% of the number of seats. And for microbuses, it should not be more than 100% of the seating capacity. The limit rule should be enforced by the traffic police.   It's a systemic problem and requires a systemic solution.|||Nepal yatayat ma gundruk khade vanda namajale khadiyeko yaad ayo|||nonchalant khalasi dai|||Ajhai 3 Jana atne thau cha.|||Khalasi be like pachadi sarnus na tetro khali cha|||aghii pakhai ho ni..khalashi haru huncha micro ra yatayaat ko bhadaa karcha.

The land already belongs to a government body, in this case, TU, it made things easy.  But elsewhere in larger projects, main reason this is difficult is because of people. For example, the nagdhunga project was stalled for 6 months because of local demands of alternative water supply, compensation money, jobs for the locals, etc. Without this, it would have already been completed last year.  Now, significant amount of taxpayer money in infrastructure projects are spent in land acquisition. The only way for Nepal to develop fast is i. stop people needlessly stopping projects and either ii. significant land reform, or complete land price collapse and people to stop seeing land as investment.|||This was a dream for cricket fan like me!!

I'm no expert but I  do come with a few facts . The actual knowledge I feel like I know it better than anyone here. Not bragging .  So take it as a means of education. I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it.

She recently had a baby, so I was genuinely happy to visit her and meet her newborn. I was meeting her in person after 2 years.  We cooked together, washed the dishes, gossiped a lot, and I came home with a full heart.  Then at the dinner table, my parents asked what caste she is. I told them… and they immediately started talking about caste differences and how I shouldn’t visit her house for meals, and how she shouldn’t come to ours. Hearing them talk about her caste that way absolutely broke my heart. I couldn’t control my tears, and my mom said, “kina yesto chitta dukhako. Pitri farak farak hunxa, manxe yeutai matra vayerw hunna. Hamlai ni aaru le yesto garxan, hamle ni garnu parxa. Paxi tha pauxau, etc etc.”  We never had serious caste conversations before. In fact, I remember them teaching us that these things shouldn’t exist, that we’re all equal. And they’ve never shown this kind of behavior toward others who visit our home or toward our tenants who are the same caste as my friend? I'm confused and upset with this interaction with my parents.",

Our parents grew up in a time where extreme casteism was normal. They didn’t create it, but they were raised inside that system, taught to follow it, and warned about the consequences of not doing so. Education shapes the mind, and the education they received reinforced these beliefs regardless of religion, culture, or society. So they’re not entirely wrong, and we’re not entirely right either.  The real problem is that we often fail to understand the environment they grew up in and the fears they carried. Instead of trying to see their side, we sometimes blame them or play the victim because it’s the easier option. But change takes understanding from both generations—not just criticism. 🙏|||This will just go with this generation or maybe next or next but you just forget what they said and forget about the cast system as well and just focus on people's behavior and if nobody talks about it next generation is not even going to know such a thing and it will just go away.

It’s painful when people who taught us about equality show a different side. Caste ideas came through shared history and influence from India, but we don’t have to carry them forward.

            "heading": "A Night in Kathmandu — The Unexpected Bar Scam Experience",
            "body": "After completing our last destination in Kathmandu, our Nepal trip was almost coming to an end. We had planned to spend the evening shopping around local markets before heading back home.  But as luck would have it, the weather had other plans. It started raining heavily, and most of us decided to cancel the shopping plan and stay inside the bus, waiting for the rain to stop.  While we were sitting there, a Nepali guy — sort of an agent — climbed onto the bus. He started chatting with my friend, talking about dance bars, attractive girls, and fun nightlife in Kathmandu. My friends, curious and excited to explore something different, agreed to check it out. So, we went along with him from Gaushala Chowk.  ⸻  The Arrival  We reached around 7 PM. The place looked more like a small pub or lounge — dim lights, loud music, and barely anyone inside. There were just two Indian guys with a few Nepali girls, sitting at a corner table, smoking hukka and drinking.  We were a group of 12 people, so we took two tables (6 on each). I sat on the other table, while two Nepali girls from the bar joined my friends’ table. They were friendly, laughing, and talking in Hindi — chit chat, masti, jokes — sab Hindi mein.  After a few minutes, the girls said they wanted to have a drink. The same agent who brought us there told my friend, “Sir, bas 400 Rs ka juice hai.” They wrote the order on a small paper chit, took my friend’s signature, and soon two juices were served.  That’s how their system worked — write on paper, take a sign, and serve the order.  We also ordered 4 beers for ourselves. Out of 12, only 4 were drinking — the rest were just watching the dance show.  ⸻  The Show Begins  Soon, Nepali girls started dancing on Hindi songs, followed by a couple of male dancers and another girl joining the floor. The vibe felt okay at first — typical dance bar scene, music, lights, drinks.  But after the girls finished their drinks, a waiter brought a hukka pot to our table without even asking. We immediately told him to take it away. The girls got off from our table soon after that.  ⸻  Something Felt Off  After finishing the beer, me and my friend went to the washroom. There we saw those same two Indian guys who were sitting earlier — looked like North Indians (maybe Delhi or Haryana). They seemed tense, arguing with the bar staff.  Out of curiosity, I asked one of them, “Bhai kya hua?” He said, “Dekho na bhai, kuch khaya nahi, thoda piya sirf — aur bill 32,000 Nepali bana diya!”  That one line was enough to send chills down my spine.  I quickly went back to my table and told my friend what had happened. We immediately asked for our bill — but the damage was already done.  ⸻  The Shocking Bill  The bill came in Nepali currency: \t•\t4 Beers = 4000 \t•\t2 Drinks for girls = 8000 \t•\t23% Service charge = 2760 Total = 14,760 NRS (≈ 9,840 INR)  My friend was shocked. He said, “Ladies drink price to 400 bola tha,” but by then, the agent who brought us there had vanished.  There was no point arguing — the staff was large in number, and the situation didn’t look safe. Finally, we settled the bill for 9,500 INR and left the place quietly.  ⸻  What Happened Next  As we were leaving, I noticed those two Indian guys being locked in a small office, surrounded by bar staff demanding they hand over their mobiles or belongings to pay off the bill.  I felt genuinely bad for them — and guilty for not sitting at my friend’s table earlier, or checking the price list before signing that paper chit.  But at the same time, I was thankful that we escaped early — with just a 4-beer loss instead of a full-blown scam.  ⸻  The Reality Behind the Glamour  While we were stepping out, a few more Nepali guys entered, and immediately all the bar girls — including those who had been at our table — went to join them, smoking hukka and ordering drinks.  Just watching that, I could only think: “Isko to aaj 40,000–50,000 ka chuna lagne wala hai.”  ⸻  Final Thoughts  Our Nepal trip overall was beautiful — from Pokhara’s serenity to the spiritual vibe of Pashupatinath. But this one Kathmandu nightlife experience was a reminder that not everything that glitters is gold.  If you ever plan to explore nightlife in Kathmandu, be cautious: \t•\tNever sign anything you don’t understand. \t•\tAlways ask for the price upfront. \t•\tAnd if something feels shady — walk away.  This experience became a story to remember — not for the fun, but for the lesson it taught us.",

His work is visible, but he is corrupt.  Balen is the only person whom I can say with confidence is not corrupt, yet. But he is no politician, and I don't think he will ever be. It is also very hard for him to open party with individual who is not involved in any scandal, and keep his non-corrupt image intact.  Rabi has his own problems. However, he is the only person at the moment who is a politician, and not involved with old goons. Only his party could have defeated the old goons, but since he is in jail, RSP will not get majority seats this time.  So, the new alternative forces combined will still not have majority in present scenario. Only way the alternative forces can have majority is if Balen and Kulman would have join RSP with Rabi still as head of RSP. But this scenario was simply not possible from start. Balen cannot associate himself with people with scandals, and Kulman is not really an alternative force, but rather the produce of the old goons who is not as bad as the old goons.|||Chup machikney tyo purano vanda yei thiq , reddit ma aayera na vuk|||One thing I will suggest if new party is contesting In some constituency just don't contest in that area. The same tactic Congress did with maobadi during election. After winning form an alliance which is the best thing to do. For that rpp rsp and new parties should agree on this. But the problem is will people trust these party chances are high they might change if favourable and good candidates are provided. Another thing CK raut did the worst mistake by completely showcasing the madesh separation thing. The thing is he would have ideal for collation to collaborate in madesh election. But one thing is for sure he lost his own madesh people club after gen z election and this statement have made him more hateful among madesh youth. Boy is gonna loose huge. Be sure three taukeys of madesh mahant thakur upendra and Rajendra are no way gonna go against uml and congress. They will completly support them and form government in madesh with majority seats.

It’s impossible to have good people lead the country when constitution promotes forming political alliance instead of promoting qualified candidate.|||First read the RSP bidhan. Unlike traditional parties, anyone with potentiality can join and compete in elections.  If Rabi Lamichane had wanted, he could have pushed Kulman Ghising as face of RSP for PM. Rabi didn't have to handover chairman. As he is in jail. He cannot run the country anyway.  There are others beside Rabi, who are aiming for PM in absence of Rabi. That's why the discussion failed. Don't blame on Kulman Ghising.  Kulman Ghising is the only person, that knows bureaucracy from core. He knows where to tweak and break. They can't fool him. He is needed for country. If RSP wants change. Then, they must give up their ego.|||You can read the indepth article to find out how Sumana and the gang along with Balen and Kulman tried to oust Rabi from his own party. https://www.nepalpress.com/2025/11/03/656615/|||There's no any alternative to Congress and UML.

Some accused them of abandoning Nepal, saying things like “They should be banned from entering Nepal” or “Their Nepali citizenship must be immediately revoked.” Others even called them traitors and insulted the Nepali government for allowing it.  But in a surprising twist, it was later revealed that the couple weren’t Nepali at all—they were from Sri Lanka and had never even been to Nepal.  When the truth came out, both the Sri Lankan couple and the Nepali commenters were left shocked.  This incident, sparked merely by assumptions based on their Nepali looking faces, became a reflection of how quickly and blindly many react online without knowing the full story.",

After plugging in the charger, the laptop didn’t respond at all for hours.  Assuming the charger was faulty, I took it to the Mudita service center. Later, they informed me that the **motherboard was damaged (“shot”)** and needed to be replaced, costing **about 60% of the laptop’s original price**. To make things worse, the laptop had just exceeded its 12 month warranty by around one month, so they refused to cover the repair under warranty.  It feels extremely strange and concerning that a motherboard or CPU would get damaged simply while charging normally. If there had been a high-voltage surge, then **all devices connected at the same time should have been affected**, including my colleagues’ laptops and chargers — but none of them faced any issue.  For a device to fail like this right after warranty expiry raises doubts about **product durability and quality assurance**. Very disappointed with this experience.",

After that, you might consider upgrading the RAM. However, some older laptops have limits on how much RAM they support. For example, my old Sony Vaio can handle up to 8GB, while an older Dell model only supports a maximum of 4GB. You can easily check online by searching your laptop model to find out if it supports SSD upgrades and the maximum RAM capacity.  Also note that in Nepal the shop are asking upward of 2-3,000 NPR for each 4gb RAM module, claiming a 6-month warranty.

            "body": "As an Computer Engineering/IT graduate in Nepal, there are various pathways.  Option A) You stay in Nepal  Option B) You move abroad   Let's discuss about Option A first.  There are two realistic pathways you could take if you stayed in Nepal.  - work at private  - work at government   I have tried working at private. But the amount of discrimination being done in private companies really blew me up. As someone who was also preparing for government jobs, I had noticed lots of underprivileged folks participating in government jobs exam(for computer engineer as well). I used to ponder what made them do this since this is not a very lucrative job compared to what a \"certain community\" person makes at private or \"certain community\" person grows at private job. But later realized that private companies are not interested to hire these \"underprivileged\" folks.   Lots of people might argue (although they know it is not true) private jobs hire on merit. No they do not do so in Nepal. It is completely based off connections. It does not matter your knowledge. It is about who you know 100%. I am not ignorant that this might be the case outside, but I swear to god everyday, esto garera USA ma jasto innovative companies cha tyo ta pakkai hudainthyo..   The reason for such favoritism is mainly because the work they do is so shit. Leaving few companies who developer softwares that Nepalese use on daily basis(Not ludo), other jobs are not very interesting to do either. It is the same low quality menial job with meagre pay.   The companies who have a business are handful already. Investor ko money burn garne jasto nepal ma kei hudaina as there are no investors. So you see these bitchy ass companies hiring full stack developer every day for the salary of an intern.     I could not really be bothered with working under someone and taking all nonsense blames for 30,000 per month on hand. With no future and no growth and dismissing my self esteem. My aviman is and was huge.   The second pathway is to work at government corporations. I looked at the salary of computer engineer at Nepal Army, Nijamati and it is decent. But the upwards mobility is just not there. What I mean by that is salary is not growing when you grow your experience. Aba ta government employee specially nijamati lai dekhne bittikai yo bhrastachari raicha bhanne lagcha. Kinaki bhrastachar nagari ta khana basnai napugne. Pradhan Sena Pati ko talab cha 67000. Social security benefits cha good and all but cash in hand ni aileko market rate anusar ta dinu paryo ni. 67000 ma kam garne pradhansenapati le ghus nakhaye k garera palne? lol.  I looked at corporations salary. And it seems that if you manage to get a handle at a corporation(Sansthans), you can make be sure to make average of 60-70 thousands per month even as a 6th level officer. At this point of my career, this seems fair enough. But it will not be enough after 5 years, if my increment is just 1 thousand per year.    A huge reform is required in government services. Government services (specially nijamati) are the core to how people feel about the government. If we cannot make it attractive and lucrative, it does not matter how rich we are saving on their salary.  Next option is moving abroad.  Aba ko market ma abroad ma PR paune/GC paune biswas ta chaina. Unless you do the jobs that Americans do not want to do (or foreigners) like teaching for 60k/year, nursing old people etc.  15 years bidesh ma basna jane. Kam garne and coming back to Nepal. It seems the most plausible way forward. Nepal ma ayepachi k garne bhanne hunasakcha however.  The countries in option to stay for so long are Japan, India. Do not want to surrender my passport to Dubai sheikh. Also middle east is terror and war prone so do not want to end up there.   Europe tira padna gaye matra ho. It seems bleak for immigrants nowadays. And I do not think they earn that much in Europe (for someone planning to return back to Nepal and not stay there). Teta nabasne bhayepachi social security ko teti matlab bhayena.   How about USA? USA seems fine and all. but I do not think getting a work permit after Masters degree is going to be easy. Or that you are going to make big bucks and save big bucks as an immigrant in this economy. Since PR/GC is not guaranteed, you are basically playing a zero sum game. The experience that you get in abroad and education bla bla is huge investment however.",

            "body": "Hi everyone👋 I’m 23, living in Nepal, only a high-school degree, and I’m broke (only have 100 dollars in savings rn). I want to build a real career in IT so I can eventually work remotely or move abroad. I want something realistic that I can learn in about a year and turn into a stable, good-paying job.  Honestly, I’m not interested in freelancing or full-stack because (personally) it feels oversaturated and too creative (for each project) and portfolio-heavy, but I’m still open if I’m wrong. I don’t wanna sound picky, and desperate, like “I only want X, not Y.” Please don't get me wrong. I'm willing to learn and work. I’m flexible - I just want something that's worth my time and effort.  I’m looking for an IT path that:  • isn’t super saturated   • is easier for beginners   • hires freshers from Nepal (South Asia)   • has a stable monthly salary (4 digits)   • has a clear roadmap   • doesn’t require a uni degree   • reliable - won’t be replaced by AI soon   • can help me find jobs abroad  If you were in my shoes - 23, broke, no degree, living in Nepal, trying to break into tech in 2025/2026 - what would you realistically choose?  I’m open to anything: front-end, app dev, full stack, IT support, cloud, DevOps, QA, cybersecurity, networking, data, MySQL - anything that actually works for someone starting with almost nothing. Coz, I don't wanna end up being homeless. Seriously, I am so sick of my current lifestyle, I wanna make a change and take some right action that will lead me to my goal. I literally don't care if it's hard or impossible, coz now it's a necessity.. I am ready to sacrifice my time. I wanna invest in myself (my skills).  So, please, I need your help to choose the right direction.  I’d really appreciate any honest suggestions, roadmaps, or personal stories from people who started in a similar place.  Thanks a lot.",

            "comments": "timle vaneko anusar networking best hola. ccna chai garnu paryo. paxi bistarai ccnp gare vayo|||f I were 23, broke, living in Nepal, and trying to start an IT career without a degree, I would choose one of three realistic paths: QA testing, IT support, or cybersecurity. QA is the easiest and fastest way to get a job because it’s not too saturated, Nepal hires many freshers, and you don’t need a portfolio or degree. IT support is the most stable long-term option because it’s beginner friendly, companies always need support staff, and it naturally leads to higher-paying roles like SysAdmin or Cloud Engineer. Cybersecurity is the most future-proof, global, and high-demand field, but it requires more effort in the first few months.  Things like frontend, full-stack, and freelancing are not the best starting point when you’re broke and need stability fast; they take longer and require portfolios or creativity. A simple one-year plan would look like this: for QA, learn manual testing first, then SQL/API testing, and later basic automation. For IT support, learn computer basics, networking, and ticketing tools, then move towards cloud platforms. For cybersecurity, start with networking and Linux, then learn security basics and practice SOC labs.  If you want something fast, choose QA. If you want something stable and practical, go for IT support. If you want long-term growth and international opportunities, choose cybersecurity. Any of these three can realistically change your life within a year if you stay focused|||You’re only 23, so you have time on your side. While I understand you want quick results, consider exploring online degree programs. Many are flexible and work-friendly. A degree can make a huge difference when applying for jobs abroad and competing for better positions - it might be worth the investment alongside building your skills. 🙂🙂|||If I were you, I’d start with IT support → networking → cloud. It’s cheap to learn, beginner-friendly, hires freshers in South Asia, and leads to real stable jobs. Once you get basic support skills, aim for CCNA, then AWS. It’s the most realistic path to a solid career without a degree.|||look for QA, devrel, dev advocate, project manager, sre/devops etc. what's the tech skill that u already know? |||Garo nai cha aile ko situation ma ta.

            "body": "Hello everyone,  I never thought I’d be writing this again. I wish our situation had gotten better since my last post… but reality has been harsher than I ever imagined.  My father is battling Stage 3 Gall Bladder Cancer, and his treatment at RGCI, Delhi is ongoing. We somehow managed to complete 5 chemo cycles , by selling whatever little we had, taking loans, borrowing from friends and relatives, and emptying every bit of savings. But now, we are completely drained .. emotionally, mentally, and financially.  The doctors say the next few chemo cycles are critical . If we stop now, everything we’ve fought for so far might go in vain. But the treatment cost has now gone beyond ₹20 lakhs, and we have nothing left to continue.  My father is a simple, hardworking man a small farmer and shopkeeper from a middle-class family. He spent his entire life making sure we never felt our struggles,have some good education. Only now do I truly see how much he silently sacrificed for us. I’m still in college, trying to study, trying to stay strong, but watching him in pain and feeling helpless is tearing me apart. i feel cancer is the worst thing you can ever deal with .  I’ve seen my mother cry silently in the corner every night, and my sisters trying to smile despite knowing how close we are to losing everything. I keep telling them we’ll make it that I’ll find a way but right now, I don’t know how much longer we can hold on without help.  In my last post, so many kind souls came forward. I’m truly, deeply grateful — we managed to raise about ₹1.5 lakh, which helped us cover chemotherapy and hospital bills. Every rupee meant the world to us. 🙏  But the journey is far from over. We still need around ₹20 lakhs more to continue his treatment and give him a real chance at life.  If you’re reading this please, help us if you can. Even a small amount, even a share, even a prayer it all counts.   I’m not asking for sympathy; I’m asking for humanity.

Bahrut stup - 2300 years old.   Buddha's story is  sculpted in this Stup. Mahamaya (Buddha's mother) is seen protected by Elephant. Another art shows her dreaming an elephant. There is also a story where buddha tamed Mad Elephant. So elephant holds importance in buddhism. You can google it.   As the time fly, scholars began their own narration and interpretation.  Mahavairocana tantra -7th/8th century. One of the foundational texts of esoteric buddhism. Here Ganesha appears as Vinayaka, often portrayed as an obstacle creating diety sub dued by the buddha's mantra. Yet once pacified. He becomes a protector.  Kanguyar - the tibetan buddhism canon, preserves several tantric texts where Ganapati is invoked. Toh 666, Toh 665 heart of mantra appears here.  Sadhanmala -a vast collection of tantric sadhanas compiled between 10th to 11th centuries include detailed rituals of Maha rakta Ganapati and other ganesha forms. These practice invoke Ganesha as a wealth bestowing and obstacle clearing diety.  In buddhism, the ganapati hridaya sutra also known as the arya maha ganapati hridaya dharani, is a sacred mantra given by shakyamuni buddha to his desciple Ananda.  Mostly Ganesha is seen in Tibetan and Vajryan with more than 4 hands.  All the buddhist countries as Japan, Thailand , indonesia (former), China see elephant head diety as buddhist god.  Ganesha images in China occur between 6th to 7th century.  Lets see where Ganesha appears in Brahmin religion (hindu).  Rigveda - 1464AD is the oldest surviving manuscripts (30 pages or folios of birch bark) submitted by Indian Governmet to UNESCO.  Ganesha does not appear in it.  And in later rigveda version also, Ganesha vagueley appears. In short, hindu Ganesha does not exist.  They may claim Veda is million years old, but we must stick with history not theories.  Ganesha Purana - 13 to 17 th century. It explains the story of Ganesha.  However , it seems the ganesha cult started form 9th/11th century.|||“Kaaaaa yesto Kura gareko hera,   Yo tah hamro Saan ani dharma ho ni ,  Hami ajhai every tourist destination ma religious sites banau parcha ,  Nepal and its natural beauty jawos Kholai khola .tyo ek dui Jana tourist naayera k huncha Hami Lai.”|||Desh tikekai India ra Indian tourists le ho ta saathi.

Most of the tourists that these places receive are mostly internal tourist, which is Nepalese, and majority of Indians, and buddhist. These places aren't attracting any secular tourists as such, plus just because they suddenly declared Nepal is a secular country, doesn't erase it's civilizational history, any western tourist when he thinks of Nepal, the things that comes in his mind are mountains, buddha, temples, monastries and stuffs, that's what they expect.  So, when there is already enough reason, Temples are automatically going to be built.  Plus, we have more and enough evidences that after building temples or statues in such places, the tourism has actually gone up.  So, it makes no sense why you are mad here.  Regarding the shoes, except the main area of Temple, it's wrong to just dictate to open shoes, that's something we all can raise voice.  Regarding Bhajan, that's definitely wrong, no one can just blast any Bhajan in such open place whenever they like it. And, this issue is also solvable.  It's sad that just because of these two issue of shoes and Bhajan, you went on to attack the existence of Mandir and statues themselves without actually understanding the overall context.|||I was there this summer, they never said to take off my shoes and there wasn't any bhajan and stuff.|||What’s the meaning behind this is Pokhara not Janakpur?|||keta keti haru jun thau pani romanticize garne lul.

This is an insane lifestyle, nothing less than Dahal family. If a local ward chairperson can amass such wealth, those at the level of IGP and mantri have looted us taxpayers a hundred times higher.   This guy is apparently the son of nepal’s most corrupt chief justice Gopal Parajuli, btw he had to resign because of fake citizenship. Openly flexing luxury cars and watches on social media. Arent we tired of them by now?  The poor doesnt have access to proper ambulances, meanwhile ankit khand the son of nepali citizenship seller balkrishna khand takes helicopters, everywhere he goes! Manju Khand ko chorra.  Shaniddhya Shaudharya Khanal, son of Ex IGP of APF, Shailendra Khanal. What is the salary of these officers to be able to afford these lifestyles?  Garima Paudel daughter of ex minister devendra paudel proudly faunting her international lifestyle. International tours, comfortable international lifestyle, business class travels while the poor are forced to use tuins for daily commute. Are we not tired of this? This is why we are exposing corruption in nepal  Sangita Pahadi has recently been sued by CIAA for 3 arba scam. Their children have been living a lavish lifestyle since ages. No shame. 30 hajar ko talab, 30 ota gharbari. Finish them all.  We found another generational corruption run. Khushi Pandey is the granddaughter of Ramesh Nath Pandey, he was the FORMER MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, INDUSTRY, TOURISM, ENVIRONMENT and COMMUNICATIONS. She is also the daughter of Nischal Nath Pandey, who served as a government employee during ramesh nath pandey’s long ministerial run. Look at this damn lifestyle. How is it possible to afford all of this when the family has nothing except civil service for the past 50 years?  Supriya Bohora, granddaughter of Deepak Bohora, former member of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and the House of Representatives, has recently come under the spotlight. Deepak Bohora was known for his strong hand in the Panchayat system and his unwavering support for the monarchy. His political journey is remembered not only for his allegiance to authoritarian structures but also for allegations of corruption. One of the most prominent accusations linked to Deepak Bohora is the illegal consumption of land where the Fun Park ice rink in Bhadrakali Road now stands. What was once a symbol of political maneuvering and alleged misappropriation of public assets is now being flaunted by his granddaughter as a mark of achievement, raising questions about how the spoils of corruption are normalized across generations.  Anusandhan khai ta comrade? Granddaughter living in europe to protect all the money stored in swiss bank. EXPOSE THEM ALL!  Most corrupted ones are the generals from police special dsp and upwards.👮 I have seen them using massive funds to get their sons n daughters abroad or in prestigious schools by paying hefty fees. their home looks like that of a king , literally narayanhiti jastai same and their sons n daughters are living the life of luxuries carrying iphones and designer dresses and bags . Actually what these officer do is they heavily launder money and budgets which comes to their department . They practice “milijuli khane” . They also take funds from criminals to manage cases. Then they use these funds to bribe politicians for getting higher post like dsp to dig , from DIG to IG and so on . They conduct massive weddings and ceremonies spending crore of rupees. this is same with army generals as well.  `-`  **TLDR - REGISTER AND CONVINCE YOUR FRIENDS, COUSINS IF THEY STILL HAVE NOT MADE VOTER ID**  Read an interesting blog on this. Hamro lato politician le k bujhla esto. Chorra chorri lai instagram delete garna chai layo dhanna teti chai buddhi raicha.  >The corrupt ruling elites of the Third World, who used to steal everything, destroy economies, and create hell for their own populations, have now added one more thing: they openly allow their children to flaunt the spoils of corruption on Instagram, right in front of their starving people. Something previous generations never witnessed.  >The new rich have never gone through a revolution so they don't understand not to flaunt their wealth like the old bourgeoisie who have witnessed multiple revolutions throughout history. It's ironic that the Maoists instigated a revolution yet the children of said Maoists are now living the luxurious lives posting everything not knowing whats simmering in society. It looks like at least the kids have understood not to flaunt their stolen wealth to avoid angering the masses.  >In any ways what happened in Nepal highlights a trend I’ve discussed on here before, which is how Instagram utterly radicalizes youth heavy developing societies.  >Suddenly you as a poor but striving young man or woman have full visibility to how the elite/upper class of your country + diaspora live, but you have little access or hope of ever living the same for the most part. The impact of this on mental health, societal stability, and also fertility rates cannot be underestimated.  >Imagine going from a society with five state channels and a few cable options in the 2000s to Instagram in just five years. That’s what happened to all of South Asia + Africa + a lot of Latin America.  These guys were being exposed to the lifestyles of the baddie daughters and Chad sons of the fucktards ruling their country,  >You see their trip to Japan and London for the summer. See their parties at their elite mansions in the most posh suburbs and neighborhoods and you realize you’re just fucked and not getting there ever, your country simply does not have the mechanism to enable that for you, you’re unemployed even despite a college degree.  >**Upward mobility is like a pressure valve. Nepal never had that. The elites taxed people, slapped tariffs on imports & ignored building institutions that foster upward mobility. Instead, they assumed that sending their populace to the Middle East would be sufficient.**  >What’s surprising is how the corrupt politicians allow their kids to flaunt stolen wealth so brazenly. Kids of politicians in developing countries flaunting their extravagant lifestyles on public Instagram accounts is so foolhardy. Exposure to social media and bragging about your luxurious lifestyle risks fuelling resentment and envy.  >It's how uprisings have always been. Old bourgeoisie don't show off their wealth like those Nepali elites did. This behavior is what got both the iranian and russian noble families killed. This also happened in Mongolia earlier this year, although less dramatically. The Prime Minister had to step down due to protests that kicked off because his son was showing off his luxury holidays and clothes too much on Instagram.",

Trendy: they're brainwashed, selfish, came for masubhat  Reality: UML has strong foundation and institutions in every sectors, from education to workers, farmers, employees, businesses.   These organizations/institutions although have bad reputations, have done some apprecianle deeds too. From volunteering, blood donations, scholarship schemes etc. For eg. UML's student union was the first one to reach to Kalapani and put Nepal's flag on the land.   What we're doing is just bashing them on the internet with mostly baseless accusations. (Mostly, not all). That's not how you defeat an established and strong organization.

I wanted to take a moment to share something from the heart, especially for the Gen Z community here. I’m not here to lecture, judge, or pretend that I “know better.” In fact, it’s the opposite—I’m here because I genuinely admire a lot about Gen Z, and I’d love to learn from you if you’re open to talking or sharing your perspectives.  What I really respect about your generation is the honesty. The courage to say things out loud that older generations kept buried. The way you call out what doesn’t feel right, whether it’s in society, culture, work, or even in yourselves. The world is changing fast, and you all seem to face it with a unique blend of humor, vulnerability, and resilience. And honestly, that’s inspiring.  I’m not perfect, and I don’t pretend to fully understand everything about today’s trends, language, mindset, or struggles. But I’m here with an open mind. If any Gen Z member is willing to talk—to enlighten me, challenge me, laugh with me, or even correct me—I’d sincerely appreciate it.  I’m reaching out with respect and humility.

I’m truly grateful. Recently during an interview, I shared my personal political standpoint. I mentioned that I do not personally recognize K.P. Oli as a leader whose ideology I align with. I say this not out of disrespect, but from a place of accountability and responsibility toward our nation. After the recent Gen Z protests, I believe many of us expected honest conversations, acknowledgment of public concerns, and accountability for the injustices that occurred under his administration where many lives were lost. When leadership is unable to take responsibility for such serious matters, it becomes difficult for me to support or follow their ideology. My intention is not to attack individuals, but to stand for truth, transparency, and a future where leaders are answerable to the people. I believe Nepal deserves leadership that listens, learns, and upholds justice for every citizen. Thank you once again to everyone who resonated with my thoughts. Let’s continue pushing for a better and more responsible political culture together.|||So many Incel chicks in comment, are we even safe?|||Nepal is literally full of chutiyas like these, logic fact kei chaina 😂 .

            "body": "I swear, the more I watch Miraj Dhungana’s actions after the Gen-Z protests, the more pissed off I get. This guy went from saying “I’m not the leader, this is a collective movement” to suddenly announcing a whole political party under the Garikhana Deu banner like it’s some kind of personal promotion. Do you even realize how ridiculous that looks? We were told this movement was leaderless, built on the frustration of an entire generation, and now the SAME person who said he wasn’t leading anything is stepping into politics like he’s been preparing the whole time. It feels like the movement’s energy was used as a ladder.  And don’t even get me started on the way he handled the October 9 protest confusion. When young people were panicking, waiting for clarity, ready to go to the streets again because the country is literally suffocating under corruption, what does he do? He steps back. He shrugs it off and says Gen-Z wasn’t involved. Bro, if you’re going to speak for the movement when it’s convenient, then show up when shit gets chaotic too. That’s literally what leadership is. Instead, he pops up when the cameras are rolling and disappears the moment things get risky. That kind of pick-and-choose activism makes me angry because that’s exactly the political behavior we protested against.  Then there’s the whole “our office was attacked” episode. He went public with it, made it sound serious, and then the police said there was no official complaint, and everything was calm when they arrived. What are we supposed to believe? Either be transparent or don’t dramatize it. People actually suffered during these protests. People bled. People DIED. And watching someone drag the movement into half-explained drama with zero clarity is honestly insulting.  What makes me the most furious is how he keeps talking like he represents the entire generation, giving big speeches about unity, direct elections, overseas voting, and political reform, while his actions keep zig-zagging all over the place. You don’t get to call yourself the voice of Gen-Z while making moves that look inconsistent, self-centered, and convenient. The Gen-Z protests weren’t a TikTok trend. They weren’t a branding opportunity. They were a desperate cry from a generation that’s tired of being silenced and robbed of a future.  Watching someone turn that into a messy political ambition is heartbreaking and infuriating. We didn’t risk our safety so one guy could walk around looking like a “youth politician.” We marched for real change. For accountability. For a country that doesn’t chew its future generation alive. And right now, Miraj feels like he’s drifting so far from the soul of that movement that it’s honestly painful.  If he actually wants to stand for Gen-Z, then he needs to stop playing this half-activist, half-politician game and show some damn consistency, clarity, and courage because right now, all I’m seeing is another person using the movement’s energy to put himself in the spotlight.  Anyone else feel like this? Because I’m seriously done pretending this is okay.    And here are the straight-up questions people genuinely have for him:  Who is funding your movement, your events, and now this new political party?  Why did you claim there was “no leader” during the protests but suddenly step into a political role afterward?  When exactly did you decide to form a party during the protests or after?  If you didn’t intend to be a leader, why are you acting like one now?  Why do you vanish or disengage whenever things get tense, unclear, or dangerous?  Why was the October 9 situation handled so confusingly by you?  Why talk about an attack on your office but file no clear, formal police complaint?  Who keeps you accountable? Who checks your decisions?  What gives you the right to speak on behalf of an entire generation?  Are you building a movement or building a personal political brand?",

He's been doing 'media' stuff like making videos and shit from a while ago but he hasn't been 'in the streets' as a kid and it shows. Call me backwards or whatever but if you never got into fights as a kid, or even as a teenager, you don't have that 'bite'. That's him. That softness combined with good looks and branding made him the perfect mascot for non-violent 'gen-z'. He's great as a model but as a ruthless and calculating leader that can lead hundreds of people to bring a certain outcome? Nope.. he's a weak kid inside. Aba ko political events le uslai daro banauna chai sakcha hai in that regard.  He got scared after the sep 8/9 incidents, fearing that his good life could get stripped away from him. He's someone with a lot to lose. His family and relatives probably held him back. Tespachi he probably came back to the front ali pachi with some kind of a plan. Aile chai I just think he's trying to do what he thinks and knows is right - play by the political system's rules. And since we all have severe trauma related to anything 'political party' related, we hate to see it.  Sudan is the opposite of miraj - he's been in the field, has scolded corrupt officials to their face since 2015, has had literal dirt and blood on him. But he's not an eloquent speaker like miraj, he's got 'a look' but the kind of person he has become, branding himself online is not sth he cares about. Whatever he is, is his brand.

What it demonstrates is the blood we have - thirsty for oneself, power, money, opportunity. I am particularly upset with Sudan Gurung who is hell bent at removing Home Minister and this guy called Miraj Dhungana. I will dismiss Miraj right off the bat because I don't see anything in his eyes and his face. He is a selfish person and anyone who is following him and all should think many times. Sudan Gurung - the guy is hell bent on removing home minister on such a stupid demand that he wants to arrest Oli and Lekhak. What the hell guys ? are you looking for rawanraj? we have laws and we want to enforce it fairly and strictly. Om Prakash is a lawyer and he is not trying to protect Oli or Lekhak - anyone thinks that is such a stupid Zenzee. Do you guys want to arrest someone just on a whim? without gathering sufficient proof? In western countries law enforcement officials spend years if not decades monitoring and gathering evidences against someone they think is culprit - they just don't  arrest someone and investigate - that wouldn't be rule of law. Om Prakash has that schooling. I don't care who Om Prakash is and all but he is definitely a capable guy and has proved it time and again - after all, he is chosen by PM.  Now, are you guys looking to change ministers and government leadership when we only have 4 months to go ? Its such a shame when every so called Zenzee goes to Singhadarbar and disturbs our government's actions. Just think if all the time they spend is meeting you guys.     Now listen to what Mahabir Pun said - please go to your constituencies and help new  political parties that align to your views win - why are you spending so much energies trying to meet the PM ? The Miraj Dhungana is such a scam guy - He is driven by his own ambition, I feel. I did like Sudan but he is also active childish and not a thing in near future.  Whatever everyone says and does listen and watch what Rachha Bam says and does. She is the one who walked out with Army Chief when he seemed to infer democracy was in danger. She is acting with passion and patience. I would recommend everyone to support behind Raswapa, Sagar Dhakal, Baburam, Kulman,  Sumana Shrestha. Sumana is the real deal.     Now if you believe in democracy and free and fair election, support Rabi. How can a person so beloved by people can be in jail without having an opportunity to go to people? is democracy is for the people and by the people?     I recommend please read. Watch what Swarmin Wagle said few days that Deuba was Zenzee, Oli was Zenzee and every popular leader was zenzee when they started politics. There has been tremendous progress but it was not enough. Just because you feel young and under 25 doesn't mean its your government and can do anything. Nope - no way until we have rule of law.     Now this government gotta focus on election and it has to happen. When I hear Miraj and Sudan that say it can't happen in current condition are not only naïve but foolish. They gotta go read what democracy is. Nothing happens without people's mandate which is vote.     And don't forget its not you guys who brought this change - it was a coincidence.  Someone else did on 24th so you really shouldn't overwhelmingly take any credit, especially Miraj who didn't even take part in the protest ! Hope it helps.|||Ani aaja bholi singa durbar bhitra baseka haru protocol follow garera aako hun ta ??|||miraj and party >>>>> yemale and other similar parties|||Yea the protest was headless/leaderless but we need people to lead you can't complain he gained from this protest of course he did and we want a capable leader to run office not military the argument that he was not in the protest is stupid this is exactly why we failed as national because we put fighters as leaders they can be leaders while fighting but in office we need people who lead office not mobs and arms   Not taking his side but this was a common argument against him and I disagree so this ... Btw I don't know why they want directly elected pm within 6 months like bring 2/3 majority and do what you want their ego will delay the election effectively pushing the country years backwards focus on NOTA and NRN voting rights and different policy and development plan for future|||All this shit is happening coz there was no leader during gen z protests. They did not achieve anything despite such massive movement except toppling Government.   Miraj Dhungana came into realization. An organised group is must to move forward. The most important thing a leader should have is a clean image and clear vision. The maturity he has shown not being political figure is admirable.   One of the good thing coming out of Gen Z movement is the youth having interest on politics and stepping forward to be incharge.  We should not discourage them, in the same time help them by giving healthy and constructive criticisms.|||आज उनीहरूले गरेको माग केपी र लेखक लाई सजाए को दायरा मा ल्याउनुपर्छ भन्ने विषयमा थियो। सायद त्यो माग राख्नु गलत भयो होला है।|||Yo sub pani flip bhaira hunxa harek bela.

Muslims of Nepal posted about their happiness when Taliban came back to power, they side with muslims be it anywhere in the world, buddhist burmese vs rohingya muslims they will take sides with muslims, indian hindus va muslims, they will pick muslims, syrian Christians vw muslimw they will pick muslims and so on… When Palestinians atatcked israel , Many musims living in Nepal celebrated it but then they never condemned the murders of 11 innocent Nepali citizens by Hamas.  They will always make reasons like we are Nepali muslims and we are different but their genetics, history is the same as that of Indian muslims as majority of musilmw living in Nepal migrated from Kashmir, UP, Bihar and Bangladesh .  For Muslims, religion comes first before nationality. Many groups within nepal have differences between them but for them the nation comes first, you will see a hindu nepali protesting against India and Buddhist protesting about illegal citizenship to Tibetan refugees. But a muslim will never say anything about illegal migration of Rohingyas .   Also, these people are real fanatics and radicals . ApM ssaid something that’s true, many arab nations don’t provide equal opportunities to women. Saudi just maid it legal for women yo obtain driver’s licenses just a year ago, many of the women can’t travel alone, islam allows mens to have multiple wives but why isn’t the same applied towards women?  Also, PM mentioned that in the past muslims women in muslims nation faced far much difficulties and there was no reason to be triggered about it.  They literally made movies about Sati practices withng some community but no one came put to protest against the release, had it been something about muslims they will flood the streets .  At the end, its upto nepali to believe that muslims of Nepal are different from rest of south asian muslims. I wonder when most of the madarsas, mosques have bangaldeshi, paksitani imams and scholars how will the teachings be any different?   I thank the Muslims tho, atleast bheda nepali got to see a hint of what’s to come when muslims make up a considerable percentage of the demographics.|||\"Ashamed of nothing, offended by everything \" community for a reason|||She ciritcized Hindus too.

I understand it looks a lot worse to you (and maybe your guardians) coming from 3.97 to 3.10 and your feelings are very valid. I have seen toppers with dead end jobs and barely first class pass having a stellar careers. I'm somewhat middle of the lot myself.  You've got a lot going for you, you got a 4.0 in the subject you love and sounds like you're pretty proactive with it and fairly competent too. All the B's and B+'s  could have been A's with a little discipline and bit of a good luck, and most of all hopefully this has given you a wake up call.

Around a year worth of income of an average Nepalese just for a 2 years of teen's study.

The number of calls those nggas made during 2 whole weeks, fk. We kept on declining and blocking their numbers but everytime it was a new number lmao.

Reasoning: ABCD is a parallelogram (from the figure). Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. That means the diagonal AC and BD intersect each other at point P such that AP = PC and BP = PD. Now, in the parallelogram, Triangles △APD and △BPQ are on the same base PD (or same diagonal portion) and they lie between the same parallel lines AD and BC.

Watch khan academy for general concepts. Use Perplexity AI or something like that for personal guidance. I got away with a 3.8+ GPA with only these resources. Perplexity really helped me understand the topics I was really struggling with. Also take full advantage of your school library. I used different books to get my concepts clear. For example: Use Fundamental Physics by Resnick and Halliday to understand the concepts in Physics, Thomas calculus for calculus, also most of the math is covered in BC Bajracharya's Basic of Mathematics. Even if you study an hour a day using these resources, that would be enough (Considering you pay attention in class).|||How much is the fee|||Too bad youtube ma free ma xa 😢|||Don't take online tuition class myannn|||fee?? |||You can easily access any topics from any elite professors for FREE .

And 12th is alll about organic ,yup almost all.The same teacher will teach u organic chem till the last day of 12th ,yup u heard it right.However, its not the matter to be intimidated .Personally i practiced organic each day,some day i took a break obviously .So, ya u should revise it from the first chapter. My organic chap teacher was amazing ,calm and gave notes and also provided ideas to make it easier to study while i was in KMC . If u dont have those ,study from youtube.  Ya and i got an overall 3.8  and ya forgot to mention, If u dont understand a topic than u have youtube .To be frankly honest,i used to watch a lecture from youtube everytime a topic or concept or terms even if its subtle. Without the teachers from youtube, well i wouldnt have scored even a 3.6. Only a handful number of teachers teaches the best while others simply recite what is shown on the slides.|||Chem is all about consistency daily class na oadhako concept bujni ho ani al din aagadi mop up garera ni sakkincha|||Ma ta cheat chorera pass vako ho yaar :)|||Well 11 is not like 10, you have to study, hunatw ma ni ekdin agadi padera +2 katako ho, but chemistry ko lagi chai you need to revise reaction haru. Hamlai chem padaune sir le sadhai, reaction chai varu theory xodera vayeni lekhairakhnu hunthyo, ani exam agadi theory ghokera gayera pugthyo, cause reaction haru handy hunthyo.|||Sajilo xa, first of all understand the properties of the metal/atoms you are reading about and based on headings, try to write what it may result in, and then see the answer and tally. this way, you will make a deeper bond with the subject you are reading about  for example, SO2 and H2S both act as reducing agent in materials like potassium permanganate or halogens, by either making H2SO4 or SO2, based on that, try to make those reactions on your own and tally it with the actual reaction  pro tip- BALANCING WALA PART CHAI RATI NAI DEU! MAA KASSAM YESAI MA BIGRINE HO!  tried and tested, got like 68 in chemistry first term|||bro same chem ruined my streak too. what helped me was making reaction charts by topic and revising them daily for 10 mins. patterns started clicking after a while, especially when i wrote them not just read.|||same mann also i got hit by karma didnt study shi and now im gonna choke in re exams cuz i dont understand anything|||I think and I felt as well that chemistry is kinda easy if you know how the chemical reactions work rather than just memorizing it. Focus on breaking compound molecules and try to react with another compound like naturally. You will be able to do every reactions|||school level shit is still easy. You just gotta study consistently|||Go to a shop and buy a lot of sticky notes. Write a reaction on one side and and information on other aide. Carry it wherever you go and memorize the hell out of it even when you are shititng on the toilet . There are no other reasons. (There is one impossible technique, its called memory palace or method of loci which i used to pass my masters)|||Lekhera padhne bani basala ahile dekhi nai 12 ma Kam lagxa Inorganic ko reactions haru sab rough copy ma lekhera padhne gara + organic haru ni lekherai gara ani catalyst haru ,name of the compound pani yad garne gara lekherai Tespaxi hera kasari audaina chemistry|||11 grade garo nai huncha bro Mero pani 11 ma kaile 3.4 gpa katena  12 ma Halka mehnat herya 3.87 gpa aayo So,chinta garnu pardaina|||ma ni testai thiye tara chem ko chai you need to start organic first j bhaye ni    din ko jabarjasti bhaye ni 10 oota reaction garirakha ani it gets easier.    scored chem ma A+ cause hamro organic chemistry ko sir le daily bihana ko class ma reaction lekhna dinthyo",
