I will urge every people to fight back those claims because a religion division is the last thing we need now. We have always been a multi religious country respecting every culture and religion no matter what. I don't think any Nepali wants to be associated with what theit government are doing in India. I remember those same people saying this exact same thing about Bangladesh revolution last year by calling it a CIA coup and what not after Sheikh Hasina through support of Modi murdered over 1000+ innocent students. Their Bihar deputy chief minister just a day ago said if Nepal was part of India then this violence wouldn't have happened and blamed Indian Congress for not invading us before. They are not our friend guys. Always remember that. They have their own evil agenda. Anyone who thinks otherwis are extremely naive. We need to be united against any foreign force.

All the Nepo kids propaganda creators and people who fell for it without doing a single research.   You guys are all responsible for this anarchy.   All the businesses are going to take their money out of Nepal. No sane person will ever think about investing in Nepal for the next decade.|||You head thinks 50-60 room hotel will collapse tourism! Very less tourism you have thought off‚Ä¶ ??  We've brought lack of Confidence in corrupted people and bureau cats  You're right. We've lost confidence in the old system‚Äîthe system where a business had to get politicians involved, where corruption was rampant, and where stability was a dream. The destruction of these buildings, which were tied to that corrupt network, is symbolic of that loss. It's a good thing, because it shows that the old way is no longer tolerated. The message is clear: the cozy relationships between corrupt business owners and politicians are over. Those people have lost their confidence.  But in losing that, we have the potential to gain a new kind of confidence. A confidence that comes from a genuine, fair, and stable environment. The NRB had to withdraw billions from the market and banks couldn't invest because there was no stability. The money wasn't flowing because the government was a mess.  The core issue was a lack of a proper structure. We couldn't even function with a single-window system to attract and manage investments. That's why so many potential investments were returned.  **We boosted the confident .**  If we can build a proper, stable government, we can create a climate where genuine investors, not just corrupt cronies, feel confident. They'll be able to invest without political interference. When that happens, you'll see a real boom in tourism and other sectors. You're not dreaming; you're seeing the opportunity that comes from breaking down the old, corrupt system. That's the real and fair practice we need.  # K kera jasto kura bro Hilton ( international ) doesn't own any asset franchisee based system, the people that owned Hilton Nepal had concentrated your wealth so it doesn't matter to them and it doesn't give a shit about tourism.  All boom in International Hotel chain itself is a controversial topic because the talk with the government to finance such projects at a less intrest rate, that's exactly why politician and businessman was involved in booming the Hotel industry and if you remember every single big Hotel wanted politician to be a part of it a , stable politician that's why lemon tree also has a politician involved that should also have been brought down.  This isn't a simple 80:20 ratio. You have to understand that Hyatt has been in corruption for a longer period of time, which is why people and politicians stay there. Now, Hilton has always been in debt. But whatever, it doesn't matter. What you need to understand is that thinking two hotels out of 500 would represent tourism is a flawed perspective. Tourists are not affected, tourists are not killed. People help them. Yes, there's damage because of the entity involved. And it's a good thing if such an influence is trying to get a foreign thing.  Hilton's strategy is not what you think. It's¬†**royalty-based**. You need to understand this. Hilton isn't involved in full investments. It's not a foreign company. It's a corrupt Nepali guy who got the Hilton name and pays a royalty to Hilton. Hilton doesn't own any single entity in that hotel. So please understand, it doesn't matter for an investment. You think this is foreign money invested here? That's rubbish. You're not doing a study, you're just talking. It's easy to talk when you don't understand anything. You're saying \"Hilton, Hyatt\" but you don't know the facts. Hilton just gives them the brand and the system to run. It doesn't own the asset. Go and look it up on the internet.  **Recovery is important**  For people like you, it's easy to say \"you shouldn't have done this, you shouldn't have done that,\" but if you're not able to fight, I don't think you should ever say that. You're showing a lack of confidence, bro.¬†**If we get the structure right, foreign investments will be greater than ever. Can you recall the moment when FDI was going lesser and lesser? Do you know why Sheraton hasn't come to Nepal?**¬†The real issue was the previous government, not a lack of foreign investments. Now, if everthing goes well saying there's more confidence, that the government is more stable. You should focus on that. Previously, we never had this chance. Now the government is reformed. If we show them that we have a structure and corruption is almost cleared, then you'll see the foreign investment you're talking about. Your thinking is very, very immature like General Public...  Chuitya talks bro chutiya talk...  You're dreaming if you think a single policy change like Trump‚Äôs tariffs will magically bring billions of dollars in investment. A business is not a simple game. A wise businessman would never invest millions of rupees to build a factory when the tariff policy is not certain. Do you even know what the¬†**breakeven point**¬†is? It's the point where total revenue equals total costs. A manufacturing plant requires a long-term plan, and even with the tariffs, you might not reach the breakeven point in 10 years.  You're talking like a child. This isn't about Trump being president and suddenly factories pop up in Nepal. Yes, maybe we can have trading companies, import goods from China, and supply them to India, but India isn‚Äôt that simple either. They will tear your containers at the port. This is a common person's thinking, not a wise businessman's.  A proper investment climate is where the government is stable and there is¬†**easy access to establish a business**. That's what's more important than any temporary tariff. The fact that many past investments were returned because we couldn't function in a single-window pattern proves this. We need to fix our own house first before we expect foreign investors to come in.",

I left after that, have not joined it today. I see representatives of GenZ already doing interviews elsewhere so what is the point here.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**¬†The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**¬†If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**¬†If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**¬†If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

Focus on the bigger fight, not the gossip. Don‚Äôt believe everything you hear, and only believe half of what you see.

Without delay, instruct the President to dissolve Parliament. 2. Present your demands informally to Sushila Karki. Finalize the draft agreed upon between Sushila Karki and you. 3. Once you finalize that draft, submit it to the President in the presence of the concerned minister. 4. The President will make the necessary constitutional amendments (directly elected Prime Minister, appointing experts in relevant fields as ministers, fully proportional Parliament, etc. according to your demands). 5. Form an interim government under the leadership of Sushila Karki. Even 9 ministers would be enough ‚Äì 3-3-3 from XYZ generations, selected jointly by you and Sushila Karki. Whoever becomes minister must commit not to contest elections. 6. Sushila Karki‚Äôs government will announce elections. An ordinance will be issued barring almost all top leaders of old parties from contesting. Congress, UML, Maoists will be entirely new and more aware ‚Äî maybe acting as a strong opposition. 7. Meet with the army and ask for their support in providing security and management during the elections. 8. Call upon Nepalis living abroad to vote. This is possible and can be done. 9. The Prime Minister you want will come before your eyes in Baisakh 2083 (April‚ÄìMay 2026), in just 6‚Äì7 months. 10. For the next 30 years, Gen YZ will work tirelessly, and they will hand over a model nation to Gen Alpha and their children ‚Äî one of the best in the world.",

            "body": "Dear Nepal  You just got rid of all the politicians. Congratulations‚Äîa feat that is very difficult to achieve, and you successfully toppled a very old government that needs reformation. But this is the problem: government consists of executive, legislative, and judicial branches, and they work together to make your country run. Now you have gotten rid of the people sitting in the seats that represent the government but even if you've burned down the building, the seats are still there. Whatever people you now elect to go and sit in those seats, your outcome will be the same. In a couple of years, those new people will succumb to the pressures and incentive structures of those seats, and your country will be again in the same place where it has been for many years‚Äîin the s\\*\\*thole. If you truly want to change the game, you need to change the incentives. Doing nothing won't change the seat; killing or replacing people on the seat also doesn't work‚Äîit's still the same seat. You need to change the pressures that the people who sit in the seat feel.  Greetings from Switzerland  Switzerland has an exceptionally effective system balancing the interests of the government, wealthy individuals, and the general public. This takes too long to explain here in detail but here is why it's the best system:  First, your local government collects most of the taxes and provides most services; the federal system collects fewer taxes and handles national responsibilities, including defence, foreign affairs, and major economic policies.¬†  Second, we have initiatives and referendums at the local, regional, and federal levels. How you want to determine what people should vote on‚Äîthat's up to you. In Switzerland we collect signatures from the general public but it's sketchy and it's a problem Switzerland hasn't really figured out yet, but you have a young, revolutionary mindset, and you can use these new open-source, token-based digital tools to put pressure on the seats in government. It's a balance on how often you want to let people vote on issues: there is too little, like in Britain, and there is certainly voting too much, but you will figure it out.  What I'm trying to say is, don't just replace the people with new people. The government is like an internal combustion engine, and you're just replacing the fuel‚Äîthe engine still runs the same way. Try to change the machine itself instead, take inspiration from nations that do have functioning government engines, and try to innovate on those.  All the best!",

One party democracy like that of China. 2.  Two party democracy like that of USA. 3.  Multiparty democracy like that of India and Nepal. 4.  Dominant-party democracy like that of Singapore.    Nepal constitutionally practice multiparty democracy.  In multiparty democracy, we all can form a party as our fundamental rights.  Yes! Even KMAG can form a party.  (Cool ya, kholyo bhane join gara hai.)  And in multiparty democracy, you can‚Äôt ban or restrict any party from competing for power, which means you cannot constitutionally limit or restrict UML, Congress, Maoist or any party to compete for power.    Very principle is, a party in itself cannot be bad.  Its leaders can be but not the party.  And more importantly, in democracy actual perception of any party isn‚Äôt determined by group of people but election result.    Thus, you, me, Balen or anyone has no rights to say who get to compete for power and who don‚Äôt.  We can only influence but cannot and should not obstruct anyone, Not even Pappu Construction.  Basic concept of multiparty democracy is - everyone competes for power and people decide who get to rule per votes.  Interestin fact:  King Mahendra then didn‚Äôt like multiparty democracy and he introduced ‚Äúparty-less democracy.‚Äù  Not going to history but a ChatGPT assignment for you to expand the topic.    So, here we are back to square one.  We can‚Äôt function by restricting or limiting other political parties constitutionally.  Only way to get them out of power is by letting them compete yet never win.    If you are all for multiparty democracy, let me dissapoint you - UML/Congress/Maoist will be back in scene as rightfully so.  You can hate them but you can‚Äôt ignore them.  So better learn to accept their existence even if you hate them.  That‚Äôs what being a constitutionalist means and what will differentiate you from anarchist.    Hope you got the fundamental.    Now don‚Äôt even think of becoming Mahendra unless you are the joker from Batman.  In that case, hello there, Harvey here.  From KMAG",

We need people elected leader not mob selected leader and think of it when any of these guys go to foreign countries for visit will anyone take them seriously they won't because mob selected leaders are ignored just like Md.Yunus is ignored by major world leaders(except China).  Considering we're in a democratic system with democratic framework, I suggest Chief Justice of Supreme Court of Nepal should be given the interim power because Legislature-Executive-Judiciary are the head of country, since President is said to be planning to resign and PM has resigned best would be to get Judicial head. You might say he's corrupt but hear me out, his only job should be to conduct fair elections and fulfill the demands of us(youth) as he's the only guy who knows about constitution more than any of us. I see only him as the one with intellect right now  According to me, Sushila Karki being former Chief Justice should held interim gov, and add the presidential style election, and the elections should be within 15days-1month. for which we gen-z's should help if we can destroy we should show we can also be a help|||Tiyo post ma garw chi chi chi chi Thu Thu Thu Thu chi chi chi chi Thu Thu Thu Thu gardi bascha üòÇüòÇ|||https://preview.redd.it/dlrjv8jm1gof1.jpeg?width=442&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97c0337eb5a438e5909e840f83db267f87a0b99a  found this making rounds in fb|||Mai hu malie sab aoucha vanne wana ego wala manchey ho  Ani yo kirati haru afno jaat vayera dherai furkirako ho  Muji haru lai tha chai kei chqina pachi k huncha vanera Dhunga bokera matra desh bandaina gu haru dimak ka cha ta haru ko|||Her keta ho.

He is asking people that he can bring the change so what the bid deal in that. So people need a leader who is just become a puppet of other, no transparency.

My suggestion is do not judge based  on sentiments.|||His position is great till the mayor, no need to drag him any further.|||This needs to spread forward, he is a narcissist, somebody who has no sense of how to speak , god complex.  publicity stunt doesnot makes person a great leader.|||We‚Äôre falling into the same trap again.

That drive inevitably brings with it shades of narcissism and opportunism. So rather than fixating on intentions, it makes more sense to judge politicians by their results.

His rough almost mobster-like style may be off-putting to some but in a city like Dharan which is home to hotheaded Kirati / Hill Janajati majority that kind of toughness isn‚Äôt just useful, it‚Äôs necessary.  That said, he is neither qualified nor capable enough to be considered an ‚Äòideal‚Äô Prime Minister. Nonetheless, when compared to Rabi Lamichhane Harka represents a comparatively more credible alternative.

            "body": "1. Sushila Karki  Position: Former Chief Justice of Nepal  Eligibility: Karki is considered a frontrunner for the role of interim Prime Minister. She has been selected by the Gen Z movement due to her neutrality, legal acumen, and credibility. Notably, she is the first woman to have served as Chief Justice in Nepal and has a history of standing against corruption. Her appointment is seen as a unifying choice amid the current political crisis.    2. Balendra Shah (Balen)  Position: Mayor of Kathmandu  Eligibility: While Balen has garnered significant support among the youth for his anti-corruption stance and urban reforms, there are legal constraints. If he accepts the role of interim Prime Minister, he would be ineligible to run for the position in the subsequent general elections, as per constitutional provisions. This limitation has led to discussions about his potential role in the interim government.    3. Harka Sampang  Position: Mayor of Dharan  Eligibility: Sampang has shown interest in leading the interim government and has engaged in preliminary discussions with the Nepal Army. However, his tenure as mayor has been marred by controversies, including allegations of mismanagement and misconduct. These issues have raised concerns about his suitability for a national leadership role.    4. Sagar Dhakal  Position: Youth Leader and Former Election Candidate  Eligibility: Dhakal has offered his leadership during the current political upheaval. However, he lacks a formal political position or mandate, which could hinder his eligibility for the role of interim Prime Minister. His involvement in the political process appears to be more aspirational at this stage.    Conclusion  Among the individuals mentioned, Sushila Karki stands out as the most eligible candidate for the role of interim Prime Minister, given her legal background, neutrality, and the support from the Gen Z movement. While Balendra Shah has significant popular support, constitutional constraints may limit his eligibility for the permanent role. Harka Sampang and Sagar Dhakal have expressed interest, but their eligibility is currently uncertain due to legal, political, or reputational factors.",

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen.

Try to restore all public infrastructures as much as possible and, scavenge for and safeguard any documents or information banks that have not yet been safeguarded  2. Of the 3 evils, one has fled, one has been ambushed but one is still free(Prachanda) and even thriving. This shouldn't be happening. He must either be imprisoned or killed. For this we will need to come together again.  3. Those that had fled in yesterday's prison escape(especially Rabi) along with those who helped them escape must be captured, investigated and imprisoned   4. Justice - those involved in the death of the students & those who infiltrated yesterday's protest to carry their selfish motives must be identified, arrested, imprisoned and investigated.  5. Leader - we need a leader even if it's a temporary one so that the country doesn't fall as well as to ensure that the evil doesn't return and to negotiate with the international bodies/countries in order to retrieve the assets hidden by those politicians and to ask for those who fled to be returned to the country for trial. And also to direct and manage the restoration of our country   From what limited I know, the top competitors for the leadership position are 1.Balen Shah(can be a bit extreme sometimes) 2. Harka Sampang(is known to be slightly dictorial) 3.Kulman Ghising(overall good but maybe a bit mild in temper) 4. Sumana Shrestha (Don't really know much)   But please understand that leadership is not limited to these four, any patriotic person who is determined to save and develop this nation, has the vision, is willing to learn, provides absolute transparency, engages in active communication and absolutely won't engage in nepotism/corruption as well as takes strict measures against any that do is more than qualified to lead. It may be any of us who dream of a better country and is willing to make the effort.  If there are any suggestions or opinions, please comment!! This is our nation, although it's in ashes now, we have to rise up again and rebuild this nation into one we can be proud of, feel safe in and live properly .  Edit, didn't know how to change the title but everything else, I tried. I'm not trying to confuse the mass, these are just my opinions that I think are very important.",

Recently, Nepal witnessed an unprecedented political shake-up where even the Prime Minister and several corrupt politicians were forced out of power. This has left the nation in a state of uncertainty, with the pressing question: who will be the new Prime Minister, and what comes next for our governance system?  In my personal view, Nepal should think beyond temporary solutions and reimagine its political structure. I believe that the post of President should be held by the King, while still maintaining our parliamentary democracy. The King would serve as the Head of State, while the Prime Minister, chosen by the people through Parliament, would continue to lead the government and daily administration.  This system would combine the stability of monarchy with the inclusiveness of democracy. The King could symbolize unity, national identity, and continuity, while elected leaders would remain accountable for policymaking and governance. Such a structure could bridge the gap between tradition and modernity in Nepal.  However, I also recognize a challenge. If the King were restored with too much authority, there is always the risk of a return to absolute monarchy, which Nepal has already struggled against in the past. To prevent this, the constitution must be amended clearly so that:  1. The King acts only as a ceremonial head of state, similar to monarchs in the UK, Japan, or Sweden.   2. All executive powers remain with the elected government.   3. The King cannot interfere in parliamentary or judicial affairs.    This would give Nepal the best of both worlds: a symbolic monarch to uphold our cultural and historical identity, and a democratic system to ensure accountability and representation of the people.  At this critical moment, when corruption has weakened faith in politics, reintroducing the King in a constitutional role could provide much-needed stability‚Äîbut only with strict safeguards. Our future should not return to absolute monarchy, but rather move toward a balanced model where tradition and democracy strengthen each other.",

            "comments": "Indian media has now started mentioning that it was about corruption and not about social media ban. It's just poor journalism.|||I saw international media doing same. I think we can't really blame them if they are taking information form joley media of Nepal.|||I hope people of Nepal are not falling for the same trap that destroyed Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. What looked like a well organised protest against govt, soon uncovered itself as regime change operations by deep state.|||We Support Nepal üáÆüá≥|||He hardly has any reach tbh. He is rather seen as a clown who has been trying to incite youth against the establishment since more than 7 years now but fails terribly at it. Most of his views on youtube are manipulated & paid (bots etc). & a chunk of his viewership is rather from Pakistan & Bangladesh.  Edit: Also he is lying.|||Most well informed Indians are aware that this dissent had been brewing for quite sometime. Wish my Nepali bros and sis the best of luck and kudos for taking back what is rightfully yours . Hopefully the guilty are brought to justice, order is restored and right representatives are assigned to take Nepal forward for all its wonderful people. As for our media, they sell whatever gets views from the masses, tomorrow if Sita maa has comeback to be the Queen of Nepal sells, they'll start posting that, organizing debate sessions with clown for cheap entertainment. ü§° I pray the martry RIP, their families fairly and properly compensated , justice is fast tracked, and a votes held  new govt formation.  Goodspeed Nepalis. üá≥üáµ|||Dhruv Rathee is fucking sellout.  He is scam, biased and no body takes him seriously.  His startup was also a scam.|||This mf is just an islamist puppet. We don't need him.|||Bruh, this guy is a charlatan.|||Broken clock moment for Agent Dhruv Rathee - do not fall for his propaganda. I am not sure which media is being blamed here but what I see is that the media channels are saying the ‚ÄúAnti corruption ‚Äú protests.   Low IQ news media doesn‚Äôt count as even Indians know that they are sensationalise everything|||I‚Äôm Indian! There is no propaganda. KP Oli is hated by India and Indians, so Infact we support it.  Indians think KP Oli has- 1) Ruined ties with India, keeps making claims that Ayodhya is actually in Nepal  2) CCP puppet, keeps insulting India and chooses china  3) Hasn‚Äôt visited India in 4 years he‚Äôs been PM, even though India and Nepal are very important partners.   Guys the Modi government is NOT a supporter of KP Oli, the news articles are misinformed and have low knowledge & context about the events in Nepal. I hope our Nepali brethren understand this on our behalf. Thank you üôè|||total international media is reporting it as social media but india ==godi  the reason i hate these nepalis|||Don't fall for him Nepali brothers , he has his own personal interests. Indians are with You üá≥üáµüáÆüá≥|||OP more than india he has more reach in pakistan and bangladesh ü§£|||Indian media is saying that this was a protest against corruption. dhruv rathee always has his agenda. He is the one who is misleading|||Right message, wrong messenger|||Even Indians don't take Dhruv Rathee seriously. We only care about peace and tranquility in Nepal.|||I don't trust him lol, he is a hardcore communist|||He is late as always trying to prove his clowness , media already started to show the true reasons for the protest|||There seems to be no valid narrative. If it was against corruption then the protest should have stopped after government stepping down. But what happened after that - people are destroying and burning their country‚Äôs asset, their parliament, airports and banks etc - this is not the way it should have gone down if this was about corruption only.   Now instead of corruption in the office it‚Äôs anarchy on the streets.|||Western media were reporting the same no?|||His favorite president Trump can't wait to start acting as president of Nepal. Definitely US is definitely behind this.|||Don't believe in this joker.|||Why nepalis are so obsessed with what indian and indian media is saying, why don't they focus on what chinese media is saying as they consider china as their friend so why worry or think about what indian are saying, they don't consider india as their friend so why so much focus on india?|||If you think Dhruv Rathee is telling the truth, then I have an Eiffel Tower to sell you. This person is a grade A propagandist of the anti-BJP front. All his tweets are made on the behest of his masters, and he has been called out multiple times for this.|||FYI‚Äî-> Social media isn‚Äôt just mirroring conflicts happening in schools and on streets ‚Äì it‚Äôs triggering new ones!|||he is against modi gov only.|||Dhruv Rathee is one of the people who remains a part of opposition forever. That doesn‚Äôt mean he is wrong always but sometimes yes! It is not just Indian media it is international media but most of them are correcting themselves now which is good. Although his comments are still wrong in many ways. Social media ban was a ignition for this protest because corruption is going on from a longtime. But people should think what‚Äôs next? Youth leaders are going to step up and take positions to govern? Do they have that kind of unity? And do you think don‚Äôt they turn into corrupt due to powers? Great initiative by youth but think about what‚Äôs next¬†|||All of us Indians know this. What are you saying?|||I don't know what are you talking about. Most coverage of Indian media is overtly positive.   This is because our love towards Nepal is same as our hate towards that Chinese puppet Oli.   If you see any doubt in our media or people, it is because we have a slight doubt if CIA or ISI will start using Nepal as a ground to disturb India.   Nepal can be a smaller country, but they are much more older nation state than us with full of brilliant souls and whatever Nepalis choose for their country, we respect that from core.  But never think this Rathee fellow has any love towards you guys. He's just putting gun over your shoulder to attack India. He is not even an Indian citizen. He is a compromised soul to the highest bidder.|||German shepherd....he only spreads propaganda...beware of him .... Nepal|||This dhruv rati guy is himself an idiot ü§£ü§£|||If you consider German/US funded Dhruv Rathee as flag bearer of honest opinion then you have fallen for exactly the narrative that the 'west' wants you to believe.  Mental colonization happens much before the physical one, this has already happened in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Pakistan look where they are at this time  Beware whom you trust and what you believe.|||It's actually USA, they did the same to Bangladesh last year¬†|||Yesterday I saw a nepali post on Instagram where an Indian mentioned in the comment that the same protest should be done in India and everyone was bashing that guy and calling him out for bringing India in the topic. I hope they see this post|||[removed]|||[removed]|||I'm from Bihar India idk about this situation so I'm here for reading what's going on|||India has (rightly) stayed out of this. It's an internal issue of Nepal and we wish them peace and prosperity. Let normalcy be restored soon.|||Why you even taking him seriously.|||It's quite obvious to everyone in India, except the media narrative. I doubt anyone here believes that our Nepali brothers were protesting to assert their right to doomscroll.  People don't go to extremes in protesting against social media.  And govts don't ban all social media apps, just because the companies didn't \"register with them\". they do it, because they see the narrative has gone against them, and they desperately want to gain back the control.|||This guy ain‚Äôt even an Indian citizen|||Nepal, you are dealing with dangerous, insecure, violent crybullies who don't care about reasons and motives because they'll just come up with fake news and use that is their motive. Good luck.|||Lol i m from india as thought that this was abt social media in the morningü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è now understood the real motive...|||I believe Nepal needs a revolution. I have visited the country many times and have relatives involved in politics, so I am aware of the real situation. People are struggling to find jobs, there is a shortage of roads, and corruption levels are too high.|||Man , this guy is cursed. Whenever his name appears , chaddis flock to it like screaming \" PROPAGANDA\" ,  like moths to a flame.   Stay safe, Nepali bros.|||To my Nepali brothers, any Redditor who is more focused on the messenger rather than the message mentioned, click on their profile and block them. They are more concerned about their agenda's useless buffons.   To the people of Nepal, I hope a better and stronger government arises from the ashes that focuses on development, literacy and is corruption-free.||| so proud of your protested and how your new generation handled the currupt officials but sadly indian youth are still stuck bootlicking|||Because that's what the Godi media does. Indian politicians must either be shitting themselves or laughing knowing this won't happen in India as long as they continue building temples and not schools.|||When has godi media shown reality?|||Because the Indian govt wants Nepal to be destabilized enough to be too weak, divided & afraid to challenge India when it can use the crisis as a pretext to invade & annex Nepal.",

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4. Retirement age and term limits: This is a must, we need a clear retirement age for the public positions just like other jobs.     These sort of things are fundamental of any country, without getting the fundamentals right we cannot expect our country to do better. We have a chance to make things better, lets take this chance.|||also i think! what lessons can be learned from Bangladesh last year?|||Garni nai ho vani presidency system lyauni.

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

AKA the daughter of a corrupt leader, the Chief Development Officer of Kathmandu, Nepal, Chhabi Rijal, who ordered gunfire in a peaceful protest that took place in Nepal on the 8th of September. The protest that took place against a corrupt government resulted in the loss of 20 individuals, some of whom were minors present in school uniforms, and hundreds were injured.   This is what we got for speaking against a government that has leeched off of taxpayers' money. We request an immediate dismissal of Sweta Rijal's candidacy at your esteemed institution. We, as Nepali people, condemn the actions of her immediate family and believe that her degree, funded by her very disliked father, will be of NO USE to our country. Hope you take the necessary action.

It‚Äôs tragic, because they also have families back home and face the same struggles as the rest of us. They should be victims of this system too, yet they show little compassion or critical thought about what‚Äôs happening around them. Why are there protests in the first place? I refuse to believe they're blind to people's frustration and the direction the country is heading.  I still remember when we joined a protest 14‚Äì15 years ago. The police confronted us aggressively, and as kids we were too confused to react. Fortunately, we just stood there processing and visibly confused, and they left ‚Äî but I still shudder to think, *what if our reaction had been different?* Today‚Äôs young protestors are in the same position, pure in their intentions, simply voicing frustration without wanting harm.  And honestly, credit must go to these protestors. They know exactly what they are standing for, unlike us back then who needed adults to organise us. I don‚Äôt see how demonstrations could be any more peaceful than they already are ‚Äî especially when the very leaders being protested against have blood on their hands from before this generation was even born.|||Yo bhatey haru kahi gayera sitcha holani|||randi baan machikne haru|||I mean this tracks, they only like when you're corrupt|||Its not andolan anymore its war|||We want death or at lease exile of KP Oli and other taukes.|||Randi haruko photo, name, address patta lagau.|||khate haru mug haru padne bela ma padenan aile mug ko mug ko chak sugera manche lai dukha dinxan. timi mug haru le esto dukha dekhnu paros jatha haru. maa gali pani dina sakdina timi haru ko aama ko galti haina timi haru jasta janmie. aama lai k thaaa. tara kailei bhalo nahos timi haru jasta ko. timi haru marna pani na paos bachna pani na paos.|||shamelss dogs of government|||Machikne radi harlai lakhetdai marnaparne|||Thuiyaa police vanauda haruuu|||you radiko ban harulai agolauno man xa|||ma sanga pani ganhune bhaye, kassam mardinthe radieekko ban|||Mathi bata aako order re ????

In any case we should focus on cleaning up the trash we made yesterday and the trash people who induce political conspiracies and terror.|||I've rarely heard bad about Jhalanath Khanal. All news i have read of him shows how honest he was and i thought he is one of few good politicians. I don't think him being involved in any corruption and I believe he mostly avoided it. He was good kind man, syals just dragged him around and overshadowed him. He wasn't a bad leader too, he was a weak leader instead and after kp oli took over and pushed him down he just accepted it and didn't cause any dispute or problems. His only mistake was he was one of the leader of yemale but in his defence what else could he do. If he leave the party, others may start a conspiracy or blame him for their wrongdoings. So he just stayed in his given position silently. He should not have been target for gen z at all. But his family member became a casualty, he had to run but his wife got trapped/unsaved in the fire and then her injured body was dragged on the road and thrown inside the ambulance and then she died. But what happened oli and his associates and his jholays? His house burnt but he didn't even suffer a scratch. He resigned and got away without getting a pinch. Sher bahadur and arju were beaten but still people helped them to escape. They will treat the injury and get help from some country to stay as a fugitive. The worst were not burnt alive or shamed publicly or got stripped off their clothing. While innocent kind person like jhala nath khanal's wife had to suffer intoxication, suffocation, excessive heat, first degree burns and later succumb to the injuries. The motive of movement was needed and right, the approach can be justified but the actions and aftermath were just unnecessary overkill. The big dogs survived and fled, but their puppies were shamed tortured and mercilessly beaten. If only they had done the same to sher bahadur and kp oli as they did to those other ministers.|||I hope every so called GEN Z who are celebrating victory be safe.. come no harm to them or their family since police is busy doing their work now and criminals are roaming freely..

Rather than looking outwards to pin üìå the chaos, it's important that we self reflect.

People are saying that 'those were not genz' stfu there DEFINITELY were genz in the crowd that beat up and killed these people. The moment buildings started getting burned down, people started becoming feral with the sense of collective power and destruction that they could bring, and they screwed up. They guided their anger and frustration of seeing kids killed into becoming the same species of monsters that they were initially fighting against. More than the corrupt government firing bullets toward us that day, the ignorant and aggrieved crowd scared me the most. Stealing and picking up guns from the chased police, i really thought that we might see the maoist reenactment that day. The mentality to bring 'an eye for an eye' made everyone senseless. People were celebrating their actions of arson, vandalism, theft, and destruction. If these people aren't the same as the maoist and criminals locked up in jail, then wtf are they?? Maoist also consisted of the young generation of that time. I believe its the ignorance and the petty sense of 'mauka ma chauka' that led these people to terrorise their own country. Sure, the angry crowd may have been incited by some wrong intended individuals at times, however, to feel satisfaction upon seeing beat up people and bloody bodies is insane. The reason bhatbhatini, Ncell, kantipur, imp govt buildings burned down is because of these IGNORANT SENSLESS FUCKING MORONS THAT COULDN'T EVEN DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN PROTEST AND VIOLENCE. There is a reason corrupt govt existed in this country, its the people that gave birth to them. And its going to happen again and again like it has always been in the history. It's the entire nepali population that's messed up. Fuck you all, we can all just die in the embers of our own fire.|||The youth of Nepal was played and deceived in the name of GenZ. There are international players in the game. The whole revolution thing was a regime change operation like which happened in Ukraine, Libya, Bangladesh. They used the youth for regime change to install their puppet government. Sad to say that our leaders are groomed to be used in the politics in the future. Looks like our neighbor used their proxies in Nepal to overtake Deep state regime change operation from the west. If we are not vigilant, we are going to get another Zelenski and Nepal may turn into another Ukraine. UN forces and Indian forces are very active to get into Nepal. Things change rapidly in geopolitics. Achieving this revolution within 24 to 48 hours is in itself very suspicious. All seems like preplanned operation. Our youth needs to be more vigilant.¬†|||how they punched that old woman was uncalled for...Nepal sinked to a new low.

In this case, it is not like that. Protestors ( violent non gen z's) they had given everyone time to evacuate the building, but she did not evacuate. Most likely cuz she was scared of the mob outside. The people outthere assumed it was empty, hence they started burning it. When people realized that women was inside the building, people came to her rescue. Unfortunately, she suffered from burn, reported to be 15% do far. Fortunately, she survived and is recovering. Even though I do not agree with what happened, I hate the narrative of us just burning a women.   Second where was this empathy for the kids that got shot? Where was this empathy for mothers and fathers that lost their children? Where was this empathy for grandfather and grandmother that lost their kids and grandkids? Where was this empathy when millions of people suffered? Where was this empathy when our voices about to be silenced?   Yes, we screwed up but before coming out and trying to shame or guilt trip us, ask yourself are you empathetic cuz you saw the video of her or are you genuinely empathetic cuz of the act? Do we all need our sufferings recorded and made public for people to feel empathetic?   Also ask yourself, people chased, dragged and beat corrupted politicians, but not of them were killed. Do you think people would burn and kill some corrupted politicians wife? If they would, then you would have seen lots of dead politicians by now.  Also I just checked your profile, you are an Indian. How can an Indian citizen empathize with Nepali people when you have not suffered under the regime we suffered. Don't just blindly follow what is being shown in your media. Do some research and you will find the truth yourself.|||Fuck, People are starting to say Save the Constitution. Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**¬†The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**¬†If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**¬†If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**¬†If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||I totally agree with this .|||[deleted]|||Why are indians interfer in our business again?

Their jobs are gone. Tonight, they sleep with fear of tomorrow.  2. Car Showroom, Thapathali: Destroyed for what? Cars will only get rarer and more expensive for us, the people. Did this really hurt the powerful?  3. National ID Center, Thamel: Every citizen needs an identity. Without it, how will people prove who they are, study, travel, or survive? We burned our own rights.  4. Supreme Court, Bar Council, Attorney Office: They were our chance, flawed but still a place for justice. We turned them into ashes with our own hands.  5. Singha Durbar : Not just offices, but history and architecture. A royal palace that carried Nepal‚Äôs story, gone in flames. Our history, our pride, our royal palace. We didn‚Äôt just burn walls, we burned our own heritage.  6. Hilton Hotel : A private property and why? A symbol of tourism and foreign trust. Now the world sees only chaos in Nepal.  7. 1500 Prisoners Freed:  Many were criminals. Now our own streets are less safe for our children.  8. Banks Looted:  Without banks, there is no savings, no loans, no economy. We set fire to our own future.  The List goes on......  The Truth: We did not hurt the leaders. We hurt ourselves. We burned jobs. We burned history. We burned our own tomorrow. If we want change, we must rise to build, not to burn. Because after the fire, it is we, the citizens, who are left with the ashes.|||Ahile ko awastha herda nepal is too vulnerable‚Ä¶. Hijo like prahari le galat garyo uni haru le shoot gare ‚Ä¶.

Balen has clearly stated that this is entirely a GenZ movement and they should go on talks with army on these bla bla bla conditions. So their leader has stepped away from taking the accountability.

The violence, the firings, the destruction of government offices, freeing of prisoners, and burning of data is a tragedy that will haunt us. But we can‚Äôt let this be the end. If we stop now, we‚Äôll only sink deeper into crisis and foreign powers like India, China, or the US will interfere. We can‚Äôt afford to become another failed state.    Yes, yesterday we made mistakes destroying Singha Durbar, burning private property(But in my opinion it wasn't gen z who started that, many political people or people with other intention must have led them to do that.) We have to investigate that, if we find anything, it will be so important for further, for choosing the leaders) But instead of drowning in sadness, we need to channel this pain into solutions.  This is the time to seek the truth, like who let Rabi out, and who is really behind the chaos. And this is also the time to seriously research those stepping forward to lead, people like Sushila Karki and others. We must check their education, experience, and their capacity to take responsibility, there background on corruption and role and everything.   One wrong choice now will cost Nepal for decades.

I mean yesterday when trying to choose a representative for GenZ nai testai vayo, everyone questioning everyone, representative candidates fighting with each other, and mind you there were less 1000 people there. Went to another server, same thing there. And of course no common interest in these two channels as well. I did raise that concern since everyone was fighting, in the chat because no one was ready to listen, just shout, that there are thousands of people who were involved, even if someone did get elected in that very server, what's to say others who were not there will follow. I left after that, have not joined it today. I see representatives of GenZ already doing interviews elsewhere so what is the point here. Also I refrain myself of any opinions since I have absolutely zero knowledge on any politician or their views or visions or nothing, but was just there to see who got elected and what was the conclusion.|||brother with whole heart, we do not but we're trying our best to include all of our voices.|||CHAT GPT ma search gari gari answer bandai theyo...lol.|||Just saw in the news that one of the groups representing genz are raising the voice for bringing the king back like what the actual fuck.

Just leading one, disasterous protest is not going to erase the 50+ years of democratic struggle that came before to write and pass the CONSTITUTION OF NEPAL.    Really Gen Z, DISCORD is your way? It is not a democratic way to select a leader.   Get a committee of trustworthy leaders who represent you to have negotiations. You guys don't know what your are doing.|||The youths of Nepal, need a leader to provide guidance who will help reach their agendas. I doubt most will agree. I believe they are making the demands. Also Nepalese Army IS asking somebody to represent the Gen-Z activists. So yeah, they are pretty much in front of it. I am wondering what they will ask from the new government. I am worried it will be about going abroad. To study and not care about the situation at the moment. I hope we get swift government who can clear corruption and restore some order.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**¬†The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**¬†If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**¬†If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**¬†If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

People watched her speech where she said stuff like, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?‚Äù  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still don‚Äôt have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we don‚Äôt have the right connections.  We don‚Äôt get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, it‚Äôs still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? That‚Äôs probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  We‚Äôre out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor people‚Äôs kids not boil?  On top of that, there‚Äôs already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent. Because this have  been suppressed for so long, and now the mindset is like ‚Äî ‚ÄúIf we can‚Äôt reach anywhere through the system, then we might as well destroy it.‚Äù  And even if some third party tries to trigger people, the truth is, it was already there deep down in their subconscious.

            "body": "What comes next? The only reason Nepal isn't going through a complete currency de-valuation and a bank run is because of the rupee peg. We need to tread water carefully. (**Bank run**¬†is a situation where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a bank simultaneously, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or financial stability. This can lead to liquidity problems for the bank, as it may not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands. Bank runs can create a cycle of panic, potentially leading to the bank's failure.)  The real pain starts after the protests have calmed. Economic crash is certain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh both went through it. Stock market/real estate crash, inflation and what not.  Whoever takes charge next, likely Balen, will need to address the pointless 'Greater Nepal' rhetoric and become a moderate on this issue. Thanks to Trump, India-China relationship is stable for the first time in ages. The only way Nepal has a future is pledge allegiance to both neighbour's.  Bangladesh under Yunus has been a pain in the ass for India. Nepal cannot make the same mistake. Any wrong steps and a free floating Nepali rupee against the dollar would go from 140 now to 25,000 like similar countries in our GDP range. Probably worse since our economy is in much worse shape. ($1 = Lao Kip 21,631.66 LAK)  Nepal needs one stable leader for the next 40 yrs. No interim gov paving way for elections bullshit. Forget the democracy experiment. It does not work in poor, illiterate countries.",

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.¬†¬† Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.¬†¬† Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||How credible is this info?|||Use bitchat for conversation.

            "comments": "We are living in a moment where anger is boiling over. People are tired of corruption, censorship, and being silenced. Many of us are ready to take to the streets on Sept 8. But before we move forward, we must stop and think carefully.  History has shown us what happens when we rush in without preparation. In Bangladesh last year, in Sri Lanka not long ago, ordinary people gave their lives while corrupt leaders fled the country with protection and comfort. Their deaths were forgotten within weeks, while the guilty walked free. If we are not careful, Nepal risks becoming the next chapter in that same tragic story.  That is why this movement must be different. We cannot afford to be reckless. We must protect our people, keep our voices peaceful, and make sure the world is watching every step so that accountability cannot be erased.  Here is what we need to do before Sept 8:  * Get international human rights groups, UN observers, and peace monitors involved beforehand so there are eyes on the ground. * Publish clear and peaceful agendas so nobody can label us as rioters or mobs. * Document everything with photos, videos, and testimonies. Every arrest and every injury must be recorded and shared. * Avoid following local leaders who are affiliated with political parties. Big parties will try to infiltrate, hijack, and twist this movement for their own gain. * Know who is truly standing beside you. Trust matters because infiltrators can turn peaceful protests into chaos.  This movement is about dignity, rights, and accountability. It is not about violence. It is not about revenge. If we lose focus, if we let anger replace strategy, then we risk repeating the same cycle where the powerful walk free and ordinary people pay with their lives.  Nepal deserves better. The world must see us not as mobs, but as citizens united for freedom and justice. If we do this right, our voices will be impossible to silence. If we do this wrong, we risk being forgotten like so many before us.  Stay safe. Stay peaceful. Stay smart.",

She is the daughter of Chabi Rijal, a communist leader and Chief District Officer in Nepal, who recently ordered a shoot-on-sight against youth peacefully protesting corruption in Nepal. His orders have killed over 18 innocent people, injured more than 100 students, and more deaths are expected. This is pure fascism and a gross misuse of power. Young people in a peaceful protest were shot dead, which is totally unacceptable. While our brothers and sisters die in Nepal, Sweta Rijal has no right to study in the US with money from corruption. Her entire funding is from the money from corruption. The US, as a democratic country and a voice for the UN, stands for freedom and justice. Allowing her to stay contradicts everything the US represents. We are struggling to fight this battle in Nepal, and she must be held accountable. I urge you to investigate her visa and take necessary action to send her back to Nepal. Regards, Concerned Citizen from Nepal",

I think you've never seen what corruption can cause, or you pretend not to!  I'm from Brazil, and I'll give you an example of what corruption can do to a society.    Here, I saw young people being shot in favelas just for supporting opposition politicians, yes, ordinary people being killed for supporting the other side.  People were and are arrested, tortured, and killed on the unjust orders of corrupt politicians and judges.  The media, also corrupt, manipulates public opinion with false narratives or half-truths, always favoring the state, especially abroad. This has caused enormous polarization in the country, in addition to promoting many unjust laws.  My country is overrun by crime, and there are criminal factions that control entire regions (with the explicit support of the state), and you run a risk when you go out at night, you know? You can be robbed and killed at any moment, and nothing will be done to the criminal.  Education is also of extremely low quality, which has caused an absurd cultural and moral degradation among my people, who today lack even the capacity to think critically.  Salary increases for politicians without social approval are frequent here, and nothing happens. Search the amount of benefits they receive here.  We recently had a scandal involving millions of retirees being stolen against their will by banks and public agencies. What was the government's solution? To create more taxes to pay without punishing those who stole, and to try to inhibit investigations by using public funds to buy off those who would investigate. Search for \"INSS Scandal\".  The current president (rejected by the majority) has actively provoked other countries, especially the US, to create an open conflict between the two countries, precisely to use this as an excuse to remain in power while putting the lives of millions of people at risk.    Anyway, I could spend all day here giving examples of the harm corruption has caused in the society I live in. I recommend imagining how many future geniuses, entrepreneurs, inventors, and exemplary people for humanity could exist here, but won't, thanks to the corruption of some.  Imagine how prosperous societies would be if there weren't corrupt representatives making absurd and selfish decisions to benefit themselves and control others.    I understand that violence blinds people, and it's unpleasant to see someone in this situation, but we need to understand that in today's societies, we have two sides, one side that wants to live and enjoy life peacefully, and the other that wants to use your life to live like gods.   So, what would you prefer?    The people of Nepal are absolutely right to act as they are, and their politicians need to see what true justice is. They acted wrongly, harming thousands of people, and now they need to be punished, something that would never happen without the use of violence.   The corrupt state would never punish itself, and military forces serve and exist precisely to defend the state and its interests, meaning they would never be punished fairly, and even if they have surrendered, the disaster has already been caused, this surrender is just a way for them to try to avoid punishment, however, sooner or later, they will stab society in the back, and guess what, if society doesn't act, nothing will happen to them and their crimes!  Soon my country will go through something similar, and you will be able to see that it is not about revenge, it is about justice, something that unfortunately is disappearing in societies.  There's no point in trying to appear morally superior, evil people exist and will continue to commit atrocities, and if there are no violent reactions against them, everything will only get worse.|||Ajai kutnu partyo mardeko bhaye huntyo.

I am just a sincere, hardworking youth who remained silent because too many opinions create a ruckus. That's what I believed till September 8. When I went to the protest, it was all fine until they started firing. When you're in the battleground, all moralities go out the window. Yet, I did not throw a single stone at anyone and I am proud of that. I remained with the group who were peacefully protesting infront of the army van, I helped people with water to wash their face, tried picking up litters. The main point is I tried being a responsible person. But the moment I saw people being carried to the hospital with their blood spattering the streets, I fucking lost it. In retaliation, my protests became more louder. I came home late at night, tried my best to repost as many information I could. At one point, I felt like people should burn down the entire ministry down, all these nepo-babies should be brought to the streets to teach their parents how it feels to kill someone's child. I was furious, the word being an understatement. But seeing this people getting mob justice was what I never wanted.

I mean gross national happiness instead of gross national product. I believe every single country on this planet should take Bhutan as a role model a little bit more. Where else in the world are citizens asked what their main problems are and what they want from the government? And later, citizens are asked how satisfied they were with the government's performance. I know it's a bit naive of me to make such a suggestion from afar, as a sheltered European who is not really familiar with the form of government in Nepal. But it seems to be similar in many, many countries. Those in power often hold office and positions of honor for decades through their family ties. And they are similar in their decadence. The most expensive clothes, the biggest cars, houses, and palaces. Flying to New York for dinner in a private jet, or to Monaco for F1, or around the globe in a yacht as long as a soccer field. And in the media, they try to appear close to the people, to be there for them, to advance the country by investing in infrastructure or new hospitals, etc. But no, a large part of your taxes ends up with the rulers themselves. The rich and powerful acquire more wealth and more power. Money rules the world!

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.¬†¬† Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.¬†¬† Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||Jaha Bhetyo tehi thok saley madarchod lai...|||Aaos na india ma ni nepali xan birsyo kya|||Bro timro yo pic use garey haii Tiktok ma vid halchu|||kun desh jala teta bebasta garnu parxa|||yo machikne lai samatna paryo jasari bhaye ni yellai bachne kunai adhikar xaina|||Bhagey ra canada nai ja la, canada ma nee xodnu hudaina.

Personally I have next to no clue who Sumana is, and normally I'd think that makes her a good candidate because there's nothing but positive vibes so far. I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both.

BTW, Gen Z doesn‚Äôt just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didn‚Äôt exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who weren‚Äôt even present for the protests claim we don‚Äôt know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldn‚Äôt even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, ‚ÄòWe have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server you‚Äôre all listening to is just for public discussion‚Äô. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal.

I am not just yapping I was there in the protest especially in the front and I didn't throw a single rock and asked people not to throw rocks as well and while some of us try to communicate with police and we ask them to understand us and support this movement tried  to bring them in our side hoping they drop their weapons but people in the back start throwing rocks and police start violence in an illegal way.I am kind of guy who condemn violence but it is not possible in those situation reality is far different than social media.people in the power wants to keep their power by any means,they have their boots on our throat they will do anything.It is not just only in Nepal it is same between police and protesters all over the world.police follows order from tyrant power hungry people in government.also protest was not just happened in kathmandu it was in every cities of Nepal all ended same ways.why are you thinking about people want to take revenge you know it's not about revenge.

Nothing was going to change if things didn‚Äôt go south. Personally, I didn‚Äôt see the government making any changes with a peaceful protest. Even when we look at history of the world, majority of peaceful protest start peaceful and end violently. No entity in power ever gives it up easily.  Change was what we asked for and change is what we are getting. Not exactly the way we wanted things to go but seems clear from the comments that we all knew, in the back of our minds, it was never going to be a straight road to Rome.  So I believe it‚Äôs high time we look ahead and bring the same energy we did to the protests to ensure that we see the change we want to see happen and bring in leaders we believe in. Easier said than done but accountability starts from us now. Let‚Äôs not settle for less than what we envision Nepal to be.|||Who are you telling this?

They are hot blooded. They can do anything with teen minds.  Look at your genZ, destroying their own land...  GenZ is a popular word on the internet.  Now whenever you talk about GenZ people will remember this amount of brutalism and rage against their own land own assets.|||**What next? thoughts from a fellow Gen Z**    The motherland burns, my heart aches, my mind ponders, is all hope lost? My soul hurts to see violence, arson, anarchy, and the loot and burning of our national properties. We, Gen-Z, seem to have won, yet feel lost. Hope feels lost. Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? I‚Äôve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we can‚Äôt let our nation fail.** We can‚Äôt let our nation burn. We can‚Äôt let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**¬†    **1) We lay down our weapons.**¬†  We came in peace, we protested in peace, and we‚Äôve always wanted peace. We shall end this in peace. Be it known that anybody inciting violence isn‚Äôt part of our movement.¬†    **2) We extend love.**¬†  Love towards our brothers and sisters, love towards our nation, love towards our neighbours, our society, and the opposing side. The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.¬†    **3) We wear white.**¬†  White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that we‚Äôve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.¬†    **4) We have hope.**¬†  Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.¬†    Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.¬†    Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.¬†    Sincerely,¬†  Pantji, a Gen-Z¬†|||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Why not sagar Dhakal?|||Yesss|||Just promote it in your social media handle|||K bhairacha yarr discord ma pm choose bhairacha|||Ahile non political manxe thik huncha...her or Dr ‡§∏‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Å‡§ï Ruit.

Make the president declare her lawful member of parliament through Proportionate Representation System, 3. Declare her the interim prime minister, 4. The president on her cabinet's recommendation dissolves the house of Representatives, 5. Her cabinet carries forward the corruption investigation and reconstruction. 6. The elections will be declared immediately. 7. The new parliament decides the constitutional amendments. (directly elected prime minister etc. and others ) 8. Then, the prime ministerial election happens. 9. She resigns as the interim prime minister. 10. New prime minister and the cabinet are sworn in. 11. The current president resigns. 12.

A message from a clear headed Indian with zero agenda. Please understand these below points very well: 1. While activism is a great way to excel IDE agency understand that it‚Äôs a double edged sword.  2. More often than not, vested interest groups will take this sword and swing it at people in power to cause unrest under the protection of protestors, bringing the protestors a bad name  3. Never under estimate the collective stupidity of a society, it is very easy to get a mob of moderately charged people to go crazy and get into arsony 4. Even a coward will act like an opportunistic lion in a mob  5. Get a hold of your ngo sector that is spreading anti govt hate. Every government is corrupt in this world but your echo chamber is so strong that some vested group could take so much advantage of your youths mind. This is very dangerous.  6. They have to make an example of all the people who have damaged the state property. In India yogi the CM of UP rounded everyone up and bulldozed their homes over night and has warned that if you destroy govt property govt will destroy your property 7. Even now in India we keep seeing anti social elements working in the ‚Äúsocial‚Äù sector and trying to topple Modi or bring disreputation but Modi Ji is a master in handling these people and he has kept a special name for them ‚Äúandolan jeevi‚Äù  Please take care of your country folks.  I‚Äôve known a lot of Nepali friends in India, all of whom are very friendly, proud, hard working people. This riot is definitely not to be allowed to form an image of your country.  Just look at the optics of it all as an international person. Protesting isn‚Äôt bad but who will want to project an image of Nepal where your parliament is on fire? Is this a message? Or is this symbolic?   Decide better dear friends.|||We are fucked up now things are going out of hand we should stop for now .

Students were shot in the head and chest while wearing school uniforms.  The father in question is not only complicit in these killings but has long been regarded in Nepal as a deeply corrupt bureaucrat‚Äîsomeone who has built power and privilege through the machinery of repression. While it is true that the sins of the father may not automatically fall on the children, it is impossible to ignore the moral contradiction here.  How can a student who is pursuing a thesis on¬†*‚ÄúAccess to Justice for Women Migrant Workers: A Case Study of Nepal‚Äù*¬†be simultaneously backed, supported, and funded by a man whose career rests on denying justice to ordinary Nepalis and now on spilling the blood of children? How does a department dedicated to the study of political systems, justice, and civil rights reconcile housing someone so directly tied through family privilege and patronage to such an atrocity?  Is this what UCI Political Science stands for? To offer opportunity and prestige to the families of state-backed killers, while students fighting for democracy are gunned down in the street? The irony is staggering. The silence, even more so.      Sincerely,   A Nepali Citizen|||Someone staying there in US needs to file a case against her, so that she can be deported.|||good initiative, let that fuckers daughter know what her dad did|||Dear Graduate Office / USCIS / ICE,  I am writing with deep pain and urgency about Sweta Rijal, a political science student at your university. She is the daughter of Chhbai Rijal, a communist leader and Chief District Officer in Nepal. He is the very man who recently gave the horrific order to shoot-on-sight at unarmed youth peacefully protesting corruption in Nepal.  Because of his command, more than 18 innocent lives have already been lost. Over 100 students have been brutally injured, and the numbers keep rising. Children, mothers, fathers ‚Äì shot dead in broad daylight for simply demanding justice. This is not governance. This is terrorism from the state itself.  And while our brothers and sisters bleed in the streets, Sweta Rijal lives a comfortable, protected life in the US, funded by money soaked in blood and corruption. Every dollar spent on her education is stolen from the people of Nepal ‚Äì the same people her father‚Äôs orders are murdering.  This is not just hypocrisy ‚Äì it is an insult to justice and democracy. America stands for freedom, human rights, and accountability. Allowing her to remain here under such circumstances goes against everything the US claims to uphold.  We, the citizens of Nepal, are fighting with our lives to end this dictatorship. We cannot accept that the daughter of the man responsible for these crimes enjoys privilege abroad while families bury their children at home. She must be held accountable.  I am begging you ‚Äì investigate her visa and funding. Do not let her enjoy the fruits of corruption and blood money in the land that stands as a beacon of democracy. Send her back to Nepal to face the reality her family created.  This is not just about one student ‚Äì it is about justice, about standing with the oppressed, and about refusing to give safe haven to those living off the suffering of others.

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen.

He is rather seen as a clown who has been trying to incite youth against the establishment since more than 7 years now but fails terribly at it.

I am not sure which media is being blamed here but what I see is that the media channels are saying the ‚ÄúAnti corruption ‚Äú protests.   Low IQ news media doesn‚Äôt count as even Indians know that they are sensationalise everything|||I‚Äôm Indian! There is no propaganda. KP Oli is hated by India and Indians, so Infact we support it.  Indians think KP Oli has- 1) Ruined ties with India, keeps making claims that Ayodhya is actually in Nepal  2) CCP puppet, keeps insulting India and chooses china  3) Hasn‚Äôt visited India in 4 years he‚Äôs been PM, even though India and Nepal are very important partners.   Guys the Modi government is NOT a supporter of KP Oli, the news articles are misinformed and have low knowledge & context about the events in Nepal.

If it was against corruption then the protest should have stopped after government stepping down. But what happened after that - people are destroying and burning their country‚Äôs asset, their parliament, airports and banks etc - this is not the way it should have gone down if this was about corruption only.   Now instead of corruption in the office it‚Äôs anarchy on the streets.|||Western media were reporting the same no?|||His favorite president Trump can't wait to start acting as president of Nepal.

That doesn‚Äôt mean he is wrong always but sometimes yes! It is not just Indian media it is international media but most of them are correcting themselves now which is good. Although his comments are still wrong in many ways. Social media ban was a ignition for this protest because corruption is going on from a longtime. But people should think what‚Äôs next? Youth leaders are going to step up and take positions to govern? Do they have that kind of unity? And do you think don‚Äôt they turn into corrupt due to powers? Great initiative by youth but think about what‚Äôs next¬†|||All of us Indians know this. What are you saying?|||I don't know what are you talking about. Most coverage of Indian media is overtly positive.   This is because our love towards Nepal is same as our hate towards that Chinese puppet Oli.   If you see any doubt in our media or people, it is because we have a slight doubt if CIA or ISI will start using Nepal as a ground to disturb India.   Nepal can be a smaller country, but they are much more older nation state than us with full of brilliant souls and whatever Nepalis choose for their country, we respect that from core.  But never think this Rathee fellow has any love towards you guys. He's just putting gun over your shoulder to attack India. He is not even an Indian citizen. He is a compromised soul to the highest bidder.|||German shepherd....he only spreads propaganda...beware of him .... Nepal|||This dhruv rati guy is himself an idiot ü§£ü§£|||If you consider German/US funded Dhruv Rathee as flag bearer of honest opinion then you have fallen for exactly the narrative that the 'west' wants you to believe.

I doubt anyone here believes that our Nepali brothers were protesting to assert their right to doomscroll.  People don't go to extremes in protesting against social media.  And govts don't ban all social media apps, just because the companies didn't \"register with them\". they do it, because they see the narrative has gone against them, and they desperately want to gain back the control.|||This guy ain‚Äôt even an Indian citizen|||Nepal, you are dealing with dangerous, insecure, violent crybullies who don't care about reasons and motives because they'll just come up with fake news and use that is their motive.

Indian politicians must either be shitting themselves or laughing knowing this won't happen in India as long as they continue building temples and not schools.|||When has godi media shown reality?|||Because the Indian govt wants Nepal to be destabilized enough to be too weak, divided & afraid to challenge India when it can use the crisis as a pretext to invade & annex Nepal.",

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4. Retirement age and term limits: This is a must, we need a clear retirement age for the public positions just like other jobs.     These sort of things are fundamental of any country, without getting the fundamentals right we cannot expect our country to do better. We have a chance to make things better, lets take this chance.|||also i think! what lessons can be learned from Bangladesh last year?|||Garni nai ho vani presidency system lyauni.

Just wanted to express supreme respect to you from Ukraine.   You're really cool!   We had protests in 2014.   We made lot of mistakes after succeded in throwing down Yanukovich in 2014.

After five years people were tricked and during war elected complete scammers after watching \"servant of nation\" series with current president in main role.   Now we get kidnapping peoples on streets by police and conscripted forcely to war or you can get out for $10k until kidnapped next time. People get beaten and sometimes murdered in basements by military guys supported by police.

Constitutional legitimacy + protester acceptance = only viable option.  # 2.¬†PROTESTER LEADERSHIP PIVOT  Gen Z groups must¬†**immediately shift messaging**:  * \"Our revolution is being hijacked\" * \"Military rule = permanent corruption\" * **Name specific civilian demands**: New constitution, elections in 1 year  # 3.¬†ARMY FACE-SAVING EXIT  New interim government must¬†**publicly thank Army Chief Sigdel**¬†for \"preserving democracy\" and¬†**offer ceremonial role**¬†in transition (advisory only, no executive power).  # 4.¬†EMERGENCY UNITY GOVERNMENT  * Sumana Shrestha as PM * Balen Shah as Deputy PM * **3 Gen Z representatives**¬†in cabinet * **Clear 12-month timeline**¬†to new elections  # 5.¬†INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION BLITZ  India, China, UN must¬†**immediately recognize**¬†any civilian arrangement.

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

It‚Äôs tragic, because they also have families back home and face the same struggles as the rest of us. They should be victims of this system too, yet they show little compassion or critical thought about what‚Äôs happening around them. Why are there protests in the first place? I refuse to believe they're blind to people's frustration and the direction the country is heading.  I still remember when we joined a protest 14‚Äì15 years ago. The police confronted us aggressively, and as kids we were too confused to react. Fortunately, we just stood there processing and visibly confused, and they left ‚Äî but I still shudder to think, *what if our reaction had been different?* Today‚Äôs young protestors are in the same position, pure in their intentions, simply voicing frustration without wanting harm.  And honestly, credit must go to these protestors. They know exactly what they are standing for, unlike us back then who needed adults to organise us. I don‚Äôt see how demonstrations could be any more peaceful than they already are ‚Äî especially when the very leaders being protested against have blood on their hands from before this generation was even born.|||Yo bhatey haru kahi gayera sitcha holani|||randi baan machikne haru|||I mean this tracks, they only like when you're corrupt|||Its not andolan anymore its war|||We want death or at lease exile of KP Oli and other taukes.|||Randi haruko photo, name, address patta lagau.|||khate haru mug haru padne bela ma padenan aile mug ko mug ko chak sugera manche lai dukha dinxan. timi mug haru le esto dukha dekhnu paros jatha haru. maa gali pani dina sakdina timi haru ko aama ko galti haina timi haru jasta janmie. aama lai k thaaa. tara kailei bhalo nahos timi haru jasta ko. timi haru marna pani na paos bachna pani na paos.|||shamelss dogs of government|||Machikne radi harlai lakhetdai marnaparne|||Thuiyaa police vanauda haruuu|||you radiko ban harulai agolauno man xa|||ma sanga pani ganhune bhaye, kassam mardinthe radieekko ban|||Mathi bata aako order re ????

Your country has been too kind to me whenever I visit. I literally started my export business with Nepal as my first destination  I have very sweet memories of Nepal and especially of its people: full of joy and compassion. Never bothered to give up to the boiling pace of life.   What the Genz achieved is a lesson to the whole world. An outstanding solidarity display. The revolution as your history will always call it has got its results. I know all is not done you need reforms you need an accountable government. But ask yourself aren't you going overboard now? Literally the whole government has given in and the most possible situation is the army going to take over. Please keep the situation such that the army or any other entity doesn't get the excuse to deny people of their right to rule themselves. This is not  new,  when a revolution with a purpose overshoots give the power mongerers an opportunity to come forward and exploit that. A mob when acting like this is too dangerous. You are now literally resorting to violence as enjoyment.  Keep your Nepali spirits intact. You are one of the most righteous people I have ever seen.

Violence, vigilantism and anarchy should stop, but we shouldn't forget the sinners.       The teacher's movement was so peaceful, i can't stop thinking about it.

All news i have read of him shows how honest he was and i thought he is one of few good politicians. I don't think him being involved in any corruption and I believe he mostly avoided it. He was good kind man, syals just dragged him around and overshadowed him. He wasn't a bad leader too, he was a weak leader instead and after kp oli took over and pushed him down he just accepted it and didn't cause any dispute or problems. His only mistake was he was one of the leader of yemale but in his defence what else could he do. If he leave the party, others may start a conspiracy or blame him for their wrongdoings. So he just stayed in his given position silently. He should not have been target for gen z at all. But his family member became a casualty, he had to run but his wife got trapped/unsaved in the fire and then her injured body was dragged on the road and thrown inside the ambulance and then she died. But what happened oli and his associates and his jholays? His house burnt but he didn't even suffer a scratch. He resigned and got away without getting a pinch. Sher bahadur and arju were beaten but still people helped them to escape. They will treat the injury and get help from some country to stay as a fugitive. The worst were not burnt alive or shamed publicly or got stripped off their clothing. While innocent kind person like jhala nath khanal's wife had to suffer intoxication, suffocation, excessive heat, first degree burns and later succumb to the injuries. The motive of movement was needed and right, the approach can be justified but the actions and aftermath were just unnecessary overkill. The big dogs survived and fled, but their puppies were shamed tortured and mercilessly beaten.

People are saying that 'those were not genz' stfu there DEFINITELY were genz in the crowd that beat up and killed these people. The moment buildings started getting burned down, people started becoming feral with the sense of collective power and destruction that they could bring, and they screwed up. They guided their anger and frustration of seeing kids killed into becoming the same species of monsters that they were initially fighting against. More than the corrupt government firing bullets toward us that day, the ignorant and aggrieved crowd scared me the most. Stealing and picking up guns from the chased police, i really thought that we might see the maoist reenactment that day. The mentality to bring 'an eye for an eye' made everyone senseless. People were celebrating their actions of arson, vandalism, theft, and destruction. If these people aren't the same as the maoist and criminals locked up in jail, then wtf are they?? Maoist also consisted of the young generation of that time. I believe its the ignorance and the petty sense of 'mauka ma chauka' that led these people to terrorise their own country. Sure, the angry crowd may have been incited by some wrong intended individuals at times, however, to feel satisfaction upon seeing beat up people and bloody bodies is insane. The reason bhatbhatini, Ncell, kantipur, imp govt buildings burned down is because of these IGNORANT SENSLESS FUCKING MORONS THAT COULDN'T EVEN DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN PROTEST AND VIOLENCE. There is a reason corrupt govt existed in this country, its the people that gave birth to them. And its going to happen again and again like it has always been in the history. It's the entire nepali population that's messed up. Fuck you all, we can all just die in the embers of our own fire.|||The youth of Nepal was played and deceived in the name of GenZ. There are international players in the game. The whole revolution thing was a regime change operation like which happened in Ukraine, Libya, Bangladesh. They used the youth for regime change to install their puppet government. Sad to say that our leaders are groomed to be used in the politics in the future. Looks like our neighbor used their proxies in Nepal to overtake Deep state regime change operation from the west. If we are not vigilant, we are going to get another Zelenski and Nepal may turn into another Ukraine. UN forces and Indian forces are very active to get into Nepal. Things change rapidly in geopolitics. Achieving this revolution within 24 to 48 hours is in itself very suspicious. All seems like preplanned operation. Our youth needs to be more vigilant.¬†|||how they punched that old woman was uncalled for...Nepal sinked to a new low.

In this case, it is not like that. Protestors ( violent non gen z's) they had given everyone time to evacuate the building, but she did not evacuate. Most likely cuz she was scared of the mob outside. The people outthere assumed it was empty, hence they started burning it. When people realized that women was inside the building, people came to her rescue. Unfortunately, she suffered from burn, reported to be 15% do far. Fortunately, she survived and is recovering. Even though I do not agree with what happened, I hate the narrative of us just burning a women.   Second where was this empathy for the kids that got shot? Where was this empathy for mothers and fathers that lost their children? Where was this empathy for grandfather and grandmother that lost their kids and grandkids? Where was this empathy when millions of people suffered? Where was this empathy when our voices about to be silenced?   Yes, we screwed up but before coming out and trying to shame or guilt trip us, ask yourself are you empathetic cuz you saw the video of her or are you genuinely empathetic cuz of the act? Do we all need our sufferings recorded and made public for people to feel empathetic?   Also ask yourself, people chased, dragged and beat corrupted politicians, but not of them were killed. Do you think people would burn and kill some corrupted politicians wife? If they would, then you would have seen lots of dead politicians by now.  Also I just checked your profile, you are an Indian. How can an Indian citizen empathize with Nepali people when you have not suffered under the regime we suffered. Don't just blindly follow what is being shown in your media. Do some research and you will find the truth yourself.|||Fuck, People are starting to say Save the Constitution. Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**¬†The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**¬†If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**¬†If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**¬†If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||I totally agree with this .|||[deleted]|||Why are indians interfer in our business again?

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**¬†The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**¬†If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**¬†If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**¬†If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

            "body": "What comes next? The only reason Nepal isn't going through a complete currency de-valuation and a bank run is because of the rupee peg. We need to tread water carefully. (**Bank run**¬†is a situation where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a bank simultaneously, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or financial stability. This can lead to liquidity problems for the bank, as it may not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands. Bank runs can create a cycle of panic, potentially leading to the bank's failure.)  The real pain starts after the protests have calmed. Economic crash is certain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh both went through it. Stock market/real estate crash, inflation and what not.  Whoever takes charge next, likely Balen, will need to address the pointless 'Greater Nepal' rhetoric and become a moderate on this issue. Thanks to Trump, India-China relationship is stable for the first time in ages. The only way Nepal has a future is pledge allegiance to both neighbour's.  Bangladesh under Yunus has been a pain in the ass for India. Nepal cannot make the same mistake. Any wrong steps and a free floating Nepali rupee against the dollar would go from 140 now to 25,000 like similar countries in our GDP range. Probably worse since our economy is in much worse shape. ($1 = Lao Kip 21,631.66 LAK)  Nepal needs one stable leader for the next 40 yrs. No interim gov paving way for elections bullshit. Forget the democracy experiment. It does not work in poor, illiterate countries.",

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.¬†¬† Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.¬†¬† Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||How credible is this info?|||Use bitchat for conversation.

            "comments": "We are living in a moment where anger is boiling over. People are tired of corruption, censorship, and being silenced. Many of us are ready to take to the streets on Sept 8. But before we move forward, we must stop and think carefully.  History has shown us what happens when we rush in without preparation. In Bangladesh last year, in Sri Lanka not long ago, ordinary people gave their lives while corrupt leaders fled the country with protection and comfort. Their deaths were forgotten within weeks, while the guilty walked free. If we are not careful, Nepal risks becoming the next chapter in that same tragic story.  That is why this movement must be different. We cannot afford to be reckless. We must protect our people, keep our voices peaceful, and make sure the world is watching every step so that accountability cannot be erased.  Here is what we need to do before Sept 8:  * Get international human rights groups, UN observers, and peace monitors involved beforehand so there are eyes on the ground. * Publish clear and peaceful agendas so nobody can label us as rioters or mobs. * Document everything with photos, videos, and testimonies. Every arrest and every injury must be recorded and shared. * Avoid following local leaders who are affiliated with political parties. Big parties will try to infiltrate, hijack, and twist this movement for their own gain. * Know who is truly standing beside you. Trust matters because infiltrators can turn peaceful protests into chaos.  This movement is about dignity, rights, and accountability. It is not about violence. It is not about revenge. If we lose focus, if we let anger replace strategy, then we risk repeating the same cycle where the powerful walk free and ordinary people pay with their lives.  Nepal deserves better. The world must see us not as mobs, but as citizens united for freedom and justice. If we do this right, our voices will be impossible to silence. If we do this wrong, we risk being forgotten like so many before us.  Stay safe. Stay peaceful. Stay smart.",

Ani Few weeks ago Prachanda b**ch also visited him in the jail. Who knows what do they discuss. Maybe this all is the plans of him to release Ravi.

Aajhai Nepal Lai Pahila Kai Situation Ma Kina Dhakalne Kosis Gardai Xau?\". Please not this time. Don't support Dirty politics. We have already lost a lot.

You say their work has benefited generations ‚Äúlike me‚Äù but what about the millions still without quality education, clean water, jobs, or justice? If that legacy was truly built for the people, then why does inequality keep growing? Why is access to opportunity still limited to a select few families like yours?  No one is attacking your elders for their hard work but using that work to claim political or social superiority today is exactly the kind of dynastic thinking that holds progress back. Legacies don‚Äôt entitle children to power. Competence, accountability, and public trust do.  You‚Äôre not being attacked, you‚Äôre being questioned. And if your only answer is to call others ‚Äúsmall-minded‚Äù and ‚Äúungrateful,‚Äù then maybe you‚Äôre not as prepared to face criticism as you think. Respect is earned in every generation, not inherited like land or a business.  The days of hiding behind the achievements of the past are over.

This has caused enormous polarization in the country, in addition to promoting many unjust laws.  My country is overrun by crime, and there are criminal factions that control entire regions (with the explicit support of the state), and you run a risk when you go out at night, you know? You can be robbed and killed at any moment, and nothing will be done to the criminal.  Education is also of extremely low quality, which has caused an absurd cultural and moral degradation among my people, who today lack even the capacity to think critically.  Salary increases for politicians without social approval are frequent here, and nothing happens. Search the amount of benefits they receive here.  We recently had a scandal involving millions of retirees being stolen against their will by banks and public agencies. What was the government's solution? To create more taxes to pay without punishing those who stole, and to try to inhibit investigations by using public funds to buy off those who would investigate. Search for \"INSS Scandal\".  The current president (rejected by the majority) has actively provoked other countries, especially the US, to create an open conflict between the two countries, precisely to use this as an excuse to remain in power while putting the lives of millions of people at risk.    Anyway, I could spend all day here giving examples of the harm corruption has caused in the society I live in. I recommend imagining how many future geniuses, entrepreneurs, inventors, and exemplary people for humanity could exist here, but won't, thanks to the corruption of some.  Imagine how prosperous societies would be if there weren't corrupt representatives making absurd and selfish decisions to benefit themselves and control others.    I understand that violence blinds people, and it's unpleasant to see someone in this situation, but we need to understand that in today's societies, we have two sides, one side that wants to live and enjoy life peacefully, and the other that wants to use your life to live like gods.   So, what would you prefer?    The people of Nepal are absolutely right to act as they are, and their politicians need to see what true justice is. They acted wrongly, harming thousands of people, and now they need to be punished, something that would never happen without the use of violence.   The corrupt state would never punish itself, and military forces serve and exist precisely to defend the state and its interests, meaning they would never be punished fairly, and even if they have surrendered, the disaster has already been caused, this surrender is just a way for them to try to avoid punishment, however, sooner or later, they will stab society in the back, and guess what, if society doesn't act, nothing will happen to them and their crimes!  Soon my country will go through something similar, and you will be able to see that it is not about revenge, it is about justice, something that unfortunately is disappearing in societies.  There's no point in trying to appear morally superior, evil people exist and will continue to commit atrocities, and if there are no violent reactions against them, everything will only get worse.|||Ajai kutnu partyo mardeko bhaye huntyo.

I am just a sincere, hardworking youth who remained silent because too many opinions create a ruckus. That's what I believed till September 8. When I went to the protest, it was all fine until they started firing. When you're in the battleground, all moralities go out the window. Yet, I did not throw a single stone at anyone and I am proud of that. I remained with the group who were peacefully protesting infront of the army van, I helped people with water to wash their face, tried picking up litters. The main point is I tried being a responsible person. But the moment I saw people being carried to the hospital with their blood spattering the streets, I fucking lost it. In retaliation, my protests became more louder. I came home late at night, tried my best to repost as many information I could. At one point, I felt like people should burn down the entire ministry down, all these nepo-babies should be brought to the streets to teach their parents how it feels to kill someone's child. I was furious, the word being an understatement. But seeing this people getting mob justice was what I never wanted. They don't deserve the least of anyone's sympathies, but we still have humanity in our hearts. That's what differs us from them.¬† I'm trying my best to control the narrative of why the protests happened, so that the opportunistic Indians, Chinese and the entire West may not take undue advantage of us.

Gen z never planned to burn or destroy public property and jails. I believe this happened due to the presence of other opportunistic groups.  Gen z‚Äôs true motive was to overthrow the government and that was achieved. they never intended to take up guns or engage in vandalism and that was not their goal. but many other people, parties or elements took advantage of the moment to cause destruction for their own selfish interests like Looting, hiding behind the anonymity of the crowd.  Because of this, even their own people are now suffering from security issues like the release of 1200 prisoners due to prison breaks.

I mean gross national happiness instead of gross national product. I believe every single country on this planet should take Bhutan as a role model a little bit more. Where else in the world are citizens asked what their main problems are and what they want from the government? And later, citizens are asked how satisfied they were with the government's performance. I know it's a bit naive of me to make such a suggestion from afar, as a sheltered European who is not really familiar with the form of government in Nepal.

The most expensive clothes, the biggest cars, houses, and palaces. Flying to New York for dinner in a private jet, or to Monaco for F1, or around the globe in a yacht as long as a soccer field. And in the media, they try to appear close to the people, to be there for them, to advance the country by investing in infrastructure or new hospitals, etc. But no, a large part of your taxes ends up with the rulers themselves. The rich and powerful acquire more wealth and more power. Money rules the world!

His clothes were torn, his hands trembling his eyes tired. Something inside me made me stop. I gave him a packet of food and a bottle of water. He looked at me for a moment, and then his eyes filled with tears.  He whispered, ‚ÄúDai malai ta manchhe jasto ko bhav nai diyeko dherai din bhayo\" (Brother, it‚Äôs been so long since anyone treated me like a human)  I didn‚Äôt know what to say. That one sentence hit me harder than anything in my life. We complain about traffic, money, stress, politics but here was a man who just wanted to feel human again.  When I left, my hands were empty, but my heart was heavy. That day I realized poverty is not only about money. The biggest poverty is being unseen, unloved, and forgotten.  Ratnapark overbridge will never look the same to me again. Today, that beggar gave me more than I gave him. He gave me a reminder: be kind, because sometimes even a small smile can save someone‚Äôs broken soul.",

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.¬†¬† Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.¬†¬† Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||Jaha Bhetyo tehi thok saley madarchod lai...|||Aaos na india ma ni nepali xan birsyo kya|||Bro timro yo pic use garey haii Tiktok ma vid halchu|||kun desh jala teta bebasta garnu parxa|||yo machikne lai samatna paryo jasari bhaye ni yellai bachne kunai adhikar xaina|||Bhagey ra canada nai ja la, canada ma nee xodnu hudaina.

Sumana didi is a good person but certainly not the one whom we can chose to lead. I know very well of the core team and the teams operations, they have done a good job as a MP but really sorry to say,didi  is not mature enough to handle all this and arko part she has to either quit her association with RSP if she has to become the genz representative or should be part of a guiding figure and more like a sallahakar kind of role to the genz representative. Because she has to come as Sumana as an individual , if she comes as a cadre of RSP, RSP le aaune election ma tesko rajnitik byaj khancha(RSP is going to take away a significant portion of credit, which is not at all fair. Because we didnt trust RSP in any way but we just supported a person)And everyone please be clear, RSP ko political roti sekna gareko haina yo revolution.

But both of them are good leaders and massive respect to both of them for their relentless effort so far and we need their active contribution in rebuilding the new Nepal.

Personally I have next to no clue who Sumana is, and normally I'd think that makes her a good candidate because there's nothing but positive vibes so far. I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both. As long as they are both in the interim government in some manner, despite any roles, everyone will be happy.|||sagar dhakal is educated and seems he can fight any battle , even challenged deuba back in the days .man got guts even in 0|||SUSHILA KARKII|||Sushila Karki would be the best bet.

This will be interim government to conduct elections which means he will not be able to contest for it, if he takes the office now. Additionally, We don‚Äôt have practice of PM contesting for other smaller roles later in life. Maybe thats the reason he is not taking it.  He can form a new party and go into elections, rather than taking office for short period of time.|||Balen|||What about Raja Ram Tandukar?

She was the one who was always obsessed with youths and Gen z yet she never explained to them the dangers of protest and what it would lead to. I'm not sitting here believing he did not felt that there would external forces in this riots.   2. She is the one who has been abroad for so long and has so many foreign connections and relations that even if she  doesn't want interference, there will be far more foreign interference with her as a leader.  We can not deny that .   3. Sumana did absolutely nothing as a health minister apart from stunts. Ministers are supposed to amend laws and execute them. could have done so much more .   4. He is RSP . Haven't issued anything about Ravi being released from prison by their goons.   5. She most probably planned this Gen z nonsense knowing well that it would cause this .|||Since no one knew who to send as a Gen Z representative, I chose to highlight a woman and a man who reflected the majority‚Äôs demands. BTW, Gen Z doesn‚Äôt just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didn‚Äôt exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who weren‚Äôt even present for the protests claim we don‚Äôt know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldn‚Äôt even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, ‚ÄòWe have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server you‚Äôre all listening to is just for public discussion‚Äô. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal. Now that it‚Äôs been confirmed everywhere and with Sumana and Balen posting that the Gen Z‚Äôs choice former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Sushila Karki is the right choice for interim prime minister of Nepal, we look forward to what comes next.|||https://new-nepal-voting.vercel.app/  Vote here or suggest names I can add|||For interim formation CJ Sushila Karki would be the perfect choice.

Nothing was going to change if things didn‚Äôt go south. Personally, I didn‚Äôt see the government making any changes with a peaceful protest. Even when we look at history of the world, majority of peaceful protest start peaceful and end violently. No entity in power ever gives it up easily.  Change was what we asked for and change is what we are getting. Not exactly the way we wanted things to go but seems clear from the comments that we all knew, in the back of our minds, it was never going to be a straight road to Rome.  So I believe it‚Äôs high time we look ahead and bring the same energy we did to the protests to ensure that we see the change we want to see happen and bring in leaders we believe in. Easier said than done but accountability starts from us now. Let‚Äôs not settle for less than what we envision Nepal to be.|||Who are you telling this?

They are hot blooded. They can do anything with teen minds.  Look at your genZ, destroying their own land...  GenZ is a popular word on the internet.  Now whenever you talk about GenZ people will remember this amount of brutalism and rage against their own land own assets.|||**What next? thoughts from a fellow Gen Z**    The motherland burns, my heart aches, my mind ponders, is all hope lost? My soul hurts to see violence, arson, anarchy, and the loot and burning of our national properties. We, Gen-Z, seem to have won, yet feel lost. Hope feels lost. Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? I‚Äôve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we can‚Äôt let our nation fail.** We can‚Äôt let our nation burn. We can‚Äôt let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**¬†    **1) We lay down our weapons.**¬†  We came in peace, we protested in peace, and we‚Äôve always wanted peace. We shall end this in peace. Be it known that anybody inciting violence isn‚Äôt part of our movement.¬†    **2) We extend love.**¬†  Love towards our brothers and sisters, love towards our nation, love towards our neighbours, our society, and the opposing side. The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.¬†    **3) We wear white.**¬†  White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that we‚Äôve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.¬†    **4) We have hope.**¬†  Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.¬†    Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.¬†    Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.¬†    Sincerely,¬†  Pantji, a Gen-Z¬†|||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger. You can only hope the rational one can eventually be the leader, and put the chaos and violence under control.|||You just need to re-steady the ship. There's no such thing as a perfecr revolution, don't be discouraged by missteps üí™üí™|||Army rule is just eminent now in Nepal. Congrats to all GenZ thinking this is some kind of revolution, you were controlled by deep state as usual.  Political instability causes far more problems than solutions. Your protests after 8th have resulted in Parliament on fire , women being raped , lootings of houses , shops and banks.   No such revolution would occur unless you have a leader who is willing to take up control of Nepal after Oli!  You will go back to either the same corrupted governments or military rule!|||Gen Z s and responsible citizens. Its not time to back off yet but a mere calculated retreat.

He killed 17000 ppl once and now he is doing it again so that he could destroy this country and if he finds a place to play with nepal again he will with the help of india again.

When the rich don't know the limits of expoliting the poor these are the consequences. Every freaking nepali politician only gave a fancy speech but never worked towards development of the country. The crowd going crazy is the result of fustration building towards government and the younger generations seeing nothing for them in nepal. All these people in power had to do was work towards uplifting of people rather exploit them, if they would have done 10% as well that would kept the citizens happy. All I wish for nepal is to move forward with vision don't fall for the fancy words like samivdhan and other crap. Bring democracy which has vision for the country!|||The same thing happened in   PAKISTAN (Installed a puppet regime controlled by the Military Dictator after throwing Imran Khan in Prison)  BANGLADESH (so called\"student uprisings\" turned violent, Now ruled by Islamic Extremists)  SRI LANKA (Been there done that)  THAILAND  MYANMAR (Already in Chaos)  TURKEY and FRANCE (on the way there)  So the next target is naturally INDIA i suppose?

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Why not sagar Dhakal?|||Yesss|||Just promote it in your social media handle|||K bhairacha yarr discord ma pm choose bhairacha|||Ahile non political manxe thik huncha...her or Dr ‡§∏‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Å‡§ï Ruit.

Unconstitutional action will hurt Nepal on the long run. Thus, to make it constitutional;  1. Make some MP elected from Proportionate Representation System resign, 2. Make the president declare her lawful member of parliament through Proportionate Representation System, 3. Declare her the interim prime minister, 4. The president on her cabinet's recommendation dissolves the house of Representatives, 5. Her cabinet carries forward the corruption investigation and reconstruction. 6. The elections will be declared immediately. 7. The new parliament decides the constitutional amendments. (directly elected prime minister etc. and others ) 8. Then, the prime ministerial election happens. 9. She resigns as the interim prime minister. 10. New prime minister and the cabinet are sworn in. 11. The current president resigns. 12.

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen. When the police and the army refused to shoot, the old order was already finished.__  **I am not a political scientist, just a hobbyist, I may be wrong.**|||High possibility OF THISSS|||Maybe but not entirely garnu bela tod fod garyeu parliament jalayeu manxe jalayo ani accountability line bela ma aru lai dosh,Kati economical crisis hunxa aba|||Prachanda and men who are into dopamine shits|||No|||Him or Gyanendra.

This tragedy is a blow to our heritage, to our economy, and to our sense of unity as a nation. The damage cannot be measured only in money, but also in the irreplaceable cultural and historical value that has been destroyed.  I feel deeply saddened by this loss.

            "body": "Many students in Nepal get attracted to foreign-affiliated colleges because of the ads and rankings. But from what I‚Äôve seen, the value is not always what it looks like. The courses aren't in depth and the time is often shorter (3 years vs 4 years) and more expensive.  Harek class ma padne afule ho. koi top hola koi le naramro garla. but have you ever heard of graduates from these colleges making it to **top 10** or even top 50 universities worldwide? Meanwhile, TU/KU toppers have gone on to **Harvard, Oxford**, and even the **top 20%** of their classes can get in **top 50 uni**.  For example, any student with four year bachelor degree can join Masters at **Harvard Extension School** (which is part of Harvard Uni). But a 3-year bachelor‚Äôs won‚Äôt qualify.(https://extension.harvard.edu/registration-admissions/degree-program-admissions/how-to-apply-to-a-graduate-degree-program/)  At the end of the day, it‚Äôs your choice - but before paying higher fees, compare the long-term recognition of TU/KU degrees. Going at foreign affiliated college means you were not able to get into a decent uni from your country with decent courses so you opted for such basic program.",

In today‚Äôs market, GPA barely matters. If you‚Äôve got the money and want more time to focus on work, foreign-affiliated degrees can be worth it. To be frank, if you can‚Äôt crack interviews or solve system design and LeetCode problems, no one cares where you studied or where you studied.|||I'll only speak for the masters part as that is prolly everyone's concern who is planing to choose their colleges after bachelors. People who study in UK colleges or EU colleges affiliated or not mostly have 3 years degree. The years for your bachelors does matter but just because u studied 3 years wont disqualify you during your interview process because I've seen people from UK colleges get into Stanford and Harvard, what will disqualify you is your colleges credit system. If your college doesn't give enough credits per subject then you cant apply to any uni period. And just because you are good in your studies or are top 2% or 1% in your class doesn't give you a seat in any ivy, its your impact in your society that matters.  But choosing a uni is a difficult subject, if someone has decided to study in a foreign affiliated uni do check the credit system, cause you never know they might just get 20 lakhs while you get nothing in return|||Yes they are shit most of the time the foreign university are not good for example westcliff uni which I have heard a lot of bad and negatives from the people studying there and the graduates.  Similar goes to the British college where the 3 years degree is modified into a 4 year one and people have to pay around 20 lakhs to get that degree.  It would be great if the foreign affiliate college were in top 100 or 50s , then the prices would be  some what justified but in this present time I think they are just a money grab scheme.|||Many students in Nepal choose foreign-affiliated colleges, and I think they do have some real advantages. The 3-year degree might look shorter, but that‚Äôs the international standard in places like the UK and Australia, and it helps you finish faster.  Moreover, many foreign affiliated colleges in Nepal are still new and where students go after their degree needs to be researched on further. Credit transfer huncha bhanne ni suneko ho maile.   In foreign uni Classes usually focus more on practical learning‚Äîprojects, case studies, internships‚Äîrather than just theory. Dherai thaau ma teachers haru pani foreign uni mai padheko huchan. That makes students more confident and job-ready. Also, the degree is recognized abroad, so if you want to apply for higher studies or work outside Nepal, it gives you an edge.  Having said this, Nepali university degrees are more rigorous no doubt but they do lack that practical exposure.   Of course, TU and KU are great, but foreign-affiliated colleges give you global exposure and a different style of education. At the end of the day, it depends on what you want for your future. Not every 18 year old wants to prepare for end of term examinations like in Nepali unis and not everyone wants to go to Harvard.|||My friend got an admission to LSE so depends on the person. Padhne environment chei xaina koi padhdainan afu padhyo vane degree ko value ramrai hunxa|||Foreign affiliated ma padhna haina hallina jane ta ho manche haru.|||After my +2 in 2019, when I went to Softwarica for counseling, with a companion who was preparing for IOM in NAME, that one Didi who did my counseling, turns out that she was also preparing for IOM and was just there because she got paid for that, which I think is a good thing, for her. They(she and my friend) started to talk about their field for some minutes after my counseling.|||I did a foreign affiliated University Degree and I am very happy with it.

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4. Retirement age and term limits: This is a must, we need a clear retirement age for the public positions just like other jobs.     These sort of things are fundamental of any country, without getting the fundamentals right we cannot expect our country to do better. We have a chance to make things better, lets take this chance.|||also i think! what lessons can be learned from Bangladesh last year?|||Garni nai ho vani presidency system lyauni.

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

It‚Äôs tragic, because they also have families back home and face the same struggles as the rest of us. They should be victims of this system too, yet they show little compassion or critical thought about what‚Äôs happening around them. Why are there protests in the first place? I refuse to believe they're blind to people's frustration and the direction the country is heading.  I still remember when we joined a protest 14‚Äì15 years ago. The police confronted us aggressively, and as kids we were too confused to react. Fortunately, we just stood there processing and visibly confused, and they left ‚Äî but I still shudder to think, *what if our reaction had been different?* Today‚Äôs young protestors are in the same position, pure in their intentions, simply voicing frustration without wanting harm.  And honestly, credit must go to these protestors. They know exactly what they are standing for, unlike us back then who needed adults to organise us. I don‚Äôt see how demonstrations could be any more peaceful than they already are ‚Äî especially when the very leaders being protested against have blood on their hands from before this generation was even born.|||Yo bhatey haru kahi gayera sitcha holani|||randi baan machikne haru|||I mean this tracks, they only like when you're corrupt|||Its not andolan anymore its war|||We want death or at lease exile of KP Oli and other taukes.|||Randi haruko photo, name, address patta lagau.|||khate haru mug haru padne bela ma padenan aile mug ko mug ko chak sugera manche lai dukha dinxan. timi mug haru le esto dukha dekhnu paros jatha haru. maa gali pani dina sakdina timi haru ko aama ko galti haina timi haru jasta janmie. aama lai k thaaa. tara kailei bhalo nahos timi haru jasta ko. timi haru marna pani na paos bachna pani na paos.|||shamelss dogs of government|||Machikne radi harlai lakhetdai marnaparne|||Thuiyaa police vanauda haruuu|||you radiko ban harulai agolauno man xa|||ma sanga pani ganhune bhaye, kassam mardinthe radieekko ban|||Mathi bata aako order re ????

Please keep the situation such that the army or any other entity doesn't get the excuse to deny people of their right to rule themselves. This is not  new,  when a revolution with a purpose overshoots give the power mongerers an opportunity to come forward and exploit that. A mob when acting like this is too dangerous.

What about teacher's movement? We need a political cleanup.   My opinion is that these are among the big players manipulating the nation, we should not be swayed by their sweet words and should see them as suspicious characters, this is the time to take initiative.       Violence, vigilantism and anarchy should stop, but we shouldn't forget the sinners.       The teacher's movement was so peaceful, i can't stop thinking about it. In any case we should focus on cleaning up the trash we made yesterday and the trash people who induce political conspiracies and terror.|||I've rarely heard bad about Jhalanath Khanal. All news i have read of him shows how honest he was and i thought he is one of few good politicians. I don't think him being involved in any corruption and I believe he mostly avoided it. He was good kind man, syals just dragged him around and overshadowed him. He wasn't a bad leader too, he was a weak leader instead and after kp oli took over and pushed him down he just accepted it and didn't cause any dispute or problems. His only mistake was he was one of the leader of yemale but in his defence what else could he do. If he leave the party, others may start a conspiracy or blame him for their wrongdoings. So he just stayed in his given position silently. He should not have been target for gen z at all. But his family member became a casualty, he had to run but his wife got trapped/unsaved in the fire and then her injured body was dragged on the road and thrown inside the ambulance and then she died. But what happened oli and his associates and his jholays? His house burnt but he didn't even suffer a scratch. He resigned and got away without getting a pinch. Sher bahadur and arju were beaten but still people helped them to escape. They will treat the injury and get help from some country to stay as a fugitive. The worst were not burnt alive or shamed publicly or got stripped off their clothing. While innocent kind person like jhala nath khanal's wife had to suffer intoxication, suffocation, excessive heat, first degree burns and later succumb to the injuries. The motive of movement was needed and right, the approach can be justified but the actions and aftermath were just unnecessary overkill. The big dogs survived and fled, but their puppies were shamed tortured and mercilessly beaten. If only they had done the same to sher bahadur and kp oli as they did to those other ministers.|||I hope every so called GEN Z who are celebrating victory be safe.. come no harm to them or their family since police is busy doing their work now and criminals are roaming freely..

People are saying that 'those were not genz' stfu there DEFINITELY were genz in the crowd that beat up and killed these people. The moment buildings started getting burned down, people started becoming feral with the sense of collective power and destruction that they could bring, and they screwed up. They guided their anger and frustration of seeing kids killed into becoming the same species of monsters that they were initially fighting against. More than the corrupt government firing bullets toward us that day, the ignorant and aggrieved crowd scared me the most. Stealing and picking up guns from the chased police, i really thought that we might see the maoist reenactment that day. The mentality to bring 'an eye for an eye' made everyone senseless. People were celebrating their actions of arson, vandalism, theft, and destruction. If these people aren't the same as the maoist and criminals locked up in jail, then wtf are they?? Maoist also consisted of the young generation of that time. I believe its the ignorance and the petty sense of 'mauka ma chauka' that led these people to terrorise their own country. Sure, the angry crowd may have been incited by some wrong intended individuals at times, however, to feel satisfaction upon seeing beat up people and bloody bodies is insane. The reason bhatbhatini, Ncell, kantipur, imp govt buildings burned down is because of these IGNORANT SENSLESS FUCKING MORONS THAT COULDN'T EVEN DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN PROTEST AND VIOLENCE. There is a reason corrupt govt existed in this country, its the people that gave birth to them. And its going to happen again and again like it has always been in the history. It's the entire nepali population that's messed up. Fuck you all, we can all just die in the embers of our own fire.|||The youth of Nepal was played and deceived in the name of GenZ. There are international players in the game. The whole revolution thing was a regime change operation like which happened in Ukraine, Libya, Bangladesh. They used the youth for regime change to install their puppet government. Sad to say that our leaders are groomed to be used in the politics in the future. Looks like our neighbor used their proxies in Nepal to overtake Deep state regime change operation from the west. If we are not vigilant, we are going to get another Zelenski and Nepal may turn into another Ukraine. UN forces and Indian forces are very active to get into Nepal. Things change rapidly in geopolitics. Achieving this revolution within 24 to 48 hours is in itself very suspicious. All seems like preplanned operation. Our youth needs to be more vigilant.¬†|||how they punched that old woman was uncalled for...Nepal sinked to a new low.

In this case, it is not like that. Protestors ( violent non gen z's) they had given everyone time to evacuate the building, but she did not evacuate. Most likely cuz she was scared of the mob outside. The people outthere assumed it was empty, hence they started burning it. When people realized that women was inside the building, people came to her rescue. Unfortunately, she suffered from burn, reported to be 15% do far. Fortunately, she survived and is recovering. Even though I do not agree with what happened, I hate the narrative of us just burning a women.   Second where was this empathy for the kids that got shot? Where was this empathy for mothers and fathers that lost their children? Where was this empathy for grandfather and grandmother that lost their kids and grandkids? Where was this empathy when millions of people suffered? Where was this empathy when our voices about to be silenced?   Yes, we screwed up but before coming out and trying to shame or guilt trip us, ask yourself are you empathetic cuz you saw the video of her or are you genuinely empathetic cuz of the act? Do we all need our sufferings recorded and made public for people to feel empathetic?   Also ask yourself, people chased, dragged and beat corrupted politicians, but not of them were killed. Do you think people would burn and kill some corrupted politicians wife? If they would, then you would have seen lots of dead politicians by now.  Also I just checked your profile, you are an Indian. How can an Indian citizen empathize with Nepali people when you have not suffered under the regime we suffered. Don't just blindly follow what is being shown in your media. Do some research and you will find the truth yourself.|||Fuck, People are starting to say Save the Constitution. Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**¬†The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**¬†If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**¬†If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**¬†If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||I totally agree with this .|||[deleted]|||Why are indians interfer in our business again?

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):**¬†The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):**¬†If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):**¬†If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):**¬†If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution.

The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal.

From BBC News on foreign policy you can understand what the British government wants its people to think, and usually not much more than that.  Here you can see their technique, where they do not invent a lie, but instead deliberately omit part of the story.  Usually on domestic news they can be trusted but on foreign policy they are not trustworthy at all.  Best of luck with what is going on in your country.

            "body": "What comes next? The only reason Nepal isn't going through a complete currency de-valuation and a bank run is because of the rupee peg. We need to tread water carefully. (**Bank run**¬†is a situation where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a bank simultaneously, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or financial stability. This can lead to liquidity problems for the bank, as it may not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands. Bank runs can create a cycle of panic, potentially leading to the bank's failure.)  The real pain starts after the protests have calmed. Economic crash is certain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh both went through it. Stock market/real estate crash, inflation and what not.  Whoever takes charge next, likely Balen, will need to address the pointless 'Greater Nepal' rhetoric and become a moderate on this issue. Thanks to Trump, India-China relationship is stable for the first time in ages. The only way Nepal has a future is pledge allegiance to both neighbour's.  Bangladesh under Yunus has been a pain in the ass for India. Nepal cannot make the same mistake. Any wrong steps and a free floating Nepali rupee against the dollar would go from 140 now to 25,000 like similar countries in our GDP range. Probably worse since our economy is in much worse shape. ($1 = Lao Kip 21,631.66 LAK)  Nepal needs one stable leader for the next 40 yrs. No interim gov paving way for elections bullshit. Forget the democracy experiment. It does not work in poor, illiterate countries.",

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.¬†¬† Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.¬†¬† Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||How credible is this info?|||Use bitchat for conversation.

            "comments": "We are living in a moment where anger is boiling over. People are tired of corruption, censorship, and being silenced. Many of us are ready to take to the streets on Sept 8. But before we move forward, we must stop and think carefully.  History has shown us what happens when we rush in without preparation. In Bangladesh last year, in Sri Lanka not long ago, ordinary people gave their lives while corrupt leaders fled the country with protection and comfort. Their deaths were forgotten within weeks, while the guilty walked free. If we are not careful, Nepal risks becoming the next chapter in that same tragic story.  That is why this movement must be different. We cannot afford to be reckless. We must protect our people, keep our voices peaceful, and make sure the world is watching every step so that accountability cannot be erased.  Here is what we need to do before Sept 8:  * Get international human rights groups, UN observers, and peace monitors involved beforehand so there are eyes on the ground. * Publish clear and peaceful agendas so nobody can label us as rioters or mobs. * Document everything with photos, videos, and testimonies. Every arrest and every injury must be recorded and shared. * Avoid following local leaders who are affiliated with political parties. Big parties will try to infiltrate, hijack, and twist this movement for their own gain. * Know who is truly standing beside you. Trust matters because infiltrators can turn peaceful protests into chaos.  This movement is about dignity, rights, and accountability. It is not about violence. It is not about revenge. If we lose focus, if we let anger replace strategy, then we risk repeating the same cycle where the powerful walk free and ordinary people pay with their lives.  Nepal deserves better. The world must see us not as mobs, but as citizens united for freedom and justice. If we do this right, our voices will be impossible to silence. If we do this wrong, we risk being forgotten like so many before us.  Stay safe. Stay peaceful. Stay smart.",

You say their work has benefited generations ‚Äúlike me‚Äù but what about the millions still without quality education, clean water, jobs, or justice? If that legacy was truly built for the people, then why does inequality keep growing? Why is access to opportunity still limited to a select few families like yours?  No one is attacking your elders for their hard work but using that work to claim political or social superiority today is exactly the kind of dynastic thinking that holds progress back. Legacies don‚Äôt entitle children to power. Competence, accountability, and public trust do.  You‚Äôre not being attacked, you‚Äôre being questioned. And if your only answer is to call others ‚Äúsmall-minded‚Äù and ‚Äúungrateful,‚Äù then maybe you‚Äôre not as prepared to face criticism as you think. Respect is earned in every generation, not inherited like land or a business.  The days of hiding behind the achievements of the past are over.

This has caused enormous polarization in the country, in addition to promoting many unjust laws.  My country is overrun by crime, and there are criminal factions that control entire regions (with the explicit support of the state), and you run a risk when you go out at night, you know? You can be robbed and killed at any moment, and nothing will be done to the criminal.  Education is also of extremely low quality, which has caused an absurd cultural and moral degradation among my people, who today lack even the capacity to think critically.  Salary increases for politicians without social approval are frequent here, and nothing happens. Search the amount of benefits they receive here.  We recently had a scandal involving millions of retirees being stolen against their will by banks and public agencies. What was the government's solution? To create more taxes to pay without punishing those who stole, and to try to inhibit investigations by using public funds to buy off those who would investigate. Search for \"INSS Scandal\".  The current president (rejected by the majority) has actively provoked other countries, especially the US, to create an open conflict between the two countries, precisely to use this as an excuse to remain in power while putting the lives of millions of people at risk.    Anyway, I could spend all day here giving examples of the harm corruption has caused in the society I live in. I recommend imagining how many future geniuses, entrepreneurs, inventors, and exemplary people for humanity could exist here, but won't, thanks to the corruption of some.  Imagine how prosperous societies would be if there weren't corrupt representatives making absurd and selfish decisions to benefit themselves and control others.    I understand that violence blinds people, and it's unpleasant to see someone in this situation, but we need to understand that in today's societies, we have two sides, one side that wants to live and enjoy life peacefully, and the other that wants to use your life to live like gods.   So, what would you prefer?    The people of Nepal are absolutely right to act as they are, and their politicians need to see what true justice is. They acted wrongly, harming thousands of people, and now they need to be punished, something that would never happen without the use of violence.   The corrupt state would never punish itself, and military forces serve and exist precisely to defend the state and its interests, meaning they would never be punished fairly, and even if they have surrendered, the disaster has already been caused, this surrender is just a way for them to try to avoid punishment, however, sooner or later, they will stab society in the back, and guess what, if society doesn't act, nothing will happen to them and their crimes!  Soon my country will go through something similar, and you will be able to see that it is not about revenge, it is about justice, something that unfortunately is disappearing in societies.  There's no point in trying to appear morally superior, evil people exist and will continue to commit atrocities, and if there are no violent reactions against them, everything will only get worse.|||Ajai kutnu partyo mardeko bhaye huntyo.

I am just a sincere, hardworking youth who remained silent because too many opinions create a ruckus. That's what I believed till September 8. When I went to the protest, it was all fine until they started firing. When you're in the battleground, all moralities go out the window. Yet, I did not throw a single stone at anyone and I am proud of that. I remained with the group who were peacefully protesting infront of the army van, I helped people with water to wash their face, tried picking up litters. The main point is I tried being a responsible person. But the moment I saw people being carried to the hospital with their blood spattering the streets, I fucking lost it. In retaliation, my protests became more louder. I came home late at night, tried my best to repost as many information I could. At one point, I felt like people should burn down the entire ministry down, all these nepo-babies should be brought to the streets to teach their parents how it feels to kill someone's child. I was furious, the word being an understatement. But seeing this people getting mob justice was what I never wanted. They don't deserve the least of anyone's sympathies, but we still have humanity in our hearts. That's what differs us from them.¬† I'm trying my best to control the narrative of why the protests happened, so that the opportunistic Indians, Chinese and the entire West may not take undue advantage of us.

Gen z never planned to burn or destroy public property and jails. I believe this happened due to the presence of other opportunistic groups.  Gen z‚Äôs true motive was to overthrow the government and that was achieved. they never intended to take up guns or engage in vandalism and that was not their goal. but many other people, parties or elements took advantage of the moment to cause destruction for their own selfish interests like Looting, hiding behind the anonymity of the crowd.  Because of this, even their own people are now suffering from security issues like the release of 1200 prisoners due to prison breaks.

I mean gross national happiness instead of gross national product. I believe every single country on this planet should take Bhutan as a role model a little bit more. Where else in the world are citizens asked what their main problems are and what they want from the government? And later, citizens are asked how satisfied they were with the government's performance. I know it's a bit naive of me to make such a suggestion from afar, as a sheltered European who is not really familiar with the form of government in Nepal.

The most expensive clothes, the biggest cars, houses, and palaces. Flying to New York for dinner in a private jet, or to Monaco for F1, or around the globe in a yacht as long as a soccer field. And in the media, they try to appear close to the people, to be there for them, to advance the country by investing in infrastructure or new hospitals, etc. But no, a large part of your taxes ends up with the rulers themselves.

This is literally just her side of the story. Anyone can sit behind a keyboard, write a long emotional post, and instantly turn public opinion against someone. That doesn‚Äôt make it the full truth.  We‚Äôve seen this before ‚Äî remember the Sandeep Lamichhane case? A girl accused him, media and public went wild, and people treated him as guilty before trial. Later, so many loopholes came out. It‚Äôs the same pattern here ‚Äî society naturally sides with the girl because we have an inbuilt bias that says ‚Äúthe girl must be the victim.‚Äù But is that always true? No.  Let‚Äôs also not ignore that sometimes girls do play emotional games. They ghost, they manipulate, they test how much a guy will ‚Äúchase‚Äù them ‚Äî and when he does, suddenly it becomes ‚Äústalking.‚Äù Where‚Äôs the line? Maybe she had past relationships, maybe she‚Äôs not telling the full story about her own actions that led to this fallout. Why should we blindly believe only her narrative and not even question what really happened?  And now people are targeting not just him, but also his family. That‚Äôs disgusting. Whatever the issue is between two individuals, why should parents, brothers, or sisters be dragged into it? People forget that when you destroy someone online, you destroy their whole family‚Äôs dignity too.  Everyone‚Äôs commenting with sympathy for her and anger towards him. But let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî most of that is just because she‚Äôs a girl and he‚Äôs a guy. If the genders were reversed, would people still believe the story this blindly? I doubt it.  Look, if he‚Äôs actually guilty of harassment, the law should punish him. No question about that. But until then, it‚Äôs not fair to publicly assassinate someone‚Äôs character based on one-sided claims. Social media is not a courtroom, and we shouldn‚Äôt let feelings override facts.|||:D|||https://www.facebook.com/share/1JV5hYfP6t/?mibextid=wwXIfr  don‚Äôt bully her. Only message her.

His clothes were torn, his hands trembling his eyes tired. Something inside me made me stop. I gave him a packet of food and a bottle of water. He looked at me for a moment, and then his eyes filled with tears.  He whispered, ‚ÄúDai malai ta manchhe jasto ko bhav nai diyeko dherai din bhayo\" (Brother, it‚Äôs been so long since anyone treated me like a human)  I didn‚Äôt know what to say. That one sentence hit me harder than anything in my life. We complain about traffic, money, stress, politics but here was a man who just wanted to feel human again.  When I left, my hands were empty, but my heart was heavy. That day I realized poverty is not only about money. The biggest poverty is being unseen, unloved, and forgotten.

In the recent past, an entire neighborbood of Murshidabad felt the wrath of communal violence. A rampage by muslims burnt down 113 hindu homes and a father and son were hacked to death. Yes, shocking and yet neither the local police nor the state intervened to protect those under attack.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.¬†¬† Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.¬†¬† Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||Jaha Bhetyo tehi thok saley madarchod lai...|||Aaos na india ma ni nepali xan birsyo kya|||Bro timro yo pic use garey haii Tiktok ma vid halchu|||kun desh jala teta bebasta garnu parxa|||yo machikne lai samatna paryo jasari bhaye ni yellai bachne kunai adhikar xaina|||Bhagey ra canada nai ja la, canada ma nee xodnu hudaina.

Personally I have next to no clue who Sumana is, and normally I'd think that makes her a good candidate because there's nothing but positive vibes so far. I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both. As long as they are both in the interim government in some manner, despite any roles, everyone will be happy.|||sagar dhakal is educated and seems he can fight any battle , even challenged deuba back in the days .man got guts even in 0|||SUSHILA KARKII|||Sushila Karki would be the best bet.

This will be interim government to conduct elections which means he will not be able to contest for it, if he takes the office now. Additionally, We don‚Äôt have practice of PM contesting for other smaller roles later in life. Maybe thats the reason he is not taking it.  He can form a new party and go into elections, rather than taking office for short period of time.|||Balen|||What about Raja Ram Tandukar?

She was the one who was always obsessed with youths and Gen z yet she never explained to them the dangers of protest and what it would lead to. I'm not sitting here believing he did not felt that there would external forces in this riots.   2. She is the one who has been abroad for so long and has so many foreign connections and relations that even if she  doesn't want interference, there will be far more foreign interference with her as a leader.  We can not deny that .   3. Sumana did absolutely nothing as a health minister apart from stunts. Ministers are supposed to amend laws and execute them. could have done so much more .   4. He is RSP . Haven't issued anything about Ravi being released from prison by their goons.   5. She most probably planned this Gen z nonsense knowing well that it would cause this .|||Since no one knew who to send as a Gen Z representative, I chose to highlight a woman and a man who reflected the majority‚Äôs demands. BTW, Gen Z doesn‚Äôt just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didn‚Äôt exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who weren‚Äôt even present for the protests claim we don‚Äôt know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldn‚Äôt even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, ‚ÄòWe have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server you‚Äôre all listening to is just for public discussion‚Äô. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal. Now that it‚Äôs been confirmed everywhere and with Sumana and Balen posting that the Gen Z‚Äôs choice former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Sushila Karki is the right choice for interim prime minister of Nepal, we look forward to what comes next.|||https://new-nepal-voting.vercel.app/  Vote here or suggest names I can add|||For interim formation CJ Sushila Karki would be the perfect choice.

Nothing was going to change if things didn‚Äôt go south. Personally, I didn‚Äôt see the government making any changes with a peaceful protest. Even when we look at history of the world, majority of peaceful protest start peaceful and end violently. No entity in power ever gives it up easily.  Change was what we asked for and change is what we are getting. Not exactly the way we wanted things to go but seems clear from the comments that we all knew, in the back of our minds, it was never going to be a straight road to Rome.  So I believe it‚Äôs high time we look ahead and bring the same energy we did to the protests to ensure that we see the change we want to see happen and bring in leaders we believe in.

Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? I‚Äôve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we can‚Äôt let our nation fail.** We can‚Äôt let our nation burn. We can‚Äôt let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**¬†    **1) We lay down our weapons.**¬†  We came in peace, we protested in peace, and we‚Äôve always wanted peace. We shall end this in peace.

The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.¬†    **3) We wear white.**¬†  White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that we‚Äôve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.¬†    **4) We have hope.**¬†  Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.¬†    Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.¬†    Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.¬†    Sincerely,¬†  Pantji, a Gen-Z¬†|||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger.

All these people in power had to do was work towards uplifting of people rather exploit them, if they would have done 10% as well that would kept the citizens happy. All I wish for nepal is to move forward with vision don't fall for the fancy words like samivdhan and other crap. Bring democracy which has vision for the country!|||The same thing happened in   PAKISTAN (Installed a puppet regime controlled by the Military Dictator after throwing Imran Khan in Prison)  BANGLADESH (so called\"student uprisings\" turned violent, Now ruled by Islamic Extremists)  SRI LANKA (Been there done that)  THAILAND  MYANMAR (Already in Chaos)  TURKEY and FRANCE (on the way there)  So the next target is naturally INDIA i suppose?

Experience isn‚Äôt a flaw, it‚Äôs literally the one thing that tells you someone can handle the chaos.

We keep repeating the same mistakes because people get blinded by shiny new faces and ignore anyone who actually knows what they‚Äôre doing. Experience doesn‚Äôt mean someone is corrupt it means they‚Äôve been in the trenches and survived. Throwing it away just to see if a ‚Äúfresh face‚Äù can magically save everything is how you crash a country.  Nepal isn‚Äôt a playground. Leadership isn‚Äôt about hype, popularity, or being young and ‚Äúgreen.‚Äù It‚Äôs about surviving the chaos, making tough decisions, and knowing where the landmines are. If you think a rookie can do that better than someone experienced, you‚Äôre dreaming and the whole nation will pay the price for it.",

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Why not sagar Dhakal?|||Yesss|||Just promote it in your social media handle|||K bhairacha yarr discord ma pm choose bhairacha|||Ahile non political manxe thik huncha...her or Dr ‡§∏‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Å‡§ï Ruit.

The president on her cabinet's recommendation dissolves the house of Representatives, 5. Her cabinet carries forward the corruption investigation and reconstruction. 6. The elections will be declared immediately. 7. The new parliament decides the constitutional amendments. (directly elected prime minister etc. and others ) 8. Then, the prime ministerial election happens. 9. She resigns as the interim prime minister. 10. New prime minister and the cabinet are sworn in. 11. The current president resigns. 12.

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen.

Built in 1908, it has stood as a symbol of our sovereignty, democracy, and national identity. For generations, it has been the place where decisions shaping our country‚Äôs future were made. Its grand architecture and historical importance make it a true pride of Nepal.The news of Singha Durbar burning yesterday is more than just the loss of a structure it feels like the loss of a piece of our soul. This tragedy is a blow to our heritage, to our economy, and to our sense of unity as a nation. The damage cannot be measured only in money, but also in the irreplaceable cultural and historical value that has been destroyed.  I feel deeply saddened by this loss. Singha Durbar was more than walls and pillars it was a living monument of Nepal‚Äôs journey, struggles, and achievements. Watching it go up in flames is heartbreaking for every Nepali who loves their country.",

            "body": "Many students in Nepal get attracted to foreign-affiliated colleges because of the ads and rankings. But from what I‚Äôve seen, the value is not always what it looks like. The courses aren't in depth and the time is often shorter (3 years vs 4 years) and more expensive.  Harek class ma padne afule ho. koi top hola koi le naramro garla. but have you ever heard of graduates from these colleges making it to **top 10** or even top 50 universities worldwide? Meanwhile, TU/KU toppers have gone on to **Harvard, Oxford**, and even the **top 20%** of their classes can get in **top 50 uni**.  For example, any student with four year bachelor degree can join Masters at **Harvard Extension School** (which is part of Harvard Uni). But a 3-year bachelor‚Äôs won‚Äôt qualify.(https://extension.harvard.edu/registration-admissions/degree-program-admissions/how-to-apply-to-a-graduate-degree-program/)  At the end of the day, it‚Äôs your choice - but before paying higher fees, compare the long-term recognition of TU/KU degrees. Going at foreign affiliated college means you were not able to get into a decent uni from your country with decent courses so you opted for such basic program.",

In today‚Äôs market, GPA barely matters. If you‚Äôve got the money and want more time to focus on work, foreign-affiliated degrees can be worth it. To be frank, if you can‚Äôt crack interviews or solve system design and LeetCode problems, no one cares where you studied or where you studied.|||I'll only speak for the masters part as that is prolly everyone's concern who is planing to choose their colleges after bachelors. People who study in UK colleges or EU colleges affiliated or not mostly have 3 years degree. The years for your bachelors does matter but just because u studied 3 years wont disqualify you during your interview process because I've seen people from UK colleges get into Stanford and Harvard, what will disqualify you is your colleges credit system. If your college doesn't give enough credits per subject then you cant apply to any uni period. And just because you are good in your studies or are top 2% or 1% in your class doesn't give you a seat in any ivy, its your impact in your society that matters.  But choosing a uni is a difficult subject, if someone has decided to study in a foreign affiliated uni do check the credit system, cause you never know they might just get 20 lakhs while you get nothing in return|||Yes they are shit most of the time the foreign university are not good for example westcliff uni which I have heard a lot of bad and negatives from the people studying there and the graduates.  Similar goes to the British college where the 3 years degree is modified into a 4 year one and people have to pay around 20 lakhs to get that degree.  It would be great if the foreign affiliate college were in top 100 or 50s , then the prices would be  some what justified but in this present time I think they are just a money grab scheme.|||Many students in Nepal choose foreign-affiliated colleges, and I think they do have some real advantages. The 3-year degree might look shorter, but that‚Äôs the international standard in places like the UK and Australia, and it helps you finish faster.  Moreover, many foreign affiliated colleges in Nepal are still new and where students go after their degree needs to be researched on further. Credit transfer huncha bhanne ni suneko ho maile.   In foreign uni Classes usually focus more on practical learning‚Äîprojects, case studies, internships‚Äîrather than just theory. Dherai thaau ma teachers haru pani foreign uni mai padheko huchan. That makes students more confident and job-ready. Also, the degree is recognized abroad, so if you want to apply for higher studies or work outside Nepal, it gives you an edge.  Having said this, Nepali university degrees are more rigorous no doubt but they do lack that practical exposure.   Of course, TU and KU are great, but foreign-affiliated colleges give you global exposure and a different style of education. At the end of the day, it depends on what you want for your future. Not every 18 year old wants to prepare for end of term examinations like in Nepali unis and not everyone wants to go to Harvard.|||My friend got an admission to LSE so depends on the person. Padhne environment chei xaina koi padhdainan afu padhyo vane degree ko value ramrai hunxa|||Foreign affiliated ma padhna haina hallina jane ta ho manche haru.|||After my +2 in 2019, when I went to Softwarica for counseling, with a companion who was preparing for IOM in NAME, that one Didi who did my counseling, turns out that she was also preparing for IOM and was just there because she got paid for that, which I think is a good thing, for her. They(she and my friend) started to talk about their field for some minutes after my counseling.|||I did a foreign affiliated University Degree and I am very happy with it.  TU ma 10000s student haru huncha, koi koi ta gai halchan ni top University haru ma. Your data is skewed.   College ko credit system anusar line ho Harvard le. 2,3,4,5 year matter gardaina k re.   I have 4 year equivalency in TU from 3 year Bachelors'.

I'm not saying all of them, but these foreign universities at least provide basic facilities that students deserve. People are choosing these universities for no hassle studying experiences, examination on time, and experience. Yes these are too expensive I agree that though.",
