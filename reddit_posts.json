            "body": "I just wanted to share something that‚Äôs been bothering me for a while.   My mom has been part of this thing called **Healthy Living Nepal** (which is under **Vestige**) for about **three years** now. They call it a ‚Äúdirect selling business,‚Äù but to me, it honestly looks like a straight-up MLM scam.  She spends around **Rs. 5000 every month** on their products and goes to their seminars. They keep telling her stuff like ‚Äúif you stay consistent, you‚Äôll earn more money than you can imagine ‚Äî you‚Äôll get a house, a car, you‚Äôll travel abroad.‚Äù   Sounds amazing, right? Except‚Ä¶ none of that ever actually happens.  She‚Äôs gone to India twice for their ‚Äúbusiness trips,‚Äù but both times **she paid for everything herself**. Nothing was sponsored by Vestige like they promised. And those trips didn‚Äôt even teach anything useful ‚Äî just hours of motivational speeches and people flexing about how rich they are.  The sad part is, these companies know exactly who to target.   They go after **middle-class families**, especially **women**, because they know people in that group are always looking for a way to earn extra money or do something meaningful. They use emotional manipulation ‚Äî saying things like ‚Äúthis business empowers women‚Äù or ‚Äúpeople who don‚Äôt believe in it just have a negative mindset.‚Äù  It‚Äôs honestly brainwashing. My mom has gotten so deep into it that she argues with our family whenever we question it. And she‚Äôs not the only one ‚Äî I‚Äôve seen so many people, especially women, completely fall into this trap.  Let‚Äôs be real ‚Äî only the top 1% actually make good money.   Everyone else keeps buying products every month, trying to ‚Äúrank up,‚Äù and ends up losing way more than they ever earn. It‚Äôs basically a **pyramid scheme disguised as a business opportunity**.  If you‚Äôre wondering whether to join something like Vestige or Healthy Living Nepal ‚Äî **don‚Äôt.**   Ask yourself this:  * Why do you have to *spend money* every month to ‚Äústay active‚Äù? * Why does your ‚Äúincome‚Äù depend on recruiting others instead of selling a product? * Why does everyone who questions it get labeled as ‚Äúnegative‚Äù?  This whole system runs on guilt and fake hope. It destroys trust within families, drains money, and leaves people with nothing but disappointment.  It breaks my heart to see good people ‚Äî especially hardworking mothers ‚Äî being taken advantage of like this.  So yeah, I‚Äôm calling it what it is: **a scam that hides behind motivational speeches and herbal products.**  If you know anyone caught in this cycle, try to show them facts instead of arguing.   Ask them to calculate how much they‚Äôve *spent vs earned*.   Sometimes that‚Äôs the only thing that makes them realize the truth.",

Many girls tend to date upward but also look for someone who can give them enough attention. These two qualities are often found in guys living abroad. They have a certain status to show off compared to local guys, and they usually have more free time to talk and connect. As a result, one such guy can often date multiple local girls at once, taking them out of the dating pool for local men.  Even among local guys, some flaunt their family‚Äôs generational wealth or money sent by relatives abroad, which also gives them an edge in dating. I know this might sound harsh, but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve observed and learned over time.|||[removed]|||Dating culture bigri sakyo Nepal ma ni.

            "body": "Hey everyone!  Do you have any hobbies that also serve as an income-generating source for you? It could be anything. I know some people who love drawing and sell their artwork, some who make TikToks, Reels and earn from it, others who crochet, edit videos, and many more creative things.  I am not talking about doing it full time, just something you genuinely enjoy that also brings in a bit of side income. I am planning something similar myself. I watch a lot of movies, and not just watch, I really enjoy talking about them, reading different interpretations, and exploring what others think. I also love reading books.  Lately, I have been thinking about creating content related to movies, books, and similar topics, and posting it on Instagram and other platforms. I know there are already lots of pages doing this, so the competition is quite high, but I feel like I can still bring something of my own. I have some ideas that I have been working on and giving time to.  And yes, even though I talked about money, it is not really about that for now. For me, it is more about learning, creating, and building something of my own. I want to explore this field, grow my skills, and slowly build a personal brand around what I love doing. Of course, if it goes well in the future, it would be amazing if it also becomes a good source of income.  So, how about you? Do you have any hobbies that are also helping you earn a little on the side or build something of your own?",

Kina beluki niskeki? Usko attitude nai farak cha. and so on|||Good timing, was just reading history and waves of feminism.   Extending on the swear words containing women related gaalis.   In a patriarchal society, men were seen as the protector of their family, they are supposed to protect their daughter and wife especially. So, when someone had to abuse a guy, he would target their vulnerable points, i.e. \"women\". So, it's more about the low points of men than directly women hating. Abusing their father or even their son would make a lower emotional impact than abusing their mothers, wife or daughters. Women were similarly called the R word and men the M word, across cultures.   I would say, writing this in your study about misogyny would be difficult to justify.  You could actually make a case about why women were seen as soft which made them targets and centre points of these abuses but you have to cover more nuances then, such as \"while the insults themselves were for men but they rely on degrading women\" which accounts for misogyny.   For your paper, my drafts are below.  1. Women are called \"dhevis\" which actually harm them more. It creates a definition of women in the mind of a misogynistic man about how a women should behave and yedi uni haru ley women lai \"dhevi\" jasto act garna laako dekhenan vane they are automatically a prostitute to them. Search \"medusa prostitute\" effect for more information.  2. Women are often praised with the word \"beautiful\" and rarely with \"intelligent\". This is one of the major problems i believe women face, the society conditions them to be a beauty, eye caching object and rewards them more when beautiful in contrast to a intelligent being.  Best of luck|||There are many Nepalese proverbs that are used to supress and degrade women, you might want to look into those.

All society norms and culture is created by man and is enforced by them as well. The core aspect here is control. Society especially man wants control. Lets suppose total freedom here is 100 percent. So our culture, morals, ethics and cultural values, traditions and practices are designed in such a way that gives 80 percent of freedom to male and 20 percent to female in order to control women in the name of tradition, culture,  ethics and moral. We are conditioned and brought up in a society that cage women to give freedom to man. And in today's morden world, women are having more freedom than in the past they used to have like say 40 percent.  So due to this Man's freedom reduced to 60 percent. Thus, society fears that they are losing control on women and its a kind of threat to the male ego.   I am not promoting any hatred toward Man/male but claiming women's power, freedom and rights which were buried long ago by the society in order to have control over them for their own benifits and ease. The reference is MANUSMRITI, those who haven't read this, please once read this ao called shastra and you'll know how pathetic it is. The root of all social evils and problems. Not everything in this shastra is relevant in today's context. Thus positive, realistic and equitable change is essential in the society. Not everything deserves to be carried forward in our generations. Necessary changes should be enforced because real spirituality and balance is living life with maximum satisfaction without hurting others.|||I don't think it's specific to Nepali.

The nepali account guided me for investing small money 12.5K. I was skeptical so I messaged other member in the group 1 girl replied ( may be there were alot of their own account ) . So the girl sent money and got cash back, like 5K in profit alog with 12.5K. So I did the same , omg 6 k profit. every day they will increase the amount nxt day it was 30K, did it again got 10k, another day 50K got 76. so I started paying my loans and other stuff. but when I saw 1 lakh. I was like na thanks. but other members posted they got money so I was like. I already have got some profit I will just have to add litle extra . so I added little extra . around 30k. now the system said you are lucky winner and want me to send another 600K to withdraw my money and bonus. I was now confirmed this was scam. So I requested I just want my regular money. but yea I know legal option is of no use as these people are abroad based and accounts are fake. I just want to warn others not to gamble. Though the loss for me was not very huge as I tried to invest lowest possible, many younger people may be tempted to invest money from their dad or family account . but don't do it. its a scam it will just get worst not good. anyone else fallen for this ?",

But in short countries like Nepal, you don't need to be as tall to stand out as in taller countries|||What makes a guy attractive is his honesty, emotional maturity and his emotional availability to people,  the empathy, the genuine care, affection and efforts makes him very unique and attractive regardless of other outer factors. And what matters is you and truly you and your emotions for that person whom you like. And don't forget your self respect too. i mean here is self respect and not the ego itself. And most importantly, what makes a man genuinely likeable is not his ego, status or money, its their emotional availability, empathy and self respect. If you posses these three things you are liked everywhere and genuinely respected too. There are few people who are heartless and narcissists too so beware of them and protect your self respect. Because being a genuine human is itself enough for respect. But for admiration, you need to earn this. but humanly respect is must and deserved by every human regardless of their age, gender, status and visible success or failure.

Yes this is ai generated for proper english and summarization.     Google **discovered** my pages but **wouldn‚Äôt index** them. After some digging, here‚Äôs what I found and how I fixed it.    # üí• The Problems  1. **404s on deep links** ‚Äì `/blog/post` returns 404 because GitHub Pages only serves static files. 2. **Empty HTML for crawlers** ‚Äì SPA loads `<div id=\"root\"></div>` first, no content. 3. **Bad meta tags** ‚Äì my build still used `localhost` URLs.  # üß© My Solution  Couldn‚Äôt use `react-snap` (React 19 issues), so I wrote a custom pre-rendering pipeline.  **Stack:** React 19 + Vite 7 + Puppeteer 24 + GitHub Pages  **Key steps**  * **404.html redirect hack:** custom file that redirects `/blog/post` ‚Üí `/?redirect=/blog/post`, React then restores the route with `history.replaceState`. * **Puppeteer pre-rendering:** after build, launches a headless browser, visits each route, waits for render, saves full HTML to `dist/blog/{slug}/index.html`. * **Auto sitemap:** built from my blog data array.  **Build pipeline:**      npm run deploy     ‚Üí vite build     ‚Üí puppeteer pre-render (13 routes ‚âà30 s)     ‚Üí generate sitemap     ‚Üí gh-pages -d dist       # ‚úÖ Results  * Every page now has full HTML before hydration * Google shows ‚ÄúPage can be indexed‚Äù * Deep links work (no 404s) * Correct canonical + OG tags * 13 routes built in \\~30 s  # üîç What I‚Äôm Asking  1. **Scaling:** Pre-render is sequential (2‚Äì3 s / route). Ideas for parallel or incremental builds? 2. **Content storage:** Posts currently in one JS array ‚Äî split JSON per post or use a CMS? 3. **Approach:** Is Puppeteer pre-rendering worth it vs moving to Next.js / Remix? 4. **SEO:** What else should I add beyond sitemap + OG + canonical + JSON-LD?",

For parents and in general in Nepal, fons which can be repaired easily are good in general. In that case Samsung fons are most repairable and easy to find parts in Nepal. It's better that fon does not break but that's like saying everything is forever. Samsung it is.  Also better you give them options.   There is psychological satisfaction in giving them options to choose thing personally.|||Infinix Note 50s   I have GT 30 and it is good phone|||extend your budget and get cmf 2 pro. Good all rounder for 35k.|||Bruh this guy|||Forget the screen stuff focus on processor|||If you want decent performance than go with note 50s, Samsung has shit processor   If you care about camera more, Samsung would be better.  I had the same dilemma a month ago on same price range and decided on Redmi note 14 5g, loved the 144hz and is smooth in everything, camera has OIS and is decent. The downside would be bit of bloatware and ads here and there, which you can easily disable.|||Depends on how old your dad is and how much he understands tech. For me I would go with Samsung the OS is just too easy. Looking into specs won't matter if they arent that tech savy. Get a phone which is repairable easy to use and reliable. My grandpa had got a OP Nord the 25k one few years back and the software is bad. There are good built it apps for samsung that Samsung provides that may be missing on other OS. Like for the nord phone there was no music player app, I had to install Third party app and they all have ads and its hard to use. So keep those knto considerations as well.|||if you want earlier version then redmi14 5G is good and if you are okay with slightly older version, still not much older redmi.note 13 5G don't buy infinix , as samsung only have UI good , I don't feel anything is good about Samsung.|||Dude looking like your Dad is hardcore Gamer|||Zenfone aka fon. don't follow the crowd dumb fuck|||Ma sanga A15 chai xa.

My mental health was worse from the age of 11 because of my family problems, daddy issues,got sexually assaulted by my own cousins etc.  Teti bela ma I started talking to him coz I didn't had any friends in my school I was pretty low-key type ko keti basically ekalghatey.  When I firs started talking to him we talked about hobbies and many interests of ours.It was my first time taking to a guy like that later he proposed me and I accepted after 2 days he kissed me for the first time ik it's cringe but bare with me. Ani I was really surprised coz I didn't know people do that vanera.  Later after days he went on opening my clothes forcefully which was really traumatizing coz I really didn't did nothing I just standed there powerless.  After some days he started to force me to do that deed as a kid I didn't know what is love I thought If I did that to him maybe he'll love me.I thought I'll feel loved if I did it with him. But after sometime he ghosted me.  Later he came again begging me then I took him coz I was a pathetic bitch and I'm still pathetic as fuck. But after sometime he ghosted me.  Later he came again begging me then I took him coz I was a pathetic bitch and I'm still pathetic as fuck.  Did it more than 30 times but you know what I never feel loved like a real love. Was in physical relationship for 3 years but I never felt loved  He use to talk to me if he wants to do the deed after doing the deed used to ghost me.  Still silly me thought that was love coz I've never been loved by anyone in this life.  Later I ghosted him.I hate my body I hate everything sometimes I feel pity for myself how my body was used as a toy. But I am pathetic as fuck I can't do nothing about it now I'm just stuck in my room sitting and doing nothing depressed.  To leave all of this I wanted to leave the country too but unfortunately my visa also got rejected.  Now I'm just sitting here ambition less feeling gross and all.  Worst part?  I got addiod doing that thing I turned into a hypersexual bitch.  Maybe I wasn't meant to be born.  Sometimes I think why my parents didn't abort me if they had this day wouldn't have to come. They themselves say this to me every morning. I don't want to live not because of him because of all career, family, personal issues going in my life I feel like I'll never be able to move on.",

Baburam le French nodel hunu parxa vanexa...  \"Before 1958, France‚Äôs Fourth Republic operated under a parliamentary system where the Prime Minister, chosen by parliament rather than the people, held executive power. However, the system was marked by severe political instability‚Äîin just twelve years, France saw over twenty different governments, with prime ministers often lasting only a few months. This constant turnover made it difficult to govern effectively, especially during crises like the Algerian War.  In 1958, amid growing chaos, Charles de Gaulle returned to power and introduced a new constitution, creating the Fifth Republic. This established a strong presidency and a semi-presidential system, and after a 1962 referendum, the president began to be elected directly by the people, ensuring greater stability and executive authority.\"  I think hamro situation ni estai xa... The President's system worked in France, it might work here as well (again, not saying it's replicable).. We can conduct a referendum for it. But, France went through hell due to this parliamentary model, army le coup garne warning ni deko thiyo...  I think it's a better model, if with proper check and balance.

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can‚Äôt get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

There are 0 to none scholarships for international students in the UK. Medicine jhan is  designed for UK residents only. If you were to (suppose) get a conditional offer, then you are expected to pay all your fees on your own! They only let few international students in this course in the hopes of making profit. So sorry to say but this isn't realistic.  Ani, the hours you can work as an international student CANNOT even pay off your living expenses; let alone school fees considering medicine is the most costly of them all (around 15- 20k pounds I believe per year). So if you can afford spending 500k pounds for just the fees for 6 years of medical school (not even considering the average cost of living) then sure, shoot your shot. This isn't the US. You aren't given full rides or scholarships. You need to be realistic.   MBBS Nepal ma padha then you can try going to the UK. Tyo ni you are expected to hold an MD to get a basic physician job in the UK. Good luck.|||UK ma ramro xainna|||lmao the uk is absolutely cooked, notorious for being stupidly expensive for international students and the work to pay ratio is terrible.  Medicine isnt just pricey, its one of the most expensive and difficult degrees to get. Especially with the intense coursework. Medicine isnt a joke.  Your not seeing this realistically, if ur family cant support u financially with tuition as well as rent, ur cooked. Food is expensive, rent is expensive, tuition is expensive.  Honestly if u want better consulting for medicine or maybe even an easier time studying or a support system just join an alevels program in nepal, rbs/stxaviers r the best bang for ur buck",

No confirmed sighting.   No verified proof of life.   No closure.      Two years have passed; two years of waiting, diplomatic efforts, and hope refusing to fade.      Today, reports have emerged suggesting he may no longer be alive.   But even now, there is no definitive evidence; only assessments, assumptions, and silence.      His family still holds on.   Nepal still waits.   And many of us wonder: how different might things have been?      If Bipin were from a more powerful nation, would the world have moved faster?   If he held a different passport, would there be answers by now?   If every life were valued equal, would this post even need to exist?      Bipin‚Äôs story is not just one of tragedy.   It is a reflection of how quiet lives are often overlooked,   how conflict steals not just people, but peace itself.      We continue to hope.   We continue to speak.   Because silence is not an option.",

They called the ‚Äúearn and learn‚Äù program an internship, likely just to bypass foreign employment laws. In reality, it was pure exploitation. From what I‚Äôve read, students were made to work five days a week in questionable conditions and study only one. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.  I just hope this changes with the new government.|||i thought hamas was fighting gaza right after they kill him i think they just sick isreal PM both are shit they just want control people.. fucking hate hamas|||I'm Israeli, sadly his DNA was diagnosed and was believed to die in the first months of the war R.I.P Bipin|||Vayo vayo pugyo,  He is dead, confirmed by Israel and hamas both.

Over time, they blended with Magars, Gurungs, Tamangs, Tharus, Newars, Rai, Limbu  everyone. Nepal‚Äôs always been a crossroads, not one ethnicity.  Even though most of us are Hindu, our culture feels different  the way we celebrate Dashain and Tihar, our food, our family values. Historically, Nepal meant the Kathmandu Valley, the Newar homeland, while the hills were a buffer between Tibet and the plains. Our roots have always been both Indo-Aryan and Tibeto-Burman.  I get what the OP means in a modern sense, Nepali and Indian identities are different. I studied in India, and the culture there feels more urban, loud, individualistic, while Nepal‚Äôs is quieter, collective, shaped by the mountains.  India itself is diverse Kashmiri to Tamil, Kerala Muslim to Bengali Muslim, Bihari to Rajput   all different. It‚Äôs a republic of many ethnic states the struggle for Gorkhaland in Darjeeling was just that a struggle for an ethno state.   So when people say ‚ÄúIndian influence,‚Äù I don‚Äôt get it. We share civilizational ties, sure but Nepal isn‚Äôt India, and India isn‚Äôt one thing either.|||Hmm I am from Uttarakhand and I could say along with Himachal Pradesh the Hilly cultures are similar but the planer ganga yamuna belt is quiet different from us as well.|||lol the differences that you are talking about can be seen from one Indian state to another, India itself does not have one common way of celebrating Dashain or Tihar, common social values, food tradition, etc. No matter how much we try to differentiate ourselves from Indians that's the most similar we are to any other country.|||   India is diverse in the sense that you have every kind of caste and race living in the same country, but in separate states and with different languages. In Nepal, though, people live under the same roof, speak almost the same language, and nobody finds it weird¬† like a Gurung family living right beside a Newar family and all.  Also, in Nepal, the garbage truck comes every week, so we all go out together to throw our trash. But in India, that‚Äôs not so common. It‚Äôs kind of a Nepali national culture now¬† your mom screaming, ‚ÄúThrow the garbage! The truck‚Äôs here!‚Äù üòÑ|||India itself is diverse. There's no general indian. So yeah some part of India be similar to you. Not whole india cause there's no universal culture in India.|||It just shows how little you know about India.  India is one of the most diverse countries in the world.   The culture of Uttarakhand is indistinguishable from the culture of Sudurpaschim and adjacent regions.   Same goes with culture of Sikkhim, Bengal and Eastern Nepal.   Your definition of Nepal is very narrow and shows that you only think of Terai and Madesh as different while the rest of Nepal as a monolith.|||Why do you think only Madesh has similar culutre to India? We all celebrate Dashain and Tihar(dfferent reason and rituals). Our family values are similar when it comes to education, marriage and relatives and elders. Our spending patterns are similar. Our language in structure are also similar. (Compare nepali to chinese or english that would be different).    India itself is a diverse country which makes it impossible to generalise it. So comparing nepal to one part of India is a statistical error. As Nepal borders with Tibet, its influence is observed in our culture and becasue Northern Nepal is hilly contrast to plains in south, lifestyle changes to adapt to it. But it is again similar to people in Uttarakhand or Northeast India.|||Compared to everyone else like west, China, Pakistan and stuff. Our culture is more similar. Maybe that is the reason.|||Because Nepalese copies indians and indian culture, it's that simple. Just like India people here are also brainrot. While india politics divide people by religion and here also politicians divide people based on parties and biasness. South Asia is Backwards Comparing other. Literacy rate is down, people are divided, education is crime here, Leaders are Clown and People are slaves|||Depends on what part of India you are referring to? India is extremely diverse and Nepali culture - as it is - is more similar to Indian Culture than culture can be between different parts of India. Remember, the India we think of today is British India, but before that Nepal was no different than any other kingdom in the Indian subcontinent. Our festivals, rituals and customs are the same with superficial regional differences. Buddha and Sita both associated with India were Nepali. We are the same people, same broad culture just different nationalities.|||To everyone else not in India and Nepal, you are exactly the same.|||because we share almost same religion, culture, languages, foods, festivals, etc and etc... plus an open border with zero security and surveillance  because the so called Nepalese hate Madheshi due to these sharing characters   because most of the politicians did their Alma Mater from Indian universities   because we enjoy Indian movies   because we lack civic sense like as Indian  because Nepal does its business mostly from India  etc  etc||| Because we are? If you were to choose one culture that we are most similar with, which one would you choose?   The areas near India will have cultural ties with Indian states that are near Nepal; thats how most countries work. Would you not say Korean or Japanese culture is similar to Chinese?   Iswtg most of these sentiments come from insecurity. Just be proud of being Nepalese.|||I am from Terai, only those who are from Mithila and Bhojpuri culture share similarity and that too only with the Mithila and other similar cultures of the India, not to the entirety of India.  Plus, why do most Nepalese think that Madhesi are entirely of Terai region?? ü§¶ü§¶|||People often compare castes and culture on internet but the real world is totally different i believe 99% of such posts are meant for mindless timepass.

They even block posts labeled ‚ÄúDiscussion‚Äù about politics, saying it should be tagged ‚ÄúPolitics‚Äù instead ‚Äî all because of their personal bias or interest.  Thirdly, If I was a current mod, I would delete this post and say that this flair is not an \"announcement\", and misguide the uploader to say it  is a \"rant\" or \"politics\", and if you would have posted a video in this announcement...i would say it should be labeled \"video\" and not \"announcement\". /s|||I think mods should run for election.

            "body": "Hello guys, I travel alot and here are some tips i collected from my experience to get cheap flights and save cost in travel.   1. Don‚Äôt book to KTM, book round trip to and from Delhi and do self transfer(meaning get separate ticket to delhi to ktm). Usually it unlocks more number of airlines and likely to get a cheaper deal.   Same applies to cheap destinations like Thailand. You can get an e visa easily and then do self transfer there as well. It costs $35 dollars for e-visa but you will get better deals in flights. Also thai air asia launched flights to BWA as well, so people going to western nepal, this could be better option.  this wont show in google flights cause it requires visa but its very easy to get.   recently i had booked usa - bangkok - usa (two way) and then bangkok - nepal - bangkok(two way) making usa-nepal round trip under $700. including two single entry visa $70.  2. Websites like skiplagged or sky scanner shows you the most optimal flights based on prices and duration, but remember to not book it from there. only use them to see prices. Use the official website to book.    3. never search up flights in official websites unless you are going to book cause the moment you will close the tab, they will price hike it. thats why use other third party or incognito google flights to do price search.   4. international students can get discount if you use student universe app (now called byo jet or sthm like that). you need to verify yourself as student tho. but remember that your credit card cashback will only be  1% if you use this. but if you had used official website, it could be upto 5%. so calculate this and only use student universe discount if it is cheaper than normal cashback.   5. if you dont have a travel credit card, apple cash (tap pay) (if you are iphone user) works with no foreign transaction fee anywhere in the world. it does not have cashback tho but you can use it to pay anything outside your country. works in nepal too, bhatbhateni, restaurants, daraz delivery, etc. exchange rate is realtime price.   6. domestic flights during festivals, when flights to and from ktm is expensive, you can try to do alternative airports as well.   example. this dashain, ktm to bhairahawa was 8500 but KTM to Pokhara was 4200, and Pokhara to Bhairahawa was 3200. total 1100 cheaper. I did this and chilled in pokhara with my friends for 2 hours (layover lol). (this is subjective and prices are subject to change. just giving you idea to look for options cause there are flights from pokhara to/from bhairahawa, bharatpur and nepalgunj).",

Also skyscanner has an option to use flexible date or even select a month for departure and return and then you can select different dates to see which combination will have the cheapest option.   Also to add what OP as listed. When you transfer make sure to check your luggage options. For example - you bought 2 different tickets, and self transferring in Delhi. Make sure that the Delhi to KTM leg has the same luggage options. Your flight between the USA and Delhi will probably have 2x23 kg check in luggage and you used both. But usually the DEL-KTM leg will only have 20 kg or something like that. You will have to pay for rest or perhaps buy second baggage. Also you will have to collect your luggage , pass through immigration and then re check in. Make sure to have a good amount of time.   Also if your first leg gets delayed/canceled, you might miss your second leg and airline is not responsible so it's important to give yourself time.   This is a good option if you travel light or alone. What OP has suggested is a good travel hack.   For skiplag, most of the time you need to travel with carry on only since you are likely to skip the second leg.|||Indian Airport ma Nepali ko lagi NOC haru chaine testo kei ta hudaina ni?

It is disappointing and frustrating that the so called student unions of Yemale, Congress and Maobadi remained silent without putting any pressure on the government or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take any actions. They were too busy licking their political fathers, grandfathers and bhaujus shoes.  Saw some former parliamentarians shamelessly posting in their social medias condolences now. They were in power for literally the whole freaking time to intervene and at least ask diplomats or embassy to at least try with some efforts.  We as a nation have failed. As our grandfathers used to say Sati le sarapeko desh, it feels truer with each passing day.  I‚Äôm not the Rajabadi, but at least king would try and not let his citizen get kidnapped for 2 years and murdered unless these heartless mfs.",

I'm currently juggling a small low-paying project alongside a few higher-paying student final-year projects from Australia (using MERN).  The thing is, I'm already feeling the **MERN saturation**. I'm finding it tough to land solid fresher jobs, so I know I need to learn something new on the side for better long-term security and income.  I've narrowed it down to two options, but I'm totally open to other suggestions:  1. **Solana (Web3/Blockchain):**    * I see huge buzz following **100xDevs** and **Superteam Nepal/India**. The money looks fantastic right now.    * **Goal:** Chase the high-paying, less-crowded early market. 2. **AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning):**    * This is obviously massive and seems like the safer, more secure bet for the next few decades.    * **Goal:** Maximum long-term job security and high income potential.  **The ultimate goal is money and security.** I'm leaning towards Solana because of the immediate high pay I see, but AI/ML feels more stable.  **Which path makes more sense for a developer who is self-learning and needs to be market-ready ASAP? Any other tech stacks I should be looking at?**   **also I hear a lot about rust and golang buzz also tell me about that also learning is not an issue to me I can learn things quick like I have been a good learner and good student as well so.. also like or should I go in Devops ,Nuxt and things like that a lot of buzz very very confused every other post in X and every other yotube video keeps on confusing me**",

What do you have to tell about this ? Love is never impure and childhood love NEVERR.. it is just that society hates people who truly love. Because society wants control and love has that power to go beyond any boundaries. Thus they break hearts who truly belonged to each other. Neither caste nor religion can confine love or any close relation despite your (immediate family members like siblings,  uncles, aunts or 1st cousins (in most of the cultures) and marriage is not always about producing child but core is to find a suitable partner with whom you desire spend your whole life with. If sex and children were only the reason to get married then homosexual relationships or marriages should never happen right!? society had always tried to confine and condition love whereas love is usually spontaneous and unconditional and can happen with anyone . But Choice is always yours . So choose your path carefully:-   If you have more of an endurance capability--> choose your cultural values and societal rules and protect your external peace over internal harmony where you must face pain when you have to suppress your emotions and live in silent suffering. GOD SHREERAM'S PATH   OR   if you have more of a courage--> choose your love and internal peace over external conflict you must have to face for violating societal or cultural rules called taboo. GOD SHREEKRISHNA'S PATH.   See, nothing is superior,  love or duty. Both are sacred and you should choose  one thing and overcome your indecisiveness .. either duty or love , you must choose as per your soul's capability i.e  either sacrificing your love in exchange of external peace. (Endurance) ( go with this route,  if you believe or think you can supress your emotions for the rest of your life and can digest silent suffering)   Or,  Embracing love you desire at the cost of your external peace. ( if you don't care what society thinks and are courageous enough ,go with this route )   Both paths involves hurdles and suffering either internal or external.  Choice is yours that which can you digest. God is there and he'll obviously help you in your journey.|||bro went from saiya to vaiya real quick|||Are you Kumai Bahun?

I know current governement wont investigate genz \"leaders\" but next gov should launch serious investigations on these people as well. Though one might argue at there is difference between violence caused by those in power and those fighting against people in power but even then accountability doesnt just vanishes, this is the reason ghost of 17k still looms over prachanda, prachanda was also fighting for \"people\" but he is still accused of being a mass murderer, gyanendra shah is as much of a murderer as is prachanda. But this point isnt brought up as much, when discussing the civil war. There is also a lot of opportunism, people who werent part of protest have started claiming its leadership, next gov should also launch serious investigation in these regard to punish those who are trying to destablise nepal in name of various agendas.

I‚Äôm done with the ‚ÄúIslam is peace‚Äù myth and the ‚ÄúFree Palestine‚Äù crowd‚Äôs fake outrage. They scream ‚ÄúIslamophobia‚Äù when we call out their double standards, mocking our gods, memeing Hindu deities, dismissing Jesus as ‚Äújust a prophet,‚Äù while demanding respect for their ‚Äúfinal‚Äù religion. Look at the UK: Muslim grooming gangs in Rotherham, Rochdale, and more raped thousands of girls, 1,400 in Rotherham alone, protected for years because officials feared ‚Äúracism‚Äù accusations. Muslims defend it saying, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not Islam, just radicals!‚Äù But dodging the problem is the problem. Ignoring the pattern, jihad, Sharia demands, 2.9 kids per Muslim woman vs. 1.6 for natives, lets this fester.  The ‚ÄúFree Palestine‚Äù posers? Silent on Bangladesh Hindus raped and displaced, Boko Haram‚Äôs 35,000+ murdered Nigerian Christians, or Yazidis and Kurds erased by ISIS. Middle Eastern Christians? Down 90% from bombings and beheadings. No hashtags for them or Bipin, just trendy anti-Israel chants. Islam‚Äôs radicals push ‚Äúfinal truth‚Äù and jihad, yet apologists pretend it‚Äôs all a misunderstanding. That denial got Bipin killed, lets grooming gangs thrive, and leaves our temples trashed. Nepal deserves better.  TL;DR: Bipin‚Äôs death, UK grooming gangs, and Islam‚Äôs defenders ignoring ‚Äúradicals‚Äù expose the hypocrisy, while ‚ÄúFree Palestine‚Äù fakes ignore Hindu, Christian, and minority genocides.

Fk the hypocrites fk Trump ani f*k all the so-called peacekeepers playing politics while our people die.  We will never forget how the Nepali government back then tyo randi ‡§Ü‡§∞‡§ú‡•Å ‡§∞‡§æ‡§£‡§æ, ‡§¶‡•á‡§â‡§µ‡§æ at the Foreign Ministry  along with so-called hypocrites like Trump, the Islamic Hamas and Israel‚Äôs diplomatic games all played their cards to let Bipin Joshi be lost.|||**They¬†may say that Islam is a peaceful religion. I don‚Äôt know the exact philosophy of the religion or the teachings of the Quran, but based on what I see in many Islamic countries and among some Muslim communities, Islam is the most violent and intolerant religion in the world. Muslims struggle to coexist peacefully with other religions and never accept religious diversity (The same case with the Nepali Converted Chsitian, they cannot accept the Hindus and Hindus festival whereas those Foreigner who have been practicing Christianity since Century do no have any Obligation to celebrate and take part in different festival and celebration of different religion)**  In many non-Muslim majority countries, Islam is allowed to grow and Muslims are free to practice their religion. But in many Islamic-majority countries, the population of other religions often declines over time, sometimes due to violence, forced conversions, or systemic discrimination. For example, just look at the religious demographics of Pakistan 40‚Äì50 years ago compared to today.  In Europe and North America, Muslims frequently protest and express their views against the Ruling people and religion too, often quite aggressively. But can you imagine Hindus, Christians, or Buddhists openly protesting against Islamic leaders or Islamic policies in Islamic countries? It would likely result in severe consequences or violence.  In Nepal too, while Muslims may seem peaceful now, it‚Äôs worth noting that the long-settled Muslim communities (who have been here since the time of Prithvi Narayan Shah, when they were brought in for weapon-making and other skilled work) have generally coexisted peacefully. However, the more recent or growing Muslim population seems peaceful possibly only because they are still a very small minority.¬† Lets jus see if their population ever reaches 10‚Äì15%, there could be a rise in communal tensions or violence.  **This is not a hate-filled statement, just an observation based on patterns seen in various parts of the world. I am expressing what I see and fear, based on history and current events.**|||Finally someone makes sense.  RESITANCE DOESN'T MEAN KILLING INNOCENT PEOPLE. Islamists will only play the victim card in a place where they are in the minority. Look at the situation of minorites in Pakistan and Bangladesh and you'll know why Indians are afraid of the rapid influx of illegal Muslims . Nepal should be worried a lot more .|||It's true I don't know why progressives support these far right extremists, victims don't prey on innocent people, Hamas deliberately targeted and killed 10 nepalis then took bipin hostage holding him in sub-human conditions for months or years and letting him die in that sh*thole called Gaza. He or Nepal has nothing to do with their struggle nor do we have anything that could help them. It's just that Hamas and their supporters looked at these nepalis and did not see them as human beings.|||selective presentation, misrepresentation, outright falsities, whataboutism, and a willful omission of Israel's historical and ongoing crimes and provocations contributing to the volatile situation in the middle east, let alone the broader historical and geopolitical context - yep this is simply a parroting of far-right and islamophobic talking points.  No, the tears for \"Free Palestine\" and the genocided population of Gaza aren't fake, they are as real as the tears we shed for Bipin Joshi.|||Bipin joshi matra haina aru 10 jana nepali lai ni mareko thiyo.

Maybe you can try to be less idiot and read [this](https://www.marxists.org/archive/gandhy/2001/00001.htm) so you can begin to understand the role of the 3 major religious fundamentalism in ostensibly shaping world conflicts (remember wars are **never** *really* fought over fictitious gods, it's always resources. True, even for those who **fought** thinking they were fighting for other reasons as they are mostly not the ones getting the resources either way, thus, the reason must be made for them. As evident in this quarreling thread.)|||You should ask the orthodox Jews in Israel who are in government, the supporters of Likuud Party what they think of \"our Hindu religion and our gods\". Lol. Hamas actually offered to release all hostages and Israeli government refused because they had bigger plans.

War and violence in general is bad. I don't say what hamas is doing is right or good but for the people of Gaza they are their saviour. Kids and women are being killed in Gaza. Kids who didn't chose to be Muslim. Noone is born religious without it being labeled or forced. They have done nothing wrong. Women are tormented and suppressed by religion. What's happening is not their fault. And if USA and pet Israel had announced ceasefire many Israeli and Palestinian children would have been saved.|||shalom|||Bipin Joshi and those 12 in Iraq !! Bachunjel birsinna|||The media - well, much more so \"Western\" media - have been doing a much better job of giving us a \"media blackout\" regarding ISIS, al-Qaeda, Al-Nusra / Jabhat al-Nusra / Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), and Boko Haram especially the past few years (and just about always with regards to Boko Haram) compared to what's going on in Israel/Palestine or else I'm sure there'd be wayyy more condemnation about all those groups and their atrocities too.  That doesn't surprise me at all though especially because of the covert (and sometimes even overt) backing - financially, logistically, militarily, intelligence, etc. - those terrorist groups receive from some nations - especially (but certainly not limited to) the US and Israel.  In short, the lack of coverage isn‚Äôt just neglect, it‚Äôs structural. It reflects editorial priorities shaped by political alliances, audience demand, and the need to protect state narratives.|||Well, I am a straight right leaning Christian. What Isreal's government has been doing to Palestinians since 2020, is objectively a genocide, and we Americans are tired of funding their war efforts, heck we don't feed the impoverished and homeless here in the states, but we can fund a stupid war? Both sides are wrong, Hamas and Isreal's government. Both should be brought to justice, and both need to give us our damn money back.   Listen up, over 50k innocent Palestanians have died, mainly women and children, they didn't deserve that. The people on Oct 7 didn't deserve that either. Screw Hamas, and screw Netanyanhu. Put these monsters in jail where they belong and remove Isreal's entire government and arrest the IDF bombers as well. By force, if necessary. America before the 60s wouldn't have funded this crap, neither any European entity/country.  Yes there are other genocides, yes Christians are being genocided in The Middle East/Africa, yes there's radical Islamists, yes there are rising crime rates in the UK ETC. This should all be addressed, and CAN all be addressed. Empathy doesn't have a limit and its not situational, or else its not empathy. None of that excuses what Isreal's government body has done!!

We belong from upper dolpa yet our ancestor where from tibet. But after king prithivi narayan shah united the nation our home came under the great nepal too. We have our own caste similar to tibetan. But yet we have to use \"gurung\" word in our citizen ship. Im not saying like im not happy with that but uts important that person must live with his or her real identity. Instead of adopting others. When i say im gurung from dolpa. Most people wont even agree on this. Last time i saw a video there was one scholar or expereinced one saying there are two type of \"gurung\" one who is mainland gurung which is located in pokhara side and other who comes from tibet side like paila mongol dekhe ayera base ko vandai thio. And in that videos comment real land gurung werent happy with that. So that made me think twice. Since we all came under nepals map. We follow every rule by nepals goverment. Dont we have a right of our own identity ? Even though i havent faced a racism like that in real. But looking at the point from bigger lvl our goverment have to look after this problem too üòÑ in future chinese le upper dolpa hmro ho and it was once part of tibet vandai ayo vane goverment le k garne ?? They arent even aware of this comimg. In upper dolpo we usually do busniess from chinese more than nepali. Cause its cheaper and better. Plus nepali goverment hasnt even been able to light up our home till now. No electrcity, no job offer, no proper health care, no proper road, we still stayed silient till this date. People wont stay quite forever. Goverment must look into this problem properly. Without proper health care once in a 4 to 5 familys child fie in mothers womb.

But if timi smart chau but testo ekdamm khatrai wala din ratt navani hardwork nagarne thikka thikka chaine level ma chau vaney farak pardaina. Valley ko college haru ko terminal exam out of valley vanda dheraii garo huncha. Question dekhauna lai matra vayeni standard banaune prachaln chaa. So timi pass huna nai mehenat garnu parcha. So ultimately hardwork garne bani, boarda ma ramro ani competitive exam ma result ramro aako dekhincha.    Now comes the real part, should you be worried valley vitra napdhera? A big NO. Ramro sanga mehenat gara, textbook padhne bani basala, note vaneko revise garna lai ho, padhne book batai ho, time milayera eso valley ko clgs like kmc, trinity, ccrc haruko paper hernu, practice garnu.

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can‚Äôt get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

No confirmed sighting.   No verified proof of life.   No closure.      Two years have passed; two years of waiting, diplomatic efforts, and hope refusing to fade.      Today, reports have emerged suggesting he may no longer be alive.   But even now, there is no definitive evidence; only assessments, assumptions, and silence.      His family still holds on.   Nepal still waits.   And many of us wonder: how different might things have been?      If Bipin were from a more powerful nation, would the world have moved faster?   If he held a different passport, would there be answers by now?   If every life were valued equal, would this post even need to exist?      Bipin‚Äôs story is not just one of tragedy.

They called the ‚Äúearn and learn‚Äù program an internship, likely just to bypass foreign employment laws. In reality, it was pure exploitation. From what I‚Äôve read, students were made to work five days a week in questionable conditions and study only one. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.  I just hope this changes with the new government.|||i thought hamas was fighting gaza right after they kill him i think they just sick isreal PM both are shit they just want control people.. fucking hate hamas|||I'm Israeli, sadly his DNA was diagnosed and was believed to die in the first months of the war R.I.P Bipin|||Vayo vayo pugyo,  He is dead, confirmed by Israel and hamas both.

This affectes every country in south Asia including Nepal. That's a problem we should solve. IT's gradually under control I guess.|||Google Bangladesh. And let me know if you found the answer|||Don‚Äôt look up bangladesh/australia. Nepal has average population density.|||Population in SE Asia seems to be quite high in general. I think regarding your question about where the population is concentrated, you will find that the population is scattered throughout the country - everywhere minus above 3000m up the himalayas. Then if you do a deep assessment what % of Perus Land actually has people vs % of Nepal where people reside, you may find the two land sizes may not be off by a magnitude like now when you compare the full size of the country. For eg UK has a landmass of 250k but has a population of 69 mil. That's 2x population of Peru in 1/5th of land. In the other hand australia has a population of 27mil in 7.7mil km2. Russia has 143mil people in 17mil km2 (4x Pop of Peru in 16x land area).  You are also looking at the mercader projection which further makes Nepal look more visually small in the map. Not that it should have any basis when you talk about numbers.   I suppose what I am trying to say is the population may still be high in Nepal but it may not be as high as you think when you factor in livable land in the country. Total land mass alone is not a great indicator.|||Fertile land, fertile people, most are on terai belt. Look at india and bangladesh, how densely populated they all are.

It calculated on a flat, two-dimensional plane, not by measuring the surface area of its mountains, hills, and valleys. The total land area of a country is determined by projecting its borders onto a standardized reference surface, typically an ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the Earth.      Nepal is roughly a \\~1000 km long, and 150 km wide and so the approximate area of 150 sq km.   Now if you count the mountains and valleys that covers like 70% of that 2D area, the actual habitable space is order of magnitide larger. maybe even 50x.   So the actual living space is quite a lot for mountainous country like Nepal. I would imagine same for Peru.|||You know about canada?|||You should have started with Bangladesh and it's population density.  Regardless, depends on how fertile and navigable the lands are.

Or they might have already made up their mind on not hiring you or they could have decided on other candidate already and took your interview cos it was on their calendar|||Why go to work under indian companies then ??|||One of the worst interviewer's are indian fr idk can't even pass a simple smile soo rudee so annoying kati pelxa xya|||Always avoid south asians!|||Tip - dont apply for an indian company simply.|||ü§£ i had also experienced giving an Interview.

I had to keep rescheduling cause the guy who was supposed to take the interview was busy. They finally scheduled me on day where I had to be at my office and couldn't offer any other time.

So there was this post by a user named TastyMarketing47 in Tech Buy/Sell offering GPT Plus at Rs.699/month or Rs. 1000/3 months(claiming ‚Äúpay after getting the product in your own email‚Äù).  He had written a long convincing description saying things like:  > ‚ÄúScam ho vannu vanda agadi read: I buy from Vietnam promotional offer and sell it here with Rs.200 profit per account. The price is cheaper than Toolsmandu (999) because of the Vietnam offer. Search it up.‚Äù   Sounded somewhat believable, so I messaged him. He acted very genuine ‚Äî said ‚Äúno need to pay before getting access,‚Äù and even added me to some kind of Oxaam workspace.  It actually worked for about 30 minutes, then I got logged out. Tried refreshing, logging in again, clearing cookies ‚Äî nothing worked. I messaged him, and he replied once saying he‚Äôs ‚Äúsorting it out for all clients ,‚Äù but after that ‚Äî no reply, I checked post too deleted, and he disappeared.  I‚Äôve attached screenshots below ‚Äî just sharing this as a lesson for everyone. If the price looks too good to be true, it probably is.  Stay safe guys üôè",

The projects will need to show extraordinary level of depth in whatever field you want to pursue. A simple webapp, or a mobile app wont suffice.

The widget of nepali date is what sold me. The UI looks clean.

I hope you keep improving and adding new features !|||Tried it. Looks good.   One thing that i felt redundant was the popup layout when seeking other dates.

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. üò≠üò≠2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye üò≠|||[deleted]|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

Because there was no one to guide me, i failed this year's neb board.   so from someone who learned from his own experience, my best advice is that you don't depend only on teachers from your school. there are tons of videos on youtube and tons of notes and  straight up answers in the internet.   if you do not understand and get anything at all, then only focus on the questions that are asked many times or repeated i.e only imp questions.   you have to make sure that you atleast passing marks, so look focus on the chapters you understand and master them first then only focus on others.   You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

Even after taking reexam on both, i don't think i will pass. because of me failing on my exams, my mother and entire relatives blame me that i didn't try hard enough, didn't study and other similar things. my mother calls me a faliure, that i destroyed her dreams and i brought her nothing but pain etc etc.       i tried , i tried to focus on class, watched youtube, searched notes, asked the topper friends what they did at home and studied. heck, because of that tension and stress my hair started falling out, at age 17.    i was not even a bad student before. i even got A on SEE.       when choosing what to study, my friends choose management, but following the WISHES of my family and relatives, i choose science. after a week, i told her that i find science hard but she said just \"**The admission money is already paid and is only half can be refunded**\" totaL was 20,000+ BOOKS. and i failed again and again and again.    and still to this day, she screams and brings up my results in every argument and uses me as a example infront of my sister everyday.  now, she has said \" **if you fail again, then go get a room away from home and do what you want or study again from class 11 in management from the start\".**  now, i don't want to get out of my house without proper source of income. i can do every single house work and can even cook nearly everything , no problem if i start living alone. but it will be problem with no money or limited money.  and i would rather die than study and take that tension for another two years again. my mind is already way too damaged from that.  so, if i fail is there a course that i can get in techical line or something. like i heard that there are courses (18 months - 3 years ) that one can complete and start working , even if only SEE passed.    so , if there is any course that exists, please tell me.",

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not ‚Äúrevolution,‚Äù it‚Äôs not ‚Äújustice,‚Äù and it sure as hell isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe voice of the people.‚Äù It‚Äôs mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn‚Äôt make you brave‚Äîit makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that‚Äîsurrounded by a wave of so-called ‚Äúyouths‚Äù who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let‚Äôs not sugarcoat it‚Äîthe so-called Gen Z ‚Äúwarriors‚Äù hiding in the mob weren‚Äôt heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country‚Äôs social fabric. He still can‚Äôt step foot in certain countries because he‚Äôs internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he‚Äôs propped up as a ‚Äúleader.‚Äù  Let‚Äôs be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn‚Äôt an accident‚Äîit was a setup. While Deuba‚Äôs family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don‚Äôt get it twisted‚Äîthose sharpshooters in the crowd weren‚Äôt just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres‚Äîformer insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let‚Äôs stop pretending this was ‚Äúthe people rising up.‚Äù It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist‚Äîthe one who drowned this nation in blood‚Äîwalks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don‚Äôt for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn‚Äôt that Deuba suffered humiliation‚Äîthe real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn‚Äôt a flower; he‚Äôs a weed choking the soil of Nepal‚Äôs democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too na√Øve to realize they‚Äôre being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||Prachanda and Baburam are India's puppet.

            "heading": "Shrinkhala‚Äôs 34 minute video is baffling and a master class in denial, privilege, and self-victimization",
            "body": "The country is burning, and Shrinkhala uploaded a 34 minute PR reel. I just finished watching 11 minutes of the 34 long video Shrinkhala Khatiwada uploaded to ‚Äúexplain her silence‚Äù and I had to stop, not because I was bored, but because it was painful to watch someone so out of touch, so self-absorbed, and so deep into their own victim complex that they‚Äôve become completely blind to reality. I‚Äôm making this post and hoping people don‚Äôt fall for the carefully packaged sob story. First off is the immediate red flag that there is zero acknowledgment of her privilege. She talks about having a simple life, and claims her parents worked hard for her and her brother. That they had a house with 3 bedrooms, didn‚Äôt have to pay rent, had a good upbringing and she still thinks that counts as simple. And that‚Äôs the only privilege she‚Äôs ever had. That alone shows how detached she is from what ‚Äúaverage‚Äù really means in Nepal. She never even briefly reflects on the fact that her father is a powerful politician, and instead, she makes it sound like she built her life from scratch. It‚Äôs baffling.  She genuinely believes her name shouldn‚Äôt have been dragged into any of the national discourse and says that people were using her name just to get content and she literally says something along the lines of, if people got attention that way, ‚Äúso be it.‚Äù That‚Äôs her takeaway. The entire nation is in shambles, people are angry, protesting, waking up to decades of injustice and she still can't look beyond her own image. It's almost unbelievable how someone can watch a country crumble and somehow make it all about themselves. She positions herself as the one being targeted ‚Äúfor no reason‚Äù and says she wanted to fight back but was too overwhelmed by people turning against her. Again, not a word about why people might be justifiably critical, just a one-sided narrative of being attacked unfairly.  She says TikTok posts were changing the narrative of her entire life. But does she stop for a second to reflect on why people are questioning her? No. Instead, she keeps doubling down on this idea that she‚Äôs misunderstood, and that her critics are just trying to take her down for no reason. There is no realization that being the daughter of a well-known and allegedly corrupt politician is a reason why people hold you accountable especially when you‚Äôve benefitted from that influence. That‚Äôs not defamation. That‚Äôs public scrutiny. Then comes the part where she calls herself ‚Äúself-made.‚Äù And at that point, I had to pause and ask how? You‚Äôre born into a powerful and connected family. You have access to platforms, resources, and networks that most Nepalis can‚Äôt even dream of. And yet here you are, trying to claim some underdog story? She goes on to brag about her accomplishments, how she‚Äôs made so much money, and how people apparently can‚Äôt handle the fact that someone as young as her is so successful. As if that‚Äôs why people are questioning her. No, Shrinkhala, people aren‚Äôt criticizing you because you‚Äôre young and successful. They‚Äôre angry because you‚Äôre trying to rewrite your origin story while skipping over the very privileges that made your success possible.  She even says she never felt the need to justify herself to anyone before because ‚Äúsatya ko saath cha.‚Äù That‚Äôs when I realized how deep her delusion runs. She genuinely believes she‚Äôs standing on moral high ground, and yet her video is filled with nothing but self-praise, image management, and emotional manipulation. She talks about being ‚Äúsatya‚Äù while ignoring every contradiction, every unfulfilled promise, and every instance where she stayed silent when it mattered. Then she says if she doesn‚Äôt defend herself, then ‚Äúthe rest of the world will write her narrative.‚Äù Again, it‚Äôs about her. Not the truth, not justice, not accountability, not the people, but her narrative. The country is collapsing under the weight of corruption, and her priority is that her public image might be misunderstood. She even says her future generations will suffer if she doesn‚Äôt clear her image like that‚Äôs the greatest injustice here. Not the looted resources, not the betrayed citizens, but her family name. She thanks those who ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt unfollow her‚Äù and those who supported her privately. That‚Äôs her criteria for support which is social media metrics. Then she starts talking about her life story, narrates her autobiography, and once again, takes the opportunity to list her accomplishments and how she was a topper, won design competitions, etc. But does she ever stop to think about why she got those platforms? Does she reflect on how being a politician‚Äôs daughter might have given her access others don‚Äôt have? Of course not. Instead, she paints herself as someone with a ‚Äúsmall-town mindset‚Äù while talking about winning designer competitions. How many small-town Nepalis get to do that? There‚Äôs such a massive contradiction in her story, and she doesn‚Äôt even seem to see it.  She even says ‚Äúma maa nai kei kami thiyo hola‚Äù and tries to sound reflective, but it‚Äôs just another way to victimize herself. As if people criticizing her now are just reinforcing her lifelong feeling of being ‚Äúnot enough.‚Äù Then she addresses people who accuse her of not following through on the promises and ideals she expressed during Miss Nepal. And honestly, that criticism is completely valid. If you stood on a national stage making tall claims about development and change, then yes, people will hold you accountable. That‚Äôs not trolling. That‚Äôs responsibility. And finally, the most absurd part that she says she never had any power. How? You were Miss Nepal and are one of the most followed influencers in the country, daughter of a powerful political figure, a Harvard graduate. And you don‚Äôt have power? Then who does? If you truly believe you never had any power to make a difference, then what was the point of all the public positioning, speeches, and social impact projects? That‚Äôs not humility. That‚Äôs denial.  She tries to play down her travel experiences too. Says that before Miss Nepal, she had only been to India, and that‚Äôs ‚Äúnot an achievement,‚Äù and that her Hong Kong trip immediately after the pageant was the only international travel till then. Then she brings up her UK trip, saying it was funded by youth, and she didn‚Äôt really get to enjoy it because she was only there for work, so apparently, that doesn‚Äôt count as privilege either. Every step of the way, she undermines and downplays her privilege, refuses to acknowledge her advantages, and continues to position herself as a victim. And all of this? Is just the first 11 minutes. I honestly couldn‚Äôt keep watching. It became clear very quickly that this wasn‚Äôt a sincere explanation. It was a 34 minute long PR video just to clear her image, filled with narcissistic reflections, gaslighting, and image control disguised as vulnerability. I really hope people don‚Äôt fall for victimized narrative. Please don‚Äôt.",

The lack of self-reflection and the constant logical fallacies, positioning anyone who challenges her as lacking critical thinking, etc, is not lost on us. Her post undermines the intelligence of us Nepalis. It's deeply emotionally manipulative, lacking an understanding of structural power, and shows us that her platform truly didn't stand up for everything it promised.|||https://preview.redd.it/1cqs8f03d0qf1.jpeg?width=1776&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=413cc01da3d5c52183f54558efa0ab80228da8cb|||üíØ. She forgot everything until she was ruined. Then everything came back to her.|||Ignoring people like that is the *only* hope. Instead, we should focus on average Joes who have done greater good. Like cleaning garbage on the street or starting a free tuition for street children. We should make heroes of those ordinary people. We should also start questioning our perception of beauty. Why is Shrinkhala Khadka considered *anything*? Is she physically appealing or sexually affable or glamorous? Why should she have *any* followers, to begin with? Then we should start questioning the perception of our 'beauty standard'. Why should only fair skinned, better looking people get millions of followers. It's not going to be easy but we should always question. If we play the same pop culture game and dig deep into how propaganda and algo can be manipulated then we can perhaps start asking questions like the way you have did.   It's not easy because it's a biased platform where heritage money and incumbent power are in bed with the forces of propaganda (e.g. Insta algorithm). Its a hard battle to win.

Can you show us that you paid income taxes on the money you claimed you earned as an influencer?|||I watched the video too and disagree. Whatever she is, she is not a criminal. There are way worse people than her in Nepal. In my view, arson who damaged the private and public properties are way worse than her and legally criminals. Similarly, there are better faces of nepo babies - the OG nepo baby, the ex-king.  I am saddened that there is no empathy. Literally, her house was burned down by an angry mob. Have some empathy.  Nepal has systematic corruption at every level. Everyone has either given or taken bribes.  There are minimal financial opportunities within Nepal. It makes financially more sense for an honest person to seek employment abroad. By destroying businesses and targeting the elites, the country will witness even less investment. It needs money to create investments for more jobs. Ironic thing was people who protested showed their own corruption by looting private companies - which again legally is a crime.   If I can have empathy for arsons and thieves who destroyed and looted public and private properties, have some empathy for another Nepali who was threatened and attacked viciously online just for being more successful than most people.|||If you guys really think she got what she deserved - having her old parents house.

It was a small house when we moved in, which was 17 years ago‚Äî few months after I was born.   After working for over 25+ years for the government, this country, and its public, my dad still has a very clear history. No bribery, no corruption, no money laundering‚Äî nothing. Rising high in status and the post, he is recognized for his diligent work and highly stable work ethic.  Now, back to the present. The protestors had reached our house. I had once thought, why would anyone target our house? It's a civil servant, not some minister or anything of that sort. My father rose high due to his hard work and competitiveness, not any connection or bribery. We can all see from how my parents lived rental first (he was already a civil servant then). Only after a few months of me being born did they buy a house, not without taking loans.  I don't know why it happened because our house was aba and definitely not supposed to be a part of whatever that was. The protestors were going to burn our house, but because of it being attached to other houses, the neighbours finally calmed them down into not burning our house. Instead, they burned our bikes, went into our house, and threw things out to burn them. What's worse? When the protestors left, all the people living nearby, went in and out for 2 days straight‚Äî morning, day and night, pickng whatever things they liked amd taking it home with them as if our house was some kind of thrift store giving away our stuff for free.  We were at our relative's house, and when we saw all the black smoke coming from the direction of our house, we were devastated. \"Our house got burnt.\" That's what we thought. As i was the oldest child in the family, i couldn't let myself break down. I can still hear those devastating gut-wrenching cries and sobs from my mom, haunting me like a ghost every time i close my eyes.   I am a college student. My uniform is gone, and so are my books and copies. My sister is in middle school. Her uniform and books and copies are nowhere to be found as well.   Our money and jewelries, of course, are gone too. The same money my father earned and mind you, a civil servant's earnings isn't much. Only enough to label us as a middle-class family. The same money my sister sent us, her hard-working money(which was in dollars at that).  Our clothes, bags, and even utensils are gone, and so are our food storage(stuff). My mom is someone who saves money. However, she can just like my dad because she knows she has experienced the hardships with my dad. Because they know. Because they have experienced hardships and complications in their life. Because they have faced obstacles.  We have never wore any designers, no luxury fashion brand. All are affordable and comfortable. The only designer my mom and dad ever even had is when my big sister from abroad visited us and surprised us with some designer bags (which she also got scolded for spending so much because she is still studying and working in between only).  Our guests'clothes, laptops, phones, everything is gone. Me and my sisters' savings and my mom's little spending for managing our household‚Äî nothing is left. Not even our puja ko thaan(a small place we had to worship and pray gods).   We have tons of debts. I am old enough to learn that by now. Now that our house was totally and utterly robbed and vandalized while my dad kept on working for the same public, we have nowhere to sleep on. No clothes to wear. There is no place to shower or bathe.  We had to hide away from our own house we once called home to keep ourselves alive. My father was lucky enough to be safe because if it was even a few seconds late, it would have all been over. We were fortunate to be alive, even though we had done nothing wrong to people.  Morality? Humanity? Conscience? Guilt? Remorse? None. The same people, the same public, that my dad is working so hard to serve with his whole heart, has done this to him, to his family.  Gen z, huh? Protest against corruption, huh? My dad, having the cleanest history‚Äî no corruption, bribery, connection, whatsoever. So why our house? Why? What had we ever done to them? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.   I have no hope left. None for this country, none for the people of this country. This is now a country full of robbers and thieves. Humans are jealous. Humans are greedy. People are full of themselves, full of greediness and selfishness. In my heart, humans are creatures who have ruined any hope for more in me and my family. My father, who once poured his heart for this country and the people in this country, is on the verge of giving up on it.  You people, opportunists, and robbers who call yourselves voice of justice‚Äî I'll be watching, watching who you are going to tame to pull this country back together. People like my dad who are so wronged will be out of all this mess soon, Who are you going to pull to patch this broken country? I'll be watching. I'll be happily watching everything crumble and fall apart with your \"justice.\" You have given the opportunists a sense of win. You've let them think anything is possible, and now, everything will fall apart while you watch everything crumble in front of your eyes.  Lastly, I'd like to be a little vulgar and uncensored. If you are uncomfortable, scroll away.  Whoever has participated in vandalizing my house and robbing it empty‚Äî You are going to see hell and worse. I hope you feel yourself rotting away. I hope you don't think it's over now because whatever you stole, it will haunt you for the rest of your life and afterwards. I will forever haunt you, even in your dreams, converting it into a disastrous nightmare. You'll see hell. You are going to suffer.  [Edit: I never expected this post to gain so many views. I‚Äôm very grateful to those who are wishing me and my family well, thank you very much for that. And I also understand those who might raise an eyebrow on this post and not believe in my words. It‚Äôs up to you, whether you want to believe me or not. I have no intention of forcing it on you.   I‚Äôd also like to request anyone who knows me through this post to maintain my privacy and not reveal anything about me or my family on the internet(please refrain any stalker behavior). I have never gone public like this and I also don‚Äôt like the attention this is getting(makes me uncomfortable) but I‚Äôm going to keep this post so other people who have experienced something like this can be open about it here. Let this be a safe space for those to speak up.]",

While this was an absolutely needed protest and it did bring much-needed attention and change, we also can‚Äôt deny the darker side of it. While the deaths of innocent people rightfully shook everyone and fueled the anger, more innocent lives were lost in the chaos that followed.  Gen Z cannot ignore the fact that others died in fires, or that people were looted and harmed during the unrest. It‚Äôs easy to say the movement was hijacked by goons, but the videos and reports show some protesters themselves vandalizing property and stealing from people who had nothing to do with the issue. Ironically, those who stood up against corruption ended up damaging the lives and livelihoods of ordinary citizens.   Those responsible should be held accountable for it!!!   My heart goes out to you for your loss. Please know you and your family are welcome to stay with us until you find a place to rebuild. Destiny will open new doors for you.

The moment I condemn their brutality, they rush to label me as ‚Äújholay,‚Äù as if that insult could erase their own guilt. Their selective outrage is sickening. And now, when things are finally settling down, looking back in retrospect, it is clear that we failed as a society. We do not deserve good leaders when, at the first sign of crisis, we loot, we vandalize, we burn homes, and then pretend we are pure.

Everyone I have met from Nepal has been so kind, hard working and overall beautiful people. Especially the women who work at my sons day care. Such gentle and kind souls. Whenever I meet someone who's immigrated from Nepal, they are always open to having a great conversation.   I know some racist people in my country have recently protested against immigration but that it mostly the old conservatives, a majority of the younger generations do not think like that. In my opinion, and the the opinion of good hearted Aussies, you are very welcome here. I think everyone from Nepal makes a wonderful addition to Australia and will continue to do so. I hope someday soon your country finds peace because I cannot wait to visit. I love Nepalese food also, I wish I could make food as good as your cuisine.  Thank you for being so kind.",

            "comments": "As a Nepali, I can understand people who protest against too much immigration. The world economy has truly been shaken by COVID and the Russia-Ukraine war. They are just normal people who don't want to see more unemployment and rising prices due to an influx of people. The blame, however, should go directly to the bureaucrats and the big businesses of Australia who are exploiting the immigrants and its laws by hiring cheap wages.|||I am Australian and play tennis with some wonderful Nepalis. They are lovely people and one, a Sherpa from Salleri, has become a good friend.   I will visit Nepal in early March to do the Three Passes trek and enjoy the beauty of your country.|||Thanks for your kind words. Do visit when free.|||Thankyou so much(x5) for your kind and warm words. Do visit Nepal, it's beautiful and safe <333.  Much love to you all Aussies too.|||Appreciate it mate|||Thanks for your kind appreciation. Let me tell you our Nepalese perspective.  As a Nepalese, it's really tough for us to enter Australia, first you must pass at least high school with good marks, then get a really good English test score, then you must show a significant bank balance, so your immigration policy is already filtering only the best people from other countries.   I am a Engineer myself, it's relatively easy for someone like me to immegrate to Australia, but for students of other field, you're immigration policy already make sure only the best students come in your country, and it should be that way to be honest.   Regarding your immigration issue, well I believe any country should only allow immigration if there is net positive for the country, you don't want a bunch of liabilities to come in your country, right??  So, just look at the data, you can very easily find out what communities are contributing to Australia, and what communities are hampering the country, and simply adjust the policies that way, it's really that simple.   Regarding recent protests against Immigration, well I think that's just the coverup done by the rich and elites to brainwash common Aussies so that the blame is shifted towards immigration when in fact Australia has the best immigration compared to many Western countries.   My cousin recently returned back to Nepal, they lived in Melbourne for almost 10 years, they shared the economy isn't doing great compared to past years, and the blame is being shifted solely towards immigration.|||U will be welcomed here in Nepal. The situation is back to normal.|||G‚Äôday folks, I‚Äôm an Aussie, not Nepali, but just wanted to say how bloody grateful I am to have Nepali mates here in Australia. Every Nepali I‚Äôve met has been so kind, hard-working and just top-notch people. The ladies at my kid‚Äôs daycare are absolute legends ‚Äì such gentle, caring souls. Always up for a good yarn whenever I bump into someone from Nepal.  I know we‚Äôve had a few grumpy old conservatives carrying on about immigration lately, but honestly, most young Aussies don‚Äôt reckon like that at all. From my point of view ‚Äì and from any fair-dinkum Aussie ‚Äì you‚Äôre more than welcome here. Nepalese folks add heaps of value to this country, and I hope that continues.  One day I‚Äôd love to visit Nepal once things settle down there. And mate, your food ‚Äì wow! I could eat momos every day, no worries.|||Can y'all please recommend your fav momo place? I need to update my list.|||australian news always mentions Kathmandu's Mayor Balen whenever they make news about Nepal haha|||Totally agree! But just commenting as i'm interested to hear you're having anti immigration protests in Australia too? I'm in UK and it's gone a bit berserk here too. People are protesting and putting England flags everywhere. I think our governments have orchestrated this, and have found their scapegoat instead of increasing taxes on the 1%.|||I made a post similar to this a few months ago. I am also Australian, and in my experience Nepalese people are so often the nicest and most genuine people you will ever meet. I have been to Nepal and I love the food, the culture and the people. We need more Nepalese people in Australia, and more Nepalese food! And Nepalese spirituality too.|||Jai Nepal Jai Australia|||Thank you for the kind words mate.|||Why are you saying this?

Most of times Indian (south asians) face racism is due to...   1. bad dressing up sense , fashion.  2. manners   3. smell     Always dress well, wear clean, not necessarily new, clothes, be polite in train, bus ( say thank you to driver, leave seats for women , pregnant, elderly etc ), don't play music in phone without earphones, don't speak in phone in crowded space, hold door if you can, and use thank you, sorry, excuse me please as often as you can. And avoid eating food with garlic, onion like lot ... mild amount won't be cause body odour.      Chinese, Korean look same as Japanese , but Japanese never face racism (mostly) , it is because they are so conscious about their appearance in public, their mannerism and they are so well dressed, we must be like Japanese ;)|||Dhaka topi lagayera k hunxa ra ?

There is nothing anyone could do because of the constitution for the old leaders to try again.   But this time, if we play our cards right, next election ma voter Id card banayera we need to vote for the party/person who we think can bring a change.  Change doesn‚Äôt happen overnight, we need to be patient.  Either start doing politics by yourself, or support someone who does. That‚Äôs the only thing our constitution allows.|||Lol, things never chang overnight. Expecting these corrupt people to just give up their power and privilege is not that easy. They will come back and try to do everything possible to regain their power.   Instead of being discouraged by their appearance we can get ourselves involved in more and more constructive dialogue and create a scenario where they will not be back again from the next election. Engage in political debate. Spread words. More intellectual discuss will help create a \"vibe\" when they will find hard to regain power. We can never demand so and so person or party should not participate in election or use their constitutional rights. So them trying to resurface and whitewash their image is normal. Unless we convict then for crime in court they are free to start doing that.  Let's keep being vigilant. Let's continue this discourse and may be, just may be, we can tip the society as a whole towards a future without the \"musical chair\".   What the jenji protest has done is create eye opening moment for a lot of the old generation people and has made the younger generation a major stakeholder in the country's governance and politics. Nothing else, this is major achievement in itself. Adem√°s, the parties also feel some sort of pressure to restructure and change. But if we keep on using this momentum to keep on being watchful and create more awakening over time I think the courage and sacrifice will not be for nothing.|||Have patience guys. impatience always brings anger and anxiety.

Yet, even after all this time, I still carry deep respect and pride for the land I came from. But watching this horrific video of a mob savagely beating an elderly man and his wife left me utterly speechless. Regardless of what the couple may have been involved in or accused of, nothing justifies such cruelty.  I thought Nepali men were the descendants of the brave Gurkhas‚Äîwarriors respected and admired worldwide for their courage and honor. Instead, I saw a man sucker punch a woman who wasn‚Äôt even facing him. That wasn‚Äôt bravery‚Äîit was pure cowardice. And the chaos that followed‚Äîhundreds of people raiding and looting their home under the excuse of ‚Äújustice‚Äù‚Äîwasn‚Äôt justice at all. That mob was just as corrupt and criminally responsible as the very people they claimed to oppose. They were not upholding the law; they were exploiting the breakdown of law and order to terrorize and humiliate helpless individuals.  But this rot doesn‚Äôt stop with the mob. The government, too, is guilty. Innocent children were killed during the protests, yet there has been no true accountability. Those in power‚Äîthe Prime Minister, the Home Minister, and the security forces‚Äîbear responsibility for those heinous crimes. They were entrusted with protecting the people, but instead, they used their authority to spill the blood of innocents.  So when I look at this situation, I see two sides of the same coin: mobs acting as judge, jury, and executioner in the streets, and leaders hiding behind power while allowing or even enabling violence against their own citizens. Both are forms of terrorism, both have destroyed public trust, and both have crippled the very soul of Nepal.  And if this mob truly represents the next generation‚Äîif this is the standard of ‚Äújustice‚Äù that today‚Äôs youth believe in‚Äîthen Nepal‚Äôs future is not just uncertain, it is in grave danger. Because a society that celebrates cowardice, looting, and lawlessness, while a government escapes accountability for killing its own children, is a society heading toward doom.|||Maile paila post garya ho, yo bare  https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/s/okOHZ5elMo|||https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/s/okOHZ5elMo|||It's not going to change in one day.

So Nepal population is low for the region but Almost 40%water in the ganges basin also comes from Nepal. This basin supports 600million people. Which is more than the population of south America.

Our factor is liveable land if you see in N.

This affectes every country in south Asia including Nepal. That's a problem we should solve. IT's gradually under control I guess.|||Google Bangladesh. And let me know if you found the answer|||Don‚Äôt look up bangladesh/australia. Nepal has average population density.|||Population in SE Asia seems to be quite high in general. I think regarding your question about where the population is concentrated, you will find that the population is scattered throughout the country - everywhere minus above 3000m up the himalayas. Then if you do a deep assessment what % of Perus Land actually has people vs % of Nepal where people reside, you may find the two land sizes may not be off by a magnitude like now when you compare the full size of the country. For eg UK has a landmass of 250k but has a population of 69 mil. That's 2x population of Peru in 1/5th of land. In the other hand australia has a population of 27mil in 7.7mil km2. Russia has 143mil people in 17mil km2 (4x Pop of Peru in 16x land area).  You are also looking at the mercader projection which further makes Nepal look more visually small in the map. Not that it should have any basis when you talk about numbers.   I suppose what I am trying to say is the population may still be high in Nepal but it may not be as high as you think when you factor in livable land in the country. Total land mass alone is not a great indicator.|||Fertile land, fertile people, most are on terai belt. Look at india and bangladesh, how densely populated they all are. Nepal's population comes from the region similar to them. I have no clue why peru has low population, maybe there isn't most habitable land.

Absolute extremes. The terrain absolutely messes things up.  Nepal ain't no heaven land but I would say the climate is very hospitable.|||Tokyo has 14 million people in 2,194 km ¬≤|||Such a great question. Most of the people are concentrated in the cities and in the low lands where theres lots of rivers and fertile land till 1990s people procreate and like crazy plus modern medicine less infant mortality and less knowledge of contraceptives. Also temperate climate.|||Time zones bro.|||Look at bangaldesh's area and population. You'll be shocked my guy|||The reported surface area of a country is always the 2D surface area. It calculated on a flat, two-dimensional plane, not by measuring the surface area of its mountains, hills, and valleys. The total land area of a country is determined by projecting its borders onto a standardized reference surface, typically an ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the Earth.      Nepal is roughly a \\~1000 km long, and 150 km wide and so the approximate area of 150 sq km.   Now if you count the mountains and valleys that covers like 70% of that 2D area, the actual habitable space is order of magnitide larger. maybe even 50x.   So the actual living space is quite a lot for mountainous country like Nepal. I would imagine same for Peru.|||You know about canada?|||You should have started with Bangladesh and it's population density.  Regardless, depends on how fertile and navigable the lands are.

The culture and people are nice but you will always be pigeonholed here. Experiencing new culture, being self independent and the journey could be rewarding.   However, it all depends on your financial background, your skillset and courage to step into the world that is full of surprises. Not easy but you never know.|||Many people go to different parts of the world because they want to explore other countries and wish to be independent from their family and societal norms.

My parents left Nepal when I was too young to make a decision, and I followed them. But the feeling of being back home is unmatched.

Congratulations on your successes. I hope your life continues to be very rich in experiences and opportunity.|||This kind of post rubs me the wrong way a bit because it feels like you‚Äôre trying to position yourself as ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù or ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than the people who went abroad. The reality is that both paths, either staying in Nepal or going abroad, have their own pros and cons, and people choose based on circumstances that are often very different from yours.  You mention being financially independent, investing early, and balancing work with studies. That‚Äôs impressive, but it‚Äôs also a privilege many don‚Äôt have. Plenty of sons and daughters in Nepal are grinding just to pay off family debts or keep their households afloat. For them, going abroad isn‚Äôt about ‚Äúhype‚Äù but it‚Äôs about survival, opportunity, or helping their families. Even the ability to invest in NEPSE in the first place points to a cleaner starting slate than what a lot of others face.  And while you thrived staying in Nepal, not everyone has that option. Families who send their kids abroad are often taking huge risks and sacrifices, sometimes from already fragile financial situations. Even if someone goes abroad and struggles at first, starting from zero (or even from debt) can eventually set them up for long-term security that wouldn‚Äôt be possible back home.  So yes, it‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre making it work in Nepal, but framing it in a way that hints at looking down on people who go abroad ignores the complexity of their decisions and struggles.|||Simple answer for you it is not same for every one.|||I knew a guy like you who didn't go abroad when he was 22.

I didn't want to leave too but had a lots of failure and lacking economic support lead ultimately to go out. I miss my country more than anything. I wish you all the best.  Going abroad was definitely worth it for me. Specially during covid, I could atleast support economically. We literally were able to save my FIL by pushing money to the hospital. Few lakhs is not a big problem for me so I always have that assurance that I can take care of my family if needed. I am also less worried about kids, as they will have better opportunity for everything. Government supports health and education, and only fooding and clothing them is what I have to worry about. They also have opportunity to grow in a better society free from caste and religion based nonsense so they can actually focus on things that matter. Its much easier for them to travel anywhere in the world because the passport is much stronger. So overall I can take care of my parents and give a better start to my kids, which makes me content.

I left Nepal when I was way past my teenage years. Even though I am not as happy or rather don't have peaceful mind as I would hope for, my decision to leave Nepal was a good call! I should have left Nepal a few years before I eventually did.   Going abroad is definitely good and I suggest everyone to do so once in their life time; however, how long to stay is up for debate. I would rather emphasize on THE purpose. I left Nepal because I couldn't stand to live in Nepal. I am poorer than the most of my old friends who stayed in Nepal. Spiritually and mentally, I am as fucked up as before, which was something I thought I would get over by moving abroad.       However, I have a hope and \"I can do\" mentality. I HIGHLY appreciate the way I think these days mixed with whatever I had learned back in Nepal and the new things in this new environment. I wouldn't give this away for any price! (well a few million dollars might do the trick :D )      Thing is, we tend to have this bias that the things that are familiar to us and we identify with always seem better and superior to others.

If Rabi criminal ho vane judgement deu, jail ma rakha. Hoina vane innocent vandeu. Mudda chaldai garda ta bail ma niskina milxa ni. Kina niskina nadeko?  Because they are threatened by Rabi.  Ever thought why articles/news about Rabi is always negative/controversial?

With all due respect to Sumana, she's a much needed breath of fresh air in Nepali politics, I have to disagree with her on one major thing.  She says Rabi needs to step down as RSP leader because she thinks that the best interest of the party and that's what people/youths want. That's where I think she's misunderstood and wrong.  From genZ upto the aged ones, most of them want Rabi in the leadership. That's why he got the highest number of votes among all leaders in the last election.  What I think is that Sumana saw many youth social media activists, who doesn't know politics and are misinformed and those who doesn't represent the overall youths of Nepal at all, they made video saying \"we don't want Rabi\", \"he's same old, corrupt\" which led to Sumana thinking Rabi isn't wanted by current youths and she need to get out of that party to be the voice of the youths.|||Good going on",

            "body": "We all know most ISP here lock the router and dont give any access to the web management. As a devops practitioner and someone who is very invested in homelabbing and selfhosting, locked router was my biggest achilles heels.   Requirement: A secondary router, you main router will stop working and secondary router will only work through LAN1 port.   Solution: All you have to do is create a ticket on vianet app stating \"Turn the router into bridge/modem only mode\". Someone will call you back, just ask them username and password for PPPOE and use your secondary router to configure through PPPOE instead of DHCP. Tada!!! you now have full control over your router.   Bonus 1: You can flash openwrt with Luci web interface and you will be able to configure anything you can think of. extra advantage is you can configure mesh routing without needing a special router. I have managed to easily flash it on my Mi router and a old tp link router, search for guides depending on your model or ask Claude or Gpt to search specifically for your router model.   Bonus 2: Vianet gives you globally accessible IPV6. That means you are free from CGNAT. Use this to access your home services without needing any relay like Cloudflare Tunnel or Tailscale VPN. Direct connection means no extra latency and maxed bandwidth and you can use this to host online game servers to play with your friends!! But for some reason Worldlink doesnt connect sometimes. Ncell and ClassicTech seems to have no problem tho. I am not sure if NTC offers IPV6.  Bonus 3: Host a adguard DNS server and configure your openwrt to use it as your default DNS server. This way you will have adblocking for your whole network. Your parents and old grannies wont have to see ads no more (wont work with Youtube app - use revance) and it keeps them safe from online phishing and malwares. You can also set some static ip and adguard to block some websites like gambling and pornography if there are minors in your household.   Disadvantage: The only downside of this is your main router will turn pretty much useless. Internet wont work through wireless and extra ports. So dont forget the vianet tech support to turn off the DHCP and wireless on the main router. Since my secondary router also has 2 ports only I had to invest some money on extra gigabyte switch.   I know some of you will appreciate this so this is my appreciation and giving back to this community. enjoy and have fun!! Happy Dashain!!!

Did it impact your internet speed in any way?   Also, directly exposing your local network and devices through IPv6 is not really a good idea.

So I have a camera that allows remote viewing.

He had written a long convincing description saying things like:  > ‚ÄúScam ho vannu vanda agadi read: I buy from Vietnam promotional offer and sell it here with Rs.200 profit per account.

This isn't just about a bad interview, it feels like a deliberate strategy to exploit job seekers for free labor.  I went through **multiple** rounds of interviews over several weeks. Everything seemed promising. The conversations were positive, and they talked about a great fit for their team. Then came the \"final\" task: to design a comprehensive digital marketing campaign.  I spent days on this. I researched their brands, analysed their competitors, and built out a full strategy, complete with campaign ideas, target audiences, content plans, and performance metrics. I treated it like a real, paid project because I genuinely wanted the job and to show my capabilities.  I submitted the work, feeling confident. Then... nothing. Total radio silence. I followed up, but no response. The most infuriating part? The reason given was a flimsy, nonsensical excuse that had nothing to do with the work I submitted.  This isn't an isolated incident. I've heard from others who have gone through the exact same process with them. They get you to design a full campaign, which they can then use or adapt, and then they ghost you or reject you on some silly pretext. It's a blatant exploitation of job seekers' time and skills.  If you're a digital marketer in Nepal and you're considering applying to IMS Group, be warned. This is not a legitimate hiring process. It's a fishing expedition for free campaign ideas. Save your time and your work for a company that respects candidates and values their professional effort.  They were still hiring 2 days ago and I gave the interview 3 months ago.",

I absolutely hate the Google calendar app on my phone. If you need some contributions for the app I can donate via PayPal or direct bank transfer if you are in Nepal. Also one small suggestion if you can make it support up to 120hz. It fluctuates between 30 to 90 quite often.

Wth|||works offline once loaded. that was a great feature.|||atleast has no ads and does not refresh when changing month  unlike hamropatro  W|||Amazing ! Just replaced it with hamro patro. The widget of nepali date is what sold me. The UI looks clean. I like that i can see the previous month and calendar years back but it would be cool if instead of the drop-down it was something else as the drop-down blocks the view of the current calendar and i feel it looks like the design aesthetic with the rest of the app design.   I hope you keep improving and adding new features !|||Tried it. Looks good.   One thing that i felt redundant was the popup layout when seeking other dates. Like when i want to see what is on 3rd Kartik, it opens up a popup therefore blocking the calendar entirely. I have to then close the popup  to seek through the next date. I feel that you could just update the info below the calendar for the selected date instead of the popup.   Makes it easier to seek through the dates.|||whats smarter in this calendar?|||Best!

It‚Äôs really smooth on my iOS. It feels like above 90, probably 120. Also, when adding reminders, can you make it show nepali date as well? I often have to hop between two apps to confirm the Nepali date while adding reminders.  And, can you make the widget also switch between light/dark mode based on my device theme?|||Well the best part of the app is it's minimilastic. Thanks.. üòä|||Loved the widgets more. Less bloat.

Make everyone accountable. Ask questions.|||might be your app lock trying to get your facial data try turning it off|||It seems more like the app is checking for permissions that might be needed in the app, namely to scan QR.|||I just tried logging in mero ma chai bhayena just dashain dhun played|||Ios ma chai photo leko xaina hai just checked|||Qr wala permission ho but this is shady af anyways.|||That's spying mf.

Qr scan garda matra aaune ho, coz teti bella camera use huncha.|||Temporary solution: revoke camera and mic permission and set ask every time.|||Let me explain this from a developer‚Äôs perspective. Every time you run an app, the system checks which permissions have already been granted. The same happens when you open the NIC Asia app. Now, why would NIC Asia need access to your camera? The answer is QR payments. The camera icon you see is most likely a UI feature indicating which hardware or system components (like the camera, location, etc.) are being accessed. iOS has a similar feature, so your phone may show it too.|||Same, just checked (in android)|||Ig that biometric verification is causing that hurdle|||Khichdaina nih bruh|||Proposal chai aba currency digital banaunu khojiraxan..|||Mobile banking applications checks for the permission of the camera on login for biometrics authentication and QR scan function.

Aru bank ko ma dekhayena, nic ma dekhayo|||No worries, I‚Äôve already tested this, nothing is sent to the backend. It has to be tied to the QR feature, because once the app is logged in the whole page is swipe-gesture based. When you swipe left, the camera view for QR is triggered, so it looks like a photo is being taken but it‚Äôs not. They likely initialize and tear down the camera process in the background to speed up access.|||SBL does that too|||Samsung OneUI 7.0 ma ni xina hai yo problem, maybe device specific ho ki.|||They keep logs for the fraud detection, yes almost all the banking systems keep the camera logs while logging in to the account.|||aru ma no yasto hunxa camera ko permission on bhayara ho|||Same thing used to happen in kumari and prime bank mobile app, I noticed as I used to turn off camera from the software so any app that needs camera would ask first, but for some reason as soon as I logged in those 2 apps asked to open camera and mic settings, but as of recently it seems to be fixed|||Your account might be hacked!!many of peoples' don't know shit..which is why iphone is too good for protection of ur account..if yu using Android then for sure you are on watch..

The child will have access to education and almost everything another child can ask for. We have belief that the child carries spirit of Taleju Bhawani, which gives the child immense power. Again, in an age where we have lost our belief, I cannot prove it.  The kumaris I have visited emit strong aura (i may have been brainwashed to feel this). But she does have to be disciplined (i dont mean someone disciplines her). The child is treated with utmost respect by the best people in a homely environment.   Aba before age of 15 16, Manang Mustang ghumna khasai koi jaadaina hola (only speaking for myself) After she is no longer a Kumari, she can go whereever she wants to.

A 3 year old child has no idea what she is getting into. She cannot grasp what a normal childhood is, what is right and what is wrong. The only thing she knows and does is based on her likes and dislikes, which is heavily depended upon how her parents/surrounding elders dictates.   Ani about 'No complains' from past Kumaris:   Newari culture is super sensitive. You cannot say anything against their culture. Otherwise, you'll have to face \"Tom n Jerry\" like people. I think, every ex Kumaris understands this at some point. With this much pressure along with the grooming done from a very young age, I don't think anyone dares to speak up. Which basically means none of us know what they really feel inside.    Well, of course, keeping in mind how they're thrown away once they reach a certain age or goes through ü©∏. At least, a life time opportunity to be a Kumari where they could renounce their position if they don't feel like it should be a way.   They don't preach, they don't teach, they only show up during jatras. I've never seen Kumaris actively participating in rituals or any sort of activities.

The only thing you should feel bad about is her parents who now have to be her full time care takers probably having to leave their jobs and careers and move into the kumari house with her.|||I used to extremely religious before and used to glorify ts But realising Kumari tradition is cruel was my first step towards atheism|||As a Newar, I understand the cultural side of it.

While modern concerns about child rights are valid, the practice is governed by strict rituals and has evolved to address contemporary welfare standards. Here are the key facts:  1. The Selection is Meticulous and Considered an Honor:  ¬∑ A Kumari is chosen from the specific Shakya clan of the Newari community, a Buddhist goldsmith caste. ¬∑ The selection process is incredibly rigorous. Candidates must meet 32 strict physical perfection requirements (e.g., eye shape, voice quality, hair color) and demonstrate a fearless and serene demeanor (e.g., by not crying during a ceremony in a room of 108 ritually sacrificed animal heads). ¬∑ For the family and community, her selection is not a punishment but the highest spiritual honor.  2. The Role is Central to National Culture and Unity:  ¬∑ The Kumari is not just a religious figure but a national symbol. ¬∑ Her most important public duty is during the Indra Jatra festival, where she blesses the President of Nepal, providing divine legitimacy to the state in a ceremony that blends Hindu and Buddhist traditions. This is a key event for national identity.  3. Significant Reforms and Safeguards Have Been Implemented:  ¬∑ Education: By law, the Kumari now receives a formal education from private tutors within her residence. The government provides a monthly stipend specifically for this purpose. ¬∑ Family Presence: Contrary to isolation claims, her family (typically her mother) lives with her throughout her tenure. ¬∑ Financial Security: Upon retiring at puberty, the state grants her a lifetime pension. As of recent years, this is approximately NPR 10,000 per month (roughly $75 USD), along with a lump sum of NPR 1 million (roughly $7,500 USD) to support her transition. ¬∑ Successful Reintegration: Former Kumaris like Dr. Chanira Bajracharya, who served until 14, have publicly spoken about their positive experiences, pursued higher education, and built successful careers, demonstrating that life after the role is viable.  The Kumari tradition is a deeply embedded socio-religious institution. It is factually inaccurate to frame it simply as the \"isolation\" of a child. It is a state-sanctioned, culturally sacred role with defined rituals, significant community support, and legally mandated provisions for the girl's education, family life, and long-term financial security. The debate around it highlights the global tension between cultural preservation and evolving child rights, but the practice itself has demonstrably adapted to modern norms.|||I ain't newar but also I think aaba yesto kura chai parents haru le vhaneko ramro hami third party le vhannu vhanda pani . look if kumari ko parents le chahanu hudaina vhani tyo kumari ko candidate mai na leraunu parni ho . so parents lai kehi problem xaina , kumari le as a normal human being ni basna paunu hunxa after completion so I think we are no one to question sodhna lai|||What about the tradition of marrying off daughters into the inlaws house?|||After giving this some thought question is of a philosophical one. What freedom does a child have?  What life does a child choose? Isn‚Äôt everyone forced and fed their parent‚Äôs beliefs?   Also, can you give some evidence of abuse? If not your post would be baseless and in attempt of defamation of our culture.  One Kumari‚Äôs time ended when she was just 12. How much do you remember of your life before you were 12? I asked myself the same question and the answer is not much.   I disagree with your claim that the Kumari‚Äôs are discarded. They are always welcome. What it shows is the core principle of Buddhism that nothing is permanent. All things, even being revered as the living goddess, comes to an end. It teaches humility, an art that is now lost in this modern time.

You‚Äôve engrained yourself with too much western influence and think that the culture needs to be reformed. Kumaris have friends, education, and the choice is with them and their families.

Khaire ko documentary haru herera brainrot kura nagara na. Not everyone is privileged to become kumari and nor they are selected randomly. The family members themself have to fill the form and there's a long running selection process. Only a certain clan of newar can become Kumari. There are lots of inhuman and child abusive traditions going on all over. In case of kumari they get highest level of love and respect. They can live with their parents, they can play, they can watch TV, they can even play video games. It would be better if you watch podcasts of ex kumaris it's really helpful. I used to think same like everyone calling this inhuman before but they are living the normal life as you and me. And the fact that you can't speak up being kumari is totally false, yes you can't but only in jatras and other religious ceremonies, do you speak up during sharad and other pujas(it's prohibited to talk during sharad if you don't know). Go visit sudurpaschim hundreds of girls are being raped during their chhaupadi bas. Go visit terai Muslim villages girls at the age of 15 are getting married and at the age of 21 they are booned with 3 childs. Ex Kumaris themself enjoy being kumari and love to live their that phase again. If they are fine, their parents are fine no need to talk about that. Now the rules and prohibitions are amended.

With isolation and the constant expectation to suppress emotions, what happens to her social, communication, and interpersonal skills? Who helps her navigate that later? 4. Does she ever get space to express her own feelings and thoughts or is silence part of the job description? 5. We‚Äôve all seen videos of new Kumari, some barely three years old, literally asleep in full dress during rituals. How on earth can a toddler be burdened with divine expectations when they can barely stay awake through it? 6. As Nepalis, many of us defend dal bhat tarkari because it‚Äôs what we grew up with it feels untouchable. (I know it‚Äôs not the same but for reference) For a Kumari, this role is all she has ever known. So how would she even recognise or articulate what she‚Äôs missed out on, when she never had the chance to experience it? 7. And let‚Äôs be honest do we really believe someone put on a pedestal that high, surrounded by cultural pressure, guilt, and shame, would openly talk about the negatives of being Kumari? Yes, things have changed there‚Äôs more education, some family contact,but none of that cancels out the developmental and human rights concerns we‚Äôre talking about.  And honestly, the comments here kind of prove the point: we were never really taught to think critically. Instead of having an actual discussion, people are throwing around ‚Äúbahun,‚Äù ‚ÄúChristian,‚Äù or ‚Äúother cultures‚Äù like that somehow answers the question. When we turn conversation into belittling, blaming, or name-calling, we‚Äôre not defending culture but normalising this behaviour. I mean how hard is it understand you can agree to disagree without all these?|||Actually the closest thing that happens in the west like this is children beauty pagents  AT LEAST, at the very least, this Kumari affects one child over a years. USA child beauty pageants produce so many|||I think this is so cruelüòû a kid should not be isolated from the society, and should not be sit there to just take photo with tourists ..|||People talking about normal childhood and growing up \"normal\", a lot of misconception here.  Goodness flows through Kumari.  She is worshipped for being the medium of taleju bhawani. They are taught that they as an individual are not god, but the goodness that flows through her is what makes her worshipped.  And calling Kumari as a \"virgin goddess\" is stupid and a complete disregard of religious belief. It's a literal translation not a literary translation.   A lot of misconceptions have already been debunked.  Therefore they are able to integrate back into society well. They have good societal support . They are mentored, taught and are well taken care of. They themselves have immence respect for their religion and tradition.  If you think being a Kumari is wrong, you simply look at other practices in other religions. Nuns are not allowed to marry or consummate. Denying the right to marry and consummate can be considered as an oppressive practices denying one from their human desires. In radical Islam, burka, multiple marriages, denial of human rights for wemen.  While such petty comparisons are stupid themselves, what I want to say is we are worshipping female power. We are actually looking at females as devine. Not simply blind worship.   Nothing about today's childhood is normal.  You see young boys and girls sent off to boarding schools as normal? It's more isolating depressing. Parents just sticking their child to an iPad, or a hyperactive parent forcing their child through multiple activities (music class, sports, extra activities) even when their child may not want to to them, and pushing their child to extremes, putting their child through ridiculously high expectations, so that they can fulfill own ego( yes I've seen it happen).  A lot is not normal in so called modern normal childhood.   A lot of narratives and propogandas have infiltrated our thinking. Be water and explore into the culture. A lot has been written about Kumari from a propogandist and religious infiltration viewpoint.  A lot has been written to criticize our culture and ostracize ourselves from our religion and culture. Beware.|||Yeah agreed I thought it was just culture as a child but now I see it as different|||Sadhguru has spoken about the Kumari tradition of Nepal. It is an understanding about God making.

Over last few days, I read some articles, listened to podcasts and was surprised to learn that Kumaris until 2000 A.D. were not given any education. That must have set those girls back and must have struggled to transition. A case was registered in high court of Nepal but the court didn't make decision against Kumari tradition but asked to reform. There have been quiet few reforms.  This little kid is Royal Kumari now and will be raised by care takers and I guess her parents can visit her once a week. Atleast Kumaris of other places have option to live in their own houses.

But let‚Äôs be real: he‚Äôs the only king after Prithvi Narayan Shah who actually did something that mattered for the survival of Nepal.    Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus ‚Äî with nine governments in ten years. That wasn‚Äôt democracy, it was chaos. Leaders were busy stabbing each other in the back while the nation stayed dirt poor, uneducated, and vulnerable. Tell me, what ‚Äústable democracy‚Äù exists when governments collapse every year? None. Mahendra saw this and did what no one else had the guts to do: he hit reset.    Yes, he dissolved parliament. Yes, he banned parties. And you know what? He was right to. Without stability, Nepal was on track to become India‚Äôs backyard project or another pawn in the Cold War. Mahendra‚Äôs Panchayat system gave the country one thing it desperately lacked: stability.    And let‚Äôs talk achievements:    He balanced India and China like a chess master. Without him, we‚Äôd have been swallowed by one side decades ago.    He pushed Nepal onto the global stage ‚Äî Non-Aligned Movement, a stronger UN presence, and an independent foreign policy.    He jump-started modernisation: roads, schools, universities, tourism. These are things no king before him, and very few leaders after him, have been able to deliver at that scale.    But historians? They love to cry about ‚Äúdemocracy dying in 1960.‚Äù These same historians never admit that the so-called ‚Äúdemocrats‚Äù of the 50s were busy running the country into the ground. It‚Äôs easy to glorify B.P. Koirala in hindsight, but Mahendra was the one cleaning up the mess in real time.    Here‚Äôs the hard truth: Mahendra was the only king who actually acted like a king ‚Äî a protector of sovereignty. Everyone after him either coasted on his legacy or failed miserably. Without him, Nepal might not even exist as the independent state it is today.    Call him authoritarian all you want, but facts don‚Äôt lie. After Prithvi Narayan Shah, King Mahendra was the only true king Nepal ever had.",

He saved Nepal from being a puppet of foreign countries. He was a gem.|||Its not an unpopular opinion though. Those who know history know how Progressive Mahendra was. One thing though, his rapid advancements did over heat a fledgling Nepalese economy which is why we needed to privatize our industries. But the privatization was a joke,   they privatized it too quickly and privatization advocates in Nepal did admit they made a huge mistake later on.|||Mahendra is a complicated figure. On one hand, he did keep Nepal intact at a time when regional instability and internal divisions could have easily spiraled out of control.  On the other, his coup dismantled the first democratic experiment and concentrated power in the monarchy, which created long-term issues that Nepal is still untangling today.   It‚Äôs less that historians hate admitting he saved Nepal, and more that they frame it as a tradeoff between short-term stability and long-term democratic development.|||Popular opinion. It's because of Prithvi Narayan Shah and King Mahendra that modern day Nepal even exists as a separate country in its current form. Otherwise there would not have even been an independent country known as Nepal.|||His authoritarian enforcement of the Nepali language and Hindu traditions on a diverse population that wanted nothing to do with them was one of the causes of the civil war that would follow.  He killed democracy in its crib and pulled us back into medieval institutions. Even if I were to hypothetically accept that he was a good ruler for the sake of argument, there is no guarantee and his heirs and his heirs‚Äô heirs would have been good rulers, which is why absolute monarchy fails. Any good that he might have done during his reign is negated by the fact that long term institutions are more important than charismatic rulers, and he ruined the institution of democracy. All the instability that we have faced since 2008- would have happened in the 1950s and we could have been a prosperous democracy by the present. This guy pulled us decades back.  It‚Äôs easy to look back at the past with rose tinted glasses and romanticize it, that is the first step on the road to fascism, but the truth of life, prosperity and happiness is in the future and progressive institutions.|||The problem with Monarchy in Nepal and everywhere else is that there are few good apples in 1 crore ropani orchard.  Except PN Shah, Mahendra and maybe Birendra (many sources call him spineless but I don't know), no one else were fit to rule. The country fell into Ranas dictatorship  because of Monrachy system failure.  So here we are, dealing with generational political trauma.|||A quick ChatGPT will give you some real perspective:  Most historians and political analysts agree that King Mahendra‚Äôs reasons were more of a pretext to consolidate royal power rather than genuine democratic concerns. Here‚Äôs why:  1. Political instability was exaggerated  Nepal‚Äôs first elected government (1959‚Äì1960) under B. P. Koirala had been in office for only 18 months.  While there were some administrative problems, it wasn‚Äôt long enough to judge the parliamentary system a failure.  Corruption and inefficiency existed, but not at the level Mahendra claimed.   2. Fear of losing monarchical dominance  The 1959 elections gave the Nepali Congress a clear majority.  Koirala‚Äôs government was popular and gaining legitimacy, which posed a direct threat to the king‚Äôs absolute authority.  Mahendra feared the monarchy would become a ceremonial institution like in India or Britain.   3. Foreign policy pretext  Koirala pursued a relatively independent foreign policy, maintaining balance between India and China.  Mahendra accused him of endangering Nepal‚Äôs sovereignty, but in reality, the king wanted direct control over diplomacy, which was vital for aid and recognition.   4. Use of \"underdeveloped society\" argument  Mahendra claimed that Nepalese people weren‚Äôt ‚Äúready‚Äù for democracy due to illiteracy and lack of experience.  This was partly true, but instead of strengthening democratic institutions, he abolished parties and built a system where only the king‚Äôs will mattered.   5. The Panchayat system benefited him most  Under Panchayat, all political power flowed through the king.  It created the image of \"guided democracy,\" but in practice, it was royal autocracy with no accountability.   üìå Conclusion: Mahendra used the excuses of instability, corruption, and national unity to justify a royal coup. The deeper reason was to preserve absolute monarchy and prevent Nepal from transitioning into a genuine parliamentary democracy.|||Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus, with nine governments in ten years. That wasn‚Äôt democracy, it was chaos.  LOL. The King chose PM. He was the one responsible.|||Yes man agreed. He is the guy who defined Nepal and Nepali people. He did a lot of great works for the country. But many people and our school books consider him as a dictator telling about how he banned political parties and not mention about the reforms and development made by him for the country. One of the greatest leader of our country King Mahendra!!|||Ali history paddam, 1959 ma first election vako ho tyo vanda aagadi sab PM king le choose garya ho, 1st election ko 1.5 years ma coup vako ho.|||But his policies are disastrous for Nepal till this day  He opened Nepal's border with India, opened free trade with India, allowed India to build its Army base in Lipulekh Limpiyadhura Kalapani since then these territories are occupied by India  He also forced Khas culture on Newaris and Janjatis which influenced them to become Communists|||Agreed!|||Will not let anyone discredit the blood of 17k Nepali|||We wouldn't have been swallowed by any side. Non-alignment was the default policy from the beggining, and B.P koirala would have continued that policy. Nepal would have 'modernized' without an iron-fisted dictatorship.|||Matrika literally wanted to suck cock of india..   He was puppet of India...while BP was good...Matrika and BP's power struggle caused mahendra to step in...and take all the powers..   Thats my unpopular opinion too.|||I agree with most of your points. But your point about 10 governments in nine years doesn't show the instability created by parties but by the monarchs. The monarchs were the ones that were making them unstable. The one time it seemed to be stable, he couped the government. That doesn't diminish the fact thought, that his rule saw probably the most balanced foreign policy of Nepal, where Nepal truly stood out as a sovereign nature. I still believe that had Mahendra controlled a bit of his authoritarian ways and worked together with B.P. Koirala, Nepal would have been in a much better position that it is currently. Both of them are the best leaders Nepal had post P.N. Shah. It might be an unpopular opinion but I think P.N. Shah might be more important historically, but these two are probably the best leaders Nepal got, even better than P.N. Shah.|||Unpopular hoina, brain-dead opinion.

Mahendra model of nation-building was \"one religion, one custom, one language.\" Hindu orthodoxy was enforced as state ideology, treating non-Hindu communities as second-class. Nepali was imposed as the only legitimate language, sidelining rich traditions like Maithili, Newar, Tharu, Tamang, Limbu, etc. This wasn't genuine unity - it was control through forced uniformity. What looked like stability was in fact suppression. That brittle foundation is why today's Nepal wrestles with federalism, ethnic assertion, and identity politics: democracy didn't invent division, it revealed what had long been silenced.  The Koiralas, born and educated in Banaras, were accused of being \"too Indian.\" But Nepal had no universities, no political freedom, no space for intellectual growth - precisely because the tyrants had closed those doors. Should they be condemned for seeking ideas in India, or credited for importing the democratic imagination Nepal lacked?  So the paradox is clear:  Mahendra centralized the state but weakened society.|||First question, why was Nepal unstable during those years? And second more important question, if stability was the most important thing for us, why did he take over from a parliament that had a 2/3 majority and the government was led by THE BP Koirala? There was a little chance that the Koirala govt would have toppled and was doing good work..  Yes, there were some long term projects under him that were very good for Nepal. There‚Äôs no denying that and kudos to him. But he was authoritarian, there is no denying that either. Let‚Äôs not over glorify someone and gloss over facts because they don‚Äôt fit our views..|||Educated boomers hate him(my boomer dad lol).|||Nepal was too small for the OG Mahendra.

            "body": "Shrinkhala has shot herself in the foot with all the recent posts and videos. While the whole nation is mourning the dead, she comes forward and tries to make it all about herself. I'm in disbelief at what I'm seeing. She thought waiting a few days for the country to mourn and then posting about her \"innocence\" would help her but this has only made her look more defensive and pathetic. She stayed formulating all these \"proofs\" and preparing scripts while kids were being murdered on the street. This is what the final boss of victim card looks like.   Providing excel sheet as proof is diabolical. I wonder how she even got into Harvard.",

While the country was grieving and people were literally risking their lives for justice, she was sitting back, polishing a script and preparing an Excel sheet to clear her image. That‚Äôs not just tone-deaf, it‚Äôs calculated. The timing, the fake vulnerability, the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm innocent‚Äù narrative, it‚Äôs all image management. And to drop that while the nation is still mourning? It‚Äôs actually disgraceful. Her silence during the peak of the movement spoke volumes, and now this video just confirmed everything people feared about her. Honestly, if this is the ‚Äúfinal boss‚Äù of playing victim, it‚Äôs a pathetic one.|||Tyo excel sheet banauna plan gareko PR team lai fire hannei parxa Shrinkhala leüòÇüòÇ|||Feels like Nepal ma kei garnu bekar ho.

Look at me. Oh woe is me. It would have been nice if she showed support to the movement, and later clarified from her perspective after things settled down but this is waaay too soon.

I got a sudden boost in heart-beat thinking she actually shot herself & unlived her|||Hijo matrai I saw a YouTube video of thesadiapsychology‚Äôs scam who provides everything but proof that she is a licensed psychologist with degrees. It‚Äôs a different story but that‚Äôs exactly how I felt watching Shrinkhala‚Äôs videos.  I never idolized her or hated her, but this is too much. It was giving manipulation & narcissism. It‚Äôs one thing to defend her reputation, but completely another to do so by playing the victim card, shifting narratives & repeatedly saying things so that they are perceived as truth & dodging accountability by blaming others. Tbh it really bothered me that she (and her PR team) thought that we‚Äôre dumb enough to believe those excel sheets. Maybe what she said is true, but she could have showed the actual proof.  In her place, all of us would feel terrible. But to say things like leaving instagram account as it is so that it can be a testament to hate while not acknowledging her silence on a platform with a million followers over deaths of youth is crazy. Becoming an influencer means you are sometimes answerable to questions & accusations, it‚Äôs not just about making your feed aesthetic & scoring brand deals. People turned her into an influencer, so ofc she will have to be answerable sometimes. I wonder what she thought? Yea it‚Äôs not easy, but it‚Äôs part of all that fame & money.  To see that she was so concerned about setting her narrative & defending her image while not even feeling sorry for those who died, were injured & whose families are now forever incomplete is baffling.   Her narrative has been set forever now. Clearly, not to everyone, but to lots of us. Someone said that she‚Äôs only sad now because she lost followers, and that pretty much sums up how I see her now.|||Tesko bhanda ta Anmol KC ko acting ramro yarr|||Aafule khaneko khaldo ma aafai parnu vaneko ehi ho :D|||Yeah couldn't agree more.

Honestly asking. Why did the Nepo Kids trend include her? I have read somewhere that people hate her now because she said she will fight against corruption when she is the daughter of Binod Khatiwoda so that made her a hypocrite. Was Binod Khatiwada known to be corrupt? Please dont tell me that every politician is corrupt. I am asking if there has been any concerns raised regarding Binod Khatiwada like he owning multiple buildings, cars etc when he is only a politician.    If no one really knows that her dad is corrupt, her defensiveness makes sense to me. I too would be devastated if my image was destroyed for no apparent reason.   Again.. I am saying this because I honestly don't know about Binod Khatiwada.|||K garos ta garna chai, yeti sab vaisakdaa, yeti sab accusations huda, euta manche le aafno clarification ta dihalxha ni yr.

Most probably of balen or old political parties. Mr. Sampang has done a lot of good things and  there are still a lot of things that remain for him to do. He is not a conventional leader with sweet tounge . Dude is cocky as hell and always spits harsh words. But nobody even his haters can deny his love for the nation. Even I don't like him and criticize him all the time because of how critical and straight forward he keeps himself all the time. It's idiotic. But the criticism is more of a constructive one to keep him in check. But these jholeys with all sorts of anonymous names claiming to be dharanis have similar patterns. They are completely dismissive of sampang. So it's not difficult to know that they are politically motivated. And about shram daan, if this jhole knows anything about how Singapore and china built their nation initially he wouldn't be talking about all this crap.|||Yo political kura gare jasto lagyo,gareko sabai kuralai normalize garne,tmi dharan kai bhaye pani kewal shramdaan lai maatra nahera ta tyo baheka aru pani gareka xan.kehi garekai xaina jasto banaune prayas ho ra?|||Sabai le afno afno area ma sudhar gare vai halyo.

But there are still people who are supporting her, because sabai kura easily trust garna mildaina especially when it's mostly allegations. Gossips lai prove garna ni sakinna. Pls read until the end.  So, recently Tiktok ma ekjana le Shrinkhala ra Shambhav ko total 9 jana ko group le Shey phoksundo ma Army ko helicopter bata 'rescue' ko naam lidai misuse gareko witness gareko bhanyo. They said majjale ramairako, hasirako thyo re yo 9 jana ko group, ani helicopter aayera lagyo re. News portals ma ni news bhetincha rescue gareko bhanera. Malai chai valid proof nai chahirathyo pattyauna. Given how she has been portraying herself through social media and PR videos, it was time we start questioning their misuse of power.   I wanted to see pictures of that 'rescue' operation. Having some free time, I did some internet digging and found a facebook page of Nepal Army posted on October 2023. It exactly matches the news portals and tiktok user's claim, plus Shrinkhala‚Äôs story(it's on her story highlights). Yes, Summit air use gareko vlog cha, but my guess is ktm to dolpa jana lai use gareko ho, not return to ktm.   Picture: collage of the picture on fb page of Nepal army, then Shrinkhala‚Äôs group of 9 people who went to Shey Phoksundo. Luga haru milcha, anuhar ni milcha. You can see that it's the same group.   This really shows how much power is misused in Nepal and the recent nepo-kids trend was helpful to shed light on this. I am also against all the opportunists who posted against their exes to gain relevancy during vulnerable times. Aba chahi we should think twice before blindly following social media figures.",

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect.

THEY GHOSTED ME WTF  ANI CRAZY THING I JUST CHECKED IF THE BUGS STILL THERE GUESS WHAT THEY FIXED IT AND I DID NOT GET MY BOUNTY!!  If I had not reported this they would have to face a use loss as everyone could access any course for free!!!   What should I do guys I need my bounty any how I mean if it was a huge bug??   Many suggested to sue them but its a huge and jhamela process üòî",

To the people wanting to know what it is . Ambition guru gives a week trial , providing recorded video of lectures but there's a catch while other top educational institutions of Nepal and india give access to 2 3 units that too the basic ones only ambition guru knowingly or unknowingly provided the file with all recorded video with all notes and everything but they were not that good tbh it worked only as reference and to get some extra insights .  To this young innocent guy here , I too thought about reporting it and asking a bug bounty but I already knew I was not going to get any so I just opened my laptop and got an extension named M8UL downloader or something to download all those videos , ( why I downloaded an extension?? : cause institutions upload videos in small small chunks of file that play altogether to form a video , like you you download from other extension you will find files of 8sec 15sec more than 100 of such files will exist there and the extension I mentioned just compiles them all and let you download the full video ) .|||Hello u/Space_X_Offical, thank you for contributing to r/NepalPlusTwo.

You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

It's not due to lack of knowledge from his side that makes it hard for us to grab the concepts, it's just the fact that he's shit at teaching and doesn't care about whether or not everyone understands. Regardless, I'm studying CS and want a good base in maths for the future. Mero first term aaudai cha, I tried to go through a few YouTube channels, some of them are alright but I already struggle with maths & physics so it's pretty difficult to understand *everything* I'd appreciate it if anyone could suggest any channels (or alternative platforms) which are good.

            "comments": "my suggestion would be that stop expecting everything from teachers in 11 and 12 and figure out what way of study suits you the best because if you are reliant on your teachers for every study resources then you'll get in trouble in bachelors or forward because here teachers  dont even give a shit if there sound is audible let alone good lectures i left relying on teachers in my 11 12 days because all of our clz teachers were shit and had to self study every chapter. if you are in 11 theres a high chance that you are yet to figure out your true study method. for me reading book line by line worked the best and i reckon this is the most optimal way to study as it not only helps you cover everything on your sylbs but also prepares you for high intensity study environment which is very essential for higher level studies..and if you're not understanding mechanics then there's a high chance that you're not willing to learn mechanics because it is the portion of  physics where you can follow everything intuitively and is most interesting one so try to learn it conceptually relating it to real life stuffs. as for yt channel ig physics wallah will be good but there will be a lot of things which are not in our course.. however you can try and learn yourself by reading books and if you dont understand any sentence then you can use chat gpt to crack it down ..and a free tip., understand derivations very effectively like every line and term, why and how they are there because if you do so you'll be able to solve every numerical, and also solve as much mcqs and numericals as you can|||Royera|||do past papers|||Hello u/Swiss_16, thank you for contributing to r/NepalPlusTwo.
