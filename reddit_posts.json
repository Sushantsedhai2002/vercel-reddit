As someone who geeks out over linguistics, I realized I was seeing something I’d never personally witnessed before: the involvement of local, non-mainstream languages in election campaigning.  ​Usually, everything is in the \"official\" or dominant language, but this time I saw posters featuring Newar (Nepal Bhasa), Urdu, and Tibetan.  ​I’ll admit my ignorance—as a non-Newar, I had never actually seen the Newar language in written form used to promote an election before. Seeing it alongside Urdu and Tibetan makes me so curious about the selection process.  ​Is this a sign of campaigns moving toward hyper-local inclusivity? Or is it a tactical move to reach specific \"pockets\" of voters that have been traditionally overlooked? I’m particularly interested in:  ​The Newar script: It’s such a powerful cultural statement to see it in a public, political space.  ​The Urdu/Tibetan choice: These feel like very specific demographic \"nods.\" Is this happening more frequently in certain districts?  ​I’d love to hear from anyone who lives in these areas or knows more about the political strategy behind this. Is this a new trend for the upcoming 2026 elections, or have I just been blind to it until now?",

            "body": "Dear all,  The impending March 5, 2026 elections represent a pivotal moment for Nepal, serving as a direct referendum on the September 2025 Gen-Z Uprising. Should the established political class, the very architects of the corruption and censorship that ignited the September 8 protests secure re-election, Nepal faces the grim prospect of systemic retributive justice. These entrenched elites view the digital-native, leaderless mobilization not as a call for reform, but as an existential threat to their patronage networks. If returned to power, they are likely to initiate a coordinated campaign of historical revisionism, discrediting the sacrifice of the martyrs and the thousands of students who marched in uniform as mere \"foreign-funded anarchy,\" thereby stripping the movement of its moral legitimacy. Furthermore, a victory for the old guard in key constituencies would almost certainly signal the beginning of a legalized crackdown on youth activists. Under the guise of \"national security\" and \"restoring order\" after the September unrest, a re-installed government would likely weaponize the judiciary to pursue reprisals against movement leaders and digital organizers. By jailing activists under false pretenses or \"cyber-terror\" charges, they seek to ensure that the spirit of defiance seen at Maitighar Mandala never resurfaces. To the voters in these critical districts: re-electing these figures is not a return to stability; it is a green light for the state to punish the very generation that fought for accountability, effectively trading the nation's future for the preservation of a corrupt status quo. Failure to heed this warning in the March 2026 elections risks plunging Nepal into a cycle of existential, nation-ending conflict, where the suppression of a generation's hope could ignite a total institutional collapse. If the old guard is permitted to weaponize the state against the very youth they failed, the resulting unrest will likely transcend mere protest, evolving into a fragmented and irreconcilable struggle that threatens the very territorial and social integrity of the Nepali state. This internal fracturing will inevitably be exploited by external powers, transforming Nepal into a high-stakes chessboard for the USA, India, and China. Because Nepal serves as the critical \"underbelly\" to China’s sensitive Tibet region, Beijing will view any prolonged instability or \"digital revolution\" as an intolerable threat to its frontier security, potentially triggering a heavy-handed intervention to secure the Himalayan rim. Simultaneously, the United States and its allies may seek to fully utilize and weaponize this unrest to pressure China at its most vulnerable border, while India- wary of losing its traditional sphere of influence will be forced to intervene to prevent a total strategic vacuum. In this scenario, Nepal ceases to be a sovereign nation and becomes a permanent proxy battleground, where the \"Old Guard\" will happily trade away our land and our future to foreign interests just to maintain their grip on power.",

It was a monument to time wasted, to ambition stalled.  One Tuesday, rain slicked the pavement, matching my grey mood. I paused, looking up. In a jagged crack running down the brick face, something glimmered. A small bird had built a nest deep within the fracture. As I watched, she settled over her eggs, a speck of vibrant life in the brokenness.  The tower wasn't keeping time; it was hosting it. Its stillness wasn't failure, but a different kind of shelter. The hands weren’t stuck—they were pointing, forever, at a moment of resilience.   I walked on, footsteps lighter. The tower wasn't a symbol of what was broken, but of what holds fast despite it. My fatigue wasn't an end, but the quiet space where new things could begin to grow. The hands, I decided, pointed not to 2:17, but to the precise moment I chose to see not ruin, but refuge. Now, every journey home passes under a tower that tells the most important time: the present, where we stand, and rebuild.",

Most teachers aren't christians, similarly with the students. Its non existent. The most christian part of the school is that they can provide catechism classes to some Christian students if they want it and they have mass or smthing (i was never went/had to go).   I'm an atheist and grew up in a Buddhist family so i can say that much. Other than that, the school is pretty good, not as modern as other schools since the fee is def at the lower end of the spectrum for good schools. The school campus is nice but the classrooms are meh at best. They have pretty nice clubs and has the whole traditional english house system like in hogwarts with a head girl/boy situation. The A levels dept in maitighar defo got the most funding. Also the +2 dept in maitighar is def one of if not the best in ktm.

If you tweak the font size of Kalimati, it can match (difference is unnoticeable) the Preeti font size. For example, Kalimati's font size 11 (almost) matches Preeti's 15.  So, in your document with Preeti font, you can type only त्त्व portion in Kalimati, and let the rest be in Preeti font.  If you have already typed most in Preeti and have half-त (त्) everywhere in Preeti, hit `Ctrl + H` (find and replace) in word. In Find what: search for Preeti त्त्व (you can search for only Preeti font by clicking Format > Font in the dialog box). Then, in Replace with: त्त्व (click Format > Font, and in the next dialogue box write Font field as Kalimati in both Latin text and Complex Script, also font size 11 in both Latin text and Complex Script). Then start replacing.  This is for anyone, or even me in the future, if they need one.  In my personal opinion, Preeti font is cool but outdated. I haven't tried many fonts but Kalimati seems to be the winner cause you can type it in Unicode and still have that Preeti-like font style.

            "body": "I’m an Android developer and a couple of years ago I built an app called **TelecomPacks**. The idea was to make mobile pack activation less painful for Nepali users.  Play Store link:   👉 [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.thegbguy.telecompacks](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.thegbguy.telecompacks)  **What the app actually does:**  * Makes **USSD calls on the user’s behalf** * **Parses the USSD responses** * Converts those text-based menus into **clear buttons** for data/voice/SMS packs * So users don’t have to remember codes or go through confusing `*141# → 1 → 3 → 2` type flows  From a dev perspective, I thought this would be genuinely useful. But in reality, it hasn’t gained the traction I expected.  So I wanted honest feedback from this community:  1. Do you think an app like this is actually useful for Nepali telecom users? 2. If yes, **what features would make it worth keeping installed?**    * Pack comparison between NTC/Ncell    * Smart recommendations based on usage    * Recharge/expiry reminders    * Better UI/UX    * Something else entirely? 3. If no, would you say this problem is already “good enough” with existing carrier/e-payment apps, and I should stop investing time into it?  I’m trying to decide whether to improve this app meaningfully or abandon it and move on.

Before, Gyanendras coup America and India were backing the military action by providing military aid and financial aid to the country. USA was willing to give Nepal 5 mi-24 gunships, that would’ve militarily defeated the maoists and the deal was also done. However, after the coup everything changed. Being the “Moral” country, they stopped supporting him as apparently he became an authotarian.  Then, Shivapuri massacre by Bhairavnath battalion was the last straw and a good excuse for them to turn against the regime.   Gyanendras biggest political move was dissolving the Parliament. Even, most of the army generals agree with this, as that incident stopped RNA to get weapons required to crush the insurgency. As that move effectively stopped “lethal” weapons to come inside the country and diplomatically isolated Gyanendra.|||I don’t go to the part of accusations that he may have killed his own brother , may not have been able to form a coalition with political parties , but deep down i feel he knew what the political parties are planning to do , what their intention was , He house arrested different leaders , gained absolute party for the country, but he was still the leader ; a king of the sovereign country who shouldn’t be interfered by Indian or US ambassadors, he was still the KING.

And sex is a way from which men can feel better, also if he marries only 1 wife and what if she got periods? He won't be able to have sex with her so if he marry more wives he can have sex and feel better. \"  Honestly, this was literally what she told me.  Then I asked, what will you do? Will you let your husband marry another girl? Can you see your husband with someone else?  She replied, \" Yes, I would let him marry another wife because he is my husband, I won't want to do anything except what islam tells to do.\"  That was like the end of the conversation and I was speechless since this was very uncomfortable to even hear. But at the same time, maybe she isn't educated or she is from rural area of pakistan. So if any of nepali muslim are here. Can you explain this? Also what do other people think about it?",

I have muslim friends. And there is a rule or reason for allowing multiple marriages. First, if a woman is alone with no support system financially or emotionally or even handicapped , then a married man can marry her with the agreement of both herself and the first wife. Second, if the previous husband of the woman meets an untimely death then another man can marry her despite having first wife, the reason being same as the first. Thirdly, the man must distribute his attention, wealth and love to all of his wives equally. Then ma must be wealthy and capable of loving all this wives. He cannot pick one and favour her only.  So the conclusion is A man can marry multiple wives only for supporting the woman. Anything else, lust or greed is haram My thoughts is, muslim is still rooted in patriarchy.

            "body": "Poor governance led regime change in Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka: Doval. Indian National Security Advisor Ajit Doval remarks that the most important people are those who build and nurture institutions. “The rise and fall of the great empires, monarchies, oligarchies, aristocracies or democracies is actually a history of their governance. In the recent cases of regime change through non-constitutional methods in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and others, these were actually cases of poor governance,” Doval said. And that is how governance matters, he added.  “In the end, it all boils down to the fact that the Roman Empire fell because it was mismanaged. The same applies to the French Revolution, Tsarist Russia, and the Mughal Empire—they all declined. In the post-war period, out of 37 countries that faced various degrees of degradation, 28 failed, were degraded, or got balkanized due to poor governance,” he added. “Change of regimes through non-institutional methods in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and others were actually cases of bad governance.”  According to the Times of India, Doval pointed out that economic failures, food and water shortages, inflation, oppressive taxes, and social conflict are key reasons behind the state failures and stated that governance creates nations and powerful states and role of people is important who build and sustain institutions.  He noted that there are some commonalities on why some states rise and some states fall. “One has been authoritarianism. It has remained relevant in the past 3,000 years of recorded histories,” said Doval. He added: “Institutional decay…internal security collapses or bureaucracies become inept and corrupt. The other factor is economic failures and scarcity of food and water.”  Doval stressed that the power of a nation lies in governance. “The government works through institutions and in the task of nation-building, the most important people are those who build and nurture these institutions,” he said.  \"The common man has become more aware and aspirational, has higher expectations from the state, and the state has a vested interest in keeping him satisfied,\" he said.  Describing weak governance as a potential reason for regime change, the NSA cited the examples of the change of regimes through non-institutional methods in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and others.  \"The power of a nation lies in governance. The government's work through institutions and in the task of nation-building, the most important people are those who build and nurture these institutions,\" he said.

Ukraine has lasted 4 years under Russian assault. Russian Army has hired mercenaries from Nepal, India and various countries from Africa, South America. They got official help in the form of troops and equipment from North Korea and China but still Ukraine has held its ground. Do these geopolitical analysts think Nepal will last 4 years? We will fold within minutes.  Like Doval said Nepal's future if the clown show continues is poor governance > ruined economy > balkanization > secession/accession  [If the same parties win, then it's another round of state collapse. This time balkanization will follow. Convince your parents to rethink their vote because Taukes will lead the country to that path.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalSocial/comments/1q3jvla/3_tauke_musical_chair_result_zero_development_no/)  |**Process** |Primary Driving Force|**Primary Outcome**|**Cooperation Level**| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |**Annexation**|Inward (Addition)/ **Centripetal** (Expansionist)|Incorporation of territory into an existing state.|Typically unilateral or forced.| |**Merger / Accession**|Inward (Unification)/ **Centripetal** (Unifying)|Voluntary or semi-voluntary joining of a territory into a larger state.|Generally involves a treaty or legal agreement.| |**Secession**|Outward (Withdrawal)/ **Centrifugal** (Divisive)|A region breaks away to form a new independent state.|Usually contested; requires recognition for success.| |**Balkanization**|Multiple (Fragmentation)/ **Centrifugal** (Extreme Fragmentation)|A larger entity splits into several smaller, hostile states.|High conflict; breakdown of central order.| |**Irredentism**|Target-Oriented (Reclamation)/ **Centripetal** (Reclamation)|A state claims or seizes territory based on historical or ethnic ties.|Often leads to interstate war or \"stealth\" support for secession.|",

Don't you have the capacity to explain it by yourself?|||totally agree with his statement|||what he said is correct but  asif Mr. Doval and his agency had no influence over these national governance being bad...He and the agency was always criticized by the nepali media and the netizens and now you want to quote him because he spoke what you like ?  what if he is saying that to brush off the faults of the way his agency  worked in these countries and put the blame entirely on government? You lots would worship the worst criminals if he spoke against the old governance !|||Lol Doval and laser eyed jaishankhar should focus on India. Modi administrations foreign policy is an absolute disaster. India has lost Bangladesh to the point that it can be considered a hostile state. Pakistan had always been hostile, now after the war pakistan in some ways has proven to the world that it is by no means militarily weaker than India resulting in the defense pact with Saudi Arabia. During the war Turkey and China expressly stood with Pakistan, not a single middle or great power stood with India, its \"sitting on the fence\" stance has left it without friends.  And your concern about balkanization and seccesion has no merit unless idiots like Balen shah starts hanging greater nepal map in the PM office like those Bangladeshi idiots who threaten to separate the seven sisters from India or if RSP basking in the galore of populism decides to do away with federalism and we reach 2015 level of distrust with madesh.|||Here, So called Spy Ajit Doval remark of \"Poor governance\" means that oli can't control the protest by jailing the students protestors for more than 5 years without trials or jailing the own Scientist & activist like Sonam more than 3 months just fake cases of UAPA. He may be trying to say that our government must do lathi charge on teachers who come to protest  on paper leaks. Or Just cut the internet of the region if people come to protest for their rights. May be paroling the rapist to win election or Just jailing the Journalist who does their job.  What \"Poor Governance\" looks like an Entire region was burning and the prime minister visited every country even though their citizens did not know the country name except their own part Manipur. Where peoples killed each other & women raped and parade on road naked.  These bigots have no right to speak about the poor governance of other countries.|||Very true.",

So I let go.  Today, Santa is a chapter — not the whole book. She taught me how deeply I can love, and how important it is to walk away when circumstances refuse to meet your sincerity.  I didn’t become cold.  I became stronger.  My focus returned.  My goals became clearer.  And my heart, though once broken by something beyond control, is healing — wiser, grounded, and resilient.  Some people don’t leave because they stop loving you.  They leave because society teaches them whothey’re allowed to love.",

            "body": "The Case for Results Over Politics Demanding Kulman Ghising’s resignation by painting him as a party Vice President is a political rush, not a legal necessity. 1. The Legal vs. Political Reality First and foremost, he is not legally a member of any political party. Secondly, every election in Nepal’s history has been conducted under party-led governments. Labeling this as a conflict of interest now is nothing more than selective outrage. 2. Results Matter More Than Affiliations The real issue isn't party politics; it’s performance. When you remove a leader who is actively delivering results mid-stream: Critical projects are left in limbo. The public ultimately pays the price for the delay.  In a political landscape where governments often last only six months, Kulman isn't \"clinging\" to power. He is trying to finish the work he started. His stance that \"even if I leave, a capable successor must take over\" is a demand for institutional continuity, not an expression of personal ego. 3. The Motive Behind the Attacks Unfortunately, certain media outlets and individuals are spreading misinformation to force a high-performing leader into an outdated political frame. This is happening because Kulman’s managerial success directly threatens the interests of those who profited from the old, corrupt system. The Bottom Line: This isn't a question of holding a position; it’s a question of whether we allow progress to be halted. If the work stops, no one has the moral right to question the ethics of his resignation.",

There is a free program called Flavortown run by Hack Club in collaboration with GitHub for high school students ages 13–18. Students build and ship open source projects on GitHub and earn points for the time they spend.  Those points can be exchanged for real prizes like a MacBook Air, iPad Air, Quest 3, Nothing headphones, and more. It is not a competition and there is no cost to join.  Seems like a good way to encourage younger students to actually build projects instead of just following tutorials. Worth sharing with younger siblings or any high schoolers interested in coding.

Every big parties have jholeys, and will always have. Congress/UML have even more, in fact most of them are. RSP at least have a mix.  We need more swing voters. I wish big parties jholeys drop and we have more independents/swing voters.  Rabi is ok. He is no saint but 1000× better than any leaders in the old parties. All those above that you think he did are mere accusations and unrelated to politics and abuse of power. You wont find any other politician who contributed so much before getting into it. But thats not biggy either.  I am voting for them this election. Biggest reason is the RSP team and not just Rabi.|||Dherai nasocha ekpatak new Lai chance dim vanne ho teti matra bujha|||It was a autocorrection error, you must know who is Netanyahu and who is backing him up and who is he attacking and why.

We skipped the formal lectures and kept things simple—just hands-on demos and honest conversations. The goal wasn’t to teach a full curriculum in an afternoon; it was to show these kids that technology isn't out of reach.  As a student-led initiative, we don't have a big corporate engine behind us. We’re just a group of peers showing up and leading where we can. This reel captures some of the curiosity we saw that day—it’s a small start, but a meaningful one.

            "body": "This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

Required fields - **vehicle_id** - **trip_id** - **route_id** - **latitude** - **longitude** - **timestamp**  Update rate - Every **10–20 seconds**  ---  **TripUpdates feed (optional)** Used to calculate delays and ETAs.  Optional fields - **trip_id** - **delay** (in seconds) - **stop_id**  ---  **ServiceAlerts (optional)** Used for strikes, diversions, or road closures.  Fields - **route_id** or **stop_id** - **alert text**  ---  **Absolute minimum stack** - Static GTFS with fixed IDs - VehiclePositions real-time feed  **Reality check** - Exact timetables not required - Ticketing systems not required - Stable IDs + live GPS is enough for Google Maps|||its too small, i cant read the words, tried the drive pdf too",

You see, the problem with our generation is we read too less to judge a person and almost fail to account the then social and political scenario of the country. So, my suggestion would be you read yourself and don't judge him based on my opinion or other few incidents or stories mentioned in the comments.   Personally, He gave me the definition of democracy. Here is one story of his conversation with his nephew Naresh Koirala.   *Naresh himself had been puzzled by his uncle’s decision to accept the result. On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP. Mahendra and Birendra believed themselves to be the savior of common \"*naive\"* Nepali.    While BP simply believed that Nepali people irrespective of their education, culture, caste, religion, sex or whatsoever are capable to choose their leaders themselves and make them responsible.|||One of the greatest writers, Nepal has ever produced.|||This guy high moral values unlike present  Congress.

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.  I (21M) and my sibling (15F) are taking care of our parents during the day and our cousins help at night. Because of this, we’ve missed months of classes but we don’t really have a choice right now.  If anyone is able to help even a small amount, it would mean a lot to us.  I’ve verified the case with two of the mods and I’ll be posting medical reports in the comments as well.  Please DM or comment if you can help in any way. Even sharing this post would really help.",

            "heading": "AMA : I have been using menstrual cups for ~8 years. Ask me anything.",
            "body": "**Disclaimer** : this is not an Ad. I have been using menstrual cups for around 8 years and have recommended it to many women in my life. All have loved it and have made the switch from pads/tampons. So i decided to spread the word here.   **Tldr**: Menstrual cups will change your life. it will give you much more freedom and flexibility than period products like pads or tampons.   First of all, what is a Menstrual cup?   A menstrual cup is a reusable, flexible silicone cup inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual fluid. It can be worn up to 12 hours and can be used for several years with proper care.   I have made a list of pro and cons that i have faced in these years. You are welcome to ask more questions. I will answer as many as i can. Serious questions only please!   **PRO**:   1. To start with the basics, menstrual flow is more than just liquid blood. it has many semi-solid/solid things like mucus and blood vessels. So a pad or tampons just cannot ‘absorb’ them. these things just lay there on the surface making you feel slimy and uncomfortable. Instead the cup ‘collects’ it so it doesn’t have this issue.  2. You dont have to worry about a pad shifting from its place. you know the feeling, when the pad is too far back or too far on one side. Also, you dont feel the blood flow ‘out’ like when you laugh or sneeze or stand up. Menstrual cup catches the blood before it gets out.  3. Its an upfront investment but one that will be much cheaper in the long run. You wont have to cash out hundreds of rupees each month on period products.  4. Its better for the environment as it creates little to no waste.  5. Its better when you are out, for example, at other people’s place. you dont have to worry about where to dump your used period products.  6. You dont feel it at all once its inside. you can just live your normal day and forget about it. then only at the end of the day you empty, clean and put it back on. (if its a heavy flow day then i empty it once in the middle of the day too)  7. No issues with friction / rashes on the inner thighs.   **CON** :   1. It has a slightly steep learning curve. I know a lot of people have anxiety of putting it in and getting it out. i did too. but once you have done it a couple of times, you will get a hang of it. There are many tutorials available online for this. I personally fold the cup in a C shape and put it in and then to be sure its secure, I check for suction by pulling/rotating it a bit. Getting it out can feel a bit scary at first. When getting it out, i hold the cup on its body and not just the tip to be sure that the tip doesn’t break. But like i said, once you have done it a few times, it will feel normal.  2. I find it most comfortable to empty the cup in a toilet that has a basin inside it. so I can empty it in the basin, clean the cup and put it in again. it can be done in a toilet stall (without basin) too but you have to be a bit more careful and you will need some tissues to clean the blood off your hands before coming out of the stall.  3. it requires a bit of investment in the beginning even to try (but it will pay off long term if it works out)  4. It can leak, very rarely but sometimes. The leakage is usually minimal so for this, you can use something light like panty liners or period panties. You can try out your options here.   **Recommendations**:   1. When first trying it out, you can try it for a couple of hours at a time when you are not having heavy flow and when you are staying home. This way you will also have an idea of how much blood comes out (spoiler alert: its much less than what you would expect) and how frequently you need to empty the cup.  2. always clean your hands with soap before and after putting/removing the cup.  3. hold the cup by its body (base of the cup) and not just its tip when pulling it out.  4. There are a lot of tutorials, feedback, helpful materials available online. Please be brave and give it a try. you will thank me later :)  —————————————————————————-  **Edit 1**: some people are asking about which brands to use. If someone is a new user of Menstrual cups, could you please let us know about your experience with it and which brand you are using?",

            "body": "Hello all,  My wife who is Nepali and I (American) are selling the house and moving to Nepal. I've started to learn a little Nepali, she grew up there until age 19 and she's fluent in Nepali, Hindi, etc. so for her we're going back home but for me it's a new world.    Thankfully I stayed there a few months and loved it however we're needing advice please.    We get retirement pay of around 620,000 Nepali rupees per month. When she lived there in high school she said her parents make around 100,000 rupees a month. With inflation, would 620,000 still be good? Or will it be tight? What should we expect to budget each month??? Thankfully we have enough cash saved up to buy a home so we won't have a mortgage payment.    Also, is Lalitpur area good for access to public transportation and some night life? Low crime? That's where we were looking to buy a home. I'm a panzy and need AC and hot water. Is that possible???   Lastly is there any general advice you'd give?",

You can rent a really nice house in Lalitpur and hire 2 maids for help around the house. That'll cost you like 100-200k per month   But there are other things you need to consider if you decide to permanently move to Nepal.  How will you keep yourself busy? You barely have a social network if you've been living away for so long. You'll come across many people and groups who are after your money. They'll befriend you until you keep giving them what they want. And you'll actually need some of them for networking, helping you with govt bureaucracy/corruption things.  Air quality is one of the worst in the world especially in cities like Kathmandu and Pokhara. Your medical costs may increase and insurance is a scam. But I guess you probably know more about it since you've lived in the US.  Driving is hectic and stressful so get a driver for Rs 25-40k a month who can also help around.  For all these services, try to use a trusted source and not just agencies.|||i think 620,000 Npr per month  is way more than enough.|||Public transportation may overwhelm you, so maybe you could have a ride of your own or even a small car if it goes with your budget. Having own vehicle helps a lot.|||If you’re planning a retired life, I wouldn’t really recommend settling in Kathmandu itself. The city is busy, noisy, and getting more congested every year. A better option would be to live slightly outside the city in a quieter area that’s still easily accessible for hospitals, markets, and the airport.  If you enjoy nature and scenery, areas around Pokhara are great. Beautiful views, a slower pace of life, and a good expat and tourist-friendly environment. Another option is the Terai region, especially if you like the idea of growing your own vegetables and fruits. Renting a house with some land for small-scale farming can be very rewarding, and you could even keep a few chickens or goats.  That said, if you still want to be close to Kathmandu, places on the outskirts like Budhanilkantha, Godavari, Bhaktapur or Kirtipur can offer a good balance between city access and a calmer lifestyle. Wherever you choose, just make sure healthcare access, road connectivity, and daily essentials are within reasonable distance.  Honestly, I think I just described my own retirement plan too haha|||Lalitpur is an accessible elite place.|||It's more than enough..Bhaktapur is starting to get polluted..but Lalitpur and Kirtipur are livable rn..there are bars and pubs in jhamshikhel if you wanna avoid crowded Thamel|||Wear a mask.|||What you have is more than enough for a extremely good life here. Cost breakdown could look something like this  Rent - Rs. 40,000 for a flat. (2BHK) in city area  Food - Depends but if you plan to cook yourself for most meals I would say Rs. 30,000 is enough  Utility - Electricity/internet water etc - Rs. 12,000   Education? - Do you have kids? If so, a high class Nepali standard school would probably be around 30,000 per kid  Misc (transport, eat out etc) - 20,000  Total - 162k say 170k per month (assuming 2 kids education). And this is extremely generous level of spending.   Lalitpur area is good. If you want night life may be stay close to Jhamshikhel area or area close to thamel.|||How We Left Australia to Start a Farm in Nepal with No Experience - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evJX2RekWvI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evJX2RekWvI)|||see , money is a different thing ,you will have learn to adjust things like narrow and unsafe roads , broken and insufficient services etc, but  but !  once you learn the ways here and kinda slow paced life over her I strong believe you will enjoy.|||600000k per month? bruh you can live like a king here with that kind of money|||She moved to her new world at 19 bro, so chill you guys will find ease here.|||620k is more than enough for really good lifestyle. No amount of inflation in coming years will make this insufficient, otherwise 95% Nepalese are doomed.  Buying house is kinda expensive in nepal but you can get decent amount of house with about 300k usd. When buying house, check if the land has enough spaces for road, near river, previously land was swamp and u should be good. Use google map historical data for this and you should be good. Harder part would be the cultural aspect for you, though having Nepali wife, you might have gotten the taste of it. Lalitpir is livable compared to kathmandu. Best of luck|||Student here can get Lavish life if they get Rs.20,000 per month. He can pay rents, hang out, buy groceries, clubs, drinking, anything.     You are getting that money Rs.20,600 per day. I can't imagine what a lavish life you will get here.|||Yup lalitpur is great, look into more upscale sanepa or jhamsikhel areas|||You will have a very good life with that amount monthly, you can also get a house as you said you have enough saving. AC and hot water no problem as well. You can ideally look to stay around patan, lalitpur or even shankhamul area if you get a house. If i was you than I will move to pokhara for a better cleaner and quite life.there is now a new higway which will now connect kathmandu and pokhara in just 3,4 hours, I think construction will finish soon. There is plenty of night life there near lakeside. I live in abroad and my plan is similar, to move back home. My home is in kathmandu, my parents migrated from pokhara.|||Hey man,  Same situation, you’ll have PLENTY of money and live a very very lux lifestyle with how much you make per month.   The biggest thing you need to realize is 1. Your access to everything drops significantly. If youre my size (5’11 205) you will have a hard time finding clothes and shoes. 2. The pollution here is beyond rough. Most days are in the hazardous levels. 3.  No beef (there are some places but its not very good) 4. Lalitpur is amazing, we live in thecho and there is no crime in our area. We have AC in the bedroom and a solar water heater for the full house.   Good luck and i hope you enjoy living here!|||At 620000 NRS per month, you should be able to leave a pretty luxurious life. You can but will struggle to spend that much unless you are going after all the highest of high end stuff.   Lalitpur is relatively calmer, quieter than some Ktm city centres and should be as good as anywhere else. I've seen a lot of high rises with apartments very similar to American / European ones in Sanepa area but not been there in a couple years.  I suggest one or both of you to learn to drive in Nepal. Assuming you both have a US driving license, it may take a few months to get used to the Nepali driving style, but it's totally worth it. Then you can get vehicles of your own because public transport sucks.  AC and hot water should be easy enough to get installed. If you are not bound to Ktm, I suggest you get a farm house in the outskirts / small hilly towns (dhulikhel, dhading, etc.) to escape ktm heat and pollution.  Keep your finances private, DO NOT fall into guilt trap and lend money. Do not tell how much money you have, not even those you consider close. Make sure your wife is able to handle the bureaucratic stuff because you may get taken advantage of (you'll learn as you go along). Make sure you know what the local rates for stuff are. No tipping in general, round up to next 100/500 if you're feeling generous but not as much as in the US. Do not trust the water, even the bottled ones outside, especially at first. Life is relatively slow and everything takes a lot of time and patience, especially paperwork, and bureaucracy. Invest your money in US as much as possible. Only keep a comfortable amount in Nepal. NRS deflation against dollars is crazy. Be careful during night time, crimes are not that high but still vigilance is warranted. Beware of the street dogs.  Hope you have a pleasant life in Nepal. Good luck and keep us posted.|||That’s awesome man. I think $4k/mo is plenty to live off. I haven’t been back in a while and others can correct me but basically beside rent and food and a bit of misc expenses there really isn’t anything else. No insurance. No taxes if you rent and don’t work (foreign income). So if I were in your shoes I’d save an outright 50% in a bank account giving like 6% interest and splurge the rest.   Nepal, and especially Kathmandu, is like anywhere else on the planet. You could live frugally and save a load of money or be high flying in elite circles that will have you broke just supporting your lifestyle.    Cheers man. You living the dream a lot of us dream of lol. Good stable income awesome Nepali life.|||Join some expat groups when you come (WhatsApp/FaceBook) so you can ask where to find things you miss from home. If you have any questions from an American living in Nepal perspective feel free to DM me. Good luck. 👍|||Your monthly retirement pay might be enough for sufficient lifestyle in lalitpur  , night life in lalitpur is not big as in thamel and is mostly surrounded by temples , buying house in lalitpur might be expensive but living in rent there might be frugal , i dont know much about house prices here and about transport , it is easily accessible|||this is decent for a good life here!|||I advise you to stay outside the valley, where there is good road access to Kathmandu, and it is quicker. Your retirement can leave a very good life in Nepal. Choose a good location where you get fresh air, which is impossible in Kathmandu valley|||With that much money you could di lot of things here !

Expensive and tight the money is good and should last you life time if spent properly.  You should consider staying in Raniban Kathmandu its safe and has a good expat community its clean fresh air and relatively cheap.  Rent for first 3 month and consider buying a house. Realestae in kathmandu is the safest investment. You could sell it with ease if needed.|||Money wise you are good. That is surplus money for living a decent life in Nepal. You might need to consider reinvesting surplus back in the US or invest here in Nepal to multiply further.  But major thing is what will you be doing here in Nepal? You can try to utilize your US skill here to engage and help Nepal and Nepali people.|||From a financial perspective,  you are quite well settled.  Lalitapur, good choice. For your budget I would prefer somewhere around the sanepa, jhamsikhel area, there are many embassy and other high profile residents so you won't get bad company, and live a lifestyle you want  From a social point of view. Since you mentioned retirement era, you could learn Nepali if you want which is optional btw   To make a retirement life. There are plenty of groups organizing hikes, trek and events, you along with your wife would join and enjoy the retirement life. Until you feel comfortable on your own.  Mostly, we Nepalese are kind towards foreigners, so you mostly should receive good hospitality. (Few exceptions could be anywhere )  Lastly, Welcome to Nepal. Hope you enjoy it here !!|||Its better to stay there|||If anyone around Balkumari/Lalitpur wants to play badminton casually, I’m looking to form a small group. DM me",

What “earning well” or “being rich” means will differ from person to person, but if you are creative and think a bit differently, there are genuine opportunities to make good money.  I am 24M, and I have already earned enough to build a new house, buy land, and make investments that are giving steady returns. My rental income / interests alone now matches what many consider a minimum wage job in Nepal. Aba eslai flex jasari vanea haina, but line vae you are welcome.  I agree that building one massive company or unicorn in Nepal is hard. But it is equally easy to build multiple small or medium income streams and make them work together. Tyo chai dherei le sochdaina. Ofcourse next Facebook is hard to be build in Nepal but Nepal can build 2 school management software sell it to 2 school ani also starting exporting them finger print device (this is very lame example but you get where i am going)  One big problem I see is how conventional people are about careers. Many wait for college to end, then wait for internships, then wait for referrals. Ani feri last maa nepotism vo vanera ultai runxan.  Send that email to an industry leader asking for work. Apply for remote jobs that pay in USD. Build skills that can be exported. Network aggressively. Be uncomfortable. Opportunities rarely come through formal paths in Nepal, but they do come if you knock hard enough.  People in my friend circle have achieved even more than I have, and I see this trend growing. More young people are figuring out how to combine remote income, local investments, and multiple side bets.  If things go right, building a 5 crore corpus while maintaining strong cash flow is not unrealistic. I am not saying 5 crore is some magical number, but starting from nothing and reaching that level in Nepal gives you freedom. Tespaxi i think its more of a choice if you want to work specifically for money or not. Hunata sabko afno life ra dream hunxa  Yes, it is not easy. And yes, people will say this only applies to tech. I disagree. Any field with a solid global market works. Nepal has an advantage: relatively cheap labor and living costs. If you can export your skills, services, or products to a stronger economy, the money is there.  Also $ huda sano sano investment opportunity cash in garna ni easy hune raixa. Nepal maa opportunity huda manxe snga lagani garne opportunity hudaina, so having some $ constantly coming through one work , you can fund another opportunity.  Aba new khojdai aaune lai ta k vannu ra but koi serious xa vane i am open to share more details. Malai few domain ko idea chai vaisako on how to go past that typical earning range chai. But again this post is not about specific field, so it depends on your skill and industry. But i can help with some strategies i took and you can see if anything you can apply from it, so maybe you can achieve even better result.  Edit (IMPORTANT) - This is not about something specific or me trying to sell any course etc LOL. I achieved this with my tech + investment + some side business skill ani i was trying to tell how euta primary job + some smart investment can open door in Nepal vanera. I am not trying to promote any specific skill or industry. I was bit happy today hence shared this, take it as motivation or feel free to DM/ask me about anything specific if you think that can help. I posted this etikai.     Edit 2 - Maybe this all thing will be more relavant if you are from tech background. Because that helps to get USD earning which can be invested in Nepal better. But not impossible for other industry.",

            "body": "After spending the last three years moving between digital marketing, software projects, and teaching, I thought I was building the “right” life. Good income, modern work, flexibility on paper but something felt missing.   So during breaks and holidays, I started asking myself a serious question:  What kind of work actually leads to a happy life?  I began researching different sectors and talking to people. Eventually, I kept coming back to agriculture.  I started visiting farms and speaking with farmers. I asked almost every one of them a simple question: \"Are you happy with your life?”  Almost all of them said yes  without hesitation.  And that surprised me.  These weren’t people living in luxury. Some of them had loans. Some worked long hours. Some didn’t own fancy things. But they had something that felt rare:  * They controlled their time * They worked with their hands and the land * They lived close to their families * They saw the direct result of their effort every day  Meanwhile, I noticed something else. In places like the USA and Australia, many people spend 30 years paying off homes and farmland. On paper, they are “successful.” But many of them barely see their families, live under stress, and don’t feel free.  So what actually makes someone happy?  It doesn’t seem to be money, or job title, or how modern your work is. It seems to be perception, freedom, purpose, and family.  Farmers may not be rich in the way society defines it but many of them are rich in time, peace, and connection. And those are things money can’t easily buy.  This made me rethink everything I was chasing.  Maybe happiness isn’t about climbing higher.   Maybe it’s about standing somewhere that feels right.  I ask everyone what happiness define you ?",

Idk what's happy about it.|||Will the farmer still be happy when he cannot afford to pay for his wife’s illness? Will he be happy to continue to do the hard labour till he is 90? Will he be happy when his children blame him for not being able to give them good schooling and a stable income source?   Your analysis of happiness is valid if the farmer earns well enough for basic needs+emergencies. Even if we forget other luxuries.  I understand money does not equate happiness but I am sure no none can still be happy if they are too poor to afford basic health and education.|||Then what are all the farmer suicides about?

Not to mention, fertilizers are never on time nor are quality seeds.   Stop romanticizing the labor and hard work of other .  Anyway, if you know that, why are you not being happy by starting farming ? Are you going to start farming? Or it’s just let them be happy why you suffer in screen and then post like you had epiphanies 😏🤣  But again, who is farmer? The one who owns land but don’t farm? Or the one who does the farming but is paid as labor? Since, they all claim it as agricultural income. Define farmer for me too.

More often than not, they got 1000% decimated because men are programmed to attack & protect.  And what do you think the wives of the warriors who died did? Do you think they fought? All of them? Fk nah. Maybe 5-10% of the women fought and died with honour. What about the remaining 90-95% ? They did what they’re biologically programmed to do. SURVIVE. They survived however necessary. So you draw the conclusions.|||WOMEN AREN’T HOMELESS BECAUSE THEY WILL SURVIVE EVERYTHING INSIDE THAT HOME, WILL DIE IN THAT HOME JUST BECAUSE OF FEAR OF BEING HOMELESS OR NOT HAVING A SAFETY NET OF A FAMILY.|||[deleted]",

            "body": "I was going through some debates about Islam and their worldview, but I could not shake off how radical the religion is. Mind you, I am not inferring all Muslims are inherently radical, but the religion shows tenets of extremism and oppression against women throughout its religious text.   i. Quran is supposed to be the word of god, divine and infallible. It is actually Allah speaking to us through the written texts by Muhammad. So there can not (or at least is very little room for) ambiguous interpretation of controversial things in it.   ii. Discrimination and violence against women is inexorably intertwined throughout the text. Here are some examples,   a. Surah An-Nisa 4:34: This verse states that men are guardians over women because Allah has made some excel others and because men spend their wealth on them. It advises men to admonish disobedient wives, separate from them in bed, and, as a last resort, ***strike them*** lightly if they persist in rebellion. (But, wives striking back at husbands is not permissible)     b. Surah Al-Baqarah 2:282: In financial transactions requiring witnesses, it specifies calling two men or one man and two women, so if one woman makes an error, the other can remind her (implying women's intellectual worth is exactly half as that of men).     c. Surah An-Nisa 4:3: Men are permitted to marry up to four wives if they can treat them justly, but women have no such polygamous rights.     iii. Discrimination and violence against 'non-believers' is called for multiple times. Here are some examples,   a. Surah At-Tawbah 9:29: Commands fighting those who do not believe in Allah or the Last Day until they pay the jizya tax in submission (tax acts as a deterrent, if you have to pay tax to believe in or worship god of your choice, you would just say fuck it in most cases).  b. Surah Al-Bayyinah 98:6: Describes disbelievers (those who reject Islam) as \"the worst of creatures,\" destined for Hell.     c. Surah At-Tawbah 9:5: Instructs killing polytheists wherever found after sacred months, unless they repent and convert.     These are only few examples that is readily available everywhere. Yet, we cannot even have open conversations about it due to 'political correctness'. The pillar of Islam is radical and is based on discrimination, violence and rejection of things non-islam. Tolerance is not part of the religion (just look at all the muslim nations and how they treat their women).   The percentage of Muslim population as the share of the country has been steadily growing. They are notorious for rejecting family planning and birth control measures and consistently have the highest fertility rates. Is there not a conversation to be had?      Disclaimer - This is not a 'hate-speech' or anything. Other religious scriptures have plenty of amoral or downright immoral tenets. This is just to understand more and create positive discussion. I believe Nepal should he secular with the right to religious freedom.",

Boycott them. Boycott religion. They are anti-freedom.|||Pashupati nath le Allah ko rakshya garun|||Oh boy!! Discussion about religion never goes the right way my brother. But anyways!!  1. If interpretation was minimal or not allowed, there would not be multiple schools. (Hanafi, maliki, hanbali). Islam in itself has been changing historically to fit context(famine), culture(india), geo-politics (iraq, egypt).   2. Islamic ethics is not derived from isolated verses alone, but from the Quran and the Prophet’s lived example. And it is mostly societal prejudice, lack of education, more than cultural. Have you seen rural india or even inner terai of nepal?   3. Mostly for written debt. And mostly as women were not heavily involved in economy. But the women always could inherit property, initiative divorce, and were considered independent moral agents accountable to God directly.  4. The other part matters maybe?  ``` If you fear you cannot be just, then marry only one.```   ``` You will never be able to be just between wives, even if you strive. ```  Again it is all about interpretation and was mostly for post war context (men died more women). Still better than sati that we had maybe?  5. Christianity flourished in Jerusalem. Hinduism strived under muslim empire in india. It is easier to find a church (egypt) or temple (Bangladesh) in islamic nation than to find a mosque in deep rooted hindu or christian area/nation (china?).   6. Every religion does this? Christianity - eternal damnation (wahtched vikings?), hinduism - karmic punishment, buddhism - rebirth in hell.  7. If state behaviour = religion then, Christianity- colonial genocide, Hinduism- caste oppression, Buddhism- Rohingya persecution.  Political power corrupts religious ideals. See turkey vs afghanistan, Indonesia vs Iran, saudi vs Bangladesh.  8.  Fertility drop sharply with education, urbanization, and women’s employment. Iran’s fertility collapsed after female education expanded. Bangladesh’s fertility fell dramatically without abandoning Islam.  Basically religion no good or bad, power corrupts people and corrupted people very bad. When this continues for long, the bad becomes the norm.   Basically,  वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्  सर्वे भवन्तु सुखिनः सर्वे सन्तु निरामयाः  विद्या विनयसम्पन्ने ब्राह्मणे गवि हस्तिनि शुनि चैव श्वपाके च पण्डिताः समदर्शिनः|||Their prophet was a pedo warlord. I ain't taking them seriously.|||Not a Muslim but every Muslim country to a certain extent has been destabilized by the west. One of the main things they did was kill all left leaning political movements hence making it easier for far right movements to take power. For eg Turkey 🇹🇷 has not had the type of western interference that other Muslim countries have and is a secular country. It gave women the right to vote in 1934. This question is like asking Bahuns hey do you secretly hate everyone because your religion has told you that you are genetically and spiritually superior to everyone else. And also Indonesia and Malaysia are both Muslim countries as well. And are more stable than the oil rich Middle East even though they both have faced CIA interference. Especially Indonesia. The Jakarta method is a terrifying documentary if you want to check it out.|||Why waste time? Better learn about world political history.|||I am a hindu but i will correct you or tell you  what i know 1. Mohammad was illiterate. He didnt write quran according to muslims it is just word go god sent by allah through jibrail. Conspiracy is it is mohammads jew friend who wrote  it.  Others are all correct|||Most religions, unfortunately, are based on discrimination, violence and patriarchy. Equality is not part of many religions (just look at the non-muslim nations like Nepal or India for example and how they treat/have treated their women, i.e. child marriage, dowry, kidnapping women for marriage, chhaupadi, domestic violence, sati pratha, etc.). Like quran, even bible or garud puran and swasthani include lots of sexist content. It sounds like you do hold a stereotypical and generalised perception about muslims but it's good that you are open for conversation.  Every religion and culture has its good and bad side. It's important that we see both, choose to follow the good, and continue challenging the bad from our end. - A non-muslim|||There is no understanding religion. Everyone will say their interpretation is right and other bad things are not what their religion preaches.   But it’s just weak people clinging to something. All religions.|||I also started learning about islam from debates with atheists, christians and ex-muslims. Ex-muslims are the most unhinged ones (understandably so). I might be biased against Islam but I don't know where the unbiased line is. Here's my two cents:  I think your intuitions are largely correct. I think the issue with islam is not of good or bad but of how to assimilate incompatible belief systems.  Your point (i) is the main issue 'good' muslims face with. Two statements \"Quran is truth\" and \"Mohammed is perfect\" are not conclusions but the premise of their belief system. Its a monumental challenge to defend the problematic parts you mentioned for them compared to christians and hindus; too less wiggle room for alternative interpretation.  I would also appreciate more muslims come forward and discuss these issues. I don't see this happening and I think I know why. I see only two outcomes of such discussions: get exposed being intolerant or change the belief.  There are couple of examples: \"Muslim guy admitting he would happily watch an apostate executed if he was in islamic country\" and \"Another guy saying is okay to marry and have sex with 5 yo\". Mind you both of them are youtube celebrities with large followings. Which is why good muslims are mostly silent or resort to disingenuous arguments nowadays. I vaguely remember seeing Jakir Naik in TV when I was kid.  Islam is filled with anti jewish sentiments and even necessitates muslim to kill them before end of time. Which explains why israel-palestine war gets a lot of attention and why all the muslims sides with palestine.  I know there are many muslims who coexist and don't believe the verses you mentioned or choose not to act upon but this will not change the fact that those verses exist and they claim to follow the book that contains them. I will always be skeptic unless islam and quran goes through radical reformation which I don't see happening given their premise.  I also find this \"alternative interpretation\" argument hard to digest. If your book clearly says kill the non-believers and you have to perform a mental gymnastics to get non-violent interpretation then maybe the peaceful muslims are the radical ones.  Now to address your points. Don't let the label of political correctness or hate speech stop talking about things you are concerned about. I should be able to criticize and absolutely shit on any ideas. Thats the fundamental of scientific process. If anyone gets offended that their problem. I don't agree with right to religious freedom because religion has vague definition and it can contradict with other rights.|||If u take it seriously, u r a problem.|||I guess, you just read few verses without interpretation. You have to read ups and downs on what circumstances surah of Quran was revealed. Also, don’t seem like you are interested in learning about Islam. I am Muslim women and I have all the right, I don’t feel oppressed. It’s just that people of other religions think we are oppressed.  If I have to be honest about oppression, people around all religions try to oppress women which go against the teaching of all religions. It’s patriarchy that took over religious leaders and they mislead people.  If you really wanna learn about Islam, purchase these three books; the sealed Nectar, Quran and then, a book called, ‘ A Commentary on Ash-shamail al-Muhammadiyyah’. If you read these books, Inshallah you gonna cry and gonna fall in love with Prophet Mohommad and Allah.  Your curiosity makes sense, as people called themselves slave of Allah and follower of prophet Mohommad and goes on doing exact opposite of what Prophet mohommad taught us.|||I have the same questions   And as i got more into the rabbit hole   I found out every religion is extremist with islam being extreme on this.

You didn't write this to learn. You wrote this to lecture. You have clearly already made up your mind, so why pretend otherwise?  If you actually wanted to understand, you would ask, 'How do you interpret Surah An-Nisa 4:34 in a modern context?' or 'How does the community view these specific verses?' Instead, you dumped a list of grievances and demographic fear-mongering about fertility rates. You haven't come here for a conversation; you’ve come here to validate a conclusion you’ve already reached.|||If you want to learn about islam in general, I would start with some of these.

Now how much worse it is for the people in the past.|||If you really wanna learn better talk to grok than redditors.  Islam does have tons of problems. But there are also many schools and many interpretations. Islam was designed to incorporate every aspect from day to day life to government. There is islamic jurisprudence, quran, haddith, fiqh.  From my observation, what i found out was that. There is main text quran. Its their most important one. Then later compiled ones haddith, which are sahil (Authentic), hasan (good), daif(weak) regarding its authenticity. Then there are jurisprudence books. Which they use to run a society or use for the basis of sharia law.  You seem to be cautious or bothered by all the fucked up things on islam. Its true. There are many. It's better to know the history. Islam was spread mostly through conquest and they developed highly apartheid society when of you weren't a Muslim. Or a non Muslim who didn't pay jizya, you had little rights and slavable. Religion is a big part for them, and worshipping an idol was the biggest crime in their religion (shirk). They punish apostasy and blasphemy with death. And these aren't fringe practices. If you look at history. This has been the norm for most of Islamic states. This is why there is so much radical aspects to islam. This is just the tip of the iceberg. You can read the book of Islamic jurisprudence, like tahir al washilah, which was a book used for Islamic state in iran. To get an inking of how Islamic states ran. You will likely find 100 problematic stuff like pedophilia, apartheid status, barbaric punishments or capital punishment, treatment of women.  However there is many interpretations in islam. Sects like shia ans sunnis. Traditions like suffisim, druze. Each country has a different flavor of islam. However they are the most consistent and dogmatic religion. Btw, suffism is mostly a spiritual traditional stuff so less of that poltical and jihad stuff which is radical.  It's also important to notice that there are plenty of non radical mulsims. Who view islam as a peaceful religion. Who believe in tolerance of other religions. Its mostly getting prominency in modern days. Where people usually only believe in the Quran and reject all the haddiths and fiqh. And quran can be interpreted in a peaceful way. It's not bad compared to books like bible. Could even be relavent to today's world.  Also important to notice that. Most people who suffer due to radical islam are muslims. Before anyone stereotypes all muslims.|||I think religions are basically cultures sugar-coated with some god's stamp of approval. But nobody knows that god.",

Most teachers aren't christians, similarly with the students. Its non existent. The most christian part of the school is that they can provide catechism classes to some Christian students if they want it and they have mass or smthing (i was never went/had to go).   I'm an atheist and grew up in a Buddhist family so i can say that much. Other than that, the school is pretty good, not as modern as other schools since the fee is def at the lower end of the spectrum for good schools. The school campus is nice but the classrooms are meh at best. They have pretty nice clubs and has the whole traditional english house system like in hogwarts with a head girl/boy situation.

I remember when he talked about doing this in his free time.|||This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

Most of the teachers in school and college all of the are pedophiles.|||I'm not aware of the definition - is it like somebody who's grooming girls under 18? Are you using the term loosely?  It's an individual-thing and not a profession-thing. Girls sending DMs to get referred (when they have no skills) is also more common than you think. I get many DMs asking for free help (refactors)/ referrals (barely know them/ barely seen their code) and I just ignore them. I help many people (m/f) on a daily basis, and I've never met most of them. I know many of my 'male' senior friends (no female senior dev friends) do the same.  You should clear your exams first. Last bullet point sounds like a good plan.  Most people here will be happy to review 1-2 projects for free. I'll jump in if it's Python/ Next.js/ ML. Just post your github repo on some relevant community and they'll do free reviews.   Edit: I dont do free mentorships, happy to review repos/ coding practices.|||I get what you r saying but the term pedo applies to people who r way older and trying to groom n trap minors (under 18).

It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

Essentially doing a drill over and over until you're fairly confident to take on almost any curve ball interview question.  Whilst you wouldn't be asked to invert a binary tree on your interview, it'd help you understand in a broader sense how to break down a problem and solve it.  Not to mention NPath, Cyclomatic, Coupling, and time complexity. These are things you need to absolutely nail down when working with anything beyond a basic crud app, which can be vibe coded easily these days.  So how'd that set you apart? Well, essentially, it'd enable you to be a quick thinker.

When you know exactly what to do it's pretty easy to write the code for it.

Shitty code, more bugs and more opportunities for IT devs. Not every company can afford AI that is going to cost fortune in long run. Mid-level devs would collapse, there would be junior then senior. Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||[https://sip-club-webier.vercel.app/](https://sip-club-webier.vercel.app/)  Bro yettiko website with cms, bina problem kaam garney AI le banau ani manum la bro ko kura.|||Skill issue.

Don't get me wrong - vibe coding and low code/no code methods are getting popular with some LLM coders (Claude, Gemini) becoming absolute beasts, but, the real need of a human is in problem solving and building scalable systems. My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.  The problem is people jumping on the bandwagon which is creating a terrible environment for business owners, recruiters and stakeholders.  I hope you do well in your career my friend. Let's all stay hopeful about the future. We have a long way to go before judgement day arrives and they finally take over.",

Then there was a brief rise in ethical hacking and backend. now  everyone has suddenly moved to AI and ML. Dipping your feet into too many things usually takes you nowhere.  Any subject you choose to study should be something you actually care about. not to mention if you are good at youll get hired and get paid. The reason so many people are not being hired right now is because the bar is too high. Every field is either boom or bust, or at best cyclical. There are honestly so many interesting areas a CS student could go deep into, but instead, if you look at the codebases of many grads, their GitHub is full of AI slop, useless backend projects, and frontend work that is completely vibecoded. The UI and UX are usually a mess too, with tacky color choices, (obv gradients because it's completely vibecoded) random fonts, and no sense of design fundamentals.  Instead of chasing trends like this, please  study things that genuinely excite you. You could focus on  networking, embedded systems, RTOS, post-quantum cryptography, homomorphic encryption, geospatial systems and GIS, quantum computing, computational hardness like P vs NP, cloud systems, or even proper HCI. These are fields that actually reward understanding, not just copying tutorials. Not only that evey AI companies will hire these people.   Companies that depend heavily on hardware will always need strong backend, systems, and network engineers. That demand does not disappear just because a new framework or buzzword shows up.

Hand in your one-week notice only after you’ve signed an agreement with the new company. Get everything confirmed before you mention anything to your current employer.  Once that’s done, approach HR or management and let them know you’ve received a better opportunity elsewhere.. ideally one offering around 4× your current pay and that you’ve decided to move forward with it. If you feel it’s appropriate, apologize for the short notice. You can also give them a chance to match the offer (though realistically, they probably won’t).  Most likely, they’ll accept the resignation.  If they’re the difficult type, they may threaten to hold your pay. In that case, try to get paid before resigning or be mentally prepared to walk away from the remaining amount. Legally, there isn’t much they can do anyway, especially if they were paying below minimum wage.  If you don’t want to go down that route, there’s another option:  You can simply inform them that a personal issue has come up and you need to return to your village for a few months (say, at least five). Explain that this is why you’re giving a week’s notice instead of disappearing. They can’t take action against you in this situation either… at most, they’ll process your exit.  Things to keep in mind:  - Try to ensure you don’t have many unpaid days before handing in your notice. - Don’t share any details about your new employer.. no names or any hints. If they’re toxic, they can try to sabotage it. - Give at least a week’s notice. Two weeks is better if you can manage it. - Don’t get manipulated into staying for a minor raise. If they can’t offer at least 3× what you’re earning now, the new role is clearly the better move. Be firm about leaving.   I’m saying this as someone who’s been on the employer side and dealt with situations like this regularly. We expected high performance and strong work ethics, and while we paid slightly above the market average, the pressure wasn’t for everyone. Many people left as soon as they got paid and that’s understandable. What we did appreciate was honesty and advance notice.  A proper 14-day resignation helps the employer transition work, hand over projects, or train replacements. Disappearing without notice only creates problems for everyone, and I wouldn’t recommend that approach despite what some comments suggest.  You don’t owe the company anything beyond basic professionalism. Just as they can terminate you immediately for violating terms, you also have the right to leave at any time. If you want to stay ethical and professional, give a 14-day notice. If not, at least give a week so the transition is smoother for you and them.  All the best with whatever route you choose and good luck with what’s next. Cheers!|||Just leave, they will find an replacement. Estai ho corporate ma, if you don't hop, you don't progress|||That's why always be sure and do proper research before signing up the contract.

Although PF amounts have been deducted from employees salaries, they have reportedly not been credited to the employees PF accounts for the past three years. Similarly, TDS was deducted from salaries but was never deposited against employees PAN numbers. I’ve heard that there are ongoing legal cases related to these issues. Several teachers who raised concerns were reportedly terminated, which may explain why there are frequent openings and many new vacancies for teaching positions at the college.  So chances that they have been scamming can be real. We can’t be 100% sure without proper proof.|||They scammed noone. We all joined knowing the fee structure. I don’t even regret joining islington.

In the project review, they mentioned my projects don’t follow their **professional workflow, clean architecture, and Repository Pattern**, so they suggested I do an internship first.  **Here’s the catch:**  * It’s **unpaid for 2 months** * Counting my previous internship experience, this would be my **5th month of work**  **About me:**  * **Final-year IT student** * Built Laravel projects like CRUD apps, auth systems, task managers, e-commerce, and blog platforms * Comfortable with **MVC, validation, relationships** * Haven’t used **Repository Pattern / clean architecture / professional workflow** in real projects yet  **My dilemma:**  * Is it worth doing another unpaid internship to learn **professional Laravel practices, architecture, DB design, and workflow**? * Should I try learning these on my own and directly apply for **paid junior roles**? * Or is this kind of unpaid learning normal for Laravel/backend devs fresh out of college?

She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

            "body": "I've been tempted to write this for a long time.       I was in a relationship with a popular male influencer for a long time. We broke up 2 years ago. During our 3+ year-long relationship, I got to be in his inner circle and hung out with Sisan and gang (and Shrinkhala too, before she went to Harvard). We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective. Just like Shrinkhala shamelessly posted those yellow highlighted Excel Sheets as her proof of innocence which had no third party audit or any verification.|||I have never watched Sisan Baniya, but I didn't feel that he ever portrayed himself as self made or coming from a humble background. He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Are you Mr. foodie's ex gf ?

One of the client where I used to work said his dad has a huge business and big house for office, they sell medals, trophies with custom carving and expensive compared to others but you can get anything you asked for (like design, customization and more).   And look at this babal store, restaurants and so on within a year or so and that too in very prime area.  That guy is fully loaded.|||Well..

Before he was viral. Even mod a subreddit for his work. And I do understand separating between the art and the artists. This all sounds very true and feels consistent with his person out of his art (videos)  It’s funny to see Sisan’s Simp Boys here, not even ready to listen to a different perspective. And they give such an Incel vibe, hating up on a woman.  I really hope they are all kids who will grow out of this someday and realize how lame they were.  Sisan 500% milked his breakup while Shrinkhala and was so out of character for the graceful guy character he tries to build up in vlogs.|||As someone who is distantly related to him, i can vouch for the Buddhist girl thing.

I also worked and hung out with and around Sisan Shrinkhala a lot. So after the breakup, the way he acted like a kicked dog and gained public sympathy from incels licking on his balls and slut shaming Shrinkhala was so insane. And the way he spoke up about the Miss Nepal funds k k when the hate for her was at an all time high. Personally I have no sympathy or love for Shrinkhala so I am not saying this to defend her.   But everyone who has been around Sisan knows how opportunistic he is. Dhunga faalera haat lukaune khaalko manche ho. And everyone talks about it too in our circle.|||Does he go around  saying to people , I was poor and I am self made from ground up? If so can I have clips or anything of him claiming such?

I used to watch his vlog in 2019 and haven't been following him for a long time. The way he portrays himself, his Paradygm TV nonsense, I never liked that. And the way he helped to intensify hate and misinformation about Shrinkhala during that difficult time for her, shows the true character of the person.  It was (still is) unpopular to support Shrinkhala and criticize Sisan but we should never hesitate to tell the truth. Plus anybody whose father owns a house in Kathmandu is never struggling. I don't ever believe that nonsense.|||Sharing your personal experience is fine. But why are you referring to his ex as 'Buddhist girl'?

The circumstances favored him because she then went on to date the business family heir shortly after.

So so very capable of taking advantage of another person or situation for personal gains.

He seems the most capable guy among all the fkin leaders, including balen and rabi. When he speaks , he always seems calm even when he is provoked, unlike balen. He does not have an ongoing corruption case like that of rabi. He is an engineer who studied at the most prestigious university of our country and also studied at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. he went as a Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar to study water science, policy, and management. This is different from most engineering degrees  because he isn't just an engineer who can build a hydropower or dam. He has knowledge of policies and understands the economics and geopolitics of water—Nepal's most valuable resource. Has worked in developing countries in Africa. Seems like he has some political knowledge. Also, rabi and balen were celebrity figures, but he wasn't and dared to challenge one of the biggest political figures in a less urban or even rural city(dadeldhura). In a time where every nepalese wants to leave the country, a guy from oxford who could have easily left the country, not only staying but wants change in his country, shows bravery and patriotism. He hasn't been in power, so we can't gauge him, but we can gauge him based on what we have seen so far - a calm, educated, brave and exceptionally brilliant young guy, and i would definitely prefer him over any politican i have witnessed so far.|||\"Oxford padheko bhandai ma should be a leader\"  Can see the mindset of OP here.

USA loses $200 billion per year in outbound remittances from foreign workers. That money leaves the country permanently and helps to finance and support other nations who become reliant on those funds INSTEAD of developing their own infrastructure/economies.

I agree with most part but I think it’s perspective, you are doing this struggle for yourself and people you care. Don’t do any bad things here obviously this is not Nepal, know the country, their rules and respect it, you’ll be fine.  Been here for almost 4 years now, got full time job after 1.5 years masters program. Pays ~150k annually, while this doesn’t help the feeling of living far from home country, but it pays for other stuff and you can get good car, buy own home, get better insurance and its set.  So my suggestion, get some experience in Nepal first, learn how to communicate, show up your skills and build your portfolio.|||Don’t come to conclusion with just  one  example. Earlier I saw a post where a nepali guy had $80k in his portfolio while working as student. These both are extreme examples.The guy in this post came to USA to study bachelor with full financial and social responsibility. Doing bachelor is always tough while working illegally for 4 years. I don’t encourage people to go for bachelor degree with their sole financial responsibility. With more effort and research, people end up in scholarship and low tuition fee college. This will change the whole dynamic of this situation. However, the grass is not greener at other side too. There will be challenges related to immigration and getting green card. Anyone can come embracing those challenges and keeping open mind.|||Its tough for students and it always has been. Struggle is part of life. Consistency is the key i think.

I do not believe I'm a different breed than the ale bhai I befriended in my cowboy days, just because we spawned out of different wombs. Equity doesn't need to sniff for financial conditions.

At first I genuinely thought he was asking for a lift, so I stopped without thinking much. Then he started talking about money. He asked if I had esewa or not. I was confused because in my head I was thinking, why would I charge someone for a lift?  He told me his bike had crashed badly and he urgently needed cash right there on the road. He said he had money in his e-wallet and would send it to me immediately.I believed him. I gave him 1500 in cash. After that he said he’d return it in an hour instead. To make me trust him, he even showed me cash in his hand, maybe around 10k, and said something like, “Why would I scam you just for 1500?” I even told him how important that money was for me college, rent, living alone and all that. He kept saying no worries, reassuring me, talking nicely, making it sound genuine. Now it’s been hours. He’s blocked my number.  I honestly don’t know what I was thinking at that moment. I just thought a fellow Nepali rider was asking for help and I didn’t want to turn my back. For someone living alone, 1500 is a big hit. It’s not just the money, it’s the feeling of being fooled so easily.  Posting this mainly as a warning. If someone asks for urgent cash on the road and promises to pay later, please think twice. I learned it the hard way. If anyone knows whether reporting this actually helps in Kathmandu, let me know. Stay safe.   We'll here's the number if you need +9779708156830",

He seemed genuine and him being Sikh and all, i was persuaded into giving him the money. He gave me his number and said he’ll send it to me in my bank account. I went home and waited for few hours and called him so many times throughout that day but the call was never picked up. I knew then that i was deceived.   I felt so stupid thinking about that whole encounter and how it didn’t take him a lot to convince me to give him $200 which was a lot of money for me at the time.

Every now and then,we get a crashing news:(|||Not an expert, but with whatever knowledge I have for following aviation industry, I have some conclusions   1) The plane has almost gone 300m off the runway, if it was a late touchdown and if the Pilots knew it wouldn't stop why didn't they go for a go around, not blaming the pilots but I also think they didn't attempt a go around cause the other side has Indian border and they would have to take a steep left turn and might even enter Indian border, and file new IFR.   2) If the plane had touchdown normally then, as shown in the photos, no flaps extended is seen, either they retracted the flaps early or the flaps weren't extended at all, this suspects for a hydraulic failure.   Adding to the 1st point, it was a layover flight, maybe the intensions of pilot was a quick landing, I am not at all shifting the blame at anyone but it's just my take.

            "body": "Nepal Electricity Authority needed to buy electricity from India to avoid load shedding during winter. When bids were invited, an Indian government company called PTC offered electricity at 6.74 Indian rupees per unit. Hitendra Dev Shakya was a director at that time. He believed the price could be reduced further and asked the company to lower it. Before any final decision was made, there was a political change. Kulman Ghising returned to power and Hitendra was removed from his position. The very next day, the same Indian company suddenly sent a new proposal at a higher rate of 6.95 rupees per unit. This proposal was not even requested by NEA. NEA quickly signed a contract at this higher price to buy 180 megawatts of electricity. Because of the higher rate and extra charges like leakage and wheeling fees, this deal would have cost Nepal more than 40 crores extra. The deal was also signed without proper approval from the Electricity Regulatory Commission. Kulman Ghising later defended the deal in public. He said the old offer had expired and prices were rising fast. He even claimed that waiting longer would push prices up to 10 rupees per unit. However, data from the Indian market showed that electricity prices were actually falling during that period. Later, the court reinstated Hitendra Dev Shakya. After returning, he questioned why NEA was paying more than the original offer. He stopped the expensive agreement and asked for new bids. As a result, another Indian government company offered electricity at 6.60 rupees per unit in December. This was cheaper than both the earlier offers and directly proved that prices were not rising as claimed. By cancelling the costly deal and pushing for a fair price, Hitendra helped prevent a loss of over 40 crores to the country. Whether corruption was involved or not is for investigators to decide, but the financial difference is clear.  (Translated and Simplified version of Narayan Gaule Post)",

We skipped the formal lectures and kept things simple—just hands-on demos and honest conversations. The goal wasn’t to teach a full curriculum in an afternoon; it was to show these kids that technology isn't out of reach.  As a student-led initiative, we don't have a big corporate engine behind us. We’re just a group of peers showing up and leading where we can. This reel captures some of the curiosity we saw that day—it’s a small start, but a meaningful one.  If you want to build, learn, or contribute to what we're doing, we’d love to have you.  👉 Join the movement: https://codeyatranp.com/join",

He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

Static GTFS (mandatory)** Without this layer, real-time tracking will not work.  **Core IDs** - **stop_id** - **route_id** - **trip_id** - **service_id**  **Required GTFS files** - **agency.txt** - **stops.txt** - **routes.txt** - **trips.txt** - **stop_times.txt** - **calendar.txt**  **Critical rule** - IDs must stay **stable forever** - Real-time data links directly to these IDs  ---  **2. GTFS-Realtime (minimum usable set)**  **VehiclePositions feed (most important)** Used to show moving buses on Google Maps.  Required fields - **vehicle_id** - **trip_id** - **route_id** - **latitude** - **longitude** - **timestamp**  Update rate - Every **10–20 seconds**  ---  **TripUpdates feed (optional)** Used to calculate delays and ETAs.  Optional fields - **trip_id** - **delay** (in seconds) - **stop_id**  ---  **ServiceAlerts (optional)** Used for strikes, diversions, or road closures.  Fields - **route_id** or **stop_id** - **alert text**  ---  **Absolute minimum stack** - Static GTFS with fixed IDs - VehiclePositions real-time feed  **Reality check** - Exact timetables not required - Ticketing systems not required - Stable IDs + live GPS is enough for Google Maps|||its too small, i cant read the words, tried the drive pdf too",

But let's not sympathize with these cronies and corrupt politicians. For decades, the real victims have been the everyday citizens of our country. Our Parliament, the Supreme Court, and Singha Durbar getting burned down is a bigger tragedy than some 5-star hotel or supermarket chain. We have been screwed over by these politicians and their business counterparts for so long that on that day, the entire country became a rage room.

And these were live ammunitions... videos of cops giving the middle finger after shooting and terrorising the shops till 9-10 o'clock at night  were circulating ..

            "body": "It’s 2026 now, and we’re still having to deal with this.  A few days ago, early in the morning, I was on the street and saw a public bus with people literally hanging from the door. It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this. This issue really needs more attention and more noise.|||KTM has enough budget with 40 percent going unused. these transportation comes under metropolitan ko authority. ask Mayor balen.

Ironic that when he came into power it would be that King’s son who would oust him. Nepal would be far better country if his prime ministership wasnt stripped from him. Congress failed him and to that extent the people as well.|||Prolific writer.|||i don't know never met him|||Quakey budo|||Every country when it goes through a transformation needs an iron willed leader who has a vision not for development but for understanding structures of power and realizing institutions which uphold the political interests of the party and the government. Any man who doesn't understand this will, after some years, experience instability within and without the political systems. He's a great writer, but he was too idealistic to be a leader for such an unstable country.|||The Biggest political figure of Nepal I would equate Koiralas as Gandhis of Nepal Nepal would've been democratically very ahead if Mahendra let him work|||SMASH|||The OG|||Great guy|||The downfall of congress started from girija and others after 2046 ,but bp was great guy, huge respect for bp always|||One of the most influential writers the country had ever produced.

Stood for political, social and economic justice throughout his life and didn't compromise for anything.    He took most of the responsibility and he did make mistakes (and he has accepted them gracefully in is biography).      You see, the problem with our generation is we read too less to judge a person and almost fail to account the then social and political scenario of the country. So, my suggestion would be you read yourself and don't judge him based on my opinion or other few incidents or stories mentioned in the comments.   Personally, He gave me the definition of democracy. Here is one story of his conversation with his nephew Naresh Koirala.   *Naresh himself had been puzzled by his uncle’s decision to accept the result. On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP. Mahendra and Birendra believed themselves to be the savior of common \"*naive\"* Nepali.    While BP simply believed that Nepali people irrespective of their education, culture, caste, religion, sex or whatsoever are capable to choose their leaders themselves and make them responsible.|||One of the greatest writers, Nepal has ever produced.|||This guy high moral values unlike present  Congress.

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.

            "heading": "AMA : I have been using menstrual cups for ~8 years. Ask me anything.",
            "body": "**Disclaimer** : this is not an Ad. I have been using menstrual cups for around 8 years and have recommended it to many women in my life. All have loved it and have made the switch from pads/tampons. So i decided to spread the word here.   **Tldr**: Menstrual cups will change your life. it will give you much more freedom and flexibility than period products like pads or tampons.   First of all, what is a Menstrual cup?   A menstrual cup is a reusable, flexible silicone cup inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual fluid. It can be worn up to 12 hours and can be used for several years with proper care.   I have made a list of pro and cons that i have faced in these years. You are welcome to ask more questions. I will answer as many as i can. Serious questions only please!   **PRO**:   1. To start with the basics, menstrual flow is more than just liquid blood. it has many semi-solid/solid things like mucus and blood vessels. So a pad or tampons just cannot ‘absorb’ them. these things just lay there on the surface making you feel slimy and uncomfortable. Instead the cup ‘collects’ it so it doesn’t have this issue.  2. You dont have to worry about a pad shifting from its place. you know the feeling, when the pad is too far back or too far on one side. Also, you dont feel the blood flow ‘out’ like when you laugh or sneeze or stand up. Menstrual cup catches the blood before it gets out.  3. Its an upfront investment but one that will be much cheaper in the long run. You wont have to cash out hundreds of rupees each month on period products.  4. Its better for the environment as it creates little to no waste.  5. Its better when you are out, for example, at other people’s place. you dont have to worry about where to dump your used period products.  6. You dont feel it at all once its inside. you can just live your normal day and forget about it. then only at the end of the day you empty, clean and put it back on. (if its a heavy flow day then i empty it once in the middle of the day too)  7. No issues with friction / rashes on the inner thighs.   **CON** :   1. It has a slightly steep learning curve. I know a lot of people have anxiety of putting it in and getting it out. i did too. but once you have done it a couple of times, you will get a hang of it. There are many tutorials available online for this. I personally fold the cup in a C shape and put it in and then to be sure its secure, I check for suction by pulling/rotating it a bit. Getting it out can feel a bit scary at first. When getting it out, i hold the cup on its body and not just the tip to be sure that the tip doesn’t break. But like i said, once you have done it a few times, it will feel normal.  2. I find it most comfortable to empty the cup in a toilet that has a basin inside it. so I can empty it in the basin, clean the cup and put it in again. it can be done in a toilet stall (without basin) too but you have to be a bit more careful and you will need some tissues to clean the blood off your hands before coming out of the stall.  3. it requires a bit of investment in the beginning even to try (but it will pay off long term if it works out)  4. It can leak, very rarely but sometimes. The leakage is usually minimal so for this, you can use something light like panty liners or period panties. You can try out your options here.   **Recommendations**:   1. When first trying it out, you can try it for a couple of hours at a time when you are not having heavy flow and when you are staying home. This way you will also have an idea of how much blood comes out (spoiler alert: its much less than what you would expect) and how frequently you need to empty the cup.  2. always clean your hands with soap before and after putting/removing the cup.  3. hold the cup by its body (base of the cup) and not just its tip when pulling it out.  4. There are a lot of tutorials, feedback, helpful materials available online. Please be brave and give it a try. you will thank me later :)  —————————————————————————-  **Edit 1**: some people are asking about which brands to use. If someone is a new user of Menstrual cups, could you please let us know about your experience with it and which brand you are using?",

Not Rabi , nor Balen ever said anything negative about working together but the public basically was going crazy why they weren't coming to agreements. Kulman was getting a lot of hate even here, let's not even talk about Balen. I wake up, and there's half a million likes on this simple photo without any details . Now everyone is fully behind Balen as the PM while Rabi will be the party man .. it's a great thing , probably the best news to come out for our contry in a while but I fear people will turn on them sooner than later. Single man, single constituency Ra executive elections and legislative elections are very different things, to run an organisation of over half a million supporters is a HUGE HUGE task . People didn't even look at what terms they agreed on .. no policies no vision just the news that they came together was enough and it will more than likely be enough to win the elections but the real problems will come after that. People who are with them are also Nepali people , the same people who were once close to the old parties , not all but most of them. And they will have their flaws , there will be problems related to distribution of power but all this comes in the later phases when there will be many winners and many leaders . I just hope Rabi becomes more grounded in terms of his promises and Balen starts interacting with the public and media .. sadhai Facebook ma status matra halera ta hudaina these people will make fake news and assumptions because He doesn't ever talk to the media and provide regular press releases . Citizens of Nepal, please support whoever you want to support but support them for thier vision and policies not for their fiery speeches and just because they are against Congress UMl and Maoists . Hold them accountable, do not start worshipping them and start hating anyone who questions them .. questions keep democracy alive. Anyone who can't answer the questions will turn into a dictator sooner or later. Craze will be enough to win the elections, not run the country.",

Almost everything here is broken; the lifestyle, the air we breathe, the system. the government is corrupt, healthcare is unreliable, and you can’t even find proper sidewalks for a simple morning or evening walk. if you’re planning to settle here long-term, you won’t enjoy it. living in kathmandu forever slowly drains you.

I remember when he talked about doing this in his free time.|||This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

It's an individual-thing and not a profession-thing. Girls sending DMs to get referred (when they have no skills) is also more common than you think. I get many DMs asking for free help (refactors)/ referrals (barely know them/ barely seen their code) and I just ignore them. I help many people (m/f) on a daily basis, and I've never met most of them. I know many of my 'male' senior friends (no female senior dev friends) do the same.  You should clear your exams first. Last bullet point sounds like a good plan.  Most people here will be happy to review 1-2 projects for free. I'll jump in if it's Python/ Next.js/ ML. Just post your github repo on some relevant community and they'll do free reviews.   Edit: I dont do free mentorships, happy to review repos/ coding practices.|||I get what you r saying but the term pedo applies to people who r way older and trying to groom n trap minors (under 18).

Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

That makes sense there because India has a massive tech ecosystem with big companies having large engineering offices and direct hiring pipelines locally in India.  But what about Nepal?  For someone based in Nepal, is heavy lc grinding actually worth the investment? Or is time better spent on projects, oepn source, depth of knowledge, system design etc.  Would love to hear from people running/working at Nepali tech companies, people working remotely for foreign companies and anyone who has internationally interviewed while being based here.",

Essentially doing a drill over and over until you're fairly confident to take on almost any curve ball interview question.  Whilst you wouldn't be asked to invert a binary tree on your interview, it'd help you understand in a broader sense how to break down a problem and solve it.  Not to mention NPath, Cyclomatic, Coupling, and time complexity. These are things you need to absolutely nail down when working with anything beyond a basic crud app, which can be vibe coded easily these days.  So how'd that set you apart? Well, essentially, it'd enable you to be a quick thinker. If you don't need to get stuck when programming on the basics, you are able to instead divert your faculties to actual problems that require your energy.|||That is not leetcode, that is codeforces which is a much higher level than leetcode.

When you know exactly what to do it's pretty easy to write the code for it. The hardest part of IT is trying to find out what the right questions to ask is so that you have a semblance on what exactly to code. It's trying to understand what the users of your software want. Have AI figure that out for you and then tell me.|||You are just here because of money which is not bad, but  for some programming is getting their vision on screen, a way to show creativity. You dont get to decide who is a fool|||with the increase in AI expect to get shitty codes delivered faster than we have ever seen. Shitty code, more bugs and more opportunities for IT devs. Not every company can afford AI that is going to cost fortune in long run. Mid-level devs would collapse, there would be junior then senior. Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||[https://sip-club-webier.vercel.app/](https://sip-club-webier.vercel.app/)  Bro yettiko website with cms, bina problem kaam garney AI le banau ani manum la bro ko kura.|||Skill issue.

Don't get me wrong - vibe coding and low code/no code methods are getting popular with some LLM coders (Claude, Gemini) becoming absolute beasts, but, the real need of a human is in problem solving and building scalable systems. My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.  The problem is people jumping on the bandwagon which is creating a terrible environment for business owners, recruiters and stakeholders.  I hope you do well in your career my friend.

We cry about infrastructure or low investment in industries or jobs while we berate the same companies and their owners for being \"corrupt\" and \"exploitative\", we want to have our cake and eat it too.   We simultaneously label all rich as evil bastards while crying about economy and industries and jobs.|||Never liked her...🖕|||Afu Le khanya khaldo ma afau parnu bhninxa…RSP and genz were blaming oldies for same….k garxau sabbai udhyog kalkarkhana chalaune ta chor nai hun bhanne bhasya create garnu bhayo…..

            "body": "Yesterday I posted about how I felt like a Pathao for my girlfriend, and almost everyone agreed that I was being used. So I finally talked to her about it. She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

            "body": "I've been tempted to write this for a long time.       I was in a relationship with a popular male influencer for a long time. We broke up 2 years ago. During our 3+ year-long relationship, I got to be in his inner circle and hung out with Sisan and gang (and Shrinkhala too, before she went to Harvard). We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective. Just like Shrinkhala shamelessly posted those yellow highlighted Excel Sheets as her proof of innocence which had no third party audit or any verification.|||I have never watched Sisan Baniya, but I didn't feel that he ever portrayed himself as self made or coming from a humble background. He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Are you Mr. foodie's ex gf ?

It was (still is) unpopular to support Shrinkhala and criticize Sisan but we should never hesitate to tell the truth. Plus anybody whose father owns a house in Kathmandu is never struggling.

He just wants to be small, ~5'8 and ignored again..|||6ft basic ho aaile ma 11 maii 6ft thiye|||Lmfao suru dinma ta approach garna aauxan ta hau|||Western bs mero opinion ma chai , height doesn't really matter especially Nepal ma girls already are so short I don't think they'd want 6ft guys when they are like 5'4 , 5'5 in average 😂.

Always put efforts from my side . Got a spotlight but not attraction .  The worse part is that people laugh at your back or sometimes in face , people looks  at you as if you're  alien .

This might be one of the reason tho why girls aren’t interested but don’t let this come between who you truly are haii mero bichar bata ta girls do care about the height difference but the most imp thing is ur personality.

We skipped the formal lectures and kept things simple—just hands-on demos and honest conversations. The goal wasn’t to teach a full curriculum in an afternoon; it was to show these kids that technology isn't out of reach.  As a student-led initiative, we don't have a big corporate engine behind us. We’re just a group of peers showing up and leading where we can. This reel captures some of the curiosity we saw that day—it’s a small start, but a meaningful one.

            "body": "This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

I did ChatGPT for basic and minimal requirements for real time tracking buses on Google Map.   **Minimum data for basic real-time bus tracking on Google Maps**  You need **two layers**.  ---  **1. Static GTFS (mandatory)** Without this layer, real-time tracking will not work.  **Core IDs** - **stop_id** - **route_id** - **trip_id** - **service_id**  **Required GTFS files** - **agency.txt** - **stops.txt** - **routes.txt** - **trips.txt** - **stop_times.txt** - **calendar.txt**  **Critical rule** - IDs must stay **stable forever** - Real-time data links directly to these IDs  ---  **2. GTFS-Realtime (minimum usable set)**  **VehiclePositions feed (most important)** Used to show moving buses on Google Maps.  Required fields - **vehicle_id** - **trip_id** - **route_id** - **latitude** - **longitude** - **timestamp**  Update rate - Every **10–20 seconds**  ---  **TripUpdates feed (optional)** Used to calculate delays and ETAs.  Optional fields - **trip_id** - **delay** (in seconds) - **stop_id**  ---  **ServiceAlerts (optional)** Used for strikes, diversions, or road closures.  Fields - **route_id** or **stop_id** - **alert text**  ---  **Absolute minimum stack** - Static GTFS with fixed IDs - VehiclePositions real-time feed  **Reality check** - Exact timetables not required - Ticketing systems not required - Stable IDs + live GPS is enough for Google Maps|||its too small, i cant read the words, tried the drive pdf too",

            "body": "It’s 2026 now, and we’re still having to deal with this.  A few days ago, early in the morning, I was on the street and saw a public bus with people literally hanging from the door. It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

This problem needs to be adressed and public transportation should be well organized and planned.|||Finally, someone spoke about this. This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this. This issue really needs more attention and more noise.|||KTM has enough budget with 40 percent going unused. these transportation comes under metropolitan ko authority. ask Mayor balen.

At the moment, i would suggest you to keep doing your jobs and garnering your skills so you land up one job with a handsome pay. Good luck.|||dude you're just like me, but 10 years ago. i've been exactly where you are and it sucks ass. i had to maintain multiple jobs because none would pay on time, and i had to support my parents and two siblings. so when i say i know what you're going through, i mean it. and as much i appreciate people being nice here, no one (except for one) is trying to help you navigate this shituation.  the one thing that you need more of isn't money or opportunities, its time. **you need more time**. more time for proper sleep, more time to gather your thoughts, more time to pause and evaluate your current situation, more time to plan out the next few months. you're like a engine that's constantly running 24/7, and you haven't had the chance to rest for a single moment, and it sucks soooo much because as much as you want to stop, you just can't. its all on you, everything depends on you, and you have to keep moving, or else everything will fall apart. and this will only end one way, and its not good dude.  thats why you have to take your time back. you need at least 2 more hours of sleep (sleeping an hour early and waking up 30 minutes late). at least 1 hour of free time to plan your next steps. you weekends need to be for yourself, and yourself alone. whatever precious time you have, you keep it and don't let anyone or anything take it from you.   if you have college every morning, talk with the administration and ask them to let you check-in an hour late - explain your situation, tell them that you have no other option; this worked for me, and will work for you.  if you have small spare time where its not too long to start working but not too short to just sit around (like 25-40 minutes of downtime), just get to the next task/next job. baru duita day shifts ko bich ma kei downtime hunai nadeu. inform your office you'll arrive early and leave early. explain that you have a tight schedule and you don't want to waste your time. companies will try to make up some nonsense about proper timing and all that bullshit but don't let them bully you to submission. ask them to understand your situation, and make up shit like you also study and go to college everyday and do your assignments daily because you're a weak student, and normally don't get enough sleep because of that, so instead of just wasting time after college, you just come to work early - you know, make it sappy if that helps. but whatever you say, make sure that they let you leave early. take back your time.  if this helps you gather even 1-2 hours extra everyday, thats the time you can invest on yourself now. if you can get home by 5pm instead of 6:30pm, thats around 3 hours before your night shift starts. you can use that time to either plan your next move. work on your portfolio. add things to your showreels that you wish you could but weren't allowed to. talk with your parents about what you're going through and ask them to help you with planning for the future. like the other user said, actually start tracking all your expenses and see where all your money is going. excel is free in the browser, and you can search for \"excel free budget templates\". categorize all your expenses and see where the money is being wasted. do you smoke regularly? are your lunches expensive? is your electricity bill too high? not a single rupee goes untracked. you need every penny to be accounted for. if there's an unnecessary expense, cut it out completely. the more you can save, the easier it will be for you.  you can also request your night shift company to let you start early, and end early. sounds like it's a remote job, so your reasoning could be that you're already free by 6pm, and instead of waiting around, you'd like to start early when you're still feeling energized and not drained of energy by 3 in the morning. you can give your work report by 12 midnight and go to sleep 30 minutes early, even.  if you travel by bus or micros, take that time to complete errands that can be done via your phone. create a checklist for what you need to do before you can apply for better jobs. look for potential companies that have a good company culture (normally has better pay too). connect with past colleagues online just to say hi (this one might feel weird at first but its better to say hi how are you rather than hi do you have a job in your company). update your expense tracking sheet. look for templates and plugins that can help your portfolio be better than the rest.  spend every single free minute to get yourself on a better situation.  you're drowning every hour every day, but you're taking the first step towards pulling yourself out. it's going to be difficult the next few months and you may feel more drained than ever, but if you do all these for yourself, you'll be in a much better mental state in the next couple of months. here's to hoping that you update us in a few months that you got a job that pays as much as all three jobs combined 🤞  all the best. do yourself proud.|||On person told me, rather focusing making money from 2-3 small jobs.

Everything will be same but you will be different  Try meditating, clearing your mind. Once you have a clear mind you can think.  The more you panic, the more it gets worse. Thinking about the future and trying to make life better is good but when you over think the same thing over and over, that thought is what making you demotivated not the situation. If you can’t change the situation, don’t over think it.  I know its hard, but don’t loose the hope.  Stay calm, plan and proceed and will be a matter of time you see the changes.  It is a process not an immediate action. At the end its you and I know someone who is handling everything as you said can do lot better in life. Don’t forget, Some people dream to be in your place.

If you have any debts, create a small, steady repayment plan so they don’t keep snowballing.      Separate essential and non-essential expenses, even small adjustments can make a difference. And try to save at least a tiny amount each month. Even a symbolic sum gives a bit of control and stability.      Look at how much free time you have outside of work and try to set aside a small, consistent window to learn skills that are in demand. Little steps add up and can help you increase your income over time.      I’ve been in a similar situation myself, and I know how heavy it can feel. But it is possible to climb out of it slowly, with small steady actions. You’re already doing an incredible amount, don’t be too hard on yourself.

Stood for political, social and economic justice throughout his life and didn't compromise for anything.    He took most of the responsibility and he did make mistakes (and he has accepted them gracefully in is biography).      You see, the problem with our generation is we read too less to judge a person and almost fail to account the then social and political scenario of the country. So, my suggestion would be you read yourself and don't judge him based on my opinion or other few incidents or stories mentioned in the comments.   Personally, He gave me the definition of democracy. Here is one story of his conversation with his nephew Naresh Koirala.   *Naresh himself had been puzzled by his uncle’s decision to accept the result. On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP. Mahendra and Birendra believed themselves to be the savior of common \"*naive\"* Nepali.    While BP simply believed that Nepali people irrespective of their education, culture, caste, religion, sex or whatsoever are capable to choose their leaders themselves and make them responsible.|||One of the greatest writers, Nepal has ever produced.|||This guy high moral values unlike present  Congress.

Economy should be of utmost priority. Unrealistic speeches for public attention should be stopped from very beginning. Private sector should be let to invest and create jobs, while government regulates effectively.  Also, they should be very wise while speaking about international relations.

I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6. This is probably the longest shot of them all, but any ideas what species of critter might have eaten up the stock at one point? I put a picture of it on picture 2, I was thinking some type of termite or wood worm.",

During the Rana regime (1846–1951), gun manufacturing in Nepal was driven largely by the innovative efforts of Gehendra Shumsher, the eldest son of Prime Minister Bir Shumsher, who is widely regarded as Nepal's first scientist and modernizer of the military.   Key Manufacturing Factories  The Ranas established several sites for arms and ammunition production, primarily centered in the Kathmandu Valley and some regional hubs:   Nakkhu (Lalitpur): Notable for producing copies of the Martini-Henry rifle, specifically the \"De-Rifle\" in the late 1880s.  Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.  Jangi Megjin: Originally founded in 1793, it continued to function during the Rana period as a government foundry for manufacturing cannons and military equipment.|||You need someone from the Hanuman Dhoka Museum in Kathmandu.

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.

            "heading": "AMA : I have been using menstrual cups for ~8 years. Ask me anything.",
            "body": "**Disclaimer** : this is not an Ad. I have been using menstrual cups for around 8 years and have recommended it to many women in my life. All have loved it and have made the switch from pads/tampons. So i decided to spread the word here.   **Tldr**: Menstrual cups will change your life. it will give you much more freedom and flexibility than period products like pads or tampons.   First of all, what is a Menstrual cup?   A menstrual cup is a reusable, flexible silicone cup inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual fluid. It can be worn up to 12 hours and can be used for several years with proper care.   I have made a list of pro and cons that i have faced in these years. You are welcome to ask more questions. I will answer as many as i can. Serious questions only please!   **PRO**:   1. To start with the basics, menstrual flow is more than just liquid blood. it has many semi-solid/solid things like mucus and blood vessels. So a pad or tampons just cannot ‘absorb’ them. these things just lay there on the surface making you feel slimy and uncomfortable. Instead the cup ‘collects’ it so it doesn’t have this issue.  2. You dont have to worry about a pad shifting from its place. you know the feeling, when the pad is too far back or too far on one side. Also, you dont feel the blood flow ‘out’ like when you laugh or sneeze or stand up. Menstrual cup catches the blood before it gets out.  3. Its an upfront investment but one that will be much cheaper in the long run. You wont have to cash out hundreds of rupees each month on period products.  4. Its better for the environment as it creates little to no waste.  5. Its better when you are out, for example, at other people’s place. you dont have to worry about where to dump your used period products.  6. You dont feel it at all once its inside. you can just live your normal day and forget about it. then only at the end of the day you empty, clean and put it back on. (if its a heavy flow day then i empty it once in the middle of the day too)  7. No issues with friction / rashes on the inner thighs.   **CON** :   1. It has a slightly steep learning curve. I know a lot of people have anxiety of putting it in and getting it out. i did too. but once you have done it a couple of times, you will get a hang of it. There are many tutorials available online for this. I personally fold the cup in a C shape and put it in and then to be sure its secure, I check for suction by pulling/rotating it a bit. Getting it out can feel a bit scary at first. When getting it out, i hold the cup on its body and not just the tip to be sure that the tip doesn’t break. But like i said, once you have done it a few times, it will feel normal.  2. I find it most comfortable to empty the cup in a toilet that has a basin inside it. so I can empty it in the basin, clean the cup and put it in again. it can be done in a toilet stall (without basin) too but you have to be a bit more careful and you will need some tissues to clean the blood off your hands before coming out of the stall.  3. it requires a bit of investment in the beginning even to try (but it will pay off long term if it works out)  4. It can leak, very rarely but sometimes. The leakage is usually minimal so for this, you can use something light like panty liners or period panties. You can try out your options here.   **Recommendations**:   1. When first trying it out, you can try it for a couple of hours at a time when you are not having heavy flow and when you are staying home. This way you will also have an idea of how much blood comes out (spoiler alert: its much less than what you would expect) and how frequently you need to empty the cup.  2. always clean your hands with soap before and after putting/removing the cup.  3. hold the cup by its body (base of the cup) and not just its tip when pulling it out.  4. There are a lot of tutorials, feedback, helpful materials available online. Please be brave and give it a try. you will thank me later :)  —————————————————————————-  **Edit 1**: some people are asking about which brands to use. If someone is a new user of Menstrual cups, could you please let us know about your experience with it and which brand you are using?",

Not Rabi , nor Balen ever said anything negative about working together but the public basically was going crazy why they weren't coming to agreements. Kulman was getting a lot of hate even here, let's not even talk about Balen. I wake up, and there's half a million likes on this simple photo without any details . Now everyone is fully behind Balen as the PM while Rabi will be the party man .. it's a great thing , probably the best news to come out for our contry in a while but I fear people will turn on them sooner than later. Single man, single constituency Ra executive elections and legislative elections are very different things, to run an organisation of over half a million supporters is a HUGE HUGE task . People didn't even look at what terms they agreed on .. no policies no vision just the news that they came together was enough and it will more than likely be enough to win the elections but the real problems will come after that. People who are with them are also Nepali people , the same people who were once close to the old parties , not all but most of them. And they will have their flaws , there will be problems related to distribution of power but all this comes in the later phases when there will be many winners and many leaders . I just hope Rabi becomes more grounded in terms of his promises and Balen starts interacting with the public and media .. sadhai Facebook ma status matra halera ta hudaina these people will make fake news and assumptions because He doesn't ever talk to the media and provide regular press releases . Citizens of Nepal, please support whoever you want to support but support them for thier vision and policies not for their fiery speeches and just because they are against Congress UMl and Maoists . Hold them accountable, do not start worshipping them and start hating anyone who questions them .. questions keep democracy alive. Anyone who can't answer the questions will turn into a dictator sooner or later. Craze will be enough to win the elections, not run the country.",

I remember when he talked about doing this in his free time.|||This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

Most of the teachers in school and college all of the are pedophiles.|||I'm not aware of the definition - is it like somebody who's grooming girls under 18? Are you using the term loosely?  It's an individual-thing and not a profession-thing. Girls sending DMs to get referred (when they have no skills) is also more common than you think. I get many DMs asking for free help (refactors)/ referrals (barely know them/ barely seen their code) and I just ignore them. I help many people (m/f) on a daily basis, and I've never met most of them. I know many of my 'male' senior friends (no female senior dev friends) do the same.  You should clear your exams first. Last bullet point sounds like a good plan.  Most people here will be happy to review 1-2 projects for free. I'll jump in if it's Python/ Next.js/ ML. Just post your github repo on some relevant community and they'll do free reviews.   Edit: I dont do free mentorships, happy to review repos/ coding practices.|||I get what you r saying but the term pedo applies to people who r way older and trying to groom n trap minors (under 18). The person u r referring r called blackmailers or gooners (in current terms i think)|||In my experience, Girls seem to help girl only when they are on some “female tech organization” and it’s rarely a technical mentorship. They should be helpful without such aids too. I am sorry that you had to deal with these. that’s extremely disgusting.  Still there are bunch of female led tech groups - they have ties with it company - approach them.|||Other side - back in Nepal I used to work for a compant that paid well and had better reputation. A young girl in her early 20s reached out to me for a referall for associate engineer. I hesitated a bit seeing her technical knowledge. She offered sex plus 1 months of her salary if I referred and she got hired. Was a weird encounter. I am still not sure if she qas serious or not.

I left my job after a year because of a toxic culture. I swear, I couldn't find a position (I was even applying for internships) at any tech company in Kathmandu. I thought it wouldn't be that difficult since I have decent projects and a year of experience, but I remain jobless for next three months. It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

            "body": "I’ve been holding this inside for a long time, and I just want to let it out.  I wasn’t a “smart kid” in school. I never understood things as fast as my friends did. I struggled even to read a paragraph and find the right answer, even in class 10. I used to feel dumb every single day. Some of my friends got things so quickly, but I didn’t. I still feel cringe thinking about it.  I also had tics. I don’t know if it was Tourette’s or something else, because I never checked. When I get excited or angry, my eyes blink hard and my back twists. It was embarrassing, and it distracted me so much in school. I used to wish I could just be “normal.”  But after my S.E.E., something changed. That 3-month break gave me a new life. I had my “aha” moment. Somehow, I finally started understanding things. Maybe it was the silence, maybe it was being away from all the noise, maybe it was just loneliness giving me space to think. But everything shifted.  I taught myself how to code. I got a job as a software developer. I didn’t finish my degree because my college wouldn’t let me work while studying, so I said “forget it” and focused on work. It was well paid, and nobody asked for a degree anyway. So yeah, I’m a dropout who made it this far.  I’m still not “super smart,” but I’m definitely smarter than the version of me back then. I still have tics, they still distract me sometimes, but I’m living with it.  I just needed to get this off my chest. I’ve kept it inside for too long.  **And to anyone reading this who feels like they’re slow, or not smart, or different:**   I hope you find your moment too. I hope you realize that you’re not broken. Sometimes loneliness or silence gives you a new life. You grow in ways you don’t even notice at first. You don’t have to be a genius to make it. You just have to keep going. If I can do it, anyone can.  Stay strong. You’ll get your moment too.      ***Note: Yes, I did use ChatGPT to improve this text, mainly to fix grammar mistakes. I hope that’s alright.***",

We normally don’t jump into public threads, but after reading this post and the comments, we felt it was important to share our side honestly and respectfully.  First, we want to say this clearly: we’re not here to fight anyone or deny their feelings. If someone feels disappointed, that matters. At the same time, one side of the story doesn’t always show the full picture.  1. Not all students are the same Every batch has students with very different abilities, discipline levels, and learning speeds. Some push themselves hard and grow fast. Some struggle, skip practice, or expect results without consistent effort. That difference affects outcomes, and it’s something no institute can fully control.  2. Many students come from very weak foundations A lot of students who join us come from backgrounds where code is still taught by writing it on the board, not by actually building things. No real tools, no projects, no industry exposure. They don’t come job-ready. They come to become job-ready. And despite these gaps, we genuinely try our best to upgrade them, change how they think about learning, and push them toward practical skills. On top of that, we take responsibility by providing guaranteed internship opportunities so they at least get real-world exposure.  3. Internships are where most people get stuck in Nepal The harsh truth is this: a huge number of IT graduates in Nepal never get an internship at all. Without that first step, they never discover what they’re capable of. Many eventually give up, leave the field, or leave the country believing Nepal has no scope. We may not be perfect, but if we can at least help someone start, that matters to us.  4. We are transparent from day one Before anyone joins Mindrisers, we explain things clearly, how the course works, what’s expected from the student, how internships are handled, everything. We use written agreements so there’s no confusion later. If, despite that, posts like this come up, all we can do is stay honest and let time speak. We truly believe karma catches up to both good and bad intentions.  We’re still learning. We’re still improving. And we’re open to real feedback. But please understand, we’re not here to scam, exploit, or sell fake dreams. We’re trying to do something meaningful in a system that already has many problems.  Thanks to everyone who took time to read this. Team Mindrisers",

            "comments": "You have 4 years of experience but you don't seem to understand that writing formatted code syntax was never the hard part. When you know exactly what to do it's pretty easy to write the code for it. The hardest part of IT is trying to find out what the right questions to ask is so that you have a semblance on what exactly to code. It's trying to understand what the users of your software want. Have AI figure that out for you and then tell me.|||You are just here because of money which is not bad, but  for some programming is getting their vision on screen, a way to show creativity. You dont get to decide who is a fool|||with the increase in AI expect to get shitty codes delivered faster than we have ever seen. Shitty code, more bugs and more opportunities for IT devs. Not every company can afford AI that is going to cost fortune in long run. Mid-level devs would collapse, there would be junior then senior. Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||[https://sip-club-webier.vercel.app/](https://sip-club-webier.vercel.app/)  Bro yettiko website with cms, bina problem kaam garney AI le banau ani manum la bro ko kura.|||Skill issue.

Don't get me wrong - vibe coding and low code/no code methods are getting popular with some LLM coders (Claude, Gemini) becoming absolute beasts, but, the real need of a human is in problem solving and building scalable systems. My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.  The problem is people jumping on the bandwagon which is creating a terrible environment for business owners, recruiters and stakeholders.  I hope you do well in your career my friend. Let's all stay hopeful about the future. We have a long way to go before judgement day arrives and they finally take over.",

            "body": "I’ve been thinking about this for a while. It feels like in Nepal, we have tons of programmers and tech talent, people who can build apps, websites, AI stuff, you name it. But when it comes to GTM, growth, marketing, or just figuring out how to actually sell and scale a product… there’s a huge gap.  Most startups here are run by tech engineers, and naturally, the focus is on building the product perfectly. That’s great, but then things like growth strategy, customer acquisition, positioning, and distribution get ignored. People just assume if you build it, users will come. Spoiler: they don’t.  Most of the startups here in Nepal fail less because the product is bad, but instead because the distribution/game-plan is weak.   Here in Nepal, GTM skills aren’t really taught, nor are they considered “cool” compared to coding. Most people in IT industrychase programming jobs, freelancing gigs, or outsourcing contracts because that’s a safer bet financially.  I think this is actually a huge opportunity. Someone who can master GTM skis here like: user research, acquisition channels, funnel optimization, sales psychology could easily dominate the startup scene.   Instead of just learning yet another JS framework, you should also learn GTM skills.   What do you guys think?",

It can also help in marketing where thousand of user are looking for something, and they can get what they actually want surfing through that category.   3. Since the users who are there and checking out the coming technology and products in the market, they can tell you if that will work out or not.

Look at Indonesia it follows Sufism mixed with agakhani sect do we hear minorities being treated badly? No. Mostly it's the south Asian Muslims who are radical because they follow a very strict islam of deubandi and wahabism school of thought which has caused problem historically it's moderate example would be creation of Taliban and extreme example is creation of Pakztan. Now contrary to that you've Indonesia which is also a majority Muslim nation but follows Sufism school of thought which is why they are much more liberal. They're okay with currency having Ganesha, okay with garuda being national symbol(coat of arms), and even okay with naming kids from Sanskrit derived names like majority of their head of the states have Sanskrit origin names there will be some ups and downs in writing because Indonesia didn't follow devanagari it followed the Brahmi script earlier, in that way it's still preserving the culture. But if you tell this to a MUSLIM.from south Asia he will say it's shirk/haram in islam and that being associated with polytheism is bad and that they are a lost tribe of Turks and Arabs who had invaded our land. So, wahabism and Deubandi unless remained will not allow for inclusivity among the people islam factor will be there no matter what|||Can't decide which is the worst religion - Islam or Hinduism.

You literally heard “ghar renovate bhairacha” and your smooth brain went: “Aww baby, aaile mero room ma aaija na, teacher lai ni bolau, ma ta class ma hunchu, disturb pani hudaina.” Bro you didn’t just hand over your room, you handed over your entire bed for their afternoon fuck-session like a 5-star hotel receptionist. You set the mood, locked the door from outside and paid the electricity bill while that randi was getting railed on your own pillow.  You’re not a “nice boyfriend”, you’re a walking doormat with Wi-Fi. The moment she said “home tuition” alarm bells should’ve rung, but no, timi ta “disturb nahos” bhanera uniharulai honeymoon suite diyau. Teacher le timro girlfriend ko “syllabus” cover gardai thiyo ani timi bahira “nice guy” badge polish gardai basyo.  You came home early and still had to play detective like some Bollywood hero, peeking through the window because your own room was locked from inside. Bro even Nepali serials don’t have this level of chutiya plot.  And the cherry on top? You threw the blankets and rugs instead of throwing hands. Blanket jalaunu parne thiyo, timi chai “winter aaucha, kasari sutne” bhanera Daraz ma fluffy white rug khojdai chau. Bro your girlfriend got piped on your bed and your biggest concern is staying warm?? Priority thik cha baba.  You didn’t just get cheated on, you got professionally scammed by a third-class tutor and a third-rate girlfriend. Block her, delete everything burn the mattress and never ever say “disturb nahos” to a girl again.  You’re not heartbroken, you’re brain-dead.

What is wrong is wrong, I dunno what the procedure for BSF to enter each other countries is, with the open border and all, but I'm sure they are only able to enter after some permission from each other's authorities. If that is not the case here, then it's wrong and us Indians should accept that. 3. Nepal is a beautiful country. People have more civic sense and overall better sense of community and cohesion from what I have seen.  4. What Nepali people have to understand is India is a big country 1.4 billion people is a lot. So, of all the counties in the world, India is probably the only one you should never generalize. 6. Both Nepali and Indian people can have good relationship with each other, just learn to talk properly and not take things to ego. 6. Yes, India is a bigger economy, and has more resources, but it is not in competition with Nepal. Nepal has it's own strengths that it should not forget.  7. Open border has it's pros and cons. Yes, many Nepali are in India, do they get to build a life, yes. Do they get discriminated, yes, and so are Indians from other states. And Nepali also discriminate against Indian tourists and workers. 8. Always remember, most average Indians will probably only have good will towards Nepal and no hate.  9. It is very important that rather than spreading unnecessary generalized hate, we judge people on individual basis.

            "body": "Yesterday I posted about how I felt like a Pathao for my girlfriend, and almost everyone agreed that I was being used. So I finally talked to her about it. She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess. Aba Don feri Bumble ma janxa haha  Thankyou everyone for your suggestions sabai Lai mero tarfa Bata coffee ly",

            "body": "Namaste everyone,  I want to share an incident that happened to me in the last two weeks here in Germany.  My name is … Khadka, and I’ve been doing an Ausbildung at a Hofladen for the past 7 months. My chef treats me really well, like family.  Last week, I was at an Indian roadside café with my sister and some German friends, waiting for my chef to pick me up before visiting the Weihnachtsmarkt. We were waiting , suddenly two indian boys came to us and we had a short conversation . They were annoying so we started ignoring but they soon started making disrespectful comments like calling me MOMO and then mocking Nepal, our size, economy, and poverty. I didn’t respond with racism, though the conversation got heated.  Coincidentally, my chef was nearby, noticed something was wrong, and later asked if I was okay. I explained everything to him. He took it seriously and suggested legal action.  With the help of my chef’s lawyer, a legal letter was sent demanding an apology and €270 from the men. After a few days, they agreed to pay the money and apologized so the case would not go further.  Fun Fact : I and my sister literally eat MOMO after getting that 270 euro 😭😆  So reason of writing this post was just to sharing the possibility of what wrong can happened and how to handle this things.  Edit : For OC (https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204052999996390/permalink/2475725379495816/?mibextid=rS40aB7S9Ucbxw6v)",

The same thing worked for balen.  2.Never stop spamming those protests and victim videos on tik and Facebook.  3. Everyone makes sure to cast a vote themselves.

RSP will be the second-largest party after CPN-UML, with Congress coming in third. They won’t agree on many decisions, but a new government will still be formed. Congress and UML will form a coalition government with RSP, telling Ravi that failing to do so could mean the death of “democracy” in Nepal and urging him to put aside his ego for the greater good. Ravi will feel suffocated every single night, unable to do anything within yet another coalition government with Congress and UML. Rise and fall.

            "heading": "The Sisan Baniya I knew",
            "body": "I've been tempted to write this for a long time.       I was in a relationship with a popular male influencer for a long time. We broke up 2 years ago. During our 3+ year-long relationship, I got to be in his inner circle and hung out with Sisan and gang (and Shrinkhala too, before she went to Harvard). We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective. Just like Shrinkhala shamelessly posted those yellow highlighted Excel Sheets as her proof of innocence which had no third party audit or any verification.|||I have never watched Sisan Baniya, but I didn't feel that he ever portrayed himself as self made or coming from a humble background. He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Are you Mr. foodie's ex gf ?

One of the client where I used to work said his dad has a huge business and big house for office, they sell medals, trophies with custom carving and expensive compared to others but you can get anything you asked for (like design, customization and more).   And look at this babal store, restaurants and so on within a year or so and that too in very prime area.  That guy is fully loaded.|||Well..

Before he was viral. Even mod a subreddit for his work. And I do understand separating between the art and the artists. This all sounds very true and feels consistent with his person out of his art (videos)  It’s funny to see Sisan’s Simp Boys here, not even ready to listen to a different perspective. And they give such an Incel vibe, hating up on a woman.  I really hope they are all kids who will grow out of this someday and realize how lame they were.  Sisan 500% milked his breakup while Shrinkhala and was so out of character for the graceful guy character he tries to build up in vlogs.|||As someone who is distantly related to him, i can vouch for the Buddhist girl thing.

I also worked and hung out with and around Sisan Shrinkhala a lot.

And the way he spoke up about the Miss Nepal funds k k when the hate for her was at an all time high. Personally I have no sympathy or love for Shrinkhala so I am not saying this to defend her.

            "heading": "Went to India recently and it was immensely traumatizing",
            "body": "So I (27M) went to India for the first time. I was traveling solo turns out it was a bad idea. It was for work related events. After the event, I decided to explore a few places.   Until the work event, everything was fine. It was great learning and networking in the event. I actually speak Hindi very fluently so communication wasn’t an issue at all. After the event, I wanted to travel and explore.   I had booked a pretty average room for my accommodation. Nothing fancy, just the most budget friendly one I could find. There were a couple of people in the lobby and they greeted me nicely and asked for my ID. I showed them my passport and their faces instantly changed after seeing my Nepali passport. The guy said oh you’re from Nepal. I said yes and the another man said, this doesn’t work, we need to see an Indian ID. They weren’t smiling anymore and were giving me very skeptical looks. I tried not to overthink it. He kept insisting for an Indian ID and I explained to him that I am not from India, it’s my first time here so it’s not possible for me to have an Indian ID. Then they asked me for my contact number and I gave my phone number (didn’t have Indian number). Once again, they kept on asking for an Indian number. I was really surprised seeing their hospitality instantly changed after learning about my identity. Not sure if they did that because I was a foreigner to them or because I was specifically a Nepali guy.   While I was exploring the local market, I went to buy some souvenirs. One shop guy asked me where I was from and I said Nepal. He then started lecturing me saying don’t be close with China. They will do the same to you what Pakistan is doing to us. He kept yapping about how Nepal is a small part of India and that we should be grateful that we have a “bada bhai” like India. I left the shop without saying anything.    I wanted to travel by train but had absolutely zero idea about it. The people weren’t helpful there either. I was asking the various staff in the train station saying I wanna go here where can I find a ticket. They just vaguely pointed go there, it’s over there. Finally one guy at the ticket counter helped me get tickets after nearly couple of hours of running frantically here and there. I told him I’m not from India, traveling by train for the first time. The counter guy gave me a ticket saying this is for general class, it’s not safe to travel there..very crowded and chaotic, after your train arrives, meet the ticket guy and ask him to upgrade to AC compartment. I thanked him and went to the platform. There was a police officer whom I asked about upgrading the ticket. He too said the same thing i.e. meet the ticket guy once your train arrives and he will help you.   I still had about 3-4 hours before my train arrived. I just stayed in the platform watching movie. After the train arrived, I was frantically searching for the ticket guy. One police officer came near me charging with his baton. I was shit scared. He almost charged me saying why are you in the AC compartment with a general ticket in your hand. I was literally shaking at this point and with a shaky voice, I explained him my situation. He said haven’t you been in a train before where are you from. I said I’m from Nepal and he laughed saying oh you guys don’t even have trains there haha. Are you really from Nepal, your eyes don’t look like Nepalese. (I think he was referring to Mongolian eyes). I saw the ticket guy and went to him. He said me go to this seat and I’ll come. Later, he came to me and upgraded my ticket. The journey was a little over an hour long. And I was constantly replaying the entire experience from the hotel to the local market to the train station police guy.    Not sure if I just happened to meet all the wrong people or that everyone is the same there. Either way, I’m not going back to India for a long time. And I haven’t even mentioned the kids constantly following you begging for money, the dirt and litter everywhere, people peeing and even pooping in the open, unnecessary horns, air pollution.

Which cities did you visit, by the way? and as far as I know, many hotels in India especially smaller ones usually avoid foreigners because of paperwork and FRRO/police registration requirements. It’s better to stay at big hotels or resorts while traveling. I personally mostly stay at resorts, especially Club Mahindra ones they’re quite good, with solid service.  Also, try to do everything online in India train bookings, hotels, cabs. That way you’re much less likely to get scammed or harsh treated. Offline train ticket booking is honestly very hectic, even for Indians, so always book train tickets online. Use the official IRCTC website or authorized partners like MakeMyTrip, ConfirmTkt, or Paytm then you won’t face these problems.  And if you remember the time, location, duration, or the office name, you can also register a complaint on the Rail Madad portal or app. Lastly, there’s a huge generation gap in India you’ll mostly hear such racist things from older people or those in the 30–40 age group, but the younger generation is usually nicer and more helpful .You can even see this generation gap while speaking English. If you start speaking English in front of older people, they often treat you like some different person almost a ‘raja sahab’ type. But with the younger generation, it usually doesn’t make much of a difference. Anyway, I hope your journey was safe.|||Mods, how much racial abuse is tolerated here?

You feel lost in those reactions and might even get out of your mind just looking at them. But listen to the tale, the story of how learning really happens. I don't know if you play games like Free Fire, PUBG, Royale, or something else. Ask yourself how you remembered all the gun names, location names, and the different things in them. How you remembered a whole 3-hour-long story you watched years ago? Treat these things the same way. Connect with them. Practice writing out the reaction yourself.

Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

We’re just a group of peers showing up and leading where we can. This reel captures some of the curiosity we saw that day—it’s a small start, but a meaningful one.  If you want to build, learn, or contribute to what we're doing, we’d love to have you.  👉 Join the movement: https://codeyatranp.com/join",

Even if you do, just think of yourself succeeding. Confidence chai chaincha hai tara you've got to put in the work too. Ajhai 8 9 months bhandai baseu bhane, one blink and the exam will be really close. Ghar ma distract hunchau bhane study at a library/study room. Don't get consumed by unnecessary thoughts and stay disciplined.|||12 passout bhayexi aaru kei garenau? ek barsa waste hola hai bro aali ramrari sochera decide gara|||Well...
