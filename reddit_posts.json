            "body": "Breaking the Loop: Constitutional Reforms for a Corruption-Free Nepal  Introduction  Nepal’s Constitution enshrines democratic values, but gaps in accountability mechanisms allow corruption to recycle the same leaders in power. This document identifies specific clauses, explains why they are problematic, and proposes concrete reforms to build a corruption-free Nepal.  Clause-by-Clause Problems & Fixes  1. Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) Clause: Article 239(1) – excludes jurisdiction if other laws apply. Article 239(1) – excludes jurisdiction if other laws apply. Problem: Creates gray zones for powerful officials; slows or blocks cases. Resolution: Remove carve-out. Give CIAA full concurrent jurisdiction over all public officials.  2. Impeachment of Top Officials Clause: Article 101 – requires ¼ initiation and 2/3 majority. Article 101 – requires ¼ initiation and 2/3 majority. Problem: Politicized, slow, and used as bargaining tool; stalls accountability. Resolution: Keep 2/3 majority but add strict timelines and allow independent prosecutors to continue cases.  3. Politicized Appointments Clause: Article 284 – Constitutional Council appointments. Article 284 – Constitutional Council appointments. Problem: Delays and partisan deals keep watchdog posts vacant or compromised. Resolution: Enforce hard deadlines, automatic acting appointments, and require opposition sign-off.  4. Anti-Defection Law Clause: Article 89(e) – MPs lose seat if expelled by party. Article 89(e) – MPs lose seat if expelled by party. Problem: MPs serve party chiefs, not voters; leaders recycle themselves. Resolution: Narrow scope to confidence/budget votes only; introduce voter recall power.  5. Right to Information vs Privacy Clause: Articles 27 & 28 – RTI limited by privacy. Articles 27 & 28 – RTI limited by privacy. Problem: Asset disclosures hidden behind 'privacy'. Resolution: Prioritize RTI over privacy for public officials; mandate annual open asset disclosure.  6. Non-MP Ministers Clause: Article 78 – allows ministers for six months without being MPs. Article 78 – allows ministers for six months without being MPs. Problem: Short-term patronage appointments with low accountability. Resolution: Restrict to emergencies; require parliamentary confirmation and pre-oath disclosures.  7. Auditor General Clause: Article 240 – AG appointed via politicized Council. Article 240 – AG appointed via politicized Council. Problem: Vacancies or weak appointments blunt audit power. Resolution: Automatic succession if deadline missed; mandatory public hearings on audit findings.  8. Lack of Recall Power Clause: No recall mechanism in Constitution. No recall mechanism in Constitution. Problem: Voters stuck with corrupt MPs for five years. Resolution: Add recall provision (25% petition → referendum).  9. Parliamentary Hearings Clause: Article 292(1) – requires hearings but often rubber-stamped. Article 292(1) – requires hearings but often rubber-stamped. Problem: Weak scrutiny leads to weak watchdogs. Resolution: Require minimum 21-day scrutiny and publish minority reports.   The Recycling Loop  These weaknesses reinforce each other: politicized appointments weaken watchdogs; party-boss control prevents accountability; lack of transparency hides corruption; no voter recall allows corrupt leaders to recycle endlessly.  The Reform Roadmap  A 10-point reform package will end recycling: strengthen CIAA, de-politicize appointments, mandate asset disclosure, tighten anti-defection, empower voters with recall, ensure strong audits, and guarantee transparent parliamentary hearings.  Conclusion  Nepal can become corruption-free if its Constitution closes loopholes that protect the corrupt. These reforms are not optional but essential for a just and democratic future.  परिचय नेपालको संविधानले लोकतान्त्रिक मूल्यहरूलाई अंगीकार गरेको भए पनि जवाफदेहिताका संयन्त्रहरूमा कमजोरी र खाल्डाखुल्डीहरूका कारण भ्रष्टाचारले त्यही नेताहरूलाई निरन्तर सत्तामा फर्काइरहेको छ। यस दस्तावेजले संवैधानिक धाराहरू पहिचान गर्छ, किन समस्या छ भनेर स्पष्ट पार्छ, र ठोस सुधारको प्रस्ताव राख्छ।  धारा अनुसार समस्या र समाधान  १. अख्तियार दुरुपयोग अनुसन्धान आयोग (CIAA) धारा: धारा २३९(१) – अन्य कानुन लागू भए अधिकार क्षेत्र बाहिर।  समस्या: शक्तिशाली पदाधिकारीका लागि खाल्डा सिर्जना हुन्छ; मुद्दा ढिला वा रोक्छ।  समाधान: खाल्डा हटाउनुपर्छ। सबै सार्वजनिक पदाधिकारीमाथि CIAA को पूर्ण अधिकार दिनुपर्छ।  २. उच्च पदाधिकारीको महाभियोग धारा: धारा १०१ – १/४ दर्ता र २/३ बहुमत आवश्यक।  समस्या: राजनीतिकरण हुन्छ, ढिला हुन्छ, र बार्गेनिङको औजार बन्छ।  समाधान: २/३ बहुमत कायम राख्दै कडा समयसीमा तोक्नुपर्छ र स्वतन्त्र अभियोजकले मुद्दा निरन्तर अघि बढाउन पाउनुपर्छ।  ३. राजनीतिक नियुक्ति धारा: धारा २८४ – संवैधानिक परिषदको नियुक्ति।  समस्या: ढिला र दलगत सम्झौताले रिक्त वा कमजोर नियामक नियुक्त हुन्छन्।  समाधान: समयसीमा कडाइका साथ लागू गर्नुपर्छ, ढिला भएमा स्वतः कार्यवाहक नियुक्त गर्नुपर्छ, र विपक्षी हस्ताक्षर अनिवार्य बनाउनुपर्छ।  ४. दलपरिवर्तन विरोधी कानून धारा: धारा ८९(ई) – दलले हटाए सांसदको पद रिक्त हुन्छ।  समस्या: सांसदहरूले मतदाताभन्दा पार्टी नेतालाई सेवा गर्छन्; नेताहरू आफैंलाई दोहोर्याउँछन्।  समाधान: यसलाई विश्वासको मत र बजेट मतमा मात्र सीमित गर्नुपर्छ; मतदातालाई सांसद फिर्ता बोलाउने अधिकार दिनुपर्छ।  ५. सूचना अधिकार बनाम गोपनीयता धारा: धारा २७ र २८ – गोपनीयताले सूचना अधिकारलाई सीमित गर्छ।  समस्या: सम्पत्ति विवरण गोपनीयता भन्दै लुकाइन्छ।  समाधान: सार्वजनिक पदाधिकारीका लागि सूचना अधिकारलाई प्राथमिकता दिनुपर्छ; वार्षिक सार्वजनिक सम्पत्ति विवरण अनिवार्य बनाउनुपर्छ।  ६. गैर-सांसद मन्त्री धारा: धारा ७८ – गैर-सांसद ६ महिनासम्म मन्त्री हुन सक्छन्।  समस्या: छोटो अवधिको राजनीतिक नियुक्तिले जवाफदेहिता कम हुन्छ।  समाधान: आपतकालीन अवस्थामा मात्र अनुमति दिनुपर्छ; संसदीय अनुमोदन र सम्पत्ति विवरण आवश्यक हुन्छ।  ७. महालेखा परीक्षक धारा: धारा २४० – राजनीतिक परिषदमार्फत नियुक्त।  समस्या: रिक्तता वा कमजोर नियुक्तिले लेखापरीक्षण शक्तिहीन हुन्छ।  समाधान: ढिला भएमा स्वतः कार्यवाहक नियुक्त; जोखिमयुक्त लेखापरीक्षणमा सार्वजनिक सुनुवाइ अनिवार्य।  ८. फिर्ता बोलाउने अधिकारको अभाव धारा: संविधानमा फिर्ता बोलाउने व्यवस्था छैन।  समस्या: मतदाताले पाँच वर्षसम्म भ्रष्ट सांसदसँगै बस्नुपर्छ।  समाधान: २५% हस्ताक्षर संकलनपछि जनमतसंग्रहमार्फत सांसद फिर्ता बोलाउने प्रावधान थप्नुपर्छ।  ९. संसदीय सुनुवाइ धारा: धारा २९२(१) – सुनुवाइ हुन्छ तर प्रायः औपचारिक।  समस्या: कमजोर परीक्षणले कमजोर नियामक जन्माउँछ।  समाधान: कम्तीमा २१ दिनको समीक्षा अवधि आवश्यक; अल्पमत प्रतिवेदन प्रकाशित गर्नुपर्छ।   दोहोरीने चक्र यी कमजोरीहरूले एकअर्कालाई मजबुत पार्छन्: राजनीतिक नियुक्तिले नियामकलाई कमजोर बनाउँछ; पार्टी नेताको नियन्त्रणले जवाफदेहिता रोक्छ; पारदर्शिताको अभावले भ्रष्टाचार लुकाउँछ; फिर्ता बोलाउने अधिकार नहुँदा त्यही नेताहरू पुनःचक्रमा आउँछन्।  सुधारको रोडम्याप १० बुँदे सुधार प्याकेजले पुनर्चक्र तोड्छ: CIAA मजबुत बनाउन, नियुक्ति राजनीतिकरण हटाउन, सम्पत्ति विवरण अनिवार्य बनाउन, दलपरिवर्तन नियम कडाइ गर्न, मतदातालाई फिर्ता बोलाउने अधिकार दिन, मजबुत लेखापरीक्षण सुनिश्चित गर्न, र पारदर्शी संसदीय सुनुवाइ लागू गर्नुपर्छ।  निष्कर्ष नेपाल भ्रष्टाचारमुक्त बन्न सक्छ यदि संविधानले भ्रष्टलाई जोगाउने खाल्डा बन्द गर्छ। यी सुधारहरू विकल्प होइनन्, न्यायपूर्ण र लोकतान्त्रिक भविष्यका लागि अनिवार्य हुन्।",

            "body": "lets face it, most of us were nowhere nearly aware about politics before this happened. this was supposed to be OUR first protest, a faceless protest , with funny play cards full of memes, funny slogans and so on. that took unprecedented turn and we were in shock and rage after how September 8 unfolded. september 9 was mix of our rage, despair and other interest groups playing on us. we didn't burn the chosen rooms of supreme court, we didn't steal hard disks from attorney general's office, we didn't go to free rabi lamichhane from prison, different interest groups did masking themselves as Gen Z protestors.  yes, we toppled the government but we were unclear of what we really wanted after that. Yes, we wanted better Nepal, corruption free nation , a nation with endless opportunities but those are all abstract demands. After the government toppled , what next? we were not prepared with what we wanted right after. we had not thought of that , rightly so. then we demanded for the parliament to be dissolved and elections to be called. but we didn't have the idea that next elections were going to be held as per same election system. we said that we wanted to protect the constitution. Now we're hearing the voices that this election system will lead us nowhere and new interim constitution is must. but like before, we haven't thought about that much and we're starting to demand that. let me talk a little bit about the constitution. this constitution , maybe with some flaws, showed its robustness in such a difficult time too. this was a hard fought constitution, after many years of chaos in country, we finally got it. bringing in a new interim constitution means the old one gets automatically annihilated and we'd have to get a new one in the future. like it happened after 62/63 - constitution 46 got annihilated, interim 63 came in play and took around 10 long years to get constitution 72. those 10 years were full of chaos and political play. bandas every month, change of governments, political play in name of ethnicity and so on. full chaos. had it not been the earthquake of 72, I doubt we'd have got this constitution that year. even after constitution India was not happy with the demarcation of madesh and gave us months of blockade and made the situation in earthquake struck country even worse.  rolling back the constitution and bringing an interim constitution will not come by itself, it will come will all the chaos of those 10 years. India , though now has \"accepted\" the constitution, would be the first power to play in it. then we have people demanding ethnic based states in the east. Madesh wants a whole madesh pradesh which would isolate hills and Himalayan region from the southern border. There are people who want the parliamentary system to be gone, there are people who want to bring back mo\\*\\*rchy. Those all fought in the constituent assembly elections back then, lost the elections and thus couldn't get their agendas into constitution but now want to get it done somehow. We held TWO constituent assembly elections just to get this constitution.  I request all my gen z friends to think from all the possible angles. Lets not do the same mistake we did a week ago, we didn't think from different angles and now we are already divided. we didn't think of election system back then, most of us probably thought but the ones in driving seat did without thinking much. i listened the vc in discord group for a while this morning and most of the participants seemed confused while the one talking there kept preaching from just one angle. we can clearly see, rise of ra\\*\\*badi groups trying to inject their own agendas, maoists trying the same and all other interest groups doing same. this might end up as blunder. lets think it through.  if so, what next ? for now, we can go with this constitution, this election system with a good campaign under a good leadership. first thing we need right now is unity. sumana, balen, sagar dhakal, the next gen of politicians united under a same party for next elections. second thing, a good campaign is what we need moving forward. we need people abroad to come back and vote this time. i see lots of youths losing confidence already, thinking these parties will prevail after elections again. lets not give up that easily, without fighting the battle. after elections we can amend the constitution through our elected representatives. lets take that agenda to elections too. most of the voters are fed up with this big government we have in states and center. with proper agendas and campaign we can win over them for sure. the real battle in democracy is elections and the preparation is campaign. lets start communicating with our youth leaders, lets ask them to be united for once. UNITED WE STAND , DIVIDED WE FALL.",

This prejudice eludes parents into FOMO , worried that their child—their future cash cow—might miss the golden ticket to success. In trying to break free from poverty, they end up chaining their children to a new kind of slavery. Some kids walk into it willingly. Most don’t even realize what’s happening until they’re already too deep to turn back.  A few break free with raw talent, hard work, or rare skills. But the rest? They’re stuck grinding in the rat race. Meanwhile the parents gets addicted to their children’s income to sustain the newfound luxury, they could never afford on their own.

They send their children away with heavy hearts, praying for a future brighter than the one they themselves endured.  To label these parents as \"human traffickers\" is deeply painful and unfair. It disregards the emotional toll, the cultural values, and the economic hardships that shape such decisions. Yes, the system is flawed. Yes, the government must do more. But to reduce this complex reality to accusations of slavery and addiction to income is to ignore the dignity and struggle of ordinary Nepali families.  Let us not confuse desperation with malice. Let us not judge without walking in their shoes. Instead, let’s advocate for better policies, stronger support systems, and a future where no parent feels forced to choose between love and livelihood.|||And here are my parents.

If you think parents are “human traffickers” and you believe it’s all for their interest, why not leave them and stay somewhere else.

Please go educate yourself on the effects of human trafficking, how prevalent it is even in today's world and the stories from victims that have \"escaped\". Nepal has been, historically, and even today a hot bed for human traffickers.

It doesnt happen only with those going abroad, but with those living in Nepal as well. I have seen it happen to teachers mainly. Majority of the secondary school teachers are a clear victim of such traps as majority of them wanted to do something else, be someone better like an engineer, doctor however since their parents forced them to earn money and not leave the sustainable source of income.   And obviously it happens to the lower manpower as well. Welp, whom can we blame for this though. This is a system, a deeply rooted system/mindset, sickening yet integral.|||They are not human trafficking, those thave have lived in this country longer know the country better, if they want better life for themselves and their families what's wrong?|||i am so tired of watching parents' obsession with their children's success. you brought theminto this world, so do what you can to raise them well. then just dont expect much from them. my parents are so excessively obsessed with my grades etc. that it hurts. we have never had a parents child talk, always about studies and grades and blah blah. i cannot wait to move out and not give them a single penny lol.|||Dumbest post in the history of Reddit|||I know many parents, who have given up their dreams and survived on bare minimum just to make sure their children get better life.

But when I talk to them, many don’t sound happy they’re working nonstop just to survive and cover tuition fees.  I chose differently. I stayed in Nepal. Since Class 12, I’ve been financially independent. I invested in NEPSE, paid for my own bachelor’s admission, and worked full-time (40 hrs/week) while balancing a day college schedule. It was tough, but manageable. Whenever I felt burned out, I’d take a break and go trekking or visit lakes with friends.  Now I’m in my final year, working remotely for a US company with good pay, and planning to launch my own startup soon. Looking back, I don’t regret my decision at all.

Is going abroad worth all the hype?",

My parents left Nepal when I was too young to make a decision, and I followed them. But the feeling of being back home is unmatched. I have been to many countries throughout the years, made many successes in my career, but nothing matches the feeling of walking in Boudha in the evening...or racing to see a sunset on Poon Hill.

After 5 years, when he was 27, he went abroad and is now a permanent citizen of Australia.   Moral: Buddhi palauna time lagcha.|||Simple answer for you it is not same for every one.|||This kind of post rubs me the wrong way a bit because it feels like you’re trying to position yourself as “smarter” or “better” than the people who went abroad. The reality is that both paths, either staying in Nepal or going abroad, have their own pros and cons, and people choose based on circumstances that are often very different from yours.  You mention being financially independent, investing early, and balancing work with studies. That’s impressive, but it’s also a privilege many don’t have. Plenty of sons and daughters in Nepal are grinding just to pay off family debts or keep their households afloat. For them, going abroad isn’t about “hype” but it’s about survival, opportunity, or helping their families. Even the ability to invest in NEPSE in the first place points to a cleaner starting slate than what a lot of others face.  And while you thrived staying in Nepal, not everyone has that option. Families who send their kids abroad are often taking huge risks and sacrifices, sometimes from already fragile financial situations. Even if someone goes abroad and struggles at first, starting from zero (or even from debt) can eventually set them up for long-term security that wouldn’t be possible back home.  So yes, it’s great that you’re making it work in Nepal, but framing it in a way that hints at looking down on people who go abroad ignores the complexity of their decisions and struggles.|||You are lucky, I suppose. I didn't want to leave too but had a lots of failure and lacking economic support lead ultimately to go out. I miss my country more than anything. I wish you all the best.  Going abroad was definitely worth it for me. Specially during covid, I could atleast support economically. We literally were able to save my FIL by pushing money to the hospital. Few lakhs is not a big problem for me so I always have that assurance that I can take care of my family if needed. I am also less worried about kids, as they will have better opportunity for everything. Government supports health and education, and only fooding and clothing them is what I have to worry about. They also have opportunity to grow in a better society free from caste and religion based nonsense so they can actually focus on things that matter. Its much easier for them to travel anywhere in the world because the passport is much stronger. So overall I can take care of my parents and give a better start to my kids, which makes me content.

            "heading": "Nepal’s Struggle Against the Maoist Terror: A Legacy of Destruction",
            "body": "Nepal’s journey toward democracy and stability has been fraught with challenges, but few periods have left as deep a scar as the rise of the Maoist terrorist party in the 1990s. What began as a claim to fight for “freedom and justice” quickly transformed into a reign of terror that destabilized the entire nation. Today, it is crucial to revisit that period, acknowledge the devastation they caused, and understand why their continued presence in Nepal’s political ecosystem threatens the country’s future.  The Rise of the Maoist Terrorists  In the early 1990s, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) capitalized on widespread dissatisfaction with the government. Claiming to represent the marginalized and oppressed, they launched an armed insurgency aimed at overthrowing the state. Their rhetoric promised equality and justice, but the reality was starkly different. They systematically targeted anyone who opposed them, creating a climate of fear that permeated villages, towns, and cities across Nepal.  A Humanitarian and Societal Catastrophe  The Maoist insurgency was not just a political movement—it was a campaign of terror. Thousands of innocent people were killed, many of them civilians, including women, children, and the elderly. Families were displaced, livelihoods destroyed, and entire communities were forced to flee in search of safety. Education systems were disrupted as schools were burned, teachers threatened, and children’s access to learning severely restricted. The country’s economic fabric also suffered as businesses were looted, financial institutions destabilized, and critical infrastructure destroyed.  The claim of fighting for justice was a cover for widespread human rights violations. Ordinary Nepalis lived under the constant threat of violence, forced recruitment, and intimidation. Millions suffered directly or indirectly from the chaos they unleashed.  The International Perspective  Even decades later, the legacy of Maoist terror is recognized internationally. Many of the party’s leaders are still considered a security risk in several countries due to their past involvement in violent acts. This global acknowledgment underscores that the label of “terrorist” was not a political exaggeration but a documented reality.  The Danger of Continued Political Influence  Despite their violent past, Maoist parties continue to wield power in Nepal’s political landscape. Their participation in mainstream politics has allowed them to avoid accountability while maintaining influence over government decisions. Until they are removed from positions of authority, Nepal faces an ongoing risk of instability. History shows that unchecked power in the hands of those who once led a violent insurgency often leads to repeated cycles of corruption, intimidation, and societal disruption.  Conclusion: Removing the Cancer  Nepal cannot achieve true stability while individuals and parties with a history of terrorism continue to dominate its political sphere. The country’s citizens deserve a government that prioritizes development, education, and the safety of its people—not one whose foundations are built on fear, violence, and propaganda. The Maoist era of terror is a stark reminder that freedom and justice cannot coexist with unchecked brutality. For Nepal to finally move forward, this destructive influence must be purged from its political ecosystem once and for all.",

            "body": "Hey everyone! I'm planning another trip to Nepal from end of November to end of March, and this time I want to step up my game significantly.  **Background:** In my previous visits, I've done the popular trekking routes like ABC, Mardi Base Camp, and similar trails. This time, I'm ready to attempt something more challenging - a proper 6000m+ peak climb.  **Questions for those with experience:**  1. **Agency vs. Group climbing** \\- Should I go through a climbing agency or try to find/join a group? What are the pros and cons of each approach? 2. **Timing** \\- With my Nov-March window, which peaks would be most suitable for this timeframe? 3. **Preparation** \\- What kind of additional training/gear should I focus on beyond regular trekking experience? 4. **Community** \\- Has anyone here done this kind of climbing? Would love to hear your experiences and any recommendations.  **Observation:** I've noticed that most serious mountain climbing in Nepal seems to be dominated by foreign climbers, while many Nepalis stick to base camp treks. Is this just my limited observation, or is there a reason for this pattern? Are there local climbing communities I should know about?  Any advice, recommendations, or reality checks would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

This narrative that communism brings misery to all and maybe inequality is the 'natural' way of things. While I don't support yemale, maobadi -- they are as neoliberal or more than congress-- using this to attack on the communism as ideology is also unfair. Just like you can not judge Gen Z for some hijacking their protest, you can also not judge communism because imperialist forces are also hijacking any attempt of a communist state. There are also several nuances -- of course USSR - say a *proper* implementation gave rise to famine (holodomar) and a lot of bloodshed, it also improved the lives of regular peasants. I was reading the accounts of the family who moved from absolute shanks to one bedroom apartments. Plus, there can be a lot of concessions and modifications -  like China for example moved it's modality to state sponsored capitalism -- of course it's a surveillance state and state is overarching (one child policy) but the improvement in standard of living and progress in society (healthcare and education) is out there. And also to blame famine and bloodshed in communism is also seeing reality with only one tainted lenses -- potato famine in Ireland, Churchill's starvation of Bengalis). I would rather live in a equal society where basics are provided to everyone else rather than of course this fucking crap of reality that we have where a 1000 year old bridge gets destroyed for someone's yacht.|||The communist parties in Nepal are only communist in name. No offense but this question in itself is really stupid because there's more than two options, stop presenting a false dichotomy and pretending to know what a communist is.|||Would you like two people make same income and live in a happy community or would you prefer income inequality causing chaos, widspread unhappiness, rampant greed, and ultimately poor people killing rich?

It's embarrassing all of this has been addressed 150 years ago and everyone is divided with cold war misinformation which is now mainstream knowledge.   https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/   Or summary video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEA_7HpLG8c   By this, I don't mean you should be subservient to your fake communist party, who doesn't even introduce basic theory to the curriculum. I wonder why..... They embraced neoliberalism which is inherently anti communist and brings misfortune. They are not interested in worker empowerment. The choice of taking the path of socialism vs capitalism is like not choosing brands of chocolate, but it's like a choice between monarchy and modernity. They are not on the same plane. Capitalism was revolutionary compared to feudalism at the time, but everyone's material conditions around the world today are deteriorating real fast because of profit > people and many are coming to the same conclusion either by learning or economic desperation. This is why fascism is on the rise to \"bring back order\" to a failed system riddled with core contradictions that cannot be reconciled.   Freedom under capitalism is freedom for capital owners, it doesn't work if everyone has a basic level of economic security by virtue of access to means of production.   I also know capitalist bad actors preemptively try to delegitimize and mock the idea. They did the same with slavery, and with monarchies, and now with capitalism. In reality, the path is clear, you just have to keep learning, keep organizing and keep pushing through.|||What an stupid framing? Nepal is truly blessed with low iq goodness.|||I'm a pro capitalist myself, but here's my take on why this is the case in Nepal (copied from another post of mine):  You see the problem with rich in the context of Nepal (and any underdeveloped nation) is that being filthy rich out of nowhere is almost always impossible. This is because in an underdeveloped economy, there isn't much consumer needs that you can solve which creates more value which makes you rich. The economy and society isn't sophisticated enough.  So, most of the rich people you see are mostly old money folks who were close to the monarchy, who got rich from the new political system, and that compounded with them owning land in the most important parts of the country.  Now, a select few being able to magically earn more (due to the land value appreciation) sitting idle while rest of the country has to work hard to earn some fraction of that is unfair, irrational, and unsustainable from a system design perspective.  This is contrary to what happens in a developed nation like America, where anyone can go and establish a billion dollar business by figuring out an emerging need and solving for it in the mesh of that sophisticated and good spending society.|||The earlier people in their 20s realize that communism doesn’t actually exist, the better. Many think calling themselves communist is cool, philosophical, and a stand for equality, but the truth is that communism has only ever lived in theories, never in real practice. Every so-called communist state eventually turned authoritarian or adapted to markets, and today the entire world has moved toward mixed economies—a balance of capitalism for growth and socialism for welfare. What sounds ideal in books is far from reality, and understanding this early saves a lot of misplaced idealism.|||The only true communist you speak of is china who has successfully implemented its concept( although there is still corruption they neutralise it instantly if found guilty unlike our country)Rest country who has adopted it has just formulated it in surface to show illusions in the eye of dumbass public like us in nepal. The no of millionaire in nepal suggest if they have become millionaire in legit manner or by 3rd ways. Yes become rich i dont mind but if you buy crores of property even though you have just stepped into financial field itself is a red flag. Nobody can generate that much profit in mere 1- 2 years. So yeah become rich but in legit manner which will probably take you 10- 12 years minimum not like these fuckers maoist amale congress who just comes into parliament and boom 10 ropanies 12 ropanies of land bought 5 crores vehicle bought son and daughter in foreign universities admitted where even the business man of that country has to work their ass off to pay the cost. Judge it for yourself!!!|||The idea of individualism and indiviluistic freedom is something that won't allow Communism to fluorish.  A lot of today's problem - that we see in our society - communism would solve it. But in paper, communism needs a way and mechanism for functioning properly and in transparent manner.  I'm against Communism - as I believe Socialism could be a potential solution. But you need to bound by heavy patriotism feeling for this to happen - and I don't think that is feasible for a lifetime of a human when other options provide better lifestyles.|||bishnu poudel|||Hi Friends,  One concern regarding the big banner,  Are they paying tax for it ?

In India the manufacturing industry was working on Socialist models as there were many government owned companies which had Monopoly that's why it never prospered.  But the Service sector contributes to 55% of GDP which works as an \"open market principle\" because there is no Government company or strict regulation.  Communist ideology looks good in theory but nature itself is capitalist, even ants collect their food before rain, and whoever will work hard will collect more.  The government's job should be only to create a level playing field (equal opportunity for all). This can be done by giving free education, healthcare etc.   India too was struggling with growth rate of only 3.5% till year 1991.

In Nepal, payments that you receive are deducted at source, meaning the payer or employer is liable for deducting tax and depositing the amount to the respective ird on behalf of her.  So what she received  must have been gross pay minus 15% = net pay, her take home amount.  Because she has multiple sources of income, all employers would have deducted 15% and paid her the amount.  Some companies or brands, however, bind you in contract and spread the single payment in a smaller amount paid in a longer period like monthly salary. This way, the tax amount would have been different.   But, given that employers are responsible for the tax deduction at source (TDS), it is assumed paid.|||Documents kunai pani legit vako vaye excel sheets hunna thyo.|||Since when did a self-typed excel sheet became proof?

If we waste the next six months bickering about names, the same people with the same playbook will turn up in our constituencies with **maasu-bhaat** and Rs.500 in hand and buy the system back , legally.  Nepal’s federal parliament is **334** people in total (275 reps + 59 assembly seats). Those 334 seats are the real levers of power. If we want change that lasts, we must stop treating this like a soap opera and start treating it like an emergency:  1. **Stop obsessing over a single leader.** Leaders are replaceable, institutions are not. If you only care about who’s trending on X/Instagram, you’ll lose the next election. 2. **Vet the candidates in your constituency.** Don’t ask “Who’s cool?” Ask: Can they run a school? Fix a road? Hold themselves accountable? Not convicted of graft? Real competence, not charisma. 3. **Watch the interim government, loudly and closely.** They were appointed to hold elections and keep the state functioning. Demand transparency, timelines, and action , not PR.  We can’t let the narrative be: “Gen Z made noise, old men bought votes, life went on.” That’s exactly what they want. They’ll smile, call it democracy, and walk back in , legally. So stop the name calling. Start a candidate list. Vet locally. Mobilize locally. Hold the interim government to account. Take the fight from feed arguments to ballot boxes.     ***Six months will go in a snap, So, start early.***",

At first it looked like just another protest: crowds of young people moving from one corner of Baneshwor to another, chanting slogans, taking photos, posting videos.  But everything changed when police opened fire. For many it was their first protest, and suddenly they were facing real violence and death. In a single day, I watched a generation grow up.  Now their posts are full of anger and sharp analysis. They’re impatient, but fiercely expressive and unwilling to look away from the hard truths older generations ignored. Some people still blame them for the chaos, yet all they really want is to have their voices heard.  I hope more people understand that. And, honestly, I miss their goofy, carefree side—the silly dances, the harmless fun. But I respect the fire they carry now.

This is what I'd do:  \\- have clear expectations (do you expect to get familiar with basic ml, train models, use pretrained models, use them to build apps/ websites, or do you expect to implement things like `torch.nn.Conv2d` from scratch and replicate results from papers)  \\- make a list of every institute in the valley offering AI/ML courses, including NAAMII, compare their pros-cons  \\- learn Python and basic libraries (numpy pandas) *before* joining the AI/ ML thing. I believe they'd cover everything from linear algebra to pytorch, so you'll be overwhelmed if you don't have a vague idea about the concepts  \\- find somebody to teach you if possible. For 25k, this might be hard, but if you could find somebody who can actually teach you the concepts, that'd be ideal  \\- think of a unique portfolio and hiring companies early  Depends on your goals, but I think you'd be better off learning Python for that. Implementing things is the pretty much the same. Python is just more accessible.   Edit: And you won't learn much if you expect them to feed it to you.

            "body": "My family lives in a rural areas while I live away from family. The issue is we are not able to get a direct ISP line as per now due to few reasons. My neighbor and I agreed to share his internet.  My house is about 80m away. Plan is:  Run a cable from his router to my house.  Set up a secondary router for Wi-Fi in my home.  Questions:  1. Will the cable connection handle over 80-100m without issues? 2. Anything special I should consider, maybe need a booster or something ? 3. Also, the person who is ready to install the connection is asking for 5000 rupees (including the router + cable + logistics). Will it be cheaper if I buy the router and the cable and ask him to just configure and I just pay him for his work ?  Thank you in advance :)  EDIT : Although the plan is to make a direct connection to my home. But the issue is that the ISP that has made connection in my village houses says that they provide connection to 8 houses per box from the main line. So he says no slot is available in any of the boxes and it would be expensive for them to install a new box just for 1 house as most of the houses has made the connection already.   So his suggestion was to partner with the chimeki ko ghar and get a secondary lan connection. But I still would want if there could be a direct connection at my home because that would reduce the hassle I might face in future with the neighbor/      Any kind of leads would be helpful !",

There’s one primary router, and I shared the connection with two secondary routers.   What I did was bring a cable along with a second-hand Mi router and set it up myself.   The total cost was 2500 for 20 m of wire and the second-hand router.   I’d also suggest you do the same—buy the equipment yourself and configure it on your own.   Don’t forget to add an RJ45 jack to the cable.

You must get copper wire inside not the cheaper copper coated one. There's difference. Usually the cables that are used by IP camera installation people are of the better quality (I found from experience).   The clamping of RJ45 cable at the terminal is very important and needs to be done with precision. (I learned from experiemce, I clamp my RJ45 myself in many places or double check when done by others. Even RJ45 connectors with goldplated terminals are of different quality in the market. You should get good quality goods. Get pro help in this. 80-100km shouldn't drop connection speed so much as I assume you.  Secondary router: Something like Tplink Archer C6 is good one. We run these 24/7 at hour home, not the best but has been reliable for over 2 years now.   I fear if the primary router where your LAN cable is connected, whether its LAN  port is Gigabit port or max 100mbps. Either case should work though giving different speed outputs. Another concern is whether the current/power provided by this router is sufficient enough for the transmission. If that is not sending better signal, then you have to add a network swich after primary router, either immediately or at a distance ~ around halfway to your home. But its just a fear and I assume it works upto 100m fine.  Get the connection guy to do the work, dont hesitate to pay, but ask for professional service and they must agree to troubleshoot if problem arises.

So all her friends who worked with her who called her out were true. Engineering ma naam na niskeko ani Architecture ma 3rd list ma naam niskeko. Her Pulchowk project being paid and done by someone else, asking for help from classmates here and at Harvard, not a single thing was done be her and having the audacity to take credit for other’s teamwork.   Topper hoina one semester ko project ma aru ko kaam present garera winner bhaeko ho. Always knew she is faking being an intellectual but this is diabolical. Everyone needs to watch this! She emphasized she is a topper at Miss Nepal or Miss World platform. Unbelievably embarrassing!  Her entire family sees nothing wrong with recalculating every exam. Harek exam ma kasari fail huncha ani recalculate garauda high scores? No wonder, she inherited the fraudulent tactics. Nothing is ever her fault, always someone else’s.

If normal kids pull off this kind of shit, our parents would have been the first ones to straighten us out.  This needs to go viral for accountability. Her words and actions don’t match at all and she is playing with people’s future since she was young. Imagine the people who actually deserved the seat but were denied because of her. This is so unfair and worry some!  Thought she is a hypocrite, pretentious, self obsessed and narcissistic parasite but this is next level of fraud.|||Oiiiiiiiii!!! This is a legit proof now.

She really is not as intellectually gifted as she portrays herself to be. She seems to surrounds herself with people who are actually intelligent (and hence pass off their work as her own) and her family is well connected and powerful enough to give her things she could never earn by merit. OR 2. Her family is CORRUPT enough for certain people to have a personal vendetta against her and deliberately tried to ensure her results are tempered with. Eventually her family had to do some private investigations and ensure her career is not impacted by such dirty political games...which just proves her family is corrupt and had immense political influence.

Despite public outrage and repeated promises, there has been no accountability, no closure, and no identified perpetrator. We cannot allow this case to be forgotten or buried in the past. Every life matters, and no one especially a child deserves to suffer such unimaginable violence. It is deeply troubling that systemic negligence, mishandled evidence, and lack of urgency have left this case unresolved. We must stand together and demand a transparent, thorough investigation. We must hold institutions accountable and ensure that no other family is forced to endure the same pain and silence.  Let us honor Nirmala’s memory not with silence, but with action. She deserves justice. Her family deserves peace. And our society deserves the truth.",

Villagers depended on landlords for loans, justice, and protection, which kept exploitation unchallenged (Kamaiya, Haruwa-Charuwa, Haliya systems).

Every politicians are coming back like it was never happened ani haami ? Haami pani kei na kei !!|||What happened to the Deuba family wasn’t just unfair—it was an orchestrated humiliation carried out in the most cowardly way possible. Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not “revolution,” it’s not “justice,” and it sure as hell isn’t “the voice of the people.” It’s mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn’t make you brave—it makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that—surrounded by a wave of so-called “youths” who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let’s not sugarcoat it—the so-called Gen Z “warriors” hiding in the mob weren’t heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country’s social fabric. He still can’t step foot in certain countries because he’s internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he’s propped up as a “leader.”  Let’s be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn’t an accident—it was a setup. While Deuba’s family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don’t get it twisted—those sharpshooters in the crowd weren’t just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres—former insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let’s stop pretending this was “the people rising up.” It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist—the one who drowned this nation in blood—walks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don’t for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn’t that Deuba suffered humiliation—the real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn’t a flower; he’s a weed choking the soil of Nepal’s democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too naïve to realize they’re being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||Prachanda and Baburam are India's puppet. Baburam was trained in India's JNU which wiped out more than 10% of our population while Madhessi bihari and Marwadi have exponentially grown. At this rate, in next 5-8 years, we will lose our country. Wake up.|||That ship has sailed.  He was the voice for the poor, women, indigenous communities, and minorities.",

At the end of the day, the bigger issue here isn’t her—it’s the massive misuse of taxpayers’ money by politicians who were supposed to develop the country but used it for their own gain.

The problem is we put celebrities on a pedestal, expecting them to be flawless, when they’re just people who can make mistakes.

            "body": "The country is burning, and Shrinkhala uploaded a 34 minute PR reel. I just finished watching 11 minutes of the 34 long video Shrinkhala Khatiwada uploaded to “explain her silence” and I had to stop, not because I was bored, but because it was painful to watch someone so out of touch, so self-absorbed, and so deep into their own victim complex that they’ve become completely blind to reality. I’m making this post and hoping people don’t fall for the carefully packaged sob story. First off is the immediate red flag that there is zero acknowledgment of her privilege. She talks about having a simple life, and claims her parents worked hard for her and her brother. That they had a house with 3 bedrooms, didn’t have to pay rent, had a good upbringing and she still thinks that counts as simple. And that’s the only privilege she’s ever had. That alone shows how detached she is from what “average” really means in Nepal. She never even briefly reflects on the fact that her father is a powerful politician, and instead, she makes it sound like she built her life from scratch. It’s baffling.  She genuinely believes her name shouldn’t have been dragged into any of the national discourse and says that people were using her name just to get content and she literally says something along the lines of, if people got attention that way, “so be it.” That’s her takeaway. The entire nation is in shambles, people are angry, protesting, waking up to decades of injustice and she still can't look beyond her own image. It's almost unbelievable how someone can watch a country crumble and somehow make it all about themselves. She positions herself as the one being targeted “for no reason” and says she wanted to fight back but was too overwhelmed by people turning against her. Again, not a word about why people might be justifiably critical, just a one-sided narrative of being attacked unfairly.  She says TikTok posts were changing the narrative of her entire life. But does she stop for a second to reflect on why people are questioning her? No. Instead, she keeps doubling down on this idea that she’s misunderstood, and that her critics are just trying to take her down for no reason. There is no realization that being the daughter of a well-known and allegedly corrupt politician is a reason why people hold you accountable especially when you’ve benefitted from that influence. That’s not defamation. That’s public scrutiny. Then comes the part where she calls herself “self-made.” And at that point, I had to pause and ask how? You’re born into a powerful and connected family. You have access to platforms, resources, and networks that most Nepalis can’t even dream of. And yet here you are, trying to claim some underdog story? She goes on to brag about her accomplishments, how she’s made so much money, and how people apparently can’t handle the fact that someone as young as her is so successful. As if that’s why people are questioning her. No, Shrinkhala, people aren’t criticizing you because you’re young and successful. They’re angry because you’re trying to rewrite your origin story while skipping over the very privileges that made your success possible.  She even says she never felt the need to justify herself to anyone before because “satya ko saath cha.” That’s when I realized how deep her delusion runs. She genuinely believes she’s standing on moral high ground, and yet her video is filled with nothing but self-praise, image management, and emotional manipulation. She talks about being “satya” while ignoring every contradiction, every unfulfilled promise, and every instance where she stayed silent when it mattered. Then she says if she doesn’t defend herself, then “the rest of the world will write her narrative.” Again, it’s about her. Not the truth, not justice, not accountability, not the people, but her narrative. The country is collapsing under the weight of corruption, and her priority is that her public image might be misunderstood. She even says her future generations will suffer if she doesn’t clear her image like that’s the greatest injustice here. Not the looted resources, not the betrayed citizens, but her family name. She thanks those who “didn’t unfollow her” and those who supported her privately. That’s her criteria for support which is social media metrics. Then she starts talking about her life story, narrates her autobiography, and once again, takes the opportunity to list her accomplishments and how she was a topper, won design competitions, etc. But does she ever stop to think about why she got those platforms? Does she reflect on how being a politician’s daughter might have given her access others don’t have? Of course not. Instead, she paints herself as someone with a “small-town mindset” while talking about winning designer competitions. How many small-town Nepalis get to do that? There’s such a massive contradiction in her story, and she doesn’t even seem to see it.  She even says “ma maa nai kei kami thiyo hola” and tries to sound reflective, but it’s just another way to victimize herself. As if people criticizing her now are just reinforcing her lifelong feeling of being “not enough.” Then she addresses people who accuse her of not following through on the promises and ideals she expressed during Miss Nepal. And honestly, that criticism is completely valid. If you stood on a national stage making tall claims about development and change, then yes, people will hold you accountable. That’s not trolling. That’s responsibility. And finally, the most absurd part that she says she never had any power. How? You were Miss Nepal and are one of the most followed influencers in the country, daughter of a powerful political figure, a Harvard graduate. And you don’t have power? Then who does? If you truly believe you never had any power to make a difference, then what was the point of all the public positioning, speeches, and social impact projects? That’s not humility. That’s denial.  She tries to play down her travel experiences too. Says that before Miss Nepal, she had only been to India, and that’s “not an achievement,” and that her Hong Kong trip immediately after the pageant was the only international travel till then. Then she brings up her UK trip, saying it was funded by youth, and she didn’t really get to enjoy it because she was only there for work, so apparently, that doesn’t count as privilege either. Every step of the way, she undermines and downplays her privilege, refuses to acknowledge her advantages, and continues to position herself as a victim. And all of this? Is just the first 11 minutes. I honestly couldn’t keep watching. It became clear very quickly that this wasn’t a sincere explanation. It was a 34 minute long PR video just to clear her image, filled with narcissistic reflections, gaslighting, and image control disguised as vulnerability. I really hope people don’t fall for victimized narrative. Please don’t.",

We handed her those privileges because we thought she’d actually speak for us. Instead, she hides behind her husband and drops a manipulative video like nothing happened.

The lack of self-reflection and the constant logical fallacies, positioning anyone who challenges her as lacking critical thinking, etc, is not lost on us.

Instead, we should focus on average Joes who have done greater good. Like cleaning garbage on the street or starting a free tuition for street children. We should make heroes of those ordinary people. We should also start questioning our perception of beauty. Why is Shrinkhala Khadka considered *anything*? Is she physically appealing or sexually affable or glamorous? Why should she have *any* followers, to begin with? Then we should start questioning the perception of our 'beauty standard'. Why should only fair skinned, better looking people get millions of followers. It's not going to be easy but we should always question. If we play the same pop culture game and dig deep into how propaganda and algo can be manipulated then we can perhaps start asking questions like the way you have did.   It's not easy because it's a biased platform where heritage money and incumbent power are in bed with the forces of propaganda (e.g. Insta algorithm). Its a hard battle to win.

Look at the videos from Pashupatinath the eyes of the parents and the pain you can see. Like how the fuck did you make this whole movement about yourself! Pathetic and Diabolical..|||I couldn’t bring myself to sit through the PR stunt. Whilst I will say, maybe she did make that $$ from her influencer career (if she did I am impressed they pay that much $$), what baffles me is, what is with defending your corrupt father? Like if you can’t question him, have benefitted from his position etc, at least maybe acknowledge that-even mere silence will do. But no, turning everything into an attack on herself is so grand, so her (or how she has conducted and presented herself on every platform thus far). She has everything it takes to be a politician- narcissistic, conniving, manipulation and when all of that fails self-victimization. Yeah, no one is discrediting her book smarts, the fact that she won a beauty contest, she went to Harvard. What gets me is the absolute inability to recognize the privileges she had and still has (anyone whose parents could afford to send them to private schools in Nepal and eventually college are already above the average folks in Nepal). Maybe in her mind privilege equates to being Bill Gates’ daughter- but someone needs to preach to her that privilege is not a blanket concept, the level varies- which I take she is not aware of or doesn’t want to acknowledge. And even with that evidence and what not, I noticed there was a lot of cherry picking. She spent maybe hours putting her excel sheets together and making those videos, but it was an absolute shame to see how tone deaf her response was. This whole movement was for a bigger cause, a cause bigger than the likes of her, what people did was simply point out the discrepancies, the widening gap, and people like her were case in point; however it seems like that went over her head (understandable when all you have done or known is me, myself, and I, it’s hard to fathom that there are real people who are struggling to make ends meet). She came across as an oblivious, self-absorbed person, who when can’t win a debate with evidence will switch to victimizing herself and victim blaming and shaming (sounds a lot like a certain suntala manche who’s running a place).  Overall, is she the only one who has benefitted from corruption in Nepal? No. But I’d have much preferred if she’d kept her mouth shut and gone to Dubai- where I hear Sirohiyas have bought properties in case shit hits the fan in Nepal (A+ for planning and I guess deep down they know what they do/ have done).  Regardless, my worry is this is the next generation of people, and if common Nepalis cannot see through the lies and manipulation and fall for this trickery again, then all those lives lost, infrastructure destroyed would be for nothing. It would be Jana andolan 2.0.  Outside of Shrinkhala there are plenty of ghusiya sarkari karmachari ko kids who have amassed a fortune and generally expect to inherit at least 2-3 million USD (unfortunately includes my own friends and family). And we are talking about normal Nepali sarkari officers’ kids- they fly under the radar, but they are very real. Guess that’s the difference, these guys probably would have gone unnoticed had they kept their businesses out of social media, but SK is something else, seems she likes to double down, she likes the drama, the tea, and she will do anything to stay relevant. Going on a tangent here, but most of us would not have known about just how much money the Deuba’s have, had it not been for Deuba’s DIL and her sister posting all those trips, pictures, and what not.  I think we as a collective just need to stop with putting these people on a pedestal and rallying around them. It’s a waste of our brain power, time, potential. There is nothing productive or beneficial for general public that has come from these people, some of the blame lies on us as consumers of their content.   P.S. she’s probably salty she no longer gets to be the first lady PM of Nepal.|||Request to OP: I have not watched the Excel Kanda at all and i don't plan to. But I would watch or hear your complete breakdown of the whole video even if its 1 hour longer.   Great breakdown. My reasoning to not watch her sob story is the same as yours (at least i believe its similar). I find it repulsive because it seems to have zero validity to the pedestal she was on. From some brief clips, she went to Harvard? How is that simple, humble or average? Internship of her own studies in Spain?? Good for her. Impressive. But addressing all the accomplishments on what is supposed to be her response? I dont get it.|||I watched the video too and disagree. Whatever she is, she is not a criminal. There are way worse people than her in Nepal. In my view, arson who damaged the private and public properties are way worse than her and legally criminals. Similarly, there are better faces of nepo babies - the OG nepo baby, the ex-king.  I am saddened that there is no empathy. Literally, her house was burned down by an angry mob. Have some empathy.  Nepal has systematic corruption at every level. Everyone has either given or taken bribes.  There are minimal financial opportunities within Nepal. It makes financially more sense for an honest person to seek employment abroad. By destroying businesses and targeting the elites, the country will witness even less investment. It needs money to create investments for more jobs. Ironic thing was people who protested showed their own corruption by looting private companies - which again legally is a crime.   If I can have empathy for arsons and thieves who destroyed and looted public and private properties, have some empathy for another Nepali who was threatened and attacked viciously online just for being more successful than most people.|||If you guys really think she got what she deserved - having her old parents house. And her husband’s business burned. And her image destroyed like this.  If you think this is justice you guys are cruel as f.

She did not even supported this movement. Hur husband is pathetic moron and liar and so as his their media Kantipur.|||Who tf is that devika girl😆|||Rabi Lamichhane and shrinkhala are so well aware and knows how to  manipulate people. |||Couldn’t have put it better myself. You took the words out of my mouth. Watching few mins of the video made me realise how out of touch, self- victimised and narcissism runs so deep. Not once did she mention about the victims and what the families of the martyrs had to go through, it was all her image. She even said “only her life has stopped” - can’t even begin to fathom how these words could come of out of her mouth whilst the victims bodies and their family are mourning/ going through right now.|||Don't take it personally. Reflect within yourself. Remember change starts from within. Dont except \"them\" to change but ensure they are not in charge or power to influence as well. Thousands of youth have vowed to change themselves to change the system. If only 5% of you succeed the country will have a good future. Let's invest on our own positive changes. Access to good education is very very important for people in rural area. A big transformation is needed in education sector. |||100k people have already fallen for her victim card game.

You have a very good skill set.|||dfdfd|||dfdfdfgfgfg|||Need a TL;DR version of this too|||Why are people so jealous about her success?|||If it isn't a girl crying and saying she didn't mean to do/support a crime and everyone in her comments going \"yess, more power to you dijju 😘\"|||Disagreed . She won many competitions in school , always an A student , won beauty pageant because she deserved it . Not because she was some politicians daughter. The majority of the people didn’t even know who her father is . It’s easy to blame her , easy to hate her now , but that’s the sad part of brainwashed social media freaks who are on their phones 24-7 . Her point was that she never lived a luxurious life until she was Miss Nepal , because that’s the truth . Weren’t people blaming her for living off tax payers money ? That’s why she is defending it with proof . When the whole nation attacks you , questions your integrity it’s natural to be defensive . I’m not against you or her , I am just saying she is not going to say 100% of what you all wanna hear . She is human , she gave her reason as to the reason why didn’t speak up as she was targeted with so much hate and rape threats. And the privilege you’re talking about , would have probably agreed with you if you were talking about Jayvir guy.  But why aren’t people targeting him as well . Most of the nepokids or so called elite people don’t even know a world outside of Kathmandu , can’t speak fluent Nepali . People connected with Shrinkhala from the beginning because she spoke like one of us , was grounded . And this whole point of not acknowledging her privilege . What part of privilege she used to win Miss Nepal ? Anybody can participate in the pageant - regardless of who your parents are . It’s easy to pinpoint others, especially a public figure , especially a woman public figure , and you know it’s so easy to spread negativity. And at this time when the whole comment section is flown with negative comments about her , you expect her to say all the Right words , sentences - who are you all ? Can you all focus on how better you can be as human beings instead of being so wild in this game ? Haven’t you never made a mistake in your life ? What good are you getting in being so critical of another public figure and expecting her to say all the right things that belongs to your narrative. Nobody is perfect . Time will always reveal the truth . Stop spreading negative. If people wanna like her support her , let them . If you don’t , just stop spreading hate - it only drains you man |||I don't quite know what Gen Z's problem is with Shrinkhala.. we ourselves loved her, we voted for her, we spent our money to send her to international platforms, we cheered for her success. And then she did succeed. She made millions as a result through brands, sponsorships, youtube, etc. If anything she is a smart business woman who capitalized her fame into actual money. Then she got married to the son of Kantipur. She goes on expensive foreign trips with him. She is the daughter-in-law of the most influential media company.  What is really our problem with her? What do we want from her? Are we jealous she became rich and famous? Are we mad at her because both her parents are CPN UML politicians? Are we mad at her for marrying with a rich guy? Are we mad at her because she carried around an expensive label bag? Are we mad at her because she did not single handedly end corruption like she said she wanted to 10 years back in a fucking beauty pageant? What do you want Shrinkhala to tell the world? Yes she is privileged? Yes she married into a well-off family? Yes she went to Harvard?   What is it really? We need to be really clear about these conversations first before dragging someone down.",

People with allegations just got a clean slate because of this.|||If there was no conspiracy then Nepalis have the lowest IQ in the world. We have erased decades of our progress.|||When these events are designed by big brothers, only the big brothers know the full game. The actors like Hamro Nepal, GenZ kids and arsonists played their part well but they only knew their own.   The way the actors are propped up, encouraged or bribed are also varied and indirect. And past the event they start running campaigns to create conspiracy theories themselves so that the real story becomes one of the conspiracy theories, Not the only one.|||\"OR\" peoples were binded in rage. But moreover, It was romanticized to burn parliament (Seeing the Indonesia and Bangladesh, people wanted to vandalize the parliament on first day). AI images and videos of burned parliament were kind of trending before. \"It's our money we have every right to torch it\" kind of logic.   Also lowest IQ, Tyapee behavior. Did you see any socials like RONB or any requesting not to burn any Important building? They were just updating shits were on fire one after another. At the end they tried to warn not to burn singha durbar but it was too late.|||I am not sure if conspiracy is the right word, but there are many question marks during the protests. For instance, people said that some organized bands/crime was taking place respectively were active; this seems to make sense if we look at what happened (beating people, setting things on fire after taking TV monitors etc...). Then there is the issue of the military shooting eagerly at people who were no threat at all - a good example is the video of a car where people walked to that car, assuming the cops could help them, and then suddenly someone from inside the car shooting one guy dead, then driving off. That is very strange - why did they kill someone there? And who were the killers? There are other videos showing strange things. Then there was pillaging and theft - some may have been from individuals who just seized an opportunity, but there are still question marks about that; most genuine protesters don't have as an objective to steal stuff. This all has to be investigated - unfortunately I do not trust any official from Nepal to make a genuine investigation here. It needs external people who are not involved on either side, perhaps investigators from Brazil, Switzerland and Canada; these should be impartial enough.  With 71 people dead, this can not be explained via \"all accidents\". Deliberate killings took place here; people were responsible for those deaths.|||Durga Prasai is involved along with RaPraPa for Singa Durbar.|||tesma ta sankai chaina ni dr saab,   months aghi dekhi nai k k slogan rakhne, social media ma kasari organize/execution garne, ko ko neta lai attack garne, kun kun city ko kun office ma important documents cha, kasari access garera jalaune sab planned bhako ho   aba tauke neta ko musical chair hateko jas line le mareko manche ra jaleko sabai nepal ko sampada ko ni jas linu parena?   400-500 yrs ko nepal ko administrative history bhako singhadurbar, griha mantralaya, adalat haru major cities ko malpot ra administrative office haru ma aago lagako cha, consciously targetting the documents lutne bhanda pani  so clearly a well executed plan ho, aba arko 4-5 years ethnic religious regional open war hune wala cha, i can see that clearly, also aile kocorrupt party haru ni arko front kholera aune cha for counter revolution  its gonna get bloody messy and take nation arko 20 years back, brace yourself|||Slightly disappointed with \"anusandhan garinu parne cha\", and not \"anusandhan ma garchu\".|||hi|||As she said, Yesto important buildings haru jalaune desh drohi haru hun.

And from what I have seen very recently, he has stopped seeking suggestions from GenZ crowds.   So everything that he has been doing at this point forward, is solely on his own discretion. Maybe he will try to cite his behaviour as something that is approved by a mass, but clearly it isn’t.   He got to be the face of GenZ because there was no one who wanted to come forward. And at this point of time, I can clearly anticipate that all of fellows from the groups will feel as if they are in the wrong boat right now.   He clearly was never meant to lead any population.|||Khutta dhog na ajai!|||Sudan is not a politician, not a leader. He is a Volunteer and an Activist. A very honest, hardworking, Volunteer/Activist, but not a leader.   He headed the negotiations and got us the interim PM when the country most needed it. We are all very thankful for that.   We should all now ask him to put down the arms and let the PM work.|||Listen to his clarification here. https://youtu.be/GLEFw2N2xAc?si=CRVf8LKpDFmb4clW|||He is a CIA stooge. How come you guys haven't realized yet. How can an NGO guy just go and threaten to take down government twice and threaten Former Supreme Court Judge and first Female PM of Nepal with no fear? He thinks country is his father's property. He will take down the government by his Discord jholey as many times  they don't worship and accept his demand.He wants full veto on how the country works.    What gave him such audacity and confidence? It's definitely CIA and Rajabadi pushing him and supporting him. No common man can do this. |||Kaha vanyo ? Any source.|||Agree!|||I think it is now time for him to reflect on what has happened, the difficult role he played in this fiasco and take a break for himself , for his mental health and for the sake of the leadership which he and his team “scrambled” at the last hour. People can disagree with his role but it is undeniably true that he became a face of representation of the “Gen Z” (aba sabai gen z le choose gare or not is a different debate) at a time when army was constantly asking for us to be unified and bring forth a representative at such a volatile situation. Thankfully the situation solved. But after the negotiations with The President and the subsequent outcomes of the negotiations, he should have taken a back seat and let the person intended to run the position do their work( at the end of the day, us “Gen Z” haru le nai choose garya hola ni ta Sushila Shreeman lai?) And I don’t get his afu chai cabinet ma na basne tara aile aba afu bina ko cabinet ma k hunxa sabai kura afu bata jawos bhanne expectations rakheko dekhda chai I felt he was either arrogant or naive when it comes to governance and how power plays when it comes to running a literal government. I think it would be best for him and his team to take a rest and REFLECT and let the experts do their thing( aba haina bhsne ki ta afai cabinet ma basnu thik hola)   Regarding the family’s demands, I won’t be so quick to comment on it as it as very sensitive issue for them and I don’t think this interim govt  would be so unkind to the families like the past (party kongovts would be). It’s only been  2 days that the govt has been in place, I think his maturity would be reflected if he supports the govt in finalizing the cabinet first and letting the administration come to its daily routine. And then u can always raise the family’s issue. We got to prioritize the country’s wellbeing before anything( sounds very insensitive and heartless but that’s the reality)   At the end of the day, desh sabai kai ho, gen z, gen x, millennials, boomers what not. Even the parties cannot be excluded in the long run. That is our democracy’s reality. I think it would be in everyone interest to think rationally and not emotionally. Because I don’t think govts around the world are run by emotions. Let’s hope we get the election and a safe landing from this situation.

They will come back and try to do everything possible to regain their power.   Instead of being discouraged by their appearance we can get ourselves involved in more and more constructive dialogue and create a scenario where they will not be back again from the next election. Engage in political debate. Spread words. More intellectual discuss will help create a \"vibe\" when they will find hard to regain power. We can never demand so and so person or party should not participate in election or use their constitutional rights. So them trying to resurface and whitewash their image is normal.

Let's continue this discourse and may be, just may be, we can tip the society as a whole towards a future without the \"musical chair\".

America is still fighting to establish a democracy almost 250 years after it started.  Come election time, find and support candidates that reflect the GenZ values.

Yet, even after all this time, I still carry deep respect and pride for the land I came from. But watching this horrific video of a mob savagely beating an elderly man and his wife left me utterly speechless. Regardless of what the couple may have been involved in or accused of, nothing justifies such cruelty.  I thought Nepali men were the descendants of the brave Gurkhas—warriors respected and admired worldwide for their courage and honor. Instead, I saw a man sucker punch a woman who wasn’t even facing him. That wasn’t bravery—it was pure cowardice. And the chaos that followed—hundreds of people raiding and looting their home under the excuse of “justice”—wasn’t justice at all. That mob was just as corrupt and criminally responsible as the very people they claimed to oppose. They were not upholding the law; they were exploiting the breakdown of law and order to terrorize and humiliate helpless individuals.  But this rot doesn’t stop with the mob. The government, too, is guilty. Innocent children were killed during the protests, yet there has been no true accountability. Those in power—the Prime Minister, the Home Minister, and the security forces—bear responsibility for those heinous crimes. They were entrusted with protecting the people, but instead, they used their authority to spill the blood of innocents.  So when I look at this situation, I see two sides of the same coin: mobs acting as judge, jury, and executioner in the streets, and leaders hiding behind power while allowing or even enabling violence against their own citizens. Both are forms of terrorism, both have destroyed public trust, and both have crippled the very soul of Nepal.  And if this mob truly represents the next generation—if this is the standard of “justice” that today’s youth believe in—then Nepal’s future is not just uncertain, it is in grave danger. Because a society that celebrates cowardice, looting, and lawlessness, while a government escapes accountability for killing its own children, is a society heading toward doom.|||you guys wanted monarchy?????????",

We are currently reviewing and verifying the complaint. After that, only we will be able to take any further stance.\"A 31-year-old female cadre of the UML filed a FIR today at the District Police Range in Kathmandu through postal service, alleging that Mahesh Basnet raped her twice and forced her to have an abortion, killing a two and a half-month-old foetus.  She has also accused Basnet of killing 2 months and 15 days foetus. The victim has alleged that he killed the foetus twice by giving medicine and performing surgery. Basnet has been demanded to be prosecuted for the crime of foeticide as it is contrary to Section 188 of the National Penal Code (Act) 2017. She was forced to have an abortion twice, with the help of medicine and surgery, according to the complaint.  \"The victim has also claimed that her apartment was robbed on the morning of 20 February 2024, on Basnet's instructions to destroy evidence of rape and infanticide. According to her complaint, \"On the instructions of Basnet, two youths entered my apartment, beat me up, and forcibly took away my mobile and other electronic devices.\"",

Public Interest Litigation (PIL)  Nepal’s legal system does allow concerned citizens or groups to file a PIL when there’s gross negligence, unaccountability, or violation of fundamental rights.  In theory, you could file a case demanding transparency and timely investigation in high-profile cases like this.  Realistically, PILs in Nepal often face delays and political interference, but they force the police/courts to respond formally.     2. Human Rights Complaint  You can approach National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) of Nepal and file a complaint about police inaction, delays, or suppression of evidence.  NHRC can investigate systemic failure, pressure authorities, and issue recommendations, which can be made public.  Again, the NHRC doesn’t guarantee immediate action, but it’s a formal legal way to hold institutions accountable.     3. Legal Notice to Police  A lawyer can send a legal notice to the police demanding they proceed with investigation within a reasonable timeframe.  This doesn’t guarantee action, but it creates a paper trail showing authorities were warned — useful if things get dragged indefinitely.     4. Limitations  You cannot prosecute Basnet yourself unless you’re the victim or have legal standing.  You also cannot compel politicians to speak; you can only force accountability through judicial pressure on authorities.     - Public Pressure & Awareness  Social media campaigns, petitions, or advocacy groups can pressure authorities to act transparently.  But this comes with risk, because political figures in Nepal can retaliate; tread carefully.|||1 number ko gunda manche yo. Dhamkauni, dada giri garni bahek aru kei gardaina.

RaSwoPa is also a cultist party centered around one person.  Now when Balen launches a party it will be the same. I don't know what people are expecting about what comes next..most of the people demanding directly elected PM doesn't even understand the status quo and political landscape and potential direction a directly elected PM can take one day.  They don't even understand what does dissolvement of parliament means and they are unaware that we still have the constitution and directly elected PM election is not possible. So it will be parliament election (if election happen)  That's why I'm saying that the protest was a total mess (no agenda, no leader, no purpose, no political awareness).  The dissolving of parliament was nowhere in the demand..it was pushed by Balen who had no participation in the protest (his own word). The unconstitutional dissolvement of parliament has set a dangerous message. The new election will bring back the same old political parties along with new ones. No one will get majority. We go back into the same system with dangerous political precedence and a much worse economy. People have now realized how easy it is to create chaos and anarchy in Nepal.

Since Class 12, I’ve been financially independent. I invested in NEPSE, paid for my own bachelor’s admission, and worked full-time (40 hrs/week) while balancing a day college schedule. It was tough, but manageable. Whenever I felt burned out, I’d take a break and go trekking or visit lakes with friends.

Moral: Buddhi palauna time lagcha.|||Simple answer for you it is not same for every one.|||This kind of post rubs me the wrong way a bit because it feels like you’re trying to position yourself as “smarter” or “better” than the people who went abroad. The reality is that both paths, either staying in Nepal or going abroad, have their own pros and cons, and people choose based on circumstances that are often very different from yours.  You mention being financially independent, investing early, and balancing work with studies. That’s impressive, but it’s also a privilege many don’t have. Plenty of sons and daughters in Nepal are grinding just to pay off family debts or keep their households afloat. For them, going abroad isn’t about “hype” but it’s about survival, opportunity, or helping their families. Even the ability to invest in NEPSE in the first place points to a cleaner starting slate than what a lot of others face.  And while you thrived staying in Nepal, not everyone has that option. Families who send their kids abroad are often taking huge risks and sacrifices, sometimes from already fragile financial situations. Even if someone goes abroad and struggles at first, starting from zero (or even from debt) can eventually set them up for long-term security that wouldn’t be possible back home.  So yes, it’s great that you’re making it work in Nepal, but framing it in a way that hints at looking down on people who go abroad ignores the complexity of their decisions and struggles.|||You are lucky, I suppose. I didn't want to leave too but had a lots of failure and lacking economic support lead ultimately to go out. I miss my country more than anything. I wish you all the best.  Going abroad was definitely worth it for me. Specially during covid, I could atleast support economically. We literally were able to save my FIL by pushing money to the hospital. Few lakhs is not a big problem for me so I always have that assurance that I can take care of my family if needed. I am also less worried about kids, as they will have better opportunity for everything. Government supports health and education, and only fooding and clothing them is what I have to worry about. They also have opportunity to grow in a better society free from caste and religion based nonsense so they can actually focus on things that matter. Its much easier for them to travel anywhere in the world because the passport is much stronger. So overall I can take care of my parents and give a better start to my kids, which makes me content.

I’d seen a Reddit post where someone shared how they had offered food and water to police officers, had a nice conversation with them, and how thankful the officers were. That person even encouraged others to do the same. Inspired by that, I thought I should try too. Since I wasn’t sure if there were rules about them accepting food, I asked on Reddit first. People told me that officers usually don’t accept unpackaged food, but they do accept packaged items. So, I bought two packets of biscuits, one carton of noodles, and a case of bottled water. The next morning, I gathered the courage to head out on my scooter, even though I was anxious and alone. I drove around and saw a group of police working from New Baneshwor to the Parliament area. I stopped and asked them if they would like some water or food. They refused, saying they were headed to Parliament. Still, I went over to the Parliament gate, where more police were stationed. I offered them water and biscuits. One of them laughed and said, “Who drinks water in this cold weather?” Another officer, who I think felt bad, quietly accepted a couple of bottles. Then one of them started warning about people making everything go viral online, while a girl behind me was clicking pictures, i didn't know her. The police scolded her, saying, “Don’t take pictures, you people already burnt down the Parliament.” In that moment, I wanted to snap back say, “Why are you guarding the Parliament when you’ve already killed so many citizens?” But I swallowed it down because I wasn’t there to argue, I was there to help. They laughed off the biscuits and noodles, saying they didn’t need anything. I was left standing there, embarrassed and humiliated. I ended up leaving the case of water bottles in the park and taking the rest back home. My mom had already warned me that they probably wouldn’t accept my help. She was right. But standing there with my offer turned down, I felt so small. Honestly, I don’t think I’ve ever felt that humiliated in my life. Maybe I’m overreacting, but all I wanted was to help and instead, it just left me feeling pathetic.",

This narrative that communism brings misery to all and maybe inequality is the 'natural' way of things. While I don't support yemale, maobadi -- they are as neoliberal or more than congress-- using this to attack on the communism as ideology is also unfair. Just like you can not judge Gen Z for some hijacking their protest, you can also not judge communism because imperialist forces are also hijacking any attempt of a communist state. There are also several nuances -- of course USSR - say a *proper* implementation gave rise to famine (holodomar) and a lot of bloodshed, it also improved the lives of regular peasants. I was reading the accounts of the family who moved from absolute shanks to one bedroom apartments. Plus, there can be a lot of concessions and modifications -  like China for example moved it's modality to state sponsored capitalism -- of course it's a surveillance state and state is overarching (one child policy) but the improvement in standard of living and progress in society (healthcare and education) is out there. And also to blame famine and bloodshed in communism is also seeing reality with only one tainted lenses -- potato famine in Ireland, Churchill's starvation of Bengalis).

I wonder why..... They embraced neoliberalism which is inherently anti communist and brings misfortune. They are not interested in worker empowerment. The choice of taking the path of socialism vs capitalism is like not choosing brands of chocolate, but it's like a choice between monarchy and modernity. They are not on the same plane. Capitalism was revolutionary compared to feudalism at the time, but everyone's material conditions around the world today are deteriorating real fast because of profit > people and many are coming to the same conclusion either by learning or economic desperation. This is why fascism is on the rise to \"bring back order\" to a failed system riddled with core contradictions that cannot be reconciled.   Freedom under capitalism is freedom for capital owners, it doesn't work if everyone has a basic level of economic security by virtue of access to means of production.   I also know capitalist bad actors preemptively try to delegitimize and mock the idea. They did the same with slavery, and with monarchies, and now with capitalism. In reality, the path is clear, you just have to keep learning, keep organizing and keep pushing through.|||What an stupid framing? Nepal is truly blessed with low iq goodness.|||I'm a pro capitalist myself, but here's my take on why this is the case in Nepal (copied from another post of mine):  You see the problem with rich in the context of Nepal (and any underdeveloped nation) is that being filthy rich out of nowhere is almost always impossible. This is because in an underdeveloped economy, there isn't much consumer needs that you can solve which creates more value which makes you rich. The economy and society isn't sophisticated enough.  So, most of the rich people you see are mostly old money folks who were close to the monarchy, who got rich from the new political system, and that compounded with them owning land in the most important parts of the country.  Now, a select few being able to magically earn more (due to the land value appreciation) sitting idle while rest of the country has to work hard to earn some fraction of that is unfair, irrational, and unsustainable from a system design perspective.  This is contrary to what happens in a developed nation like America, where anyone can go and establish a billion dollar business by figuring out an emerging need and solving for it in the mesh of that sophisticated and good spending society.|||The earlier people in their 20s realize that communism doesn’t actually exist, the better. Many think calling themselves communist is cool, philosophical, and a stand for equality, but the truth is that communism has only ever lived in theories, never in real practice. Every so-called communist state eventually turned authoritarian or adapted to markets, and today the entire world has moved toward mixed economies—a balance of capitalism for growth and socialism for welfare. What sounds ideal in books is far from reality, and understanding this early saves a lot of misplaced idealism.|||The only true communist you speak of is china who has successfully implemented its concept( although there is still corruption they neutralise it instantly if found guilty unlike our country)Rest country who has adopted it has just formulated it in surface to show illusions in the eye of dumbass public like us in nepal.

Yes become rich i dont mind but if you buy crores of property even though you have just stepped into financial field itself is a red flag. Nobody can generate that much profit in mere 1- 2 years.

I'm against Communism - as I believe Socialism could be a potential solution.

Communist ideology looks good in theory but nature itself is capitalist, even ants collect their food before rain, and whoever will work hard will collect more.  The government's job should be only to create a level playing field (equal opportunity for all).

I commented that it was the Interim Constitution that allowed such provisions, but our 2072 Constitution clearly states that it’s not possible. I suggested that there might be other ways to achieve something similar. My friend, who happens to be blindly faithful toward RONB, texted me and lashed out: How can you say such things? How do you even have this kind of knowledge? Who taught you to talk like this? You don’t know shit, and you don’t know better than the editor of RONB.

And the most annoying part is that she unblocked me exactly on the day Sushila Karki became PM, just to share the RONB post with me, of course, and texted “bhedaa” along with some other shit—then blocked me again.

After that didn't work, due to the severity of the situation, then as the last measure \"Doctrine of necessity\" was used.  9. And, the president announced the interim government.  10. This is what happened, it's just a summary, there are several contexts and nuances plus there are several talks with law and constitution experts, ex Advocates and so on, and finally after one full day and another whole night of discussion, president made this call.  This is what happened.|||After revolution of 2046, 2062/63 same thing happened, 2063 pachi 1st constitution assembly collapsed, nothing happened.

            "body": "Hi everyone, I’m [Madan](https://x.com/MadanKhd).  I recently lived in a Hacker House in Dubai and it was an amazing experience for focused collaboration, learning, and launching projects. I’m curious if something similar could work in Kathmandu.  What is a Hacker House?  * A short-term shared space for builders: founders, devs, designers, students, creators. * Focused on collaboration, project sprints, workshops, and community events (typically 4–8 weeks).  Why Kathmandu?   There’s a growing tech and student scene here, and I think a hacker house could help bring people together to build and share knowledge.  Questions for you all:  1. Do you think Kathmandu would benefit from a hacker house? 2. What features would matter most (workspace, internet, events, mentorship, hardware lab, etc.)? 3. Have you seen/experienced something like this elsewhere?     👉 If enough people are curious, maybe we can even do a small meetup to discuss further.  Would love to hear your thoughts 🙏",

Using mainly just the 17% of the land (Terai) to feed the entire population is a problem in making.   Yes, I know we also farm in hills but it was an expression. Westerners use all that fancy technologies such as combines and auto-harvesters while majority of Nepalese hilly areas still rely on bulls and cows or not even those at all.   Could we make a small compact motor that a farmer dai can sling on his back and carry all the way up to a terrace, unload it and start farming and tilling the soil with it?   Could we make drones that will help spray fertilize the top hard to rich areas so the farmers don't have to go up and down the elevations constantly?   Another technology we desperately need is imo nationalizing 3D printers. I am very inspired by the Big Hero 6 movie where every household has a 3D printer and they can print their own solutions rather than having to go to the store constantly. Make community run 3D printers (like a library, a public property for an entire community) a common sight in Nepal rather than just a strange novelty technology.

But building a company quickly showed me a bigger picture. A founder isn’t just a coder you’re a communicator, a coordinator, a salesperson, a project manager. Investors, clients, and teammates don’t care only about elegant code; they care whether you can explain a product in clear English, align a team, and keep promises.  Here’s the mindset shift that hit me hard: \t•\tTechnical intelligence builds the product. You need the skills to create something real. \t•\tEmotional intelligence sells it. You need the skills to talk to customers, handle conflict, and inspire a team. \t•\tEffort multiplies both. No matter how smart you are, the person who keeps showing up and doing the hard, uncomfortable work will outpace you.  Whenever you avoid the call, the pitch, or the awkward conversation because it’s “not your thing,” that’s a signal your emotional intelligence needs reps just as much as your coding skills do.  If you want to build a great tech startup, you can’t pick one side. You need to build and you need to sell. Period.",

            "body": "I had to recently reinstall windows on multiple machines, and found myself writing a comprehensive guide. Fell free to add your tweaks ;)  .1. **Download UniGetUI** to inspect installed software and save to package useful ones (will be useful for reinstall)  2. **(Optional) Use Windows Disk Management** to create a new disk partition `D: Data`, move data there, so that it doesn't get cleaned.  3. **Download official Windows 11**, use Windows 11 Installation Media for USB - [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11)  4. **This step will auto select Windows 11 Pro version**. On the USB’s root, create a file sources\\\\ei.cfg (plain text). Put this content in it:      [EditionID]     Professional          [Channel]     Retail          [VL]     0  5. **When installing windows, it offers an option to select disk partition** where windows should be installed. Delete all paritions (except data disk in step 2), so that all space is unallocated. Select this unallocated partition as installation target.  6. **(Optional) If stuck on screen \"Oops, you' ve lost internet connection\".** On this screen or on country selection screen:  >Open cmd with Shift + F10 and type `OOBE\\BYPASSNRO.`  >Your computer will restart and now you will have the \"I don't have Internet\" option.  7. **After windows installation, permanently activate Windows 11 and Microsoft Office 365:(https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts)**  >a. Open PowerShell as administrator and enter: `irm` [`https://get.activated.win`](https://get.activated.win) `| iex`  >b. Select `[1] HWID` \\- for windows activation. Follow activation steps.  >c. Select `[2] Ohook` \\- for Office download and activation. Then Press `[3] Download Office` \\- and follow hearts on the website to download Office 365. After installation, press `[1] Install Ohook Office Activation`.  8. **Debloat Windows 11 and set optimal configurations: (https://github.com/Raphire/Win11Debloat)**  >a. Open PowerShell as administrator and enter: `& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm \"https://debloat.raphi.re/\")))`  >b. Select `(2) Custom mode` \\- press again `(2) Remove default` selection of bloatware apps, as well as mail & calendar apps, developer apps and gaming apps.  >c. Follow further steps onto your consideration. I click \"yes\" to 90% of proposed changes.  9. **Configure Windows Defender for optimal security:**  >a. Download `ConfigureDefender.exe` from [https://github.com/AndyFul/ConfigureDefender](https://github.com/AndyFul/ConfigureDefender)  >b. Launch ConfigureDefender and press `HIGH`.  >c. Close the app and you can now remove it.  10. **Install UniGetUI and reinstall all the apps**  11. **(Optional) Install some other cool apps:**  >a. Unchecky - when installing apps auto de-selects bloatware install options.  >b. Revo Uninstaller - when removing apps cleanups all residuals like registry keys and temp files.  >c. 7-Zip - file archiver  >d. VLC - media player (or more advanced: MPC-BE)  >e. qBittorrent - torrent client  >f. SumatraPDF - lightweight file reader  >g. Notepad++ - advanced text editor  >h. OBS - Desktop/Recording  EDIT:  Switched around uTorrent with qBittorent. Next time I will try using Rufus and ChrisTitusTech Win util for windows debloat 🙌",

            "body": "Context: Back in 2023, I jumped into this \"SEO\" thing for my startup because I thought, “hey, this can’t be that hard.” I just have to write some good blogs, add a few \"targeted keywords\" in the content, send emails to few prospect for \"link building\" and then BOOM Google will show my site in the first page.  Nope. Not even close.  I spent months publishing content (more than 20+ articles) I thought they were amazing. But when I checked Google? Page 10. Page 12. Basically invisible. And every time I tried to ask “why isn’t this ranking?” most answer I got from SEO gurus was mostly the same two words:  “Your Content is good, but SEO TAKES TIME\"  And then, of course, the golden advice: “Just build quality backlinks.”  Okay… but what does that actually mean?  How many backlinks do I need?  \"SEO TAKES TIME\" okay, but exactly how long specifically for my target \"keyword\" I want to rank for?  And getting backlinks from what kind of sites is good enough to be considered as \"high quality backlinks\" purely for my targeted keyword?  And how the hell do I guest post without spamming “keyword + write for us” into Google and begging random sites for guest posts?  That’s when it hit me: what if there was a tool that didn’t just say “build quality backlinks,” but literally broke it down for you? Like Google saying  “To rank for this keyword, you’ll need around 42 backlinks from DA 28-32 sites, you site MUST LOAD under 2.5 seconds, have 3 supporting articles, and ~4 months of consistency. Oh, and here’s the exact strategy to actually get those backlinks without generic guest posting BS.”  So… I built it.  It’s called Pikera SEO (https://pikeraai.com). It’s a tool where you type in your target keyword (for example: “best AI tools in 2025”), and it tells you:  How many backlinks you’ll realistically need  What domain authority range those backlinks should come from  How long it’ll probably take to rank  What technical fixes you need to make  And most importantly → the strategy to actually hit those requirements  I’m not saying this magically gets you to Page 1 overnight (SEO is still work). But at least now you can start with clarity instead of guesswork with Pikera SEO.  Right now, Pikera SEO is in early access, and we’re running a waitlist here: https://pikeraai.com/waitlist.  If you’re a founder, marketer, or just someone tired of SEO “it depends” answers, I think you’ll find it useful.  But I’d also love your feedback: if you were using a tool like this, what’s the #1 thing you’d want it to tell you about your keyword? Because I’m still improving it, and honestly, hearing from people in communities like this is way more valuable than any \"SEO guru’s\" advice.  That’s it. Just wanted to share my journey, my frustration, and what I built out of necessity.  If anyone’s been through the same SEO pain, I’d love to hear your story too.",

            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada’s classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.   We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking–much to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in  Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate - the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala’s approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.   Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn’t mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‘help’. One time, she even said airily, “I wash my own dishes, you know.” She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala–a beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth–lingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don’t intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‘nepo babies’ who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).   Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It’s a troubling idea to think that despite what’s happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

And a few after she became miss nepal... I can somewhat vouch for the \"I'm busy with this and that... Can you help me with this\" part...  People around her always had the same feedback.. and I quote as I recall \"Euta kaam pani garna parexaina yo kt lai.. jahile ni help help vanxa...  help magne pro vikhari..\"  😂 (she barely does a thing on her own, always keeps asking for help , she like pro-beggar ..)   I never liked her naak ma singan adke jasto boli.. And always felt she has a cunning personality that clings over you until she can no more use you for her advantage..  Sisan literally dodged a  bullet.. all thanks to her greed though..|||Wish we had more tea like this on all nepo babies.|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn’t some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was “beneficial” for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake “beauty with brains” narrative. Do you guys remember Niti’s big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let’s not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala’s prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it’s her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let’s be real- Sisan wasn’t perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they’d known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn’t even exist. This just proves it- they weren’t just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can’t just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala’s career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav’s narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What’s the lesson we can learn from here ?  Karma is real af & money can’t give you lifelong happiness, night Redditors|||She didn't get any fucking scholarship from the Nepali government. She was funded by her corrupt father.||| Damn I strictly feel its true|||[deleted]|||I  never cared for her but hated her when she said ‘ we were not well off I had to share room with my house help ‘ and tried to relate to poor people like bro fuck off .|||Thanks for sharing. Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don’t even make sense to begin with. Don’t know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don’t even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It’s so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It’s astounding what the world has come to and it’s deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can’t be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn’t she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It’s better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has. It’s disheartening!|||I’ve realized just how cunning and calculative she really is. Nothing feels natural with her. Every move, every word, every connection seems like part of a bigger calculation. While most people get dragged through the mud on social media, she somehow stays a step ahead. Of all platforms, she was clever enough to pull the LinkedIn card first. That’s not by accident, it’s calculation. She knows the bashing on Tiktok or Instagram doesn’t matter as long as her professional side stays spotless, especially where she might work with people internationally who will never know the side of her life in Nepal that’s been exposed and torn apart ever since the truth came out.  It’s like she’s playing this endless game of Ludo, always climbing the ladder, polishing her image as she goes. But at the same time, you can’t help but feel she’s only ever a roll away from hitting 98 and sliding right back down the snake.|||Correct my if I’m wrong guys, but shrinkhala father was health minister covid time, I heard tyo time ma vaccine ma ra health sector ma eka dum corruption bhaykeo thiyo.

I would assume that she was in her best behavior since she was not in Nepal and probably wanted to portray the best of her image.

The beinfit is probably meant for the MPs who had to move temprorarily to the capital or who didn't have their own residence. Iirc, they had to manually opt in to get that added housing allowance. When the news published, her father's reaction was something along the line of \"I didn't know, I was getting it. I am happy to return it.\"  Question for her, how come you dont know the source of wealth and your parent's ethics?

It highlights how Shrinkhala, despite her public image and privileges, was not as collaborative or hardworking in academic settings as she appeared to be. It also touches on the contrast between her image and reality, as well as some concerns about nepotism and entitlement.|||there was a podcast recently, shrinkhala & 3 other women sittng down to talk with, his name may be anil shah.

These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!! And the way she's silent when the country is bleeding says alottt too!!!!!!

They NEVER used their \"Harvard degree\" or Ivy league label to show off. It's those who want to fame and fake pride that put up social media posts to show off their diplomas.

For the longest time I thought it was a generational difference, since there are many other Harvard students who have publicized themselves in several Youtube videos and they are all Gen Z, and as a Gen Y (Millennial) observing this trend seemed justifiable.  However, Shrinkhala was building a house of cards and the fact that she had the audacity to publicize and put Sambhav Sirohiya in the limelight using Harvard freebies was just laughable a few years ago.  Like you pointed out, the fact that she still has 900K followers is troubling for sure but let's hope those are just her fake followers (some % are bought/in-organic followers, some her closest elite allies like \"Other Miss Nepals/ Businessmen/political affiliates etc. and some her enemies) as they say, **keep your friends close and enemies closer.**|||keep exposing|||People beware of believing everything you read on Reddit. It's really easy to put dirty on people as it's anonymous|||TBH this all make no sense at all. can you post this on your public account IG or TikTok where people can see your face and account history?? The internet is dangerous and anyone can sit behind a screen make up stories and try to drag someone down just for attention. if you are really who you claim to be and if what you re saying about her is real then u need to show somethin that make sense. we need actual proof that you're a real person and that your story is true. and to be clear i 'am not asking for private or sensitive information i 'am asking for verifiable proof that doesn't expose personal data. post something that proves you are real AND U ACTUALLY KNEW HER not just a vouge words from behind an anonymous screen's.  you could show a public Harvard profile or alumni directory link with your name on it or simple photo of a Harvard ID or an official enrollment or graduation letter. without something like that, this is just baseless gossip. the internet is full of people who spread lies to ruin others, and that's exactly why nobody should take your words seriously without real evidence. if you truly care about the truth you'd stand behind your claims publicly. otherwise, what you're saying is just another reminder of how dangerous and misleading the internet can be when people use it to spread rumors without accountability.|||Give us some proof OP. How can we blindly trust u? And its a burner acc.

I think her winning Ms Nepal helped; also her access to many social works would have helped with her application. But still getting into Harvard is not a small feat- so she must have some intellectual capacity to get picked by the best educational institutions in the world.|||All I can say here is that who ever wrote this has poor English and I am doubtful he/she/they attended Harvard.|||Your views on her seem completely emotion-based, lacking any factual concreteness. They exude your bitterness towards her. I think you envy her followers ( which you have mentioned a lot) and her beauty, its common for ugly people to have this jealousy. Her prowess is enough to get admitted into Harvard and she also has a private architecture company. You creating a burner account to throw dirt at her shows your pettiness as well.|||i mean knowing she did try to contribute to nepal rest of the thing was from the breakup scandal right , i don't know about the beauty though everyon is beautiful you try to find it !!!the system will surely benefit her , but a lot of people are unaware of transparecy can't connect the dot in larger scale if she can do great things with her face that has been blessed and for the achievement sh won once title ie miss nepal, she should do great things for the nation in upcoming years and time and hope she get equal value from the scandals!! and serve !!!|||[deleted]|||Still Beautiful though",

While the country was grieving and people were literally risking their lives for justice, she was sitting back, polishing a script and preparing an Excel sheet to clear her image. That’s not just tone-deaf, it’s calculated. The timing, the fake vulnerability, the “I’m innocent” narrative, it’s all image management. And to drop that while the nation is still mourning? It’s actually disgraceful. Her silence during the peak of the movement spoke volumes, and now this video just confirmed everything people feared about her. Honestly, if this is the “final boss” of playing victim, it’s a pathetic one.|||Tyo excel sheet banauna plan gareko PR team lai fire hannei parxa Shrinkhala le😂😂|||Feels like Nepal ma kei garnu bekar ho.

I got a sudden boost in heart-beat thinking she actually shot herself & unlived her|||Hijo matrai I saw a YouTube video of thesadiapsychology’s scam who provides everything but proof that she is a licensed psychologist with degrees. It’s a different story but that’s exactly how I felt watching Shrinkhala’s videos.  I never idolized her or hated her, but this is too much. It was giving manipulation & narcissism. It’s one thing to defend her reputation, but completely another to do so by playing the victim card, shifting narratives & repeatedly saying things so that they are perceived as truth & dodging accountability by blaming others. Tbh it really bothered me that she (and her PR team) thought that we’re dumb enough to believe those excel sheets. Maybe what she said is true, but she could have showed the actual proof.  In her place, all of us would feel terrible. But to say things like leaving instagram account as it is so that it can be a testament to hate while not acknowledging her silence on a platform with a million followers over deaths of youth is crazy. Becoming an influencer means you are sometimes answerable to questions & accusations, it’s not just about making your feed aesthetic & scoring brand deals. People turned her into an influencer, so ofc she will have to be answerable sometimes. I wonder what she thought? Yea it’s not easy, but it’s part of all that fame & money.  To see that she was so concerned about setting her narrative & defending her image while not even feeling sorry for those who died, were injured & whose families are now forever incomplete is baffling.   Her narrative has been set forever now. Clearly, not to everyone, but to lots of us. Someone said that she’s only sad now because she lost followers, and that pretty much sums up how I see her now.|||Lol yo ta halka clickbait bhayena ra?|||Tesko bhanda ta Anmol KC ko acting ramro yarr|||More the explanation more the lie.|||Aafule khaneko khaldo ma aafai parnu vaneko ehi ho :D|||Yeah couldn't agree more.

Honestly asking. Why did the Nepo Kids trend include her? I have read somewhere that people hate her now because she said she will fight against corruption when she is the daughter of Binod Khatiwoda so that made her a hypocrite. Was Binod Khatiwada known to be corrupt? Please dont tell me that every politician is corrupt. I am asking if there has been any concerns raised regarding Binod Khatiwada like he owning multiple buildings, cars etc when he is only a politician.    If no one really knows that her dad is corrupt, her defensiveness makes sense to me. I too would be devastated if my image was destroyed for no apparent reason.   Again.. I am saying this because I honestly don't know about Binod Khatiwada.|||Timi tyape nepalko news youtuber ho|||Bolnu ni vanxa bolda ni lyang hanxa k chaiyo hau tmi haru lai Ajha video ma vaneko xa ta ki tesko problem sano ho aru haru ko life gako xa vanera ki video complete naheri hatta na patta reddit aako interaction badauna?

            "body": "I know we already have too many posts on her. I know we are trying to make her irrelevant now. But there are still people who are supporting her, because sabai kura easily trust garna mildaina especially when it's mostly allegations. Gossips lai prove garna ni sakinna. Pls read until the end.  So, recently Tiktok ma ekjana le Shrinkhala ra Shambhav ko total 9 jana ko group le Shey phoksundo ma Army ko helicopter bata 'rescue' ko naam lidai misuse gareko witness gareko bhanyo. They said majjale ramairako, hasirako thyo re yo 9 jana ko group, ani helicopter aayera lagyo re. News portals ma ni news bhetincha rescue gareko bhanera. Malai chai valid proof nai chahirathyo pattyauna. Given how she has been portraying herself through social media and PR videos, it was time we start questioning their misuse of power.   I wanted to see pictures of that 'rescue' operation. Having some free time, I did some internet digging and found a facebook page of Nepal Army posted on October 2023. It exactly matches the news portals and tiktok user's claim, plus Shrinkhala’s story(it's on her story highlights). Yes, Summit air use gareko vlog cha, but my guess is ktm to dolpa jana lai use gareko ho, not return to ktm.   Picture: collage of the picture on fb page of Nepal army, then Shrinkhala’s group of 9 people who went to Shey Phoksundo. Luga haru milcha, anuhar ni milcha. You can see that it's the same group.   This really shows how much power is misused in Nepal and the recent nepo-kids trend was helpful to shed light on this. I am also against all the opportunists who posted against their exes to gain relevancy during vulnerable times. Aba chahi we should think twice before blindly following social media figures.",

Which could have happened just after the laughs they had or they were lighting up the mood.   We become too judgemental too quickly. And because the nepo kid trend went on, this incident invovling her was brought to light.

            "heading": "Shrinkhala khatiwada’s dating history & Karma Story",
            "body": "This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named something Puri. It wasn’t some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction. She used to post pictures with him, and their relationship was pretty much out in the open :)  Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. This was right after she went china to represent Nepal . Some even say she was the one who initiated those late night hotel meetups because Sisan was “beneficial” for her career & public were loving em together. Reason? To stay relevant. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline, she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close together while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public and privately, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake “beauty with brains” narrative. Do you guys remember Niti’s big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let’s not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala’s prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it’s her personal choice unless you give hopes to people and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built over the years. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still seeing each other until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a probability of a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let’s be real- Sisan wasn’t perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they’d known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn’t even exist. This just proves it- they weren’t just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can’t just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala’s career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav’s narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And let’s not forget- his house got burned down because of his ties with Shrinkhala. Sure, they were already  corrupted, but sambhav’s family always stayed lowkey until Shrinkhala’s fame and her controversial marriage put them in the spotlight. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What’s the lesson we can learn from here ?  Karma is real af & money can’t give you lifelong happiness, fame can backfire you fr !  night Redditors",

If you check out his profile you can still see his old posts supporting Shrinkhala for Miss Nepal. As far as I know, Prasanga helped her a lot and was very supportive. He even went to Miss world competition in China along with Shrinkhala and her brother. I really liked them together during that time, but later found out that she left him right after the Miss world pageant. Just around the time when she found Sisan and was making the Introduction video for her. I still remember Prasanga was devastated and he did really love her.

I think we can't really blame them if they are taking information form joley media of Nepal.|||I hope people of Nepal are not falling for the same trap that destroyed Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. What looked like a well organised protest against govt, soon uncovered itself as regime change operations by deep state.|||We Support Nepal 🇮🇳|||He hardly has any reach tbh. He is rather seen as a clown who has been trying to incite youth against the establishment since more than 7 years now but fails terribly at it. Most of his views on youtube are manipulated & paid (bots etc). & a chunk of his viewership is rather from Pakistan & Bangladesh.  Edit: Also he is lying.|||Most well informed Indians are aware that this dissent had been brewing for quite sometime. Wish my Nepali bros and sis the best of luck and kudos for taking back what is rightfully yours . Hopefully the guilty are brought to justice, order is restored and right representatives are assigned to take Nepal forward for all its wonderful people. As for our media, they sell whatever gets views from the masses, tomorrow if Sita maa has comeback to be the Queen of Nepal sells, they'll start posting that, organizing debate sessions with clown for cheap entertainment. 🤡 I pray the martry RIP, their families fairly and properly compensated , justice is fast tracked, and a votes held  new govt formation.  Goodspeed Nepalis. 🇳🇵|||This mf is just an islamist puppet. We don't need him.|||Dhruv Rathee is fucking sellout.  He is scam, biased and no body takes him seriously.  His startup was also a scam.|||Bruh, this guy is a charlatan.|||Broken clock moment for Agent Dhruv Rathee - do not fall for his propaganda. I am not sure which media is being blamed here but what I see is that the media channels are saying the “Anti corruption “ protests.   Low IQ news media doesn’t count as even Indians know that they are sensationalise everything|||I’m Indian! There is no propaganda. KP Oli is hated by India and Indians, so Infact we support it.  Indians think KP Oli has- 1) Ruined ties with India, keeps making claims that Ayodhya is actually in Nepal  2) CCP puppet, keeps insulting India and chooses china  3) Hasn’t visited India in 4 years he’s been PM, even though India and Nepal are very important partners.   Guys the Modi government is NOT a supporter of KP Oli, the news articles are misinformed and have low knowledge & context about the events in Nepal. I hope our Nepali brethren understand this on our behalf. Thank you 🙏|||Don't fall for him Nepali brothers , he has his own personal interests.

We only care about peace and tranquility in Nepal.|||[removed]|||He is late as always trying to prove his clowness , media already started to show the true reasons for the protest|||There seems to be no valid narrative. If it was against corruption then the protest should have stopped after government stepping down. But what happened after that - people are destroying and burning their country’s asset, their parliament, airports and banks etc - this is not the way it should have gone down if this was about corruption only.   Now instead of corruption in the office it’s anarchy on the streets.|||total international media is reporting it as social media but india ==godi  the reason i hate these nepalis|||Western media were reporting the same no?|||His favorite president Trump can't wait to start acting as president of Nepal. Definitely US is definitely behind this.|||Don't believe in this joker.|||Why nepalis are so obsessed with what indian and indian media is saying, why don't they focus on what chinese media is saying as they consider china as their friend so why worry or think about what indian are saying, they don't consider india as their friend so why so much focus on india?|||If you think Dhruv Rathee is telling the truth, then I have an Eiffel Tower to sell you. This person is a grade A propagandist of the anti-BJP front. All his tweets are made on the behest of his masters, and he has been called out multiple times for this.|||FYI—-> Social media isn’t just mirroring conflicts happening in schools and on streets – it’s triggering new ones!|||he is against modi gov only.|||Dhruv Rathee is one of the people who remains a part of opposition forever. That doesn’t mean he is wrong always but sometimes yes! It is not just Indian media it is international media but most of them are correcting themselves now which is good. Although his comments are still wrong in many ways. Social media ban was a ignition for this protest because corruption is going on from a longtime. But people should think what’s next? Youth leaders are going to step up and take positions to govern? Do they have that kind of unity? And do you think don’t they turn into corrupt due to powers? Great initiative by youth but think about what’s next |||All of us Indians know this. What are you saying?|||I don't know what are you talking about. Most coverage of Indian media is overtly positive.   This is because our love towards Nepal is same as our hate towards that Chinese puppet Oli.   If you see any doubt in our media or people, it is because we have a slight doubt if CIA or ISI will start using Nepal as a ground to disturb India.   Nepal can be a smaller country, but they are much more older nation state than us with full of brilliant souls and whatever Nepalis choose for their country, we respect that from core.  But never think this Rathee fellow has any love towards you guys. He's just putting gun over your shoulder to attack India. He is not even an Indian citizen. He is a compromised soul to the highest bidder.|||German shepherd....he only spreads propaganda...beware of him .... Nepal|||This dhruv rati guy is himself an idiot 🤣🤣|||If you consider German/US funded Dhruv Rathee as flag bearer of honest opinion then you have fallen for exactly the narrative that the 'west' wants you to believe.  Mental colonization happens much before the physical one, this has already happened in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Pakistan look where they are at this time  Beware whom you trust and what you believe.|||It's actually USA, they did the same to Bangladesh last year |||Yesterday I saw a nepali post on Instagram where an Indian mentioned in the comment that the same protest should be done in India and everyone was bashing that guy and calling him out for bringing India in the topic.

It's an internal issue of Nepal and we wish them peace and prosperity. Let normalcy be restored soon.|||Why you even taking him seriously.|||It's quite obvious to everyone in India, except the media narrative. I doubt anyone here believes that our Nepali brothers were protesting to assert their right to doomscroll.  People don't go to extremes in protesting against social media.  And govts don't ban all social media apps, just because the companies didn't \"register with them\". they do it, because they see the narrative has gone against them, and they desperately want to gain back the control.|||This guy ain’t even an Indian citizen|||[https://youtu.be/CXEMBDjnoWU?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/CXEMBDjnoWU?feature=shared) watch this|||This guy has some personal beef with modi and his party .

We have civilization connect that exists for thousands of years. Far before countries as a concept existed. Seeing our people in pain hurts us. 2. Indian mainstream media is shit. Even we don't entertain them. Each passing day their credibility is decreasing in India. 3. Dhruv rathi is also shit. Even his credibility is decreasing each passing day. One hypocrisy at a time. 4. From the bottom of our hearts we hope things calm down there and change for the better for the people of Nepal. I am sure if Nepal wants, the govt in India would love to help however possible (No strings attached) not unlike the hand we gave to srilanka in their time of need Because we understand what it is like to go through a state of political unrest.

You don't need any validation from germany ka kukkur.|||Guys, I assume everyone here has someone in their family with some political ties. I too have. But that doesn't mean I have direct ties with them. JHOLEY and BHEDA is a noun that defines people who blindly believe in a person or a political party.      Talking about myself, I am already 36, a father and I am thinking of raising my family here in Nepal. I was totally against going abroad as a student when there was trend to do so. But the political system was never stable here. However, This current GenZ revolution happened against corruption. We indeed got a good progress against these corrupt leaders. But things turned out to be different and here is my roller coaster of emotions. Please let me know if you can relate to this.  Day 0: Social Media Ban - Mixed feelings. Hopeful that social medias will proceed further with registration.  Day 1: GenZ revolution and killing - Lots of anger. Disappointment and discontent.  Day 2: Revolution, excited and happy till 4 PM, until we destroyed the party system. Once the public started destroying Singha Durbar, I came to realize what I had done. I started a fire that I can't extinguish.  Day 3: Realization of the revolution being hijacked. We were just against corruption, regime change was not our motto. The revolution gradually turned into a COLOR REVOLUTION.  Day 4: Worried about who will lead the country. Started mentally supporting Balen/Rabi or any young leader. Furious, since the army asked GenZ to come up with a leader. Finally Hami Nepal, some guys funded by Deep state along with Sanduk Ruit and Swarnim Wagle came into light. They started talking about regime change and Constitution change. They said they directly want to select Zelensky as their prime minister.   Day 5: Much more disappointed as some kids who are aiming to go abroad for future study is electing prime minister through Discord. Sushila Karki elected as PM. Which is some sort of relief. I feared a autocrat.  Day 6 - Day 7: China is yet to acknowledge PM Sushila Karki. China is suspecting foul play as KP Oli had been to SCO and all of this happened just after that.      Now I am very much in distress. I feel that, Nepal is Ukraine. Balen is the new Zelensky and China is the new Russia. I dont want to think negatively but the situation ahead seems to be very dark and we will have to take steps cautiously. There are a lot of hatred here and Social medias are fueling it. None of the GenZ were born during the writing of the constitution. There were lots of revolution that was endured by current revolution Maoist Revolution, Madesh Revolution etc. But now it seems everything has gone to waste and there is no constitution here in the country. Is this PTSD?|||Nepal, you are dealing with dangerous, insecure, violent crybullies who don't care about reasons and motives because they'll just come up with fake news and use that is their motive. Good luck.|||Man , this guy is cursed. Whenever his name appears , chaddis flock to it like screaming \" PROPAGANDA\" ,  like moths to a flame.   Stay safe, Nepali bros.|||Lol i m from india as thought that this was abt social media in the morning🤦🏻‍♂️ now understood the real motive...|||I believe Nepal needs a revolution. I have visited the country many times and have relatives involved in politics, so I am aware of the real situation. People are struggling to find jobs, there is a shortage of roads, and corruption levels are too high.||| so proud of your protested and how your new generation handled the currupt officials but sadly indian youth are still stuck bootlicking|||Because that's what the Godi media does. Indian politicians must either be shitting themselves or laughing knowing this won't happen in India as long as they continue building temples and not schools.|||To my Nepali brothers, any Redditor who is more focused on the messenger rather than the message mentioned, click on their profile and block them. They are more concerned about their agenda's useless buffons.   To the people of Nepal, I hope a better and stronger government arises from the ashes that focuses on development, literacy and is corruption-free.|||When has godi media shown reality?|||Because the Indian govt wants Nepal to be destabilized enough to be too weak, divided & afraid to challenge India when it can use the crisis as a pretext to invade & annex Nepal.",

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not “revolution,” it’s not “justice,” and it sure as hell isn’t “the voice of the people.” It’s mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn’t make you brave—it makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that—surrounded by a wave of so-called “youths” who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let’s not sugarcoat it—the so-called Gen Z “warriors” hiding in the mob weren’t heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country’s social fabric. He still can’t step foot in certain countries because he’s internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he’s propped up as a “leader.”  Let’s be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn’t an accident—it was a setup. While Deuba’s family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don’t get it twisted—those sharpshooters in the crowd weren’t just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres—former insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let’s stop pretending this was “the people rising up.” It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist—the one who drowned this nation in blood—walks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don’t for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn’t that Deuba suffered humiliation—the real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn’t a flower; he’s a weed choking the soil of Nepal’s democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too naïve to realize they’re being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||CIA & India Agents involved in chaos!

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4. Retirement age and term limits: This is a must, we need a clear retirement age for the public positions just like other jobs.     These sort of things are fundamental of any country, without getting the fundamentals right we cannot expect our country to do better. We have a chance to make things better, lets take this chance.|||also i think! what lessons can be learned from Bangladesh last year?|||Garni nai ho vani presidency system lyauni.

Just wanted to express supreme respect to you from Ukraine.   You're really cool!   We had protests in 2014.   We made lot of mistakes after succeded in throwing down Yanukovich in 2014.

After five years people were tricked and during war elected complete scammers after watching \"servant of nation\" series with current president in main role.   Now we get kidnapping peoples on streets by police and conscripted forcely to war or you can get out for $10k until kidnapped next time.

Or some peoples are going \\~100km through wild forests to escape country hunted by border guards with drones. Some succeed, some die.

Constitutional legitimacy + protester acceptance = only viable option.  # 2. PROTESTER LEADERSHIP PIVOT  Gen Z groups must **immediately shift messaging**:  * \"Our revolution is being hijacked\" * \"Military rule = permanent corruption\" * **Name specific civilian demands**: New constitution, elections in 1 year  # 3. ARMY FACE-SAVING EXIT  New interim government must **publicly thank Army Chief Sigdel** for \"preserving democracy\" and **offer ceremonial role** in transition (advisory only, no executive power).  # 4. EMERGENCY UNITY GOVERNMENT  * Sumana Shrestha as PM * Balen Shah as Deputy PM * **3 Gen Z representatives** in cabinet * **Clear 12-month timeline** to new elections  # 5. INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION BLITZ  India, China, UN must **immediately recognize** any civilian arrangement. Every hour of delay gives military justification for intervention.  **THE WINDOW IS 6-8 HOURS MAX**.

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

People should remain vigilant, because power vacuums can attract opportunists and old interests looking for a way back. Sushila Karki’s reputation for integrity is promising, but all eyes must stay on the process ahead—the appointments, the investigations she has promised, and the preparations for free and fair elections.  If we relax now, those who thrive on chaos and corruption will try to regain ground. Vigilance, regular citizen oversight, and strong pressure for transparency are needed at every step. The sacrifices made in this movement must be honored by making sure accountability and reform actually reach every corner of the new system.    This is our chance to set a new standard in Nepali politics—let’s not waste it for a second.|||Huge Respect with how they handled the situation while maintaining peace.

Indian media is the judge, jury and executioner of all the happenings in Nepal, Bangladesh, Srilanka and Pakistan. According to them, India is Ramarajya but others were Raavan rajya. India has become a dead democracy in the past decade. We have no jobs, extremely costly education and no health. We are just scrapping by but nothing to show as the media paints cooked up Indian GDP.

A shift to a fully directly elected system for every seat would ensure greater accountability and public representation. 2. **Establish a Directly Elected Executive Head:** Instead of the parliament choosing the Prime Minister, the call is for a directly elected President or Prime Minister with full executive powers.

It’s tragic, because they also have families back home and face the same struggles as the rest of us. They should be victims of this system too, yet they show little compassion or critical thought about what’s happening around them. Why are there protests in the first place? I refuse to believe they're blind to people's frustration and the direction the country is heading.  I still remember when we joined a protest 14–15 years ago. The police confronted us aggressively, and as kids we were too confused to react. Fortunately, we just stood there processing and visibly confused, and they left — but I still shudder to think, *what if our reaction had been different?* Today’s young protestors are in the same position, pure in their intentions, simply voicing frustration without wanting harm.  And honestly, credit must go to these protestors. They know exactly what they are standing for, unlike us back then who needed adults to organise us. I don’t see how demonstrations could be any more peaceful than they already are — especially when the very leaders being protested against have blood on their hands from before this generation was even born.|||Yo bhatey haru kahi gayera sitcha holani|||randi baan machikne haru|||I mean this tracks, they only like when you're corrupt|||Its not andolan anymore its war|||We want death or at lease exile of KP Oli and other taukes.|||Randi haruko photo, name, address patta lagau.|||shamelss dogs of government|||Machikne radi harlai lakhetdai marnaparne|||Thuiyaa police vanauda haruuu|||you radiko ban harulai agolauno man xa|||ma sanga pani ganhune bhaye, kassam mardinthe radieekko ban|||Mathi bata aako order re ????

Most people don't know the perspectives of one event and they believe only what is potrayed.

Honestly speaking they are playing with young people’s emotions and future… they are burning our country and feeling the warmth… and we are happy at the time being because youth are so blinded by this madness they don’t see right from wrong!! Just look at the way they incite violence like it’s nothing!! Talking about burning down houses and people is nothing!! This is not a right foundation. We must make all these Gen-Z representatives accountable. Especially, Sudhan Gurung. He needs to stop acting like some filmy hero and step back for people with capabilities to step in and do their job. He is distracting the revolution in many way by his hot headed attitude. And stop with this Balen nonsense. He is just a populist who is just an experienced cringe wannabe… atleast for now he has not shown his worth to Nepali people.

Also what happens if he wins election he managed? Would everyone trust he won fair election?   I think what did is best for him and country. If people choose him, he will be pm if not he wont. It’s simple.|||Disclaimer: I am not a Balen supporter or cultist.  This post is conflicting for me. But, the post is characterizing the man based on:  1. What the man didn’t do or didn’t say. 2. What people expected him to do.  The man himself has said enough in his posts.   It’s what, he DIDN’T do that impresses me the most about him. Saying “No” is harder than saying “Yes”, when everyone wanted him to say “Yes”.  (Think about this.)  He put out only a couple of posts, which I think served as guide posts during the revolution.   1. He was the first widely known public figure (that I know) who defined who Gen Z was and gave his support to the protest. 2. When the tempo rose, he clarified that Gen Z should lead, he accepted Sushila even when all of his cultists were going crazy about making him the interim PM.  Removing himself from the picture, brought focus back on the revolution and the task ahead, rather than turn the confusion situation, even more confusing with a popularity contest as a side gig.   There is a lot of things to think about and I think in time we can all make sense of it all.   That’s my two paisa about him.|||Leading KTM municipality vs leading the nation are totally different. The followers of Balen urging and rushing him to lead 'right now' and come out by 2PM are the same people who will criticize him within one year if he were to be them PM someday. They don't have patience and want to see changes immediately.  Personally, I would like to see him running in the upcoming election as deputy/vice roles first and not immediate PM role...assuming how parties will be formed and if there are any good lead independent candidate who will run with him. He's one of those few worthy to be PM but this is not his peak yet. He just became a mayor like 3 years ago and he still has a lot to show to the general public. If and when he wins to the election, it will be his peak and he has high chances of being a two term PM...assuming two term limit will be in place hopefully. Time will tell.|||GenZ aren't immune to celeb worship culture.|||Hami Nepal has already stated it was part of a plan and they want balen for 5 years.

Yes it is definitely an opportunistic behaviour by balen. But how is this behaviour wrong and how is taking over PM position now and securing interim govt now and not taking part in politics for next 5 years do any good to the country.    He is practicing patience to achieve the goal he desires and what people actually wants from a young leader like him. Look throughout the history of world politics, paitence has always been the key factor to shape the world politics.|||Having trusted by many even me,In the moment of national threat, he could do nothing. That’s the reason I doubt him.  i think he is not completely responsible for being the Prime Minister. Sure, he is a great person. He’s doing such a great thing in the valley, but being a Prime Minister is very responsible post, his way up talking to seniors, saying I will put fire to SinghaDurbar, I will bury everyone if you’re in tudinkhel, getting carried away by emotions, being Prime Minister means you should not be carried away by any emotions and none of the factors should affect your judgment which you believe to be true and is lawful, Hopefully he will make such changes and we can finally see him in the top, as much as I want him to be the Prime Minister I do think he is inexperienced and immature in this field,|||We are so far behind that criticizing political leader sounds like a hater. We are not even to the point where we could say “This person is bad/clueless , country isn’t safe with them”. For the past decade, the corrupted 3 have been playing nothing but tato aloo with us so its natural to be sticking nail to current situation. Give it some time and our voices will get echoed.|||If there’s one thing old political leaders never learned, it was how to handle criticism. The moment anyone spoke up, they tried to shut it down and let’s not even start on the behavior of their hardcore supporters(jholey as we call them).  Even leaders like Balen need to address this with their own supporters, as do all the new representatives entering the upcoming elections. They must say publicly that they welcome criticism, will reflect on it, and use it as a tool for improvement. Leaders should make it clear to their base: don’t bully or silence people for simply asking questions or raising concerns. Do not perform character assassination against someone just for criticizing. After all, in a democracy, freedom of speech is our right.  At the same time, we the general public also carry responsibility. We need to recognize the difference between constructive criticism and defamation. What we must not do is fall for propaganda, spread rumors, or engage in baseless character assassination.  And if we realize that our criticism or questioning was wrong, we should have the courage to apologize in the same way we raised the question. After all, apologizing will never make you small. It’s just a simple five letter word: “Sorry.” A word that can and should be spoken from both sides.|||Just because you’re against the system, doesn’t make you Balen-Supporters. Balen has no experience. Balen should wait and gain some experience. Criticism is a backbone of democracy and one must welcome it.|||EXACTLY. They lack this ability to critically analyse any action of any leader. Like no one is perfect and no one is a good. Let's be honest. Let's criticize people for their actions. People should be held accountable for their actions. Most importantly, leaders who run our nation. If we don't point out their wrongdoings, will they ever stop? Nepalese have such a bheda mindset, istg. Let's be more aware and let's know how to discern leaders and their actions.   By criticizing these leaders, we aren't hating on them. We're trying to bring awareness so that they won't repeat the same thing again and can do things better for the country.|||They need to be aware party KO jhole become jhole because they were andabhakt of party leader ( just like they are blind follower of balen rn)|||I think holding politicians accountable is crucial. I hope people realize we don’t need  more devotees and followers. We need critical, educated thinkers. Support the good work, appreciate your favorite leader but don’t forget to question often. People change. Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Need to always stay cautious. |||Agreed|||Thanks man, you speaked my words. I see people thanking Balen for this movement and saying he was the reason this movement happened and succeeded and all after Sushila Karki became interim PM, and this made me very sad for actual people who started the movement and also faced the consequences and this was even more big realization for me for how blind youth and supporters these days are and this concerns me even more for future|||This. This is what I’ve been saying for some time. Like the post says, I’ve also been labeled as a party ko jhole and what not. Even here in this sub, people have called me jhole lol just because I questioned him.  I am a Balen supporter. I supported him and did my part by sharing about his campaign on social media and making everyone aware about it. And I was super happy when he won, I still am. But I’ve been criticizing him on various points that I find valid. The top one is communication.  During the election, he constantly criticized Bidya Sundar (the previous mayor) for not communicating publicly. He even said that once he became mayor, he wouldn’t be like that and would stay in constant touch. He proposed starting a ‘Mayor with the Public’ TV program and even set aside a budget for it, but nothing has happened. He hasn’t given a single interview.  And then come his jhole supporters who always argue with the same line: ‘Pailai kei chaieko ho.’ With that logic, we should never question anyone. Just look at how Balen has become now, he just posts one-sided, no-context Facebook statuses and nothing else.|||Balen is a hypocrite in my opinion, like he encouraged the protest and even promised to provide a safe and secure environment for the protest but when things turned south he vanished like horn from a donkeys head|||Finally someone spoke about this, belun has literally become a god complex among some people out there, which is kinda concerning, the only time he speaks is to not let his adhabhatka interfere in every other stuff out there.

I personally don't think he has the temperament (though if there's a choice between any big parties' leader and Balen, I'd choose Balen every time).|||Aru kura thik ho, but can’t say he abandoned. It’s not 100% sure he will be the next PM so can’t call him opportunist.|||Yes ,|||Very well said|||While I am unsure on balen and his move, yes! To select a leader, you do have to question. Even the one you support. That is transparency. That is the trust that has foundation|||You’re right. In Nepal, many people tend to follow leaders without much critical thought, even when those leaders don’t necessarily act in their favor. Unfortunately, this habit seems to persist across generations. If the younger generation continues with the same mindset, there’s a real risk that the country could end up facing the same challenges in the future that we are experiencing today.|||You can make your own assumptions and narratives. If Balen had taken the post of PM, you would have said that he is opportunistic, that he enraged protestors just to get the position. I saw somewhere on Facebook, even before Balen’s official post on sushila karki that balen played dirty game for the sake of pm position. As far as I know, Balen is a farsighted person. He only comes forward when he feels fully prepared.|||That's my whole point, but again..vanepachi manche lai jholey nai lagcha. 😅 Guy's, learn to ask questions yourself too.

He is still better than most of the people there. Whatever he does, he has never done anything wrong. Stop pretending to be so-called critics for useless reasons. What is your academic background, and what makes you think that way? Have you ever felt the difference between past and present Kathmandu? I have a friend from the core area of Kathmandu, do you know what his opinion about Balen Shah is? No!  Even Harka Sampang is a very good person. Moreover, Sagar Dhakal’s brother has been working actively to eradicate the dictatorship of these political parties. Maybe your parents are bootlicking those rotten political parties, so you only see what Balen has never done and will never do. Just because he supported the movement does not mean he said he wants to become prime minister. You must understand that he posts only a few things because his words are weapons. One word from him has many consequences in such a movement. He is very clever and very wise; unlike Harka Sampang, though I like Harka as a person. But you need to give Balen full power to unlock his full potential. He wants change, he wants revolution, and he wants to remove corrupt politicians.

If Balen had come out saying he’s ready to lead, a lot of people would’ve jumped in claiming he planned the whole movement and just used Gen Z for his own benefit. That’s probably why in his statements, he keeps stressing that this is Gen Z’s movement and that the government will be formed by them. imo, staying out of it was the smartest move he could have made.  I’m all for questioning and criticizing leaders. I agree that its a problem if you dont want to do it. But when someone has shown that they are dedicated, not corrupt, and actually get things done, you’ve got to give them some benefit of the doubt. Save the tough questions for real concerns. Dont critise just because you think no one can ever be good enough.|||Yes Balen has fallen badly as he didnt seem to care about the youths when they needed him the most. But, when we are talking about selection of interim PM, he did the right thing by not coming out.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):** The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):** If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):** If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):** If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

This has been ongoing for more than two decades. Behind the few visible figures, there are countless others who have either assisted them or benefitted through their association—ranging from major brands in Nepal to traders. For example, Sher Bahadur Deuba’s son and his sanitary pad importing company stand as an illustration.  They have institutionalized corruption by appointing foreign ambassadors based on party loyalty and financial gains, extending even to the transfer of bureaucrats to preferred locations in exchange for bribes and other undue benefits. The problem is not limited to the political system alone; bureaucrats, too, require checks and balances. A mechanism must be established to regulate the power of bureaucrats over politicians. Since bureaucrats are permanent stakeholders, their influence is even greater. One effective way to mitigate this is to appoint domain experts as ministers—for instance, a professional civil engineer as a minister cannot be misled about the cost estimates of a construction project.  There remains much to be done. Moreover, these political parties will attempt to form alliances before elections, bringing forward the same candidates and restoring the same exploitative system. Therefore, the first and most meaningful reform must be a change in the electoral process, with the inclusion of a “NOTA” (None of the Above) option.  Further accountability can be ensured by eliminating political appointments to certain positions. At present, even temporary (karar) appointments are made based on party affiliation rather than merit. As a result, even highly qualified experts are compelled to seek political approval. The recent appointments of Vice-Chancellors at B.P. Koirala Institute in Dharan and Gangalal Hospital are prime examples.  In addition to these issues, several other structural flaws persist. What we urgently require is a comprehensive systemic reform|||Gen Z laid them in the grave, and now they're shoveling the dirt themselves.|||# How to make Gen Z movement bullet proof ?

He pushed Nepal towards democracy and republicanism.   He gave poor villagers and lower-caste groups a voice in national politics.   He increased women’s participation in politics and society, with many ex-fighters now active in leadership roles.   In western hills and Madhesh, state institutions were weak or absent. Villagers depended on landlords for loans, justice, and protection, which kept exploitation unchallenged (Kamaiya, Haruwa-Charuwa, Haliya systems). His movement gave villagers confidence to defy landlords for the first time.

Every politicians are coming back like it was never happened ani haami ? Haami pani kei na kei !!|||What happened to the Deuba family wasn’t just unfair—it was an orchestrated humiliation carried out in the most cowardly way possible. Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not “revolution,” it’s not “justice,” and it sure as hell isn’t “the voice of the people.” It’s mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn’t make you brave—it makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that—surrounded by a wave of so-called “youths” who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let’s not sugarcoat it—the so-called Gen Z “warriors” hiding in the mob weren’t heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country’s social fabric. He still can’t step foot in certain countries because he’s internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he’s propped up as a “leader.”  Let’s be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn’t an accident—it was a setup. While Deuba’s family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don’t get it twisted—those sharpshooters in the crowd weren’t just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres—former insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let’s stop pretending this was “the people rising up.” It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist—the one who drowned this nation in blood—walks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don’t for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn’t that Deuba suffered humiliation—the real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn’t a flower; he’s a weed choking the soil of Nepal’s democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too naïve to realize they’re being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||Prachanda and Baburam are India's puppet. Baburam was trained in India's JNU which wiped out more than 10% of our population while Madhessi bihari and Marwadi have exponentially grown.

People watched her speech where she said stuff like, “What’s my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?”  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still don’t have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we don’t have the right connections.  We don’t get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, it’s still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? That’s probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  We’re out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor people’s kids not boil?  On top of that, there’s already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent. Because this have  been suppressed for so long, and now the mindset is like — “If we can’t reach anywhere through the system, then we might as well destroy it.”  And even if some third party tries to trigger people, the truth is, it was already there deep down in their subconscious. This is just it coming out. Right now it feels new, but honestly, it was bound to happen sooner or later.|||No Shit Sherlock (You guys got  manipulated into doing the wrong thing) 😔|||Sherey ko choro lai dhulai diye ki nai ?|||Each Hilton hotel employees 400+ Nepalese nationals 😂 what about the people that lost their jobs?|||https://preview.redd.it/muoumzxh6eof1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63da78ae8b2a74c1f669dc95f01e062ff9e299b0|||https://preview.redd.it/rjynwvrk6eof1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04a5f8cbe1243c2dfca73c29dea57aa5425243bf|||We could’ve turned this into Hospital but Nope|||This is an absolutely great work revolution.|||Aur Karo money money wali gand masti|||if you make a good system and government now that‘s important!

His rough almost mobster-like style may be off-putting to some but in a city like Dharan which is home to hotheaded Kirati / Hill Janajati majority that kind of toughness isn’t just useful, it’s necessary.  That said, he is neither qualified nor capable enough to be considered an ‘ideal’ Prime Minister.

If a person has done good work, both of them will be appreciated hands down. You have to look at the picture from both sides. Secondly, please ask your senior citizens or elders from a different generation. They have seen history and faced the consequences. The real issue is bringing change in the constitution, i.e., a representative should not be above a certain age and should be allowed to seek votes only for one term. Take that in writing from the concerned representative, live, and show it to the world clearly. Also, please do not discriminate by saying someone is from the “Stone Age,” as such remarks can hurt the sentiments of people who are not from cities.|||Yes, I don't know what to.

(**Bank run** is a situation where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a bank simultaneously, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or financial stability. This can lead to liquidity problems for the bank, as it may not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands. Bank runs can create a cycle of panic, potentially leading to the bank's failure.)  The real pain starts after the protests have calmed. Economic crash is certain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh both went through it. Stock market/real estate crash, inflation and what not.  Whoever takes charge next, likely Balen, will need to address the pointless 'Greater Nepal' rhetoric and become a moderate on this issue. Thanks to Trump, India-China relationship is stable for the first time in ages. The only way Nepal has a future is pledge allegiance to both neighbour's.  Bangladesh under Yunus has been a pain in the ass for India. Nepal cannot make the same mistake. Any wrong steps and a free floating Nepali rupee against the dollar would go from 140 now to 25,000 like similar countries in our GDP range. Probably worse since our economy is in much worse shape.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.   Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.   Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||How credible is this info?|||Use bitchat for conversation.

She is the daughter of Chabi Rijal, a communist leader and Chief District Officer in Nepal, who recently ordered a shoot-on-sight against youth peacefully protesting corruption in Nepal. His orders have killed over 18 innocent people, injured more than 100 students, and more deaths are expected. This is pure fascism and a gross misuse of power. Young people in a peaceful protest were shot dead, which is totally unacceptable. While our brothers and sisters die in Nepal, Sweta Rijal has no right to study in the US with money from corruption. Her entire funding is from the money from corruption. The US, as a democratic country and a voice for the UN, stands for freedom and justice. Allowing her to stay contradicts everything the US represents. We are struggling to fight this battle in Nepal, and she must be held accountable. I urge you to investigate her visa and take necessary action to send her back to Nepal. Regards, Concerned Citizen from Nepal",

Many of us here are also frustrated by the opportunist media and some jerks. We do have misunderstandings and conflicts between but they should have been side lined at this critical moment. Even the people who are getting inspired and speaking in favour of your protest are getting back lash (and recently a person has been charged under the law by the police)because this protest turned violent but ik that wasn't intended. We can argue about the pros and cons but the fact that you stood up against the system is a big achievement and inspiration. I wish you great luck guys and hope you find a better system than the one you fought against and draw a milestone for us. Although I would say you have had a great loss of infrastructure which could have been avoided if the protest was properly managed.|||Abiskar Raut for POTUS  #RAUT2028|||Good speaker, I hope we learn a lot from him.|||Aja samma malai ni yo manchey(sudan gurung) ley miraj dhungana ley start gareko protest  lai hijack garera, sabai cerdit liyo vanney socheko thiye.

Sakidaina vaney kurai nanikaleko vaye hunthyo. Atleast daily life ta chali raheko thiyo sabai jana ko. Ahiley herda sabai damadol vaisakyo.

Why can't we try to support eachother instead of blaming each other??   And No body knows. Since those politicians where chased. They have little chance to establish again.  And the hotel was belonging of politicians son. So, they could have made fake protestor's to do it, to claim insurance?  Why are indian and nepalese are fighting here about this matter?? This isn't time for fighting.   And about destroying properties, there are theories that the protest were hijacked by other political parties. Like wise, about governments offices, they wanted to destroy the proofs of corruptions. And public building and properties was collateral damages for those fake protesters to look it real.   So stop blaming and fighting with each other. Please please please 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏.

Unless someone takes control. President and Army is supposed to take control in situations like this but Nepal Army Seems too hesitant. There's no government currently . President in hiding and Army doing nothing, when the country actually needs them.    Sigha Durbar, Parliament Building, Supreme Court , all public properties that were not significant monuments but also held importance in history were burned along with all its documents . NO leader has come forward to lead , neither from Gen Z or Balen or Rabi or Harka or even Army. Everyone seems to be in a game of wait and watch and let the anarchy unfold.   This protest has already diverted far from its agenda, will not be surprised if violence continues tomorrow|||https://preview.redd.it/6f6oyj3qi5of1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=176470516eb46992ba47132d9c55fa6eff12766d|||Idk man j bhayeni naramro ta lagne raixa|||Sorry.

I am just a sincere, hardworking youth who remained silent because too many opinions create a ruckus. That's what I believed till September 8. When I went to the protest, it was all fine until they started firing. When you're in the battleground, all moralities go out the window. Yet, I did not throw a single stone at anyone and I am proud of that. I remained with the group who were peacefully protesting infront of the army van, I helped people with water to wash their face, tried picking up litters. The main point is I tried being a responsible person. But the moment I saw people being carried to the hospital with their blood spattering the streets, I fucking lost it. In retaliation, my protests became more louder. I came home late at night, tried my best to repost as many information I could. At one point, I felt like people should burn down the entire ministry down, all these nepo-babies should be brought to the streets to teach their parents how it feels to kill someone's child. I was furious, the word being an understatement. But seeing this people getting mob justice was what I never wanted. They don't deserve the least of anyone's sympathies, but we still have humanity in our hearts. That's what differs us from them.  I'm trying my best to control the narrative of why the protests happened, so that the opportunistic Indians, Chinese and the entire West may not take undue advantage of us.

            "subreddit": "NepalSocial",
            "heading": "The Shrinkhala Khatiwada I knew at Harvard",
            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada’s classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.   We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking–much to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in  Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate - the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala’s approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.   Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn’t mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‘help’. One time, she even said airily, “I wash my own dishes, you know.” She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala–a beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth–lingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don’t intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‘nepo babies’ who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).   Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It’s a troubling idea to think that despite what’s happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

And a few after she became miss nepal... I can somewhat vouch for the \"I'm busy with this and that... Can you help me with this\" part...

I never liked her naak ma singan adke jasto boli.. And always felt she has a cunning personality that clings over you until she can no more use you for her advantage..  Sisan literally dodged a  bullet.. all thanks to her greed though..|||Wish we had more tea like this on all nepo babies.|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn’t some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was “beneficial” for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake “beauty with brains” narrative. Do you guys remember Niti’s big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let’s not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala’s prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it’s her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let’s be real- Sisan wasn’t perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they’d known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn’t even exist. This just proves it- they weren’t just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can’t just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala’s career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav’s narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What’s the lesson we can learn from here ?  Karma is real af & money can’t give you lifelong happiness, night Redditors|||She didn't get any fucking scholarship from the Nepali government. She was funded by her corrupt father.||| Damn I strictly feel its true|||[deleted]|||I  never cared for her but hated her when she said ‘ we were not well off I had to share room with my house help ‘ and tried to relate to poor people like bro fuck off .|||Thanks for sharing. Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don’t even make sense to begin with. Don’t know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don’t even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It’s so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It’s astounding what the world has come to and it’s deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can’t be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn’t she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It’s better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has. It’s disheartening!|||I’ve realized just how cunning and calculative she really is. Nothing feels natural with her. Every move, every word, every connection seems like part of a bigger calculation. While most people get dragged through the mud on social media, she somehow stays a step ahead. Of all platforms, she was clever enough to pull the LinkedIn card first. That’s not by accident, it’s calculation. She knows the bashing on Tiktok or Instagram doesn’t matter as long as her professional side stays spotless, especially where she might work with people internationally who will never know the side of her life in Nepal that’s been exposed and torn apart ever since the truth came out.  It’s like she’s playing this endless game of Ludo, always climbing the ladder, polishing her image as she goes. But at the same time, you can’t help but feel she’s only ever a roll away from hitting 98 and sliding right back down the snake.|||Correct my if I’m wrong guys, but shrinkhala father was health minister covid time, I heard tyo time ma vaccine ma ra health sector ma eka dum corruption bhaykeo thiyo.

I would assume that she was in her best behavior since she was not in Nepal and probably wanted to portray the best of her image.  My moment of disdain for her came about when her father one of the members of the parliament who were on monthly housing allowance along with the monthly pay. The beinfit is probably meant for the MPs who had to move temprorarily to the capital or who didn't have their own residence. Iirc, they had to manually opt in to get that added housing allowance.

It highlights how Shrinkhala, despite her public image and privileges, was not as collaborative or hardworking in academic settings as she appeared to be. It also touches on the contrast between her image and reality, as well as some concerns about nepotism and entitlement.|||there was a podcast recently, shrinkhala & 3 other women sittng down to talk with, his name may be anil shah.  Shrinkhala said harvard was funded by $ she had saved up from influencer income she had made post miss nepal.that's what she said.  Podcast frm less than 2 wks ago.|||Honestly wanted to hear this from someone at Harvard. In Nepal we already had similar rumors of her student life here 5 year s back but they were ignored.   I have no hate for her.

These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!! And the way she's silent when the country is bleeding says alottt too!!!!!!  And about the Nepal's government scholarship for harvard,this is not true, she is telling an entire different story about harvard scholarsip & how she paid fees there. She said she got 30% scholarship at harvard and the remaining 70% is paid through her brand endorsements money as she is brand ambassador to few company. We didnt buy that story, she tried hardest to sell it though and still fools people with this shitty madeup script about harvard's 30% scholarship & 70% funding through brand endorsement's money lmao. And lately she's being questioned on 50,000USD she got during miss world competition after winning \"beauty with the purpose\" title. Her ex exposed & questioned her in a very shady way and because of him we all knew this new layer of truth and i highly doubt it went on harvard's funding rather than for actual purpose|||One buy Harvard degree with that 50K and another one became a MAKUSE owner .

Its not easy to get in there and even if you do its one of the expensive schools there. Talking about her Nepal bachelor’s days, my friends studied with her in KU in nepal in b. arch, and so many said she cheated on exams (A LOT) just to pass. later she worked for the nepal government and came to US for conferences and presentations 🤡. now she has started her master’s at UT austin, funded by corrupted money. she removed her instagram posts about her prior foreign visits and her recent UT Austin orientation day, and even deactivated her linkedin account.  Now she’s posting on instagram and facebook, after the new PM was appointed, congratulating her and thanking the president grand dad for this revolution. it’s crazy how these unethical people still have the audacity to do all this.

This is valuable for those of us who were shocked and skeptical about her success right from the day she got into limelight. I watched her view on Youtube yesterday and couldn't get past a minute of that video, she is clearly playing victim and trying to play the game.  Nope! she doesn't deserve any chance at all.  The students that I know personally who went to Harvard, MIT and many other prestigious institutions had grit, determination, belief in hard-work, may be little bit of luck but most of all they had \"humility\". They NEVER used their \"Harvard degree\" or Ivy league label to show off. It's those who want to fame and fake pride that put up social media posts to show off their diplomas. Honestly, it was very very clear even before she went to Harvard that she was on the wrong side of fame game.  For the longest time I thought it was a generational difference, since there are many other Harvard students who have publicized themselves in several Youtube videos and they are all Gen Z, and as a Gen Y (Millennial) observing this trend seemed justifiable.  However, Shrinkhala was building a house of cards and the fact that she had the audacity to publicize and put Sambhav Sirohiya in the limelight using Harvard freebies was just laughable a few years ago.  Like you pointed out, the fact that she still has 900K followers is troubling for sure but let's hope those are just her fake followers (some % are bought/in-organic followers, some her closest elite allies like \"Other Miss Nepals/ Businessmen/political affiliates etc. and some her enemies) as they say, **keep your friends close and enemies closer.**|||keep exposing|||People beware of believing everything you read on Reddit.

I mean gross national happiness instead of gross national product. I believe every single country on this planet should take Bhutan as a role model a little bit more. Where else in the world are citizens asked what their main problems are and what they want from the government? And later, citizens are asked how satisfied they were with the government's performance. I know it's a bit naive of me to make such a suggestion from afar, as a sheltered European who is not really familiar with the form of government in Nepal. But it seems to be similar in many, many countries. Those in power often hold office and positions of honor for decades through their family ties. And they are similar in their decadence. The most expensive clothes, the biggest cars, houses, and palaces. Flying to New York for dinner in a private jet, or to Monaco for F1, or around the globe in a yacht as long as a soccer field. And in the media, they try to appear close to the people, to be there for them, to advance the country by investing in infrastructure or new hospitals, etc. But no, a large part of your taxes ends up with the rulers themselves. The rich and powerful acquire more wealth and more power. Money rules the world!

Experience isn’t a flaw, it’s literally the one thing that tells you someone can handle the chaos. You want to hand the country over to a rookie who has no clue how the system works, how politics works, or how to deal with the mess we’re already in? That’s not bravery, that’s stupidity.  We keep repeating the same mistakes because people get blinded by shiny new faces and ignore anyone who actually knows what they’re doing. Experience doesn’t mean someone is corrupt it means they’ve been in the trenches and survived. Throwing it away just to see if a “fresh face” can magically save everything is how you crash a country.  Nepal isn’t a playground. Leadership isn’t about hype, popularity, or being young and “green.” It’s about surviving the chaos, making tough decisions, and knowing where the landmines are. If you think a rookie can do that better than someone experienced, you’re dreaming and the whole nation will pay the price for it.",

Even if they have the intention and will to do so (like many of us want), they do not know how to run a country. I see them as ineffective in running even a municipality (maybe that was because of politics and in-cooperation from party elected ward heads). The thing is they have a lot more to learn and they will, with time.       This situation would not have happened if there were transfer of power to youth in timely manner. Now the rising youth leaders do not have experience because these corrupt politicians did not allow that.      What we need is a system where corruption should now be absolutely dreaded, seeing how corrupt politicians had to run away for thier life. They have to realize that people will not just punish the corrupt polticians, they will also punish whoever was responsible to prevent that.       There now needs to be a collaborative development with young leaders like Balen and experienced people like Sushila. Each and everyone's characters will show with time, for now, we have to seek for stability as soon as possible.|||If we fail to appoint her then external along with internal force will play and bring more chaos to the country.

I truly want Sushila Karki to be prime minister, but according to our constitution it's not possible. And if we ditch our constitution our country is open for invasion from other countries. So, what's the best option it's BALEN. I know that he won't be able to run for prime minister for the next election but it is a risk we have to take. It's already proven that our protest was the result of different politicians 'parties'involvement. So, let's play it safe and try to choose the best result for us. Already many Indian politicians are saying that they are ready to deploy an army if needed. It's not goodwill but an invasion. So it's best we know what we do for the country.  But if it's possible for her to be prime minister without disturbing our constitution then I'm all for it. I also want a good leader who will work for the development of the country.   Indian is already eyeing the district like Lipilekh and Limpadhura. If we take too long to make a responsible decision, they are favourites to win the case.   The country is already in chaos. So we must do our best to calm it down. We protested against corruption and got unexpected results. We are not ready for it. And we don't have time to think about it and make a decision. But, we must make a decision and make it work, isn't it all there is to it ?    It's not that I don't support \"Sushila Karki\" . She has my full support. But if it is disturbing our core rules set by our constitution. I just thought it isn't right. So it's my request all my fellow citizens ( not just gen-z ) to make a right decision.   But my final warning is that if we defy our current constitution ourselves. It will not be a suprise other countries take advantage of it. So we shall make a decision ourselves and take the best route possible. But you've my support to make her ( Sushila Karki) intrim prime minister. It is the best result seeing her experience on political field.   It might have been a bit long for the attention span of gen-z but i just want to say that, neither the constitution nor the national rules be any shorter 😊. So make your protest and blood of many worthy of something great. You've already done impossible without any preparations. So make a few preparations and make our country great again.|||She can be a mentor, why hog all the power for herself at that age??|||Divide and rule going on same old tactics which works everytime.|||This stupid ando Balen supporter haru.

Most importantly, she understands the mechanics and urgency of holding a fair election which is the single most crucial step to stabilizing the country right now.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.   Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.   Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.

Lets first make sure state security, tax, bureaucracy and banking system be under central government. Then every other remaining ministry which needs localization be under province government.    Let there be 1 president directly elected by everyone to handle state security and 7 governor to handle province security, and 1 premier and 7 Magistrate to handle state & province tax, banking and bureaucracy. This way we will have clean central government in which no one can capture state function and minimize corruption.    Since we don't have any functioning people in power, either let lower house to vote for temporary governor and magistrate. No minister, let bureaucracy handle them under strict scrutiny of Governor and Magistrate.    Then start a fresh election, 1 President, 7 Governors, 1 Premier, 7 Magistrates, Lower House or Province Parliament member, then from each Province send 10 representative in Upper House/Federal Parliament 3 voted by Lower House/Province Parliament, 5 directly elected in Upper House and 2 votes each from Province Governor and Province Magistrate. Let the bill for Upper House be registered by directly elected member of Upper House. Upper house will vote for foreign minister, ambassadors and diplomats.   For now, either make Mayor and Deputy Mayor of each capital of Province to be interim Governor and Magistrate to bring law and order in state-province security and function. After election they will go back to be Mayor and Deputy Mayor.     Why all this?

He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both.

She was the one who was always obsessed with youths and Gen z yet she never explained to them the dangers of protest and what it would lead to. I'm not sitting here believing he did not felt that there would external forces in this riots.   2. She is the one who has been abroad for so long and has so many foreign connections and relations that even if she  doesn't want interference, there will be far more foreign interference with her as a leader.  We can not deny that .   3. Sumana did absolutely nothing as a health minister apart from stunts. Ministers are supposed to amend laws and execute them. could have done so much more .   4. He is RSP . Haven't issued anything about Ravi being released from prison by their goons.   5. She most probably planned this Gen z nonsense knowing well that it would cause this .|||Since no one knew who to send as a Gen Z representative, I chose to highlight a woman and a man who reflected the majority’s demands. BTW, Gen Z doesn’t just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didn’t exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who weren’t even present for the protests claim we don’t know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldn’t even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, ‘We have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server you’re all listening to is just for public discussion’. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal. Now that it’s been confirmed everywhere and with Balen posting that the Gen Z’s choice former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Sushila Karki is the right choice for interim prime minister of Nepal, we look forward to what comes next.|||https://new-nepal-voting.vercel.app/  Vote here or suggest names I can add|||For interim formation CJ Sushila Karki would be the perfect choice.

The world doesn’t run on kindness. It runs on power, survival, and who’s willing to fight or cheat to stay alive. Sitting there whining online, hoping people will listen, makes you irrelevant.

Nothing was going to change if things didn’t go south. Personally, I didn’t see the government making any changes with a peaceful protest. Even when we look at history of the world, majority of peaceful protest start peaceful and end violently. No entity in power ever gives it up easily.  Change was what we asked for and change is what we are getting. Not exactly the way we wanted things to go but seems clear from the comments that we all knew, in the back of our minds, it was never going to be a straight road to Rome.

My soul hurts to see violence, arson, anarchy, and the loot and burning of our national properties. We, Gen-Z, seem to have won, yet feel lost. Hope feels lost. Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? I’ve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we can’t let our nation fail.** We can’t let our nation burn. We can’t let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**     **1) We lay down our weapons.**   We came in peace, we protested in peace, and we’ve always wanted peace. We shall end this in peace. Be it known that anybody inciting violence isn’t part of our movement.     **2) We extend love.**   Love towards our brothers and sisters, love towards our nation, love towards our neighbours, our society, and the opposing side. The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.     **3) We wear white.**   White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that we’ve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.     **4) We have hope.**   Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.     Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.     Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.     Sincerely,   Pantji, a Gen-Z |||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Why not sagar Dhakal?|||Yesss|||Just promote it in your social media handle|||K bhairacha yarr discord ma pm choose bhairacha|||Ahile non political manxe thik huncha...her or Dr सन्दुक Ruit.

The president on her cabinet's recommendation dissolves the house of Representatives, 5. Her cabinet carries forward the corruption investigation and reconstruction. 6. The elections will be declared immediately. 7. The new parliament decides the constitutional amendments. (directly elected prime minister etc. and others ) 8.

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen. When the police and the army refused to shoot, the old order was already finished.__  **I am not a political scientist, just a hobbyist, I may be wrong.**|||High possibility OF THISSS|||Maybe but not entirely garnu bela tod fod garyeu parliament jalayeu manxe jalayo ani accountability line bela ma aru lai dosh,Kati economical crisis hunxa aba|||Prachanda and men who are into dopamine shits|||No|||Him or Gyanendra.

Rather than looking outwards to pin 📌 the chaos, it's important that we self reflect. This movement was started to hold those who've wronged our nation accountable but if we ourselves don't hold us accountable for yesterday's actions then we've lost the cause.  I beg that we don't dilute the blood spent in the last 48 years to any conspiracy.  जे भयो, गलत भयो । हामीले हिजोको घटनाक्रबाट आम नेपाली नागरिकको मनस्थिति भुज्यौं, हामीमा अझै पनि सुझबुझ छैन भनेर प्रमाणित गर्यौ।  तर अब के गर्ने भन्ने प्रश्न महत्पूर्ण छ - अब को छलफल त्यसमा हुनु पर्छ जस्तो लाग्छ।  We need law and order to end this chaos otherwise opportunists will prevail.

Built in 1908, it has stood as a symbol of our sovereignty, democracy, and national identity. For generations, it has been the place where decisions shaping our country’s future were made. Its grand architecture and historical importance make it a true pride of Nepal.The news of Singha Durbar burning yesterday is more than just the loss of a structure it feels like the loss of a piece of our soul. This tragedy is a blow to our heritage, to our economy, and to our sense of unity as a nation. The damage cannot be measured only in money, but also in the irreplaceable cultural and historical value that has been destroyed.  I feel deeply saddened by this loss. Singha Durbar was more than walls and pillars it was a living monument of Nepal’s journey, struggles, and achievements. Watching it go up in flames is heartbreaking for every Nepali who loves their country.",

One for the 165 candidates who are elected directly (first-past-the-post), other for the party. The votes that party gets determine the remaining 110 members via proportional representation.  so aba either we need new political parties to replace the existing ones by Falgun 21, or we have to vote for the same parties again. This is more complicated because Nepal is not just Kathmandu. The political players which we have termed jholey will be active outside Kathmandu.   So if we need the change in constitution, we have to be more careful. The mandates of the movement are more at risk now than before.",

But that doesn't mean I have direct ties with them. JHOLEY and BHEDA is a noun that defines people who blindly believe in a person or a political party.      Talking about myself, I am already 36, a father and I am thinking of raising my family here in Nepal. I was totally against going abroad as a student when there was trend to do so. But the political system was never stable here. However, This current GenZ revolution happened against corruption. We indeed got a good progress against these corrupt leaders. But things turned out to be different and here is my roller coaster of emotions. Please let me know if you can relate to this.  Day 0: Social Media Ban - Mixed feelings. Hopeful that social medias will proceed further with registration.  Day 1: GenZ revolution and killing - Lots of anger. Disappointment and discontent.  Day 2: Revolution, excited and happy till 4 PM, until we destroyed the party system. Once the public started destroying Singha Durbar, I came to realize what I had done. I started a fire that I can't extinguish.  Day 3: Realization of the revolution being hijacked. We were just against corruption, regime change was not our motto. The revolution gradually turned into a COLOR REVOLUTION.  Day 4: Worried about who will lead the country. Started mentally supporting Balen/Rabi or any young leader. Furious, since the army asked GenZ to come up with a leader. Finally Hami Nepal, some guys funded by Deep state along with Sanduk Ruit and Swarnim Wagle came into light. They started talking about regime change and Constitution change. They said they directly want to select Zelensky as their prime minister.   Day 5: Much more disappointed as some kids who are aiming to go abroad for future study is electing prime minister through Discord. Sushila Karki elected as PM. Which is some sort of relief. I feared a autocrat.  Day 6 - Day 7: China is yet to acknowledge PM Sushila Karki. China is suspecting foul play as KP Oli had been to SCO and all of this happened just after that.      Now I am very much in distress. I feel that, Nepal is Ukraine. Balen is the new Zelensky and China is the new Russia. I dont want to think negatively but the situation ahead seems to be very dark and we will have to take steps cautiously. There are a lot of hatred here and Social medias are fueling it. None of the GenZ were born during the writing of the constitution. There were lots of revolution that was endured by current revolution Maoist Revolution, Madesh Revolution etc. But now it seems everything has gone to waste and there is no constitution here in the country. Is this PTSD?|||Nepal, you are dealing with dangerous, insecure, violent crybullies who don't care about reasons and motives because they'll just come up with fake news and use that is their motive.

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not “revolution,” it’s not “justice,” and it sure as hell isn’t “the voice of the people.” It’s mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn’t make you brave—it makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that—surrounded by a wave of so-called “youths” who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let’s not sugarcoat it—the so-called Gen Z “warriors” hiding in the mob weren’t heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country’s social fabric. He still can’t step foot in certain countries because he’s internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he’s propped up as a “leader.”  Let’s be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn’t an accident—it was a setup. While Deuba’s family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don’t get it twisted—those sharpshooters in the crowd weren’t just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres—former insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let’s stop pretending this was “the people rising up.” It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist—the one who drowned this nation in blood—walks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don’t for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn’t that Deuba suffered humiliation—the real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn’t a flower; he’s a weed choking the soil of Nepal’s democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too naïve to realize they’re being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||CIA & India Agents involved in chaos!

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4. Retirement age and term limits: This is a must, we need a clear retirement age for the public positions just like other jobs.     These sort of things are fundamental of any country, without getting the fundamentals right we cannot expect our country to do better. We have a chance to make things better, lets take this chance.|||also i think! what lessons can be learned from Bangladesh last year?|||Garni nai ho vani presidency system lyauni.

Constitutional legitimacy + protester acceptance = only viable option.  # 2. PROTESTER LEADERSHIP PIVOT  Gen Z groups must **immediately shift messaging**:  * \"Our revolution is being hijacked\" * \"Military rule = permanent corruption\" * **Name specific civilian demands**: New constitution, elections in 1 year  # 3. ARMY FACE-SAVING EXIT  New interim government must **publicly thank Army Chief Sigdel** for \"preserving democracy\" and **offer ceremonial role** in transition (advisory only, no executive power).  # 4. EMERGENCY UNITY GOVERNMENT  * Sumana Shrestha as PM * Balen Shah as Deputy PM * **3 Gen Z representatives** in cabinet * **Clear 12-month timeline** to new elections  # 5. INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION BLITZ  India, China, UN must **immediately recognize** any civilian arrangement. Every hour of delay gives military justification for intervention.  **THE WINDOW IS 6-8 HOURS MAX**. After that, the army's 10 PM ultimatum becomes permanent control.  **Key insight**: Don't fight the chaos - channel it into civilian transition before military \"restores order\" permanently.  **Act NOW or lose democracy for decades.**|||Is birgunj safe to visit today?

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

Congratulations to all and Thank you to Nepal Army|||He should be in social book|||I believe work is not done yet. Giddhe najar laaune haru dherai chan ajhai. Election is next big challenge. People should remain vigilant, because power vacuums can attract opportunists and old interests looking for a way back. Sushila Karki’s reputation for integrity is promising, but all eyes must stay on the process ahead—the appointments, the investigations she has promised, and the preparations for free and fair elections.  If we relax now, those who thrive on chaos and corruption will try to regain ground. Vigilance, regular citizen oversight, and strong pressure for transparency are needed at every step. The sacrifices made in this movement must be honored by making sure accountability and reform actually reach every corner of the new system.    This is our chance to set a new standard in Nepali politics—let’s not waste it for a second.|||Huge Respect with how they handled the situation while maintaining peace.

But are we seriously going to ignore the fact that the upper echelons of the army are also as corrupt as Oli, Deuba and Prachanda? They embezzle a lot of funds that are allocated for the army!

I know that indian media is misreporting the revolution as silly protests to reinstate scrapy social media and belittle the ambition of GenZ. Media wants the status quo in India forever. They belittled the Bangladesh protests similarly and painted it as Muslims vs Hindus in Bangladesh. They paint a high opinion of the fugitive Shaik Hasina but curse Nobel laureate Mohammed Yunus. Indian media is the judge, jury and executioner of all the happenings in Nepal, Bangladesh, Srilanka and Pakistan. According to them, India is Ramarajya but others were Raavan rajya. India has become a dead democracy in the past decade. We have no jobs, extremely costly education and no health. We are just scrapping by but nothing to show as the media paints cooked up Indian GDP. Baba's have become politicians, industrialists and millionaires. Politicians just encourage the industry of religion. Their children reap the benefits and others' children subsist on rationed rice.

A shift to a fully directly elected system for every seat would ensure greater accountability and public representation. 2. **Establish a Directly Elected Executive Head:** Instead of the parliament choosing the Prime Minister, the call is for a directly elected President or Prime Minister with full executive powers.

It’s tragic, because they also have families back home and face the same struggles as the rest of us. They should be victims of this system too, yet they show little compassion or critical thought about what’s happening around them. Why are there protests in the first place? I refuse to believe they're blind to people's frustration and the direction the country is heading.  I still remember when we joined a protest 14–15 years ago. The police confronted us aggressively, and as kids we were too confused to react. Fortunately, we just stood there processing and visibly confused, and they left — but I still shudder to think, *what if our reaction had been different?* Today’s young protestors are in the same position, pure in their intentions, simply voicing frustration without wanting harm.  And honestly, credit must go to these protestors. They know exactly what they are standing for, unlike us back then who needed adults to organise us. I don’t see how demonstrations could be any more peaceful than they already are — especially when the very leaders being protested against have blood on their hands from before this generation was even born.|||Yo bhatey haru kahi gayera sitcha holani|||randi baan machikne haru|||I mean this tracks, they only like when you're corrupt|||Its not andolan anymore its war|||We want death or at lease exile of KP Oli and other taukes.|||Randi haruko photo, name, address patta lagau.|||shamelss dogs of government|||Machikne radi harlai lakhetdai marnaparne|||Thuiyaa police vanauda haruuu|||you radiko ban harulai agolauno man xa|||ma sanga pani ganhune bhaye, kassam mardinthe radieekko ban|||Mathi bata aako order re ????

Honestly speaking they are playing with young people’s emotions and future… they are burning our country and feeling the warmth… and we are happy at the time being because youth are so blinded by this madness they don’t see right from wrong!! Just look at the way they incite violence like it’s nothing!! Talking about burning down houses and people is nothing!! This is not a right foundation.

It’s simple.|||Disclaimer: I am not a Balen supporter or cultist.  This post is conflicting for me. But, the post is characterizing the man based on:  1. What the man didn’t do or didn’t say. 2. What people expected him to do.  The man himself has said enough in his posts.   It’s what, he DIDN’T do that impresses me the most about him. Saying “No” is harder than saying “Yes”, when everyone wanted him to say “Yes”.  (Think about this.)  He put out only a couple of posts, which I think served as guide posts during the revolution.   1. He was the first widely known public figure (that I know) who defined who Gen Z was and gave his support to the protest. 2. When the tempo rose, he clarified that Gen Z should lead, he accepted Sushila even when all of his cultists were going crazy about making him the interim PM.  Removing himself from the picture, brought focus back on the revolution and the task ahead, rather than turn the confusion situation, even more confusing with a popularity contest as a side gig.   There is a lot of things to think about and I think in time we can all make sense of it all.   That’s my two paisa about him.|||Leading KTM municipality vs leading the nation are totally different. The followers of Balen urging and rushing him to lead 'right now' and come out by 2PM are the same people who will criticize him within one year if he were to be them PM someday. They don't have patience and want to see changes immediately.  Personally, I would like to see him running in the upcoming election as deputy/vice roles first and not immediate PM role...assuming how parties will be formed and if there are any good lead independent candidate who will run with him. He's one of those few worthy to be PM but this is not his peak yet. He just became a mayor like 3 years ago and he still has a lot to show to the general public. If and when he wins to the election, it will be his peak and he has high chances of being a two term PM...assuming two term limit will be in place hopefully. Time will tell.|||GenZ aren't immune to celeb worship culture.|||Hami Nepal has already stated it was part of a plan and they want balen for 5 years.

Yes it is definitely an opportunistic behaviour by balen. But how is this behaviour wrong and how is taking over PM position now and securing interim govt now and not taking part in politics for next 5 years do any good to the country.    He is practicing patience to achieve the goal he desires and what people actually wants from a young leader like him. Look throughout the history of world politics, paitence has always been the key factor to shape the world politics.|||Having trusted by many even me,In the moment of national threat, he could do nothing. That’s the reason I doubt him.  i think he is not completely responsible for being the Prime Minister. Sure, he is a great person. He’s doing such a great thing in the valley, but being a Prime Minister is very responsible post, his way up talking to seniors, saying I will put fire to SinghaDurbar, I will bury everyone if you’re in tudinkhel, getting carried away by emotions, being Prime Minister means you should not be carried away by any emotions and none of the factors should affect your judgment which you believe to be true and is lawful, Hopefully he will make such changes and we can finally see him in the top, as much as I want him to be the Prime Minister I do think he is inexperienced and immature in this field,|||We are so far behind that criticizing political leader sounds like a hater. We are not even to the point where we could say “This person is bad/clueless , country isn’t safe with them”. For the past decade, the corrupted 3 have been playing nothing but tato aloo with us so its natural to be sticking nail to current situation. Give it some time and our voices will get echoed.|||If there’s one thing old political leaders never learned, it was how to handle criticism. The moment anyone spoke up, they tried to shut it down and let’s not even start on the behavior of their hardcore supporters(jholey as we call them).  Even leaders like Balen need to address this with their own supporters, as do all the new representatives entering the upcoming elections. They must say publicly that they welcome criticism, will reflect on it, and use it as a tool for improvement. Leaders should make it clear to their base: don’t bully or silence people for simply asking questions or raising concerns. Do not perform character assassination against someone just for criticizing. After all, in a democracy, freedom of speech is our right.  At the same time, we the general public also carry responsibility. We need to recognize the difference between constructive criticism and defamation. What we must not do is fall for propaganda, spread rumors, or engage in baseless character assassination.  And if we realize that our criticism or questioning was wrong, we should have the courage to apologize in the same way we raised the question. After all, apologizing will never make you small. It’s just a simple five letter word: “Sorry.” A word that can and should be spoken from both sides.|||Just because you’re against the system, doesn’t make you Balen-Supporters. Balen has no experience. Balen should wait and gain some experience. Criticism is a backbone of democracy and one must welcome it.|||EXACTLY. They lack this ability to critically analyse any action of any leader. Like no one is perfect and no one is a good. Let's be honest. Let's criticize people for their actions. People should be held accountable for their actions. Most importantly, leaders who run our nation. If we don't point out their wrongdoings, will they ever stop? Nepalese have such a bheda mindset, istg. Let's be more aware and let's know how to discern leaders and their actions.   By criticizing these leaders, we aren't hating on them. We're trying to bring awareness so that they won't repeat the same thing again and can do things better for the country.|||They need to be aware party KO jhole become jhole because they were andabhakt of party leader ( just like they are blind follower of balen rn)|||I think holding politicians accountable is crucial. I hope people realize we don’t need  more devotees and followers. We need critical, educated thinkers. Support the good work, appreciate your favorite leader but don’t forget to question often.

I see people thanking Balen for this movement and saying he was the reason this movement happened and succeeded and all after Sushila Karki became interim PM, and this made me very sad for actual people who started the movement and also faced the consequences and this was even more big realization for me for how blind youth and supporters these days are and this concerns me even more for future|||This. This is what I’ve been saying for some time. Like the post says, I’ve also been labeled as a party ko jhole and what not. Even here in this sub, people have called me jhole lol just because I questioned him.  I am a Balen supporter. I supported him and did my part by sharing about his campaign on social media and making everyone aware about it. And I was super happy when he won, I still am. But I’ve been criticizing him on various points that I find valid. The top one is communication.  During the election, he constantly criticized Bidya Sundar (the previous mayor) for not communicating publicly. He even said that once he became mayor, he wouldn’t be like that and would stay in constant touch. He proposed starting a ‘Mayor with the Public’ TV program and even set aside a budget for it, but nothing has happened. He hasn’t given a single interview.  And then come his jhole supporters who always argue with the same line: ‘Pailai kei chaieko ho.’ With that logic, we should never question anyone. Just look at how Balen has become now, he just posts one-sided, no-context Facebook statuses and nothing else.|||Balen is a hypocrite in my opinion, like he encouraged the protest and even promised to provide a safe and secure environment for the protest but when things turned south he vanished like horn from a donkeys head|||Finally someone spoke about this, belun has literally become a god complex among some people out there, which is kinda concerning, the only time he speaks is to not let his adhabhatka interfere in every other stuff out there.

In Nepal, many people tend to follow leaders without much critical thought, even when those leaders don’t necessarily act in their favor. Unfortunately, this habit seems to persist across generations. If the younger generation continues with the same mindset, there’s a real risk that the country could end up facing the same challenges in the future that we are experiencing today.|||You can make your own assumptions and narratives. If Balen had taken the post of PM, you would have said that he is opportunistic, that he enraged protestors just to get the position. I saw somewhere on Facebook, even before Balen’s official post on sushila karki that balen played dirty game for the sake of pm position. As far as I know, Balen is a farsighted person.

He is still better than most of the people there. Whatever he does, he has never done anything wrong. Stop pretending to be so-called critics for useless reasons. What is your academic background, and what makes you think that way? Have you ever felt the difference between past and present Kathmandu? I have a friend from the core area of Kathmandu, do you know what his opinion about Balen Shah is? No!  Even Harka Sampang is a very good person. Moreover, Sagar Dhakal’s brother has been working actively to eradicate the dictatorship of these political parties. Maybe your parents are bootlicking those rotten political parties, so you only see what Balen has never done and will never do. Just because he supported the movement does not mean he said he wants to become prime minister. You must understand that he posts only a few things because his words are weapons. One word from him has many consequences in such a movement. He is very clever and very wise; unlike Harka Sampang, though I like Harka as a person.

If Balen had come out saying he’s ready to lead, a lot of people would’ve jumped in claiming he planned the whole movement and just used Gen Z for his own benefit. That’s probably why in his statements, he keeps stressing that this is Gen Z’s movement and that the government will be formed by them. imo, staying out of it was the smartest move he could have made.  I’m all for questioning and criticizing leaders. I agree that its a problem if you dont want to do it.

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):** The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):** If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):** If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):** If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

This has been ongoing for more than two decades. Behind the few visible figures, there are countless others who have either assisted them or benefitted through their association—ranging from major brands in Nepal to traders. For example, Sher Bahadur Deuba’s son and his sanitary pad importing company stand as an illustration.  They have institutionalized corruption by appointing foreign ambassadors based on party loyalty and financial gains, extending even to the transfer of bureaucrats to preferred locations in exchange for bribes and other undue benefits. The problem is not limited to the political system alone; bureaucrats, too, require checks and balances. A mechanism must be established to regulate the power of bureaucrats over politicians. Since bureaucrats are permanent stakeholders, their influence is even greater. One effective way to mitigate this is to appoint domain experts as ministers—for instance, a professional civil engineer as a minister cannot be misled about the cost estimates of a construction project.  There remains much to be done. Moreover, these political parties will attempt to form alliances before elections, bringing forward the same candidates and restoring the same exploitative system. Therefore, the first and most meaningful reform must be a change in the electoral process, with the inclusion of a “NOTA” (None of the Above) option.  Further accountability can be ensured by eliminating political appointments to certain positions. At present, even temporary (karar) appointments are made based on party affiliation rather than merit. As a result, even highly qualified experts are compelled to seek political approval. The recent appointments of Vice-Chancellors at B.P. Koirala Institute in Dharan and Gangalal Hospital are prime examples.  In addition to these issues, several other structural flaws persist. What we urgently require is a comprehensive systemic reform|||Gen Z laid them in the grave, and now they're shoveling the dirt themselves.|||# How to make Gen Z movement bullet proof ?

He pushed Nepal towards democracy and republicanism.   He gave poor villagers and lower-caste groups a voice in national politics.   He increased women’s participation in politics and society, with many ex-fighters now active in leadership roles.   In western hills and Madhesh, state institutions were weak or absent. Villagers depended on landlords for loans, justice, and protection, which kept exploitation unchallenged (Kamaiya, Haruwa-Charuwa, Haliya systems). His movement gave villagers confidence to defy landlords for the first time.

Every politicians are coming back like it was never happened ani haami ? Haami pani kei na kei !!|||What happened to the Deuba family wasn’t just unfair—it was an orchestrated humiliation carried out in the most cowardly way possible. Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not “revolution,” it’s not “justice,” and it sure as hell isn’t “the voice of the people.” It’s mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn’t make you brave—it makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that—surrounded by a wave of so-called “youths” who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let’s not sugarcoat it—the so-called Gen Z “warriors” hiding in the mob weren’t heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country’s social fabric. He still can’t step foot in certain countries because he’s internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he’s propped up as a “leader.”  Let’s be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn’t an accident—it was a setup. While Deuba’s family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don’t get it twisted—those sharpshooters in the crowd weren’t just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres—former insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let’s stop pretending this was “the people rising up.” It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist—the one who drowned this nation in blood—walks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don’t for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn’t that Deuba suffered humiliation—the real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn’t a flower; he’s a weed choking the soil of Nepal’s democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too naïve to realize they’re being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||Prachanda and Baburam are India's puppet. Baburam was trained in India's JNU which wiped out more than 10% of our population while Madhessi bihari and Marwadi have exponentially grown.

People watched her speech where she said stuff like, “What’s my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?”  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still don’t have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we don’t have the right connections.  We don’t get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, it’s still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? That’s probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  We’re out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor people’s kids not boil?  On top of that, there’s already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent. Because this have  been suppressed for so long, and now the mindset is like — “If we can’t reach anywhere through the system, then we might as well destroy it.”  And even if some third party tries to trigger people, the truth is, it was already there deep down in their subconscious. This is just it coming out. Right now it feels new, but honestly, it was bound to happen sooner or later.|||No Shit Sherlock (You guys got  manipulated into doing the wrong thing) 😔|||Sherey ko choro lai dhulai diye ki nai ?|||Each Hilton hotel employees 400+ Nepalese nationals 😂 what about the people that lost their jobs?|||https://preview.redd.it/muoumzxh6eof1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63da78ae8b2a74c1f669dc95f01e062ff9e299b0|||https://preview.redd.it/rjynwvrk6eof1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04a5f8cbe1243c2dfca73c29dea57aa5425243bf|||We could’ve turned this into Hospital but Nope|||This is an absolutely great work revolution.|||Aur Karo money money wali gand masti|||if you make a good system and government now that‘s important!

His rough almost mobster-like style may be off-putting to some but in a city like Dharan which is home to hotheaded Kirati / Hill Janajati majority that kind of toughness isn’t just useful, it’s necessary.  That said, he is neither qualified nor capable enough to be considered an ‘ideal’ Prime Minister.

If a person has done good work, both of them will be appreciated hands down. You have to look at the picture from both sides. Secondly, please ask your senior citizens or elders from a different generation. They have seen history and faced the consequences. The real issue is bringing change in the constitution, i.e., a representative should not be above a certain age and should be allowed to seek votes only for one term. Take that in writing from the concerned representative, live, and show it to the world clearly. Also, please do not discriminate by saying someone is from the “Stone Age,” as such remarks can hurt the sentiments of people who are not from cities.|||Yes, I don't know what to.

(**Bank run** is a situation where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a bank simultaneously, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or financial stability. This can lead to liquidity problems for the bank, as it may not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands. Bank runs can create a cycle of panic, potentially leading to the bank's failure.)  The real pain starts after the protests have calmed. Economic crash is certain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh both went through it. Stock market/real estate crash, inflation and what not.  Whoever takes charge next, likely Balen, will need to address the pointless 'Greater Nepal' rhetoric and become a moderate on this issue. Thanks to Trump, India-China relationship is stable for the first time in ages. The only way Nepal has a future is pledge allegiance to both neighbour's.  Bangladesh under Yunus has been a pain in the ass for India. Nepal cannot make the same mistake. Any wrong steps and a free floating Nepali rupee against the dollar would go from 140 now to 25,000 like similar countries in our GDP range. Probably worse since our economy is in much worse shape.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.   Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.   Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||How credible is this info?|||Use bitchat for conversation.

            "comments": "We are living in a moment where anger is boiling over. People are tired of corruption, censorship, and being silenced. Many of us are ready to take to the streets on Sept 8. But before we move forward, we must stop and think carefully.  History has shown us what happens when we rush in without preparation. In Bangladesh last year, in Sri Lanka not long ago, ordinary people gave their lives while corrupt leaders fled the country with protection and comfort. Their deaths were forgotten within weeks, while the guilty walked free. If we are not careful, Nepal risks becoming the next chapter in that same tragic story.  That is why this movement must be different. We cannot afford to be reckless. We must protect our people, keep our voices peaceful, and make sure the world is watching every step so that accountability cannot be erased.  Here is what we need to do before Sept 8:  * Get international human rights groups, UN observers, and peace monitors involved beforehand so there are eyes on the ground. * Publish clear and peaceful agendas so nobody can label us as rioters or mobs. * Document everything with photos, videos, and testimonies. Every arrest and every injury must be recorded and shared. * Avoid following local leaders who are affiliated with political parties. Big parties will try to infiltrate, hijack, and twist this movement for their own gain. * Know who is truly standing beside you. Trust matters because infiltrators can turn peaceful protests into chaos.  This movement is about dignity, rights, and accountability. It is not about violence. It is not about revenge. If we lose focus, if we let anger replace strategy, then we risk repeating the same cycle where the powerful walk free and ordinary people pay with their lives.  Nepal deserves better. The world must see us not as mobs, but as citizens united for freedom and justice. If we do this right, our voices will be impossible to silence. If we do this wrong, we risk being forgotten like so many before us.  Stay safe. Stay peaceful. Stay smart.",

Emails: grad@uci.edu reportfraudtips@uscis.dhs.gov Subject: Urgent Concern Regarding Sweta Rijal’s Status Dear Graduate Office/USCIS/ICE, I am writing about Sweta Rijal, a political science student at your university. She is the daughter of Chabi Rijal, a communist leader and Chief District Officer in Nepal, who recently ordered a shoot-on-sight against youth peacefully protesting corruption in Nepal. His orders have killed over 18 innocent people, injured more than 100 students, and more deaths are expected. This is pure fascism and a gross misuse of power. Young people in a peaceful protest were shot dead, which is totally unacceptable. While our brothers and sisters die in Nepal, Sweta Rijal has no right to study in the US with money from corruption. Her entire funding is from the money from corruption. The US, as a democratic country and a voice for the UN, stands for freedom and justice. Allowing her to stay contradicts everything the US represents. We are struggling to fight this battle in Nepal, and she must be held accountable. I urge you to investigate her visa and take necessary action to send her back to Nepal. Regards, Concerned Citizen from Nepal",

Even the people who are getting inspired and speaking in favour of your protest are getting back lash (and recently a person has been charged under the law by the police)because this protest turned violent but ik that wasn't intended. We can argue about the pros and cons but the fact that you stood up against the system is a big achievement and inspiration. I wish you great luck guys and hope you find a better system than the one you fought against and draw a milestone for us.

This isn't time for fighting.   And about destroying properties, there are theories that the protest were hijacked by other political parties. Like wise, about governments offices, they wanted to destroy the proofs of corruptions. And public building and properties was collateral damages for those fake protesters to look it real.

I am just a sincere, hardworking youth who remained silent because too many opinions create a ruckus. That's what I believed till September 8. When I went to the protest, it was all fine until they started firing. When you're in the battleground, all moralities go out the window. Yet, I did not throw a single stone at anyone and I am proud of that. I remained with the group who were peacefully protesting infront of the army van, I helped people with water to wash their face, tried picking up litters. The main point is I tried being a responsible person. But the moment I saw people being carried to the hospital with their blood spattering the streets, I fucking lost it. In retaliation, my protests became more louder. I came home late at night, tried my best to repost as many information I could. At one point, I felt like people should burn down the entire ministry down, all these nepo-babies should be brought to the streets to teach their parents how it feels to kill someone's child. I was furious, the word being an understatement. But seeing this people getting mob justice was what I never wanted. They don't deserve the least of anyone's sympathies, but we still have humanity in our hearts. That's what differs us from them.  I'm trying my best to control the narrative of why the protests happened, so that the opportunistic Indians, Chinese and the entire West may not take undue advantage of us.

            "subreddit": "NepalSocial",
            "heading": "The Shrinkhala Khatiwada I knew at Harvard",
            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada’s classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.   We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking–much to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in  Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate - the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala’s approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.   Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn’t mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‘help’. One time, she even said airily, “I wash my own dishes, you know.” She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala–a beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth–lingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don’t intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‘nepo babies’ who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).   Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It’s a troubling idea to think that despite what’s happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

And a few after she became miss nepal... I can somewhat vouch for the \"I'm busy with this and that... Can you help me with this\" part...

I never liked her naak ma singan adke jasto boli.. And always felt she has a cunning personality that clings over you until she can no more use you for her advantage..  Sisan literally dodged a  bullet.. all thanks to her greed though..|||Wish we had more tea like this on all nepo babies.|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn’t some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was “beneficial” for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake “beauty with brains” narrative. Do you guys remember Niti’s big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let’s not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala’s prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it’s her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let’s be real- Sisan wasn’t perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they’d known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn’t even exist. This just proves it- they weren’t just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can’t just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala’s career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav’s narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What’s the lesson we can learn from here ?  Karma is real af & money can’t give you lifelong happiness, night Redditors|||She didn't get any fucking scholarship from the Nepali government. She was funded by her corrupt father.||| Damn I strictly feel its true|||[deleted]|||I  never cared for her but hated her when she said ‘ we were not well off I had to share room with my house help ‘ and tried to relate to poor people like bro fuck off .|||Thanks for sharing. Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don’t even make sense to begin with. Don’t know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don’t even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It’s so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It’s astounding what the world has come to and it’s deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can’t be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn’t she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It’s better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has. It’s disheartening!|||I’ve realized just how cunning and calculative she really is. Nothing feels natural with her. Every move, every word, every connection seems like part of a bigger calculation. While most people get dragged through the mud on social media, she somehow stays a step ahead. Of all platforms, she was clever enough to pull the LinkedIn card first. That’s not by accident, it’s calculation. She knows the bashing on Tiktok or Instagram doesn’t matter as long as her professional side stays spotless, especially where she might work with people internationally who will never know the side of her life in Nepal that’s been exposed and torn apart ever since the truth came out.  It’s like she’s playing this endless game of Ludo, always climbing the ladder, polishing her image as she goes. But at the same time, you can’t help but feel she’s only ever a roll away from hitting 98 and sliding right back down the snake.|||Correct my if I’m wrong guys, but shrinkhala father was health minister covid time, I heard tyo time ma vaccine ma ra health sector ma eka dum corruption bhaykeo thiyo.

I would assume that she was in her best behavior since she was not in Nepal and probably wanted to portray the best of her image.  My moment of disdain for her came about when her father one of the members of the parliament who were on monthly housing allowance along with the monthly pay. The beinfit is probably meant for the MPs who had to move temprorarily to the capital or who didn't have their own residence. Iirc, they had to manually opt in to get that added housing allowance. When the news published, her father's reaction was something along the line of \"I didn't know, I was getting it. I am happy to return it.\"  Question for her, how come you dont know the source of wealth and your parent's ethics? I mean I know the answer, I just want to hear her say it.  https://preview.redd.it/z06jr4rj13pf1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8a20b685f7aae22f53a82b2ee284b7d2c72672f  [https://www.cijnepal.org/accommodation-allowance-for-landlord-lawmakers](https://www.cijnepal.org/accommodation-allowance-for-landlord-lawmakers)|||What do you expect from a pageant queen?

It highlights how Shrinkhala, despite her public image and privileges, was not as collaborative or hardworking in academic settings as she appeared to be. It also touches on the contrast between her image and reality, as well as some concerns about nepotism and entitlement.|||there was a podcast recently, shrinkhala & 3 other women sittng down to talk with, his name may be anil shah.

I have no hate for her.

These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!! And the way she's silent when the country is bleeding says alottt too!!!!!!  And about the Nepal's government scholarship for harvard,this is not true, she is telling an entire different story about harvard scholarsip & how she paid fees there. She said she got 30% scholarship at harvard and the remaining 70% is paid through her brand endorsements money as she is brand ambassador to few company. We didnt buy that story, she tried hardest to sell it though and still fools people with this shitty madeup script about harvard's 30% scholarship & 70% funding through brand endorsement's money lmao. And lately she's being questioned on 50,000USD she got during miss world competition after winning \"beauty with the purpose\" title. Her ex exposed & questioned her in a very shady way and because of him we all knew this new layer of truth and i highly doubt it went on harvard's funding rather than for actual purpose|||One buy Harvard degree with that 50K and another one became a MAKUSE owner .

Its not easy to get in there and even if you do its one of the expensive schools there. Talking about her Nepal bachelor’s days, my friends studied with her in KU in nepal in b. arch, and so many said she cheated on exams (A LOT) just to pass. later she worked for the nepal government and came to US for conferences and presentations 🤡. now she has started her master’s at UT austin, funded by corrupted money. she removed her instagram posts about her prior foreign visits and her recent UT Austin orientation day, and even deactivated her linkedin account.  Now she’s posting on instagram and facebook, after the new PM was appointed, congratulating her and thanking the president grand dad for this revolution. it’s crazy how these unethical people still have the audacity to do all this.

This is valuable for those of us who were shocked and skeptical about her success right from the day she got into limelight. I watched her view on Youtube yesterday and couldn't get past a minute of that video, she is clearly playing victim and trying to play the game.  Nope! she doesn't deserve any chance at all.  The students that I know personally who went to Harvard, MIT and many other prestigious institutions had grit, determination, belief in hard-work, may be little bit of luck but most of all they had \"humility\". They NEVER used their \"Harvard degree\" or Ivy league label to show off. It's those who want to fame and fake pride that put up social media posts to show off their diplomas. Honestly, it was very very clear even before she went to Harvard that she was on the wrong side of fame game.  For the longest time I thought it was a generational difference, since there are many other Harvard students who have publicized themselves in several Youtube videos and they are all Gen Z, and as a Gen Y (Millennial) observing this trend seemed justifiable.  However, Shrinkhala was building a house of cards and the fact that she had the audacity to publicize and put Sambhav Sirohiya in the limelight using Harvard freebies was just laughable a few years ago.  Like you pointed out, the fact that she still has 900K followers is troubling for sure but let's hope those are just her fake followers (some % are bought/in-organic followers, some her closest elite allies like \"Other Miss Nepals/ Businessmen/political affiliates etc. and some her enemies) as they say, **keep your friends close and enemies closer.**|||keep exposing|||People beware of believing everything you read on Reddit.

You say their work has benefited generations “like me” but what about the millions still without quality education, clean water, jobs, or justice? If that legacy was truly built for the people, then why does inequality keep growing? Why is access to opportunity still limited to a select few families like yours?  No one is attacking your elders for their hard work but using that work to claim political or social superiority today is exactly the kind of dynastic thinking that holds progress back. Legacies don’t entitle children to power. Competence, accountability, and public trust do.  You’re not being attacked, you’re being questioned. And if your only answer is to call others “small-minded” and “ungrateful,” then maybe you’re not as prepared to face criticism as you think. Respect is earned in every generation, not inherited like land or a business.  The days of hiding behind the achievements of the past are over. If you want respect for your family, prove it through your own actions, not by silencing criticism or demanding loyalty based on history.|||French revolution Bata sikna paryo kei|||I fwwww it.

I mean gross national happiness instead of gross national product. I believe every single country on this planet should take Bhutan as a role model a little bit more. Where else in the world are citizens asked what their main problems are and what they want from the government? And later, citizens are asked how satisfied they were with the government's performance. I know it's a bit naive of me to make such a suggestion from afar, as a sheltered European who is not really familiar with the form of government in Nepal. But it seems to be similar in many, many countries. Those in power often hold office and positions of honor for decades through their family ties. And they are similar in their decadence. The most expensive clothes, the biggest cars, houses, and palaces. Flying to New York for dinner in a private jet, or to Monaco for F1, or around the globe in a yacht as long as a soccer field. And in the media, they try to appear close to the people, to be there for them, to advance the country by investing in infrastructure or new hospitals, etc. But no, a large part of your taxes ends up with the rulers themselves. The rich and powerful acquire more wealth and more power. Money rules the world!

This is literally just her side of the story. Anyone can sit behind a keyboard, write a long emotional post, and instantly turn public opinion against someone. That doesn’t make it the full truth.  We’ve seen this before — remember the Sandeep Lamichhane case? A girl accused him, media and public went wild, and people treated him as guilty before trial. Later, so many loopholes came out. It’s the same pattern here — society naturally sides with the girl because we have an inbuilt bias that says “the girl must be the victim.” But is that always true? No.  Let’s also not ignore that sometimes girls do play emotional games. They ghost, they manipulate, they test how much a guy will “chase” them — and when he does, suddenly it becomes “stalking.” Where’s the line? Maybe she had past relationships, maybe she’s not telling the full story about her own actions that led to this fallout. Why should we blindly believe only her narrative and not even question what really happened?  And now people are targeting not just him, but also his family. That’s disgusting. Whatever the issue is between two individuals, why should parents, brothers, or sisters be dragged into it? People forget that when you destroy someone online, you destroy their whole family’s dignity too.  Everyone’s commenting with sympathy for her and anger towards him. But let’s be honest — most of that is just because she’s a girl and he’s a guy. If the genders were reversed, would people still believe the story this blindly? I doubt it.  Look, if he’s actually guilty of harassment, the law should punish him. No question about that. But until then, it’s not fair to publicly assassinate someone’s character based on one-sided claims. Social media is not a courtroom, and we shouldn’t let feelings override facts.|||:D|||https://www.facebook.com/share/1JV5hYfP6t/?mibextid=wwXIfr  don’t bully her. Only message her.

Experience isn’t a flaw, it’s literally the one thing that tells you someone can handle the chaos. You want to hand the country over to a rookie who has no clue how the system works, how politics works, or how to deal with the mess we’re already in? That’s not bravery, that’s stupidity.  We keep repeating the same mistakes because people get blinded by shiny new faces and ignore anyone who actually knows what they’re doing. Experience doesn’t mean someone is corrupt it means they’ve been in the trenches and survived. Throwing it away just to see if a “fresh face” can magically save everything is how you crash a country.  Nepal isn’t a playground. Leadership isn’t about hype, popularity, or being young and “green.” It’s about surviving the chaos, making tough decisions, and knowing where the landmines are. If you think a rookie can do that better than someone experienced, you’re dreaming and the whole nation will pay the price for it.",

Balen cannot do that, Harka is very very incapable of that. Etibela we should look for someone who's least politically inclined and has very little tainted personality. Sushila karki is the right choice for many reasons. We have a precedent meaning Supreme court cannot overturn our decision.

Even if they have the intention and will to do so (like many of us want), they do not know how to run a country. I see them as ineffective in running even a municipality (maybe that was because of politics and in-cooperation from party elected ward heads). The thing is they have a lot more to learn and they will, with time.       This situation would not have happened if there were transfer of power to youth in timely manner. Now the rising youth leaders do not have experience because these corrupt politicians did not allow that.      What we need is a system where corruption should now be absolutely dreaded, seeing how corrupt politicians had to run away for thier life. They have to realize that people will not just punish the corrupt polticians, they will also punish whoever was responsible to prevent that.       There now needs to be a collaborative development with young leaders like Balen and experienced people like Sushila.

I truly want Sushila Karki to be prime minister, but according to our constitution it's not possible. And if we ditch our constitution our country is open for invasion from other countries. So, what's the best option it's BALEN. I know that he won't be able to run for prime minister for the next election but it is a risk we have to take. It's already proven that our protest was the result of different politicians 'parties'involvement. So, let's play it safe and try to choose the best result for us. Already many Indian politicians are saying that they are ready to deploy an army if needed. It's not goodwill but an invasion. So it's best we know what we do for the country.  But if it's possible for her to be prime minister without disturbing our constitution then I'm all for it. I also want a good leader who will work for the development of the country.   Indian is already eyeing the district like Lipilekh and Limpadhura. If we take too long to make a responsible decision, they are favourites to win the case.   The country is already in chaos. So we must do our best to calm it down. We protested against corruption and got unexpected results. We are not ready for it. And we don't have time to think about it and make a decision. But, we must make a decision and make it work, isn't it all there is to it ?    It's not that I don't support \"Sushila Karki\" . She has my full support. But if it is disturbing our core rules set by our constitution. I just thought it isn't right. So it's my request all my fellow citizens ( not just gen-z ) to make a right decision.   But my final warning is that if we defy our current constitution ourselves. It will not be a suprise other countries take advantage of it. So we shall make a decision ourselves and take the best route possible. But you've my support to make her ( Sushila Karki) intrim prime minister. It is the best result seeing her experience on political field.   It might have been a bit long for the attention span of gen-z but i just want to say that, neither the constitution nor the national rules be any shorter 😊. So make your protest and blood of many worthy of something great. You've already done impossible without any preparations. So make a few preparations and make our country great again.|||She can be a mentor, why hog all the power for herself at that age??|||Divide and rule going on same old tactics which works everytime.|||This stupid ando Balen supporter haru.

His clothes were torn, his hands trembling his eyes tired. Something inside me made me stop. I gave him a packet of food and a bottle of water. He looked at me for a moment, and then his eyes filled with tears.  He whispered, “Dai malai ta manchhe jasto ko bhav nai diyeko dherai din bhayo\" (Brother, it’s been so long since anyone treated me like a human)  I didn’t know what to say. That one sentence hit me harder than anything in my life. We complain about traffic, money, stress, politics but here was a man who just wanted to feel human again.  When I left, my hands were empty, but my heart was heavy. That day I realized poverty is not only about money. The biggest poverty is being unseen, unloved, and forgotten.  Ratnapark overbridge will never look the same to me again. Today, that beggar gave me more than I gave him. He gave me a reminder: be kind, because sometimes even a small smile can save someone’s broken soul.",

Jalaide|||Yes thus is TRUE LOOK AT MY MOST RECENT POST|||please do this email to UN and OHCHR   To: registry@ohchr.org        info@ihrcworld.org        petitions@ohchr.org   Subject: Urgent Appeal: Violation of Human Rights in Nepal – Police Shooting School Studentsj   Dear United Nations Human Rights Council, I am writing to raise an urgent appeal regarding the grave human rights violations currently occurring in Nepal. Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.   Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.   Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||Jaha Bhetyo tehi thok saley madarchod lai...|||Aaos na india ma ni nepali xan birsyo kya|||Bro timro yo pic use garey haii Tiktok ma vid halchu|||kun desh jala teta bebasta garnu parxa|||yo machikne lai samatna paryo jasari bhaye ni yellai bachne kunai adhikar xaina|||Bhagey ra canada nai ja la, canada ma nee xodnu hudaina.

Lets first make sure state security, tax, bureaucracy and banking system be under central government. Then every other remaining ministry which needs localization be under province government.    Let there be 1 president directly elected by everyone to handle state security and 7 governor to handle province security, and 1 premier and 7 Magistrate to handle state & province tax, banking and bureaucracy. This way we will have clean central government in which no one can capture state function and minimize corruption.    Since we don't have any functioning people in power, either let lower house to vote for temporary governor and magistrate. No minister, let bureaucracy handle them under strict scrutiny of Governor and Magistrate.    Then start a fresh election, 1 President, 7 Governors, 1 Premier, 7 Magistrates, Lower House or Province Parliament member, then from each Province send 10 representative in Upper House/Federal Parliament 3 voted by Lower House/Province Parliament, 5 directly elected in Upper House and 2 votes each from Province Governor and Province Magistrate. Let the bill for Upper House be registered by directly elected member of Upper House. Upper house will vote for foreign minister, ambassadors and diplomats.

I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both.

She is the one who has been abroad for so long and has so many foreign connections and relations that even if she  doesn't want interference, there will be far more foreign interference with her as a leader.

BTW, Gen Z doesn’t just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didn’t exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who weren’t even present for the protests claim we don’t know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldn’t even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, ‘We have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server you’re all listening to is just for public discussion’. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal. Now that it’s been confirmed everywhere and with Balen posting that the Gen Z’s choice former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Sushila Karki is the right choice for interim prime minister of Nepal, we look forward to what comes next.|||https://new-nepal-voting.vercel.app/  Vote here or suggest names I can add|||For interim formation CJ Sushila Karki would be the perfect choice.

Nothing was going to change if things didn’t go south. Personally, I didn’t see the government making any changes with a peaceful protest. Even when we look at history of the world, majority of peaceful protest start peaceful and end violently. No entity in power ever gives it up easily.  Change was what we asked for and change is what we are getting. Not exactly the way we wanted things to go but seems clear from the comments that we all knew, in the back of our minds, it was never going to be a straight road to Rome.  So I believe it’s high time we look ahead and bring the same energy we did to the protests to ensure that we see the change we want to see happen and bring in leaders we believe in. Easier said than done but accountability starts from us now. Let’s not settle for less than what we envision Nepal to be.|||Who are you telling this?

They are hot blooded. They can do anything with teen minds.  Look at your genZ, destroying their own land...  GenZ is a popular word on the internet.  Now whenever you talk about GenZ people will remember this amount of brutalism and rage against their own land own assets.|||**What next? thoughts from a fellow Gen Z**    The motherland burns, my heart aches, my mind ponders, is all hope lost? My soul hurts to see violence, arson, anarchy, and the loot and burning of our national properties. We, Gen-Z, seem to have won, yet feel lost. Hope feels lost. Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? I’ve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we can’t let our nation fail.** We can’t let our nation burn. We can’t let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**     **1) We lay down our weapons.**   We came in peace, we protested in peace, and we’ve always wanted peace. We shall end this in peace. Be it known that anybody inciting violence isn’t part of our movement.     **2) We extend love.**   Love towards our brothers and sisters, love towards our nation, love towards our neighbours, our society, and the opposing side. The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.     **3) We wear white.**   White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that we’ve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.     **4) We have hope.**   Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.     Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.     Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.     Sincerely,   Pantji, a Gen-Z |||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger.

The crowd going crazy is the result of fustration building towards government and the younger generations seeing nothing for them in nepal.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Why not sagar Dhakal?|||Yesss|||Just promote it in your social media handle|||K bhairacha yarr discord ma pm choose bhairacha|||Ahile non political manxe thik huncha...her or Dr सन्दुक Ruit.

We don’t deserve the bare minimum.💯|||This is how it is gonna go. People are gonna be really angry now and for the next 6 months people's anger is going to go wild. But here is the truth the undeniable fact.   After the next 6 months there is gonna be development cause the election is near. Develop in order to show that we have developed, look around how much we developed. People have Short term memory most of you are gonna forget about today's anger 🤬 and will mostly be happy by the development that has been done in 6 month or a year before election. So the results will not change much.   Most people will likely vote for the same party again because most people think they are obligated to vote for the same party cause in the time of need or having some legal problems they will help to solve that problem and give special favor and priority to party members.  The best way I see to solve or to change current government is kind of cynical.

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen.

Rather than looking outwards to pin 📌 the chaos, it's important that we self reflect. This movement was started to hold those who've wronged our nation accountable but if we ourselves don't hold us accountable for yesterday's actions then we've lost the cause.  I beg that we don't dilute the blood spent in the last 48 years to any conspiracy.  जे भयो, गलत भयो । हामीले हिजोको घटनाक्रबाट आम नेपाली नागरिकको मनस्थिति भुज्यौं, हामीमा अझै पनि सुझबुझ छैन भनेर प्रमाणित गर्यौ।  तर अब के गर्ने भन्ने प्रश्न महत्पूर्ण छ - अब को छलफल त्यसमा हुनु पर्छ जस्तो लाग्छ।  We need law and order to end this chaos otherwise opportunists will prevail.

And there are plenty of those in Nepal. Don’t need to name names - everyone is aware.  But we also need fresh blood, not retired octogenarian doctors or septuagenarian judges (or loud “all caps” media personalities who interview them and think they still have their hand on our pulse). Not 50-year-old “youth leaders” of failed parties either! Nepal is so lucky to have awesome, talented and honest young people.

Built in 1908, it has stood as a symbol of our sovereignty, democracy, and national identity. For generations, it has been the place where decisions shaping our country’s future were made. Its grand architecture and historical importance make it a true pride of Nepal.The news of Singha Durbar burning yesterday is more than just the loss of a structure it feels like the loss of a piece of our soul. This tragedy is a blow to our heritage, to our economy, and to our sense of unity as a nation. The damage cannot be measured only in money, but also in the irreplaceable cultural and historical value that has been destroyed.  I feel deeply saddened by this loss. Singha Durbar was more than walls and pillars it was a living monument of Nepal’s journey, struggles, and achievements. Watching it go up in flames is heartbreaking for every Nepali who loves their country.",

One for the 165 candidates who are elected directly (first-past-the-post), other for the party. The votes that party gets determine the remaining 110 members via proportional representation.  so aba either we need new political parties to replace the existing ones by Falgun 21, or we have to vote for the same parties again. This is more complicated because Nepal is not just Kathmandu. The political players which we have termed jholey will be active outside Kathmandu.

Samshad Bhawan jalaune, Singha Durbar lai hamla garne, randomly police lai marne, politicians ko family nai harm garne. These are a part of some bigger game. I'm not sure exactly who is doing this or why this is being done. But there's a bigger game going on. Let's please be cautious and critical thinkers. We can't let those lost lives be in vain. We can't let this nation be ruined again!",

While our parents break their backs in foreign lands, cleaning toilets and washing dishes they never imagined they'd touch, just to send us Rs. 50,000 for our fees - THEIR KIDS are posting Instagram stories from Dubai shopping sprees!   While we study by candlelight because of load-shedding, wondering if we'll ever find a decent job in our own country - THEIR KIDS are getting government contracts at 25!  While we're forced to leave our mountains, our culture, our loved ones behind because there's NO FUTURE here - THEIR KIDS are building empires with OUR TAX MONEY!  WHERE ARE OUR TAXES GOING? - Roads that wash away every monsoon?  - Hospitals without medicine? - Schools without teachers? - Jobs that don't exist?  NO! IT'S ALL GOING TO FUND THEIR CHILDREN'S LUXURY!  This #NepoBaby trend isn't just about calling out privilege - it's about DEMANDING ANSWERS! It's about asking why WE have to sacrifice everything while THEY get everything handed to them!   NEPALI YOUTH - THIS IS OUR MOMENT!  🔥 Share every nepo kid post you see 🔥 Ask the hard questions publicly   🔥 Don't let them silence us 🔥 From online to the streets - LET'S GO!  Our parents' sacrifices will NOT be in vain. Our country's future will NOT be stolen. Our voices will NOT be silenced.  ENOUGH OF BEING QUIET. ENOUGH OF ACCEPTING .",
