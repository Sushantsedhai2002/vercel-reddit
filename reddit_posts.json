I checked the news as well as her social media, and she is quite active right now, especially around discussions related to elections. She has been vocal about election reforms, such as allowing Nepalis living abroad to vote from their host countries and making it easier for people in remote areas to vote. She seems to be actively working on these issues, attending meetings and discussions.  So yes, she is active, but I am curious about how exactly she is preparing for the election and which party she plans to represent.

Kulman is similar, with a communist mindset - *free electricity after 10 years* and so on. Yes, many privately owned hydropower projects are going to be nationalized under the BOOT model, but free electricity? Really? Why would elites need free electricity? Does no one have the idea of using that money to create a fund for social security like Norway did?  A wave of populism leads nowhere. We saw that with Prachanda’s Maoists, we saw that with Oli, and now we might witness the same fate again.  People in Nepal hate capitalism, people hate FDI, but at the same time they want the country to be like Norway lol. They need to see how Norway utilized its resources, invited FDI to and created a trillion-dollar fund that backs social security. Without creating capital, nothing is possible. There is no one in Nepal doing politics by explaining this reality—not Rabi, not Balen, not Harka. Kulman is literally a communist.  Nepal’s general mindset needs to be reset, and we need a strong political figure to do that. Rabi, Kulman, and Balen *can* do that, I honestly think so. Nepal is a country where if FDI comes in, people start saying \"desh bechyo\". With this communist mindset, the country is not going anywhere, no country ever has, nor will. Even China had to open its markets to progress. Deng Xiaoping took a step forward to reset the mindset; he said, *“To be rich is glorious.”* We need leaders who can make people understand this. In Nepal, if someone becomes rich, they get abused. Politics needs to be grounded in reality. Free schools, cheap housing, free healthcare all sound cool, but Nepal is a country running a current-account deficit.  Even youth don't understand this reality, leave alone the older generation. All we want is free stuffs but have no damn idea where'll that come from. So we need political figures whom society trusts to explain this. Right now, that’s Rabi, Balen, and Kulman.  So yeah, you can be as excited as you want, but economically Nepal isn’t going anywhere with this mindset.  I want RSP balen kulman to come together and win, not because I’m optimistic about them (yet), but because I want the arrogance of the old parties to die. I want them to lose badly. And I’ll truly support RSP–Balen–Kulman when they start talking about an economic reset.",

As someone who has worked in energy sector for such a long time, he means he is optimistic. That's his target. The energy he thinks Nepal can produce.   Kulman Ghising has shown great maturity. He barely speak against anyone.  He has never single handedly taken credit for the end of loadshedding. A communist mindset won't do that.   He has shown great managerial skill.  He dedicated trunk line for the industries. He cut the expenses. He sold the excess energy to neighbours. Voila, for the first time in history NEA turns profitable. They are investing in many hydro project without the help of foreign aid. How amazing that sound. That 's not the communist mindset.  He has shown great leadership skill. A leader must decide. People are afraid to decide. They do not want to be in bad page. A leading person must do what is necessary. He should not be scared of criticism. A leader is action oriented.  MCC was needed. He supported it. Parliament approved it. He cut the lines of 30 industries that were not paying bills. He even went against PM. Now they will be paying in 28 installments. He knows how to be strict. And knows how to sort it out.  He knows how beurocracy work.  For Rabi and Balen, it will take time to understand the system. Kulman Ghising came out from that system. Beurocracy can't fool him. He knows the procedure, mindset, the people. He cancelled hundreds of bad contracts.  He himself is working 16/18 hours a day. Kulman Ghising is the best choice.  There are many countries with free health, free school, free housing, free transport etc. Even UK has it. Is UK a communist country.  No, They are socialist.  Do you know Free school education single handedly raised the number of students in Nepal. Free tiffin, books, bicycle for girls. These are the scheme that Nepal government launched successfully. Otherwise poor families weren't sending their kids.  Do you know how many lives governmental hospital is saving. Entire saving is gone in treatment. How is poor supposed to pay. Thanks to government hospitals.  Free is not always bad. People need it. It means a lot for poor people.|||Leader should come with \"nation first \" mindset.. Not someone who has personal interest in vengeance or fake legacy .. New vs old will surely land this country in situation worse.|||kulman never said to give free electricity uhaley just nepal sanga xemata xa free electricity diney venko hun jo satteta pani ho tara free ma kunai pani kura dinu chai hudaina|||Likes of balen kulman with veteran integration like baburam and so on (should be the first mandate )|||https://preview.redd.it/ow7vhjysoh9g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cd59fb55c3c1dd7868916e76d7ee85fef6a7e0b|||RSP also have swornim wagle and other who are capitalist. In fact every party have some short of pro capitalist people. In congress Gagan is pro capitalist, in UML surendra pandey. LOOk at MCC, BRI. Look chanra dhakal who UML permits to built cable car.

I doubt nepali people will understand this.|||“Elites need free electricity?”, what do you mean by that? Please elaborate. First and foremost, social security is a ponzi scheme. So you’re telling me, we generate all sorts of income from hydropower and give it away to people as subsidies or SS fund?   What will the fund do? What will it go to? In a short run, that could work out but it won’t last forever as we all know.   Nepal can only be revived with a clear mindset and a strategic plan to take the responsibility of every consequence that occurs, be accountable, be aware, with honesty, dignity, a mindset reset (THAT’S BIGG, like you mentioned), honesty is a big part, investments, help from our neighboring countries, and with a commitment to build this nation on the ground it was formed.   Let’s not forget what this nation was and what it’s meant to be. It’s meant to  be the greatest and will be. We got this. Jay Nepal, Jay Himal, Jay Pahad, Jay Terai 🙏  And your mention on topics like Balen and Rabi are capable of bringing this nation back but when you get into the depth of the abyss, you find out that these people didn’t come in the times of scarcity, times when people were lost in the dark stage of destruction that happened in September. My only question is, “Why give away the responsibility to people who never really backed up this revolutionary plan ?”.   Your mention of Kulman doesn’t click in all the way but Kulam seems to have a strong stance on the succession of the MCC plan.|||You seem young and still learning, but wealth creation has nothing to do with capitalism or communism. It can be created in either system.   Nepal does not have oil fields like Norway to get rich quick also the Norwegian creating a common sovereign wealth fund that everyone owns is antithesis of capitalism.   A health mix where capitalism is kept on a short leash is likely the best path forward, if not we will have a bunch of madwari and politician get richer than god while the country remains in doldrums.  There is nothing wrong with what Kulman or Ravi's statement. NEA is there to provide service to Nepali people, It's not there to squeeze every single rupee out of 'customers', it already provides free electricity to low usage household, If it can sustainably lower household electricity bill, what's the harm in that?  I hope you will keep learning and grow out of redscare propaganda.|||Norway also Nationalizes Hydropower after 60 years .

But looking at the scenario right now, Balen really holds huge power.  I was just going through the news, and today alone he has been meeting with all kinds of groups. He met Rabi Lamichhane again, he’s in discussions with Kulman Ghising, the Gen Z Group, Baburam Bhattarai, and some people from Congress. He’s been busy all day, even till late evening, I saw updates that he was meeting with Kulman, and he had another meeting scheduled with Rabi that was postponed to tomorrow due to timing issues.  Everyone, be it Rabi or Kulman, seems to understand that Balen must be taken into account. That’s why the main focus has been on him. No alternative force can move forward without Balen at this point.  I originally thought he wouldn’t contest the upcoming election and would instead support someone else, continuing as mayor. But looking at the news now, he has officially announced that he’s entering politics. He has asked everyone to come forward and join him. I also read that Kulman and Balen are on the same page, but talks with Rabi haven’t been finalized. He mentioned that if discussions don’t go smoothly with either Ujjyalo Party of Kulman or RSP of Rabi, he would move forward with his own party, which is already set up.  Man, the amount of power this guy holds right now is insane. We saw it during the protests as well, on the second day, literally the entire country was chanting for Balen to step up and take the prime minister’s seat.  Even now, the news is all about him, everyone seems to be saying Balen must be taken seriously. Crazy times.",

            "comments": "People might hate him but one thing is sure if Balen participates actively in election alone or in coalition, he will get almost all the youth votes except who are actively involved in party politics. |||Balen must go to the elections under the RSP. I like Balen dai a lot, but he should remember that he won only 38% (60K Votes) of the votes in the mayor election in Kathmandu while the RSP got around 11% of the NATIONAL vote (11 Lakhs!!!). Currently, the RSP has a wayyyyy bigger mandate to lead the country than Balen or any other alternative force. I hope Kulman dai and Balen dai understand this. I am not going to include Harka dai in this because he seems off the rails.  It's so sad to see alternative parties bickering over who gets power even after the carnage of september 8. If we go into the elections divided, the old establishment will come back to power and will prosecute everyone that was involved in the peaceful protests. Jay Nepal|||He holds big power because general people think that a country is run by one person and he would magically solve all the problems and people treat him like a god. If people could they would give him unchecked power and make him a dictator and tell other people the beauty of democracy.   Even if the election were to happen then the majority would vote for the same parties and hope for a different outcome. They would be the first to complain that nothing would change in this country and all are bhedas.|||I don’t doubt the intentions of either Balen or Ravi but I think they including their fans and followers have descended into Olipath just as much. Unpopular opinion but Balen and Ravi both are no different than Oli (they could easily become like Oli or worse pretty soon).  Having said that, I too am tempted by the idea of the new and the ‘alternatives’ coming together but I find it very hard to believe that this will lead to anything more than an instant gratification for many Nepalis. I am genuinely scared at the power Balen supposedly holds right now, and I would rather have him explain and clarify his stance as to critical political agendas than hurrying to ride on that power.|||can’t say he is yet to be tested in elections; social media hype and election- entirely different things|||Balen needs to risk it all in the ultimate act of political gamble. Go against KP oli in jhapa. This will be the final symbolic victory over the incumbents.|||Alternative patti janey ho bhaney balen first RSP last|||Yes Balen holds huge power right now but is that only the perception or reality?? He's Mayor of KMC which is huge but KMC doesn't represent all of Nepal and it is not easy to run a political party in Nepal like you have to be hyper active and not be insulated. So I wonder if Balen decides to go it alone and join this Desh bikash party and fight election either on his own or at least ally with Kulman,'s party, what will be the result of that??   I think it will help Balen a lot if he joins RSP and becomes their PM candidate like Ghanti at this point is a well known election symbol, Balen can leave party management to Rabi and maybe Kulman (if he joins) and solely focus on winning his constituency and then planning on what he will do once he becomes PM. Alternatively, he can do alliance with RSP whereby he and some of his people will run on lauro election symbol but then RSP won't field candidates in areas where they run. Desh bikash party may get 10 to 15 seats or more and RSP can support Balen there. Of course in this situation Balen also has to manage a party with lots of different people.   So let's see what happens.|||He holds this immense power because he is the only person that has got this gut to change the future of Nepal at this point! And he has shown that he can maintain and enforce change as he did by being a Mayor alone. Change will take time but a confident and visionary leader must lead our country for some years for now  otherwise our country might stuck being 3rd world forever. I definitely believe he can change a lot of things and if all the right people like kulman and others come along to support him, our nation’s going to be great again.|||I think it only in these major cities only hou|||Dude must be thinking, kabhi kabhi toh lagta hai apun ich vagwaan hai...😆😆.

            "body": "I worked at a company in Nepal for 1 year. My gross salary was NPR 25,000 per month, but every month I received only NPR 20,598 after tax deduction and CIT contribution. So roughly NPR 4,000 was deducted every month → 4,000 × 12 = ~48,000 per year After I left the company, they gave me only NPR 57,000 as my total CIT amount. They said “this is all our accountant calculated” and did not provide any payslips, tax statements, or CIT breakdown. My questions: Is it normal/fair for around NPR 4,000 to be deducted monthly from a 25k salary? How does CIT work in Nepal? How much should be employee contribution? How much should be company contribution? Shouldn’t the company also contribute to CIT separately? Should I receive official payslips or CIT statements? Has anyone faced a similar situation? Am I possibly being underpaid or scammed? I’m confused about the accounting rules and would appreciate advice from anyone familiar with Nepal salary tax & CIT system. Thanks in advance 🙏",

I don't mind selling to either stores or individuals who might use it with an external display, so if you know any stores in Kathmandu or elsewhere that deal in used Macs, please let me know. Personal experiences would be appreciated.  Thanks 🙏",

When you hear about the gulf then it's the people who didn't even complete their high school education  go to that's were most people go to and rest newly high school graduates tend to go to the west. My uncle just have to do the job nothing else as everything is managed by the company. Every year a month of vacation etc.   Are we missing out good opportunities ? Whereas its tough in the west as you don't even land a white collar job most of the time you have to stick with blue collar jobs even if you graduate or have to work in nursing homes, child cares etc. Would love to see insights from other people who have been working somewhere in gulf countries.",

About 2 weeks ago, we took our paywalls down and opened up MyBot for a short community testing period just to see how people actually use it when everything’s unlocked. The response, especially from people who spend a lot of time with AI companions, has been way more useful than we expected, so we’ve decided to keep community testing open through the end of the year!  A few things that stood out once people got into longer chats  * Confirmed if the core chat isn’t engaging, none of the extra features really matter * Differences between AI models become way more obvious in longer conversations * With the advancement in image generation tech users are expecting more and more and faster too * Some settings we thought people would tweak nonstop barely get touched, while a few others, people really obsess over  None of this is crazy of course, but seeing it play out across real users instead of internal testing has definitely changed how we’re looking at everything.  If you’ve already tried it, thank you for your support!  If you haven’t yet and you’re curious to poke around at our memory, models, or longer conversations, testing is still open and will be through the end of the year.   Happy to answer any more of your questions too!",

Or if that's too complicated, normally you can insert the input LAN to one of the LAN ports (instead of the WAN) ports and it will be configured as AP nkde|||Yes it should be possible depending on your choice of secondary router and as long as you configure it properly.   These are the points I'd keep in mind:  1. Disabling the DHCP of the secondary router, 2. Giving it a static IP in the same subnet as your main Nokia router, 3. Make sure you don't mistakely set it up as a NAT, 4. And connect it LAN to LAN.  I have done smth similar with an old Huawei EGA8141A5. I had set it up as a NAT to work with port forwarding and such like 2 years ago but not an AP. So, I can't really tell you what to do but you should be able to do what you want as long as you have admin access to the router. You should try looking up on YT or forums for more help, I'm sure you will find the answer for your exact router. Some routers DO have a default setting that allows them to be set up as an AP tho, so you should look into that first.",

This is not and isn't supposed to be any sort of personal or accusational message to anyone, just a humble feedback with due consideration to the nature of the subreddit and reddit as whole.  Pahilo, What post stays should be defined.   My suggestion is to discard absolutely low tier low effort post like ig tiktok and reel ss unless they're of unique nature to avoid a boring feed. I mean general question should be allowed like typical address, location, how to file return, my neighbor doesn't pickup his dog poo, I am tired from work, padna manlaunna etc etc you get it. It also includes those My gf/bf doesn't love react my story, gm/gn texts etc etc  too, you get it.  Second is on the topic of serious or sensitive matter like feminism, patriarchy, social problems and all. Post with good enough body text as opinion of the OP should be made mandatory, tyo 1 liner title garne haru kamm kaaj buddhi chaina, feed wahighat matra huncha plus it creates unnecessary & misunderstanding led arguments and debates. It was fun but now it's boring as hell. Okay like make a post calling out whatever you like but avoid to title it horrendously & ultra vaguely and insensitive as to deem you as jackass. This rule will make the discussion fair and not hinder freedom of speech either, freedom of speech doesn't recommend being stupid, insensitive and jackass.  Third is to totally not allowing use of swears in TITLE, do whatever in body text just don't be Hitler. Ani typical swears like sale, gadha, yk, murdar etc other than those of heinous or demeaning nature should be allowed. Like come on these are needed to make funny and snarky comments. A little bit of fun, considering majority of the sub is of goofy, unsrs, causal nature: casual 'off words' should be let it be 😭  Fourth, Strong moderation of Serious and help flair. I see people using it as shitpost alternative. These two flair should be limited to very very serious matter. Unnecessary use will make people less sensitive to these flair, leading to increased ignorance and loss of that feeling i describe as 'alertness factor' like the feeling or alertness you get when you hear a ambulance siren. Punishment too, ipso facto, Immediate 2 day ban.  Fifth, more mods, in a way atleast one is active at all timestamp of the day. Should be of neutral nature for objectivity, or someone that isn't too deep into his position in compass, is capable of gauging both side appropriately, keep the bias (of any kind) aside when in the role or position or to exercise as moderator.  Six, to create a kinda fashion for post, making people used to the rules of sub without being a dickhead like r/nipples, in short consistency.  Seven, for any international or nationwide event, no post other than those that are well written in a manner it's seems the writer actually knows what he/she/rest is speaking, isn't generic repetitive mess like just typing the event title and saying thing like 'that is good/bad' yeahhh this gotta go. Rest of those just rewriting the title without anything strong or aren't well opinionated should be discarded too. No more of the spams. It doesn't have to be accurate or u being a Martin Luther King to get posted. Just put effort in your opinion or thing you want to say. It's much more fun to engage in such post. This will be crucial to construct the subject mention in point six.  While I respect the mods, moderation and the growth this sub saw, We're a quite the big boy sub yet the state of is little disorganized and inconsistent by moderation & feed standards, the above mention QOL changes should be enforced. In coming months or so people and users will adapt. And for the way it is written was intented and to make it little off to ensure it feels little entertaining for regular viewers. I really wanted to use the word ipso facto, fitting place and sentence nei bhetina.|||![gif](giphy|ZztgXZ5UhbKZTbPPSU)|||Would be better if second one wasn't there IMO|||Accept only female post if she got that curry cannon|||I dont like that flairs are now mandatory. When I used to post in r/Nepal, where flairs are mandatory, I was usually torn between which flair to choose as sometimes what you want to post does not fit into a specific category. For example, I want to post about a news, but I also want a discussion but the news is related to politics, which flair should I choose? Politics? News? Discussion? I had to try to guess which flair mods would have least problem with and would be less likely to delete my post. This was hard.

            "body": "Being a MBBS from scholarship myself. I thought I would clarify few things.  As of Today there is total of 691 scholarship for MBBS. About 311 are reservations. All of this is provided by **Government of Nepal.** That means Government of Nepal has decided to teach 691 students under its own expense. After that they will have to do **2 years of Bonding**. Which means for 2 years they are not allowed to give exams or study further.   So, it is a great achievement if a person from Poor family gets MBBS scholarship no doubt about that. However, to say that government is doing nothing is a literal retarded statement. The whole scheme is by Government of Nepal. The fees for MBBS easily crosses 60 lakhs in some private colleges. It can reach upto crores in India. This scheme has helped a lot of family uplift themselves. I have seen some of my friends from poorer background uplifting their family from their job. Also, 311 are reservations, which means if you are from Oppressed background you can get scholarship through lower marks in comparison to general catergory. That lower marks depends on the number of people fighting for the same category.  All the private colleges must provide at least 10 scholarship for the students. These are referred to as MOE. This exists because government tells them. Otherwise private colleges never would teach someone for free.   In short, we should be thankful that such schemes exist in Nepal. This is exclusive to southasian countries. In developed countries like USA, you study on the basis of student loans. A MBBS student may have upto 300,000 USD at the end of their studies. They pay it as they earn after becoming a consultant. Just because its sounds cool bashing the government doesn't mean it has not done something useful.",

            "body": "Guys, real kura, no bullshit. My father is a civil servant, a Saha Sachib, and he is someone who has struggled a lot in life. When he was 15, he worked as a helper in a hotel in Delhi. He saved some money, returned to Nepal, lived in Kathmandu, did Aqua Guard marketing, and studied college at the same time. He prepared for Loksewa, became section officer when I  was born when he was 22 years old.  This is from the time before the mayor system, when the power in Tansen Municipality was in the hands of the Nagar Pramukh. During that period, my father did genuinely good work. Tansen became the first district to ban plastic and had one of the best waste management systems. The municipality was extremely clean and well managed. Around 2060 BS, Tansen Nagarpalika was highly talked about in the media.  Because of his work, the government sent him on official visits to many countries including Japan, Korea, the USA, and several European nations. At that time, even though he was in debt, he genuinely saved more than 40 lakhs from foreign travel allowances and bought land in Bhaktapur. That is why we have a place to live in the Valley today.  Later, he passed the exam for Rajaswa Upasachib. He was offered postings in customs many times, but he never went there. Even now, he works in a ministry, earning only his salary and occasional allowances. We still have more than one crore loan from the Provident Fund for building our house and for educating us, which still needs to be paid off.  There is a person from my father’s village, about the same age as him. He is now only a Subba after promotion, but he worked in customs for decades. Today, his family lives a luxurious life despite being four levels below my father’s post. Meanwhile, I still cannot afford an iPhone. His son has the latest iPhone every year  macbook every expensive gadgets , a car, an expensive bike, and a luxury house.  But you know what? I have no complaints. I am confident that my father is not corrupt. If he were, I would easily have luxury products and a comfortable life. The fact that I don’t have those things is proof of his honesty.  edit My father was once the head of the Inland Revenue Department in Lalitpur. During his tenure, he took firm action against tax evasion, even when it involved powerful people. At one point, he was close to initiating legal action that could have resulted in jail time by Arzu Deuba by false accusation, who was unwilling to pay taxes owed by Ullens School.  Because of this, he faced political pressure and was eventually transferred from his position.  My father often says that he would rather resign than work with this system. But the reality is that he has a family to feed, so he keeps going.",

I got the sense that she might be joining Kulman Ghising, since she was present at the launch of his party, Ujyalo Nepal. That makes it seem like a real possibility. She has also been teaming up with Sagar Dhakal recently. They even posted a video urging young people to come forward and participate.  I checked the news as well as her social media, and she is quite active right now, especially around discussions related to elections. She has been vocal about election reforms, such as allowing Nepalis living abroad to vote from their host countries and making it easier for people in remote areas to vote. She seems to be actively working on these issues, attending meetings and discussions.  So yes, she is active, but I am curious about how exactly she is preparing for the election and which party she plans to represent.  I also read on Onlinekhabar that Balen, Kulman, and Rabi might officially announce their collaboration today after signing some papers. If that happens, I assume Sumana’s and Sagar’s plans will also become clearer afterward. So let’s see how it goes.",

For example...ward ma can ppl like bakendra put all the people to run in elections...whereas congress and UML ma ta tyo ward ko position ko lagi nai maramar huncha...whereas these individuals don't even have the capacity to put all the people in ward elections...say if you get these people and get majority in hor...which is extremely unlikely as well...what happens...when you got whole ward of the country against you...what happens if they do pen down and kneel down the government...  with thousands of people engaging in micro level for their party at local area...city areas ma nai they get massive chunk of votes... social media ma engagement farm garera kehi direct seats uniharule hareypani they get massive chunk of votes through losing votes or samanupatik votes as well...so it's not about city vs village...  see you need structure first... Political legitimacy also comes from political structure...its natural...you got majority of people at wards,federal structure and even outside political associations like bar association, media council etc yo sabai association and Organisation determines power structure...  Esto Huda it's natural they are in top...you don't have to support the parties...but reality must be upheld...we have to be real...  structure binako politics is a pipe dream and algorithms based amplified rage baits or engagement farming ko basis ma chaleyko populism is extremely temporary...with advancements in ai and ai agents yo algorithm based populism also will expire in near future...yo algorithm based populism ko ragebait partyharule face Gareypani they still have a structure or Organisation to fall onto or to take shelther from the storm...but who will save these individuals afterwards...I will not be surprised they will join the mainstream parties eventually...  people are not getting the structure of politics in the country...tesaima these individuals are selling pipe dream and capitalizing on people's lack of knowledge regarding politics...yes these people can win a seat or two in hor but that's about it...  You see democracy is about organization...while you can glorify certain sets of individuals...but it's about how they manage a group of people inside an organization where colourful characters are present...these individuals need to deal with backstabbers,opportunists as well...uniharule pathayeko representative manchele patyauna parcha...  While you idolize balendra or ravi...you can see the clear difference between these individuals and their representatives...there will be trust issues...as balendra or ravindra can't contest in each election area as well...they must give tickets to others...yo populist clout would have worked if these individuals had been able to fight in every area of the country but yiniharuko limit nai yehi ho...and in our system tesaile individual clout doesn't matter it's about organizational reach...every area ma euta powerful manche huncha tesailai ppl vote...  You should get out of your house first and look who is in charge in your neighborhood...ppl are so much manipulated that they are not looking at the politics happening in their locality...yo individual clout le garera they are only looking at mainstream politics...whereas the structure or Organisation jsko basis ma the big parties are winning they are neglecting the political structure outside their homes...if you want change Tmro Ghar Bahira ko politics paila change hunaparcha...and if you want these populist to win uniharuko representative ko halimuhali tmro tole ma hunaparcha paila...  These individuals can also get losing votes at best...RSP le last time around they won far more seats because of samanupatik seats not direct elections... yiniharuko aash nai tehi samanupatik seats or losing votes ho...balendra is talking with different parties because samanupatik seats ko lagi he need to give name list as well...as the dates are approaching...  social media le Esto manipulate gareykocha ki they are dumbfounded on reality itself...",

In the next election, Congress made alliance with Maobadi and other smaller parties, Emale still secured good seats. This shows how strong Emale organization is.

GAGAN Thapa whole Carrer as a politician has revoled around bringing internal democracy and primary in election which RSP has started doing. Instead of this they only say that RSP is the fan club of Rabi which I don't think gives you the complete picture.|||Primary election is the reason I like the party, and not because of someone's personality. This is a great system, in fact every party who considers themselves as democratic should have it, but only RSP has.   Even someone who is not into politics but has good potential have a chance to get a ticket to contest the election. You just have to convince/win hearts of people of your area, and not have to do chakari of any top neta. For eg. that's how Zohran Mamdani won the democratic party ticket, even though top leaders of his own party didn't like him and favored the other guy.   In that sense, RSP is a great platform for people with merit. Anyone with big potential/perosnality like Kulman, Balen can easily contest  in the party election and have a chance to replace Rabi as the party President. Is it the same case in Congress, UML? Don't even think about contesting election for 10 years, tespachhi ni neta ko chakari garda garda lucky vayau vane ticket payo, no consideration of talent. Swarnim Wagle jasto talented manchhe, who dedicated so much in the Congress party, didn't even get the ticket because Vauju didn't like him. While murderers, fraudsters were easily getting ticket cause they were loyal to her.|||US funding diye pachi bhai halcha ni. Don’t worry ",

Was the **Master’s worth it** given today’s market? 2. If you were 26 **right now**, would you still take the same path? 3. Is Australia still a place where **skill + effort reliably pay off**, or has that changed? 4. Am I overestimating how bad things are — or underestimating the long-term upside? 5. If you had the option to earn remotely from a cheaper country, would you still move?  I’m not anti-Australia. I’m just trying to make a **clear, non-emotional decision**.

            "body": ">  >Santosh has studied up to Plus-2. After not seeing any way to do anything in Nepal, he thought of going abroad and was haunted by the 'ghost' of going to America. Looking around, he could see his friends who had gone to America. Their discussions about earning money in America, stories of building houses, and the glamour of foreign countries all touched Santosh's heart. Anyway, the idea of ​​going to America was formed. On the advice of his relatives, he reached out to an agent. The agent was a Nepali. He lived and worked in Dubai. The point was straightforward, 'America for 4.8 million!'  >An agreement was reached with the agent. But that agreement was not on paper, it was just trust.  >The agent explained the plan. From Nepal to Dubai, from there to Brazil. Then via the lower route to America. After leaving Nepal, Santosh reached Dubai. He was kept there for a month and a half. Then he reached Brazil by air. After reaching Brazil, reality dawned for the first time. The agent said, 'Now we need to add money.'  >What happens if you don't pay?   The answer was straightforward - 'We'll leave it here.'  >It was not possible for a person who had traveled to America with a dream to live in Brazil. Santosh contacted his family and asked them to send money to the agent's Nepali account. The family sought a loan.  >Not only Brazil, but also Cambodia and Guatemala, Santosh had to add money again and again. In each country, there were new agents, new demands. Santosh was confused. But there was no other option.  >They had to contact their family in Nepal. The family would borrow money from acquaintances in the village at 2-3 percent interest. The land would be pledged as collateral. The money would go to the agent's account. Only then would the journey to another country begin.  >By the time he landed in America, Santosh had already spent Rs. 7.5 million.  >**The horror of the Panama jungle**  >The most terrifying part began, the journey from Colombia to the jungles of Panama. After leaving the buses, trucks, and boats, it was a day-long walk. There were 7 to 10 people in the group. The group included not only Nepalese hoping to reach America, but also people from Africa, Asia, and Latin America.  >\"Many people knew as soon as they heard the word 'Panama','\" Santosh says in a low voice. \"We would start walking as soon as it got light. After nightfall, we had to sleep in the dense forest. Sometimes we would get a tent, sometimes we would have to sleep in an empty space.\"  >Hungry stomach. Journey through the jungle. His mind was filled with memories of his country. The jungle, the orchard. Even when he was hungry, he could not find food. All he could get was biscuits, water from rivers and streams. The fear of wild animals in the dense jungle was the same. The only hope was to be able to enter America.  >\"We were afraid that we would have to leave our lives in the forest,\" Santosh recalls, \"we didn't know anything.\"  >After crossing the forest, he traveled by bus and truck, avoiding security personnel. He does not want to remember the tragic boat ride on the river that came between.  >After reaching Mexico via Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala, Santosh feels like his dream of reaching America is coming true.  >In every country, there was the same obligation to wait for a few days. In some places, it was 7 days, in some countries, it was 15 days. In a small room, 8-10 people with dreams of entering America were crammed together. Sleeping on the floor. Isolation from the outside world. This had become a regular practice. In other words, they were under house arrest. 'It was like house arrest,' says Santosh, 'our world was confined within four walls.'  >Different agents were waiting in every country. Once an agent was found, the demand was for money again. He would not be able to take another step until the money arrived. Santosh remembers that no matter what happened, he had no choice.  >After reaching Mexico, America seems close. But where did he get to enter so quickly? After staying there for a few days, thinking, \"You came here with so much difficulty, now you're leaving,\" Santosh recalls, he had no choice but to stay cooped up in his room until the agent decided on the right time and place to enter.  >After staying in Mexico for more than a week, one day the news came, 'Let's go now.' Finally, Santosh's heart felt lighter. Now he was going to enter America! He happily headed towards the border with his bag.  >The dream of living a happy and joyful life in America was shattered when a group including Santosh, who had reached the border with bags, was taken into custody by American border guards.  >My heart was filled with joy. 'Oh! It's ruined. What will happen now?' There was an unanswered question in everyone's mind. The American security guard put them on the bus. The security personnel took the bag and materials that Santosh was carrying. They were taken to the camp in only the clothes they were wearing.  >His plan to reach America and start making money from scratch failed. Santosh spent six months in American custody.  >In the 18 months since he left Nepal, he has not been able to eat a full meal. He went to America to eat delicious food and dress well, but he has not been able to eat a full meal. He did not get any on the way, and he suffered the same in the camp.  >At that time, he remembered the 'gundrak and rice' that his mother had cooked for him. Cakes, bread, and rajma became the limited food he could get in the cap. He would be happy to get a handful of rice once a week.  >It was not possible to leave the camp. The American field was visible from the fence. America was there, but he could not reach it. His plan to enjoy the American splendor was trapped within the fence.  >0000  >Pradeep Bhandari, 38, of Tulsipur, Dang, returned on the same plane. He returned 22 months after leaving home, having spent 11 months in a US prison.  >Bhandari's agent had given him two options to reach America - 5.5 million through the underground route, and 6.5 million through air travel from various countries. Bhandari chose the underground route to enter America.  >Then his journey began. From Nepal to Dubai, from Dubai to Brazil. After reaching Brazil, the agent's threats began. Like Santosh. Threatened to leave him in Brazil if he didn't pay. Pradeep had no choice. He talked to them at home and managed to get money.  >Even after paying the money, his departure from Brazil to America never came. He and his team were locked up in a house in Brazil for two months. One day, the agent took him to Colombia via truck, pickup van, and bus.  >Pradeep still feels the pain and swelling of his feet after walking for three days in the jungle of Panama. The terrifying walk through the jungle all day, the night in a tent. The journey for hours on a boat. Amidst various challenges, the agent took him to the US border. After crossing the border at 5 pm and entering the US, Pradeep forgot about his debt and the pain of Panama. 'No matter what, he entered America!' he thought to himself.  >But his happiness did not last long. Because American security personnel took him into custody shortly after crossing the border and took him to a camp. Pradeep was shifted to three camps. The food was the same as usual, bread and rice. Rice was served once a week.  >Hundreds of foreign nationals have been deported since Donald Trump became president, following the tightening of immigration policies. Many like Santosh and Pradeep are on the list.  >They were also able to come to Nepal easily! They were brought onto the plane with nails on their hands and feet and handcuffs, but the nails were removed just a few hours before landing in Kathmandu. They were disembarked from the plane, which stopped in Nepal via Texas, Bulgaria, and India.  >०००  >But the deportees are not ready to file a complaint against the agents. Bishwaraj Khadka, spokesperson for the Human Trafficking Investigation Bureau of the Nepal Police, says that most of those using the illegal route, or danki route, go to the US on the advice of relatives and acquaintances, so they do not file a complaint. \"Since the agents are relatives, no complaints are filed,\" he says. Although the police have tried to reach the agents of the deportees at various times, it has not been easy due to the lack of complaints and sufficient information from the victims. According to the police, gangs that give loans to those going to the US are also found in villages and districts. According to the police, most of those using the danki route are from Dang, Rukum East, Rukum West, Salyan and Banke.  >\"Gangs that provide loans to people going to America are based in villages and districts,\" said Spokesperson Khadka. \"The lenders are people you know. They provide loans by pledging land at an interest rate of 2 to 3 percent.\"  >He said that research has found that many Nepalis have returned to the US after investing a minimum of Rs. 5 million to Rs. 10 million.  >Santosh and Pradeep are now wandering. They are not even ready to file a complaint against the agent. They have not given up hope that they will return the money after contacting them, but the agent is out of contact. The interest meter on the loan is spinning day by day. For these young people who had dreams of changing their lives by reaching America, that journey on the Danki route became a trap that took away not only their property, but also their peace of life. The iron nail that was loosened when they got off the ship has loosened, but the invisible nail of the 75 lakh rupee loan is binding them.  >The number of people who have illegally entered the US is increasing. In the last eight fiscal years, 669 Nepalis have been deported from the US. Of these, 634 are men and 35 are women, according to police data.  >Only 442 people have returned since last January. Of these, 412 are men and 30 are women.  >Of those who went in this way in the fiscal year 2075/076, 45 men returned. In the fiscal year 2076/077, 83 people returned, including 2 women and 81 men, while in the fiscal year 2077/078, 30 people returned, including 2 women and 28 men, according to police data.  >In 2078/079, 13 men returned, while in 2079/080, 7 men returned. In 2080/081, 21 people returned, in 2081/082, 270 people returned, including 19 women and 188 men. In 2082/083, 263 people returned, including 12 women and 81 men.  >The US border security policy has been tightened significantly in 2025. According to the US Department of Homeland Security, those who cross the border illegally will now be returned to their country directly through the 'fast track deportation' process without any legal hearing. As reported by US news organizations, the US administration has increased strict surveillance at the main points of the 'Donkey Route' in cooperation with Panama and Mexico. The White House has recently described the mass return of migrants to their country via chartered flights as its major achievement. As a result, the possibility of obtaining political asylum has now reached an all-time low.  >**Action under which law?**  >Sending people to work abroad without working is considered illegal. According to the police, sending people illegally is considered human trafficking. Although action is taken against those who send people to the US in this way according to the Human Trafficking and Smuggling (Control) Act, problems arise when the victims do not file a complaint.  >There is a legal provision that anyone who sells or buys a human being will be sentenced to twenty years in prison and a fine of two hundred thousand rupees. Anyone who takes a person abroad for the purpose of buying, selling, or using them for prostitution will be sentenced to ten to fifteen years in prison and a fine of fifty thousand to one hundred thousand rupees, and if a child is taken, the sentence will be fifteen to twenty years in prison and a fine of one hundred thousand to two hundred thousand rupees.

            "body": "My college head and a friendly botany teacher who has seen thousands of students always says just do enough to pass all subjects. Thats it. Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

Whether we like them or not, an attack on a high profile figure can disrupt our national peace and damage our international reputation for years to come.  ​We can never be certain who might be planning an attack on a VVIP or for what purpose. These individuals hold their status for a reason, and they will have followers regardless of whether we perceive their character as good or bad. There will always be those who fight for their \"masters\" or those who have something to gain from these VVIPs, for them, personal interests and loyalty will always take priority over the country’s wellbeing. If an attack occurs, our country’s stability can derail overnight and Western media and racists in west love to make fun of \"third world countries\" to feel superior regardless of fact that they have been through worse.

            "body": "As it says, I recently got this and was hoping for some help, especially on the markings. There isn’t a ton of info on these in English so I figured I’d do to the source. My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6. This is probably the longest shot of them all, but any ideas what species of critter might have eaten up the stock at one point? I put a picture of it on picture 2, I was thinking some type of termite or wood worm.",

During the Rana regime (1846–1951), gun manufacturing in Nepal was driven largely by the innovative efforts of Gehendra Shumsher, the eldest son of Prime Minister Bir Shumsher, who is widely regarded as Nepal's first scientist and modernizer of the military.   Key Manufacturing Factories  The Ranas established several sites for arms and ammunition production, primarily centered in the Kathmandu Valley and some regional hubs:   Nakkhu (Lalitpur): Notable for producing copies of the Martini-Henry rifle, specifically the \"De-Rifle\" in the late 1880s.  Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.  Jangi Megjin: Originally founded in 1793, it continued to function during the Rana period as a government foundry for manufacturing cannons and military equipment.|||You need someone from the Hanuman Dhoka Museum in Kathmandu. They’ll be able to clarify for you.

            "body": "Obviously we know that Balen is someone the entire country knows. I think he's one of the few with thousands of supporters. But looking at the scenario right now, Balen really holds huge power.  I was just going through the news, and today alone he has been meeting with all kinds of groups. He met Rabi Lamichhane again, he’s in discussions with Kulman Ghising, the Gen Z Group, Baburam Bhattarai, and some people from Congress. He’s been busy all day, even till late evening, I saw updates that he was meeting with Kulman, and he had another meeting scheduled with Rabi that was postponed to tomorrow due to timing issues.  Everyone, be it Rabi or Kulman, seems to understand that Balen must be taken into account. That’s why the main focus has been on him. No alternative force can move forward without Balen at this point.  I originally thought he wouldn’t contest the upcoming election and would instead support someone else, continuing as mayor. But looking at the news now, he has officially announced that he’s entering politics. He has asked everyone to come forward and join him. I also read that Kulman and Balen are on the same page, but talks with Rabi haven’t been finalized. He mentioned that if discussions don’t go smoothly with either Ujjyalo Party of Kulman or RSP of Rabi, he would move forward with his own party, which is already set up.  Man, the amount of power this guy holds right now is insane. We saw it during the protests as well, on the second day, literally the entire country was chanting for Balen to step up and take the prime minister’s seat.  Even now, the news is all about him, everyone seems to be saying Balen must be taken seriously. Crazy times.",

I like Balen dai a lot, but he should remember that he won only 38% (60K Votes) of the votes in the mayor election in Kathmandu while the RSP got around 11% of the NATIONAL vote (11 Lakhs!!!). Currently, the RSP has a wayyyyy bigger mandate to lead the country than Balen or any other alternative force. I hope Kulman dai and Balen dai understand this. I am not going to include Harka dai in this because he seems off the rails.  It's so sad to see alternative parties bickering over who gets power even after the carnage of september 8. If we go into the elections divided, the old establishment will come back to power and will prosecute everyone that was involved in the peaceful protests. Jay Nepal|||He holds big power because general people think that a country is run by one person and he would magically solve all the problems and people treat him like a god. If people could they would give him unchecked power and make him a dictator and tell other people the beauty of democracy.   Even if the election were to happen then the majority would vote for the same parties and hope for a different outcome. They would be the first to complain that nothing would change in this country and all are bhedas.|||I don’t doubt the intentions of either Balen or Ravi but I think they including their fans and followers have descended into Olipath just as much. Unpopular opinion but Balen and Ravi both are no different than Oli (they could easily become like Oli or worse pretty soon).  Having said that, I too am tempted by the idea of the new and the ‘alternatives’ coming together but I find it very hard to believe that this will lead to anything more than an instant gratification for many Nepalis. I am genuinely scared at the power Balen supposedly holds right now, and I would rather have him explain and clarify his stance as to critical political agendas than hurrying to ride on that power.|||can’t say he is yet to be tested in elections; social media hype and election- entirely different things|||Balen needs to risk it all in the ultimate act of political gamble. Go against KP oli in jhapa. This will be the final symbolic victory over the incumbents.|||Alternative patti janey ho bhaney balen first RSP last|||Yes Balen holds huge power right now but is that only the perception or reality?? He's Mayor of KMC which is huge but KMC doesn't represent all of Nepal and it is not easy to run a political party in Nepal like you have to be hyper active and not be insulated. So I wonder if Balen decides to go it alone and join this Desh bikash party and fight election either on his own or at least ally with Kulman,'s party, what will be the result of that??   I think it will help Balen a lot if he joins RSP and becomes their PM candidate like Ghanti at this point is a well known election symbol, Balen can leave party management to Rabi and maybe Kulman (if he joins) and solely focus on winning his constituency and then planning on what he will do once he becomes PM. Alternatively, he can do alliance with RSP whereby he and some of his people will run on lauro election symbol but then RSP won't field candidates in areas where they run. Desh bikash party may get 10 to 15 seats or more and RSP can support Balen there. Of course in this situation Balen also has to manage a party with lots of different people.   So let's see what happens.|||He holds this immense power because he is the only person that has got this gut to change the future of Nepal at this point! And he has shown that he can maintain and enforce change as he did by being a Mayor alone. Change will take time but a confident and visionary leader must lead our country for some years for now  otherwise our country might stuck being 3rd world forever. I definitely believe he can change a lot of things and if all the right people like kulman and others come along to support him, our nation’s going to be great again.|||I think it only in these major cities only hou|||Dude must be thinking, kabhi kabhi toh lagta hai apun ich vagwaan hai...😆😆.

Kulman is similar, with a communist mindset - *free electricity after 10 years* and so on. Yes, many privately owned hydropower projects are going to be nationalized under the BOOT model, but free electricity? Really? Why would elites need free electricity? Does no one have the idea of using that money to create a fund for social security like Norway did?  A wave of populism leads nowhere. We saw that with Prachanda’s Maoists, we saw that with Oli, and now we might witness the same fate again.  People in Nepal hate capitalism, people hate FDI, but at the same time they want the country to be like Norway lol. They need to see how Norway utilized its resources, invited FDI to and created a trillion-dollar fund that backs social security. Without creating capital, nothing is possible. There is no one in Nepal doing politics by explaining this reality—not Rabi, not Balen, not Harka. Kulman is literally a communist.  Nepal’s general mindset needs to be reset, and we need a strong political figure to do that. Rabi, Kulman, and Balen *can* do that, I honestly think so. Nepal is a country where if FDI comes in, people start saying \"desh bechyo\". With this communist mindset, the country is not going anywhere, no country ever has, nor will. Even China had to open its markets to progress. Deng Xiaoping took a step forward to reset the mindset; he said, *“To be rich is glorious.”* We need leaders who can make people understand this. In Nepal, if someone becomes rich, they get abused. Politics needs to be grounded in reality. Free schools, cheap housing, free healthcare all sound cool, but Nepal is a country running a current-account deficit.  Even youth don't understand this reality, leave alone the older generation. All we want is free stuffs but have no damn idea where'll that come from. So we need political figures whom society trusts to explain this. Right now, that’s Rabi, Balen, and Kulman.  So yeah, you can be as excited as you want, but economically Nepal isn’t going anywhere with this mindset.  I want RSP balen kulman to come together and win, not because I’m optimistic about them (yet), but because I want the arrogance of the old parties to die. I want them to lose badly.

This wave of daleytantra is based more on the corrupt bureaucracy than the political class.|||Kulman ghising didn't said he will give free electricity. He said it can be done if we have enough will power. Nepal still need big hydro project to fulfil the demand.  As someone who has worked in energy sector for such a long time, he means he is optimistic. That's his target. The energy he thinks Nepal can produce.   Kulman Ghising has shown great maturity. He barely speak against anyone.  He has never single handedly taken credit for the end of loadshedding. A communist mindset won't do that.   He has shown great managerial skill.  He dedicated trunk line for the industries. He cut the expenses. He sold the excess energy to neighbours. Voila, for the first time in history NEA turns profitable. They are investing in many hydro project without the help of foreign aid. How amazing that sound. That 's not the communist mindset.  He has shown great leadership skill. A leader must decide. People are afraid to decide. They do not want to be in bad page. A leading person must do what is necessary. He should not be scared of criticism. A leader is action oriented.  MCC was needed. He supported it. Parliament approved it. He cut the lines of 30 industries that were not paying bills. He even went against PM. Now they will be paying in 28 installments. He knows how to be strict. And knows how to sort it out.  He knows how beurocracy work.  For Rabi and Balen, it will take time to understand the system. Kulman Ghising came out from that system. Beurocracy can't fool him. He knows the procedure, mindset, the people. He cancelled hundreds of bad contracts.  He himself is working 16/18 hours a day. Kulman Ghising is the best choice.  There are many countries with free health, free school, free housing, free transport etc. Even UK has it. Is UK a communist country.  No, They are socialist.  Do you know Free school education single handedly raised the number of students in Nepal. Free tiffin, books, bicycle for girls. These are the scheme that Nepal government launched successfully. Otherwise poor families weren't sending their kids.  Do you know how many lives governmental hospital is saving. Entire saving is gone in treatment. How is poor supposed to pay. Thanks to government hospitals.  Free is not always bad. People need it. It means a lot for poor people.|||Leader should come with \"nation first \" mindset.. Not someone who has personal interest in vengeance or fake legacy ..

I doubt nepali people will understand this.|||“Elites need free electricity?”, what do you mean by that? Please elaborate. First and foremost, social security is a ponzi scheme. So you’re telling me, we generate all sorts of income from hydropower and give it away to people as subsidies or SS fund?   What will the fund do? What will it go to? In a short run, that could work out but it won’t last forever as we all know.   Nepal can only be revived with a clear mindset and a strategic plan to take the responsibility of every consequence that occurs, be accountable, be aware, with honesty, dignity, a mindset reset (THAT’S BIGG, like you mentioned), honesty is a big part, investments, help from our neighboring countries, and with a commitment to build this nation on the ground it was formed.   Let’s not forget what this nation was and what it’s meant to be. It’s meant to  be the greatest and will be. We got this. Jay Nepal, Jay Himal, Jay Pahad, Jay Terai 🙏  And your mention on topics like Balen and Rabi are capable of bringing this nation back but when you get into the depth of the abyss, you find out that these people didn’t come in the times of scarcity, times when people were lost in the dark stage of destruction that happened in September. My only question is, “Why give away the responsibility to people who never really backed up this revolutionary plan ?”.   Your mention of Kulman doesn’t click in all the way but Kulam seems to have a strong stance on the succession of the MCC plan.|||You seem young and still learning, but wealth creation has nothing to do with capitalism or communism. It can be created in either system.   Nepal does not have oil fields like Norway to get rich quick also the Norwegian creating a common sovereign wealth fund that everyone owns is antithesis of capitalism.   A health mix where capitalism is kept on a short leash is likely the best path forward, if not we will have a bunch of madwari and politician get richer than god while the country remains in doldrums.  There is nothing wrong with what Kulman or Ravi's statement. NEA is there to provide service to Nepali people, It's not there to squeeze every single rupee out of 'customers', it already provides free electricity to low usage household, If it can sustainably lower household electricity bill, what's the harm in that?  I hope you will keep learning and grow out of redscare propaganda.|||Norway also Nationalizes Hydropower after 60 years .

The reason is simple: the college bus takes a very long route and ends up consuming almost three hours of her day just in travelling. We live in Budhanilkantha, and she studies in Baneshwor, so commuting is already tiring enough. For the next few weeks, I’ll be out of town, and she isn’t comfortable using ride-hailing services like Pathao or inDrive. This made me think—why can’t these platforms introduce a feature where both the rider and the passenger are women? On top of that, the company could waive its commission for female drivers and passengers. Such a step would promote women empowerment, provide an added sense of safety for the women in our families, and also strengthen the company’s CSR initiatives. Taxis are an option, yes, but since we live in Budhanilkantha, using taxis regularly isn’t practical. It’s not really about affordability—I just feel the pricing is often unjustifiably high.

            "body": "I want to share something that happened today. As we all know, pickpocketing is extremely common on public transportation. If you’re a regular public transport user, chances are you’ve witnessed it at least once. I’ve been using public buses for a long time, so I’ve seen this pattern many times.  Usually, these people come in groups. They act like they’re all friends, sit close to each other, talk loudly, and keep changing seats.  The same thing happened today. I was on a bus (Mayur Yatayat), when a group of four or five guys got on. I don’t know how to explain it exactly, but you could immediately feel that something was off. They sat near each other, kept talking, and kept switching seats, one moment here, the next moment somewhere else. That alone raised red flags.  What made it very clear was what happened near the Tinkune area. A group of passengers, they were from Terai region, got on the bus. As soon as they entered, one of these guys said, “naya manche chadyo, manche chadyo.” Immediately, one of them stood up, and the group moved close to the new passengers as if they were trying to get past them.  One of the passengers then said he felt someone’s hand inside his jacket pocket, trying to take his phone. A confrontation happened. They couldn't speak clear Nepali but you could easily understand them saying that they were pickpocketers. Immediately after that the group got off bus, as if nothing happened, ultei attitude ka sath.  What was even more frustrating was that another passenger (who was at the last seat) came forward and told the driver and conductor that he had seen these same people many times on this same route. According to him, they usually get on at Gausala and get off around Koteshwor. He said the drivers, conductors, and even the police knows about them, but nothing is done.  This is something I’ve been witnessing since I was a kid. These groups often create distractions, sometimes even fake fights, to divert attention. I still remember an incident from around 12/13 years ago when a group acted like they were fighting, and during that moment, a woman shouted that someone tried to pull the ring off her finger.  What made today even more depressing was that The driver as well as the conductor knew about these people. The guys later confronted the conductor asking him questions like: what about safety of passengers? Why do you let them get on despite of knowing who they are? And the conductor just hussed them off.  Even cops knows all this. We only hear about arrests during their Dashain operations, natra barsa bhari matlab gardeina police le pani.  Some might say, “Why didn’t you confront them?” By the time it became clear, they were already leaving. One of them was drunk, they were all huge and kept cursing, were aggressive, were in group. Getting into a physical fight with them isn’t realistic or safe. Yes record chai garna sakinthyo, but tyo bela dimag chalena.  This problem is way too common, and yet nothing changes. So in the end, we have to be responsible for our own safety. Because as the other guy said, groups like these are regular and he can even recognise them at this point.  If you’re a regular public transport user in Kathmandu, please stay alert and be careful.",

            "body": "I’m 23 and recently graduated with an engineering degree. Over the past few months, I’ve come to a difficult realization: I don’t enjoy studying or working in anything related to my academic field, and I don’t see myself doing this long-term. The thought of continuing down this path feels exhausting and honestly depressing.  On the other hand, I’ve discovered something that feels very different. I’ve started learning piano. I’m still a beginner, but I genuinely enjoy it in a way I’ve never felt about my studies. I can practice for hours without feeling tired, and I actually look forward to it. I feel confident that if I keep practicing seriously, I can become really good at it.  What scares me is the practical side. I know passion alone doesn’t pay the bills. I’m already an adult, and starting music seriously at this age feels risky and maybe unrealistic. I keep asking myself:   – Is it even possible to make a living from music at this point?   – Am I being irresponsible for wanting to give up a “stable” career path?   – How do people actually transition into music without ending up broke or regretful?  I’m not expecting instant success or fame. I just want a life that doesn’t feel empty or forced. I’m looking for genuine, realistic advice—especially from people who’ve switched careers, pursued music, or balanced passion with financial stability.  Any perspective would really help.

            "comments": "is it even late? 23 is so young, you have all the time on the earth.|||As someone who switched career and followed my passion much much later than you and is now happy with my decision, here is my advice.  1. Acknowledge that it is going to be very very very difficult. It will take its toll mentally. You'll have days/weeks/months/years of frustration where it will just be you and the piano. The audiences come later. You and your craft and the process. That is all you'll have to live with for a very long time.   2. People in your lives will constantly question your choice. Your family, your siblings, your friends, your loved ones. Almost everyone will tell that you're not being realistic. This will continue for the rest of your life. Be prepared for that.  3. Think hard what success means to you. Being rich and famous through arts is pretty rare in this country. You'll most likely never make a lot of money, have a rich lifestyle. Are you willing to change the definition of success to 'waking up every day and getting to do what you love'? It is okay if you want a more comfortable life. You'll have to decide.   4. It will take you a long time to get good at your craft. Get a formal training if you can. Once things get to a higher level, you might discover that you don't like it all that much.  5. If you want a more comfortable path to transition, you'll have to work twice as hard. Get a job and train yourself. Build savings and switch.  6. Build a good support system around you because that will be the difference between plunging into depression and staying mentally healthy.  6. Most importantly, have fun. None of this matters if you are not enjoying it, have a great set of friends around to share it with.  This is what I have for now. Cheers!|||23. How much do you watch social media? These things influence you a lot more than you realize. Planting ideas into your head about people living the live without having to give up anything. Yeah right.   I’m 45. Let me tell you. Anything worthwhile in life is going to be tough to get. A good spouse? You gotta put in a lot of work into the relationship. A nice big house? Be prepared to sink 10+ years of your life working your ass off to pay for it. A shiny degree? 2-4 years of your life being absolutely miserable learning all you can about your subject. A good physique? You guessed it. Sweat and tears at the gym for months before you see anything.   Engineering is not easy. Music is not easy. You can do the easy parts of it and feel good about it but mastery of anything is hard. Because it is mastery.  Rethink your decision. Base it on what really matters to you. Because either way you’re gonna have to put a shitload of work in.   Whatever you’re imagining putting into your engineering field imagine going through it again but for your piano. It’s not the easy way. You’ve already spent so much energy and pain into graduating in eng. think very carefully if you wanna go through the exact same thing with music cuz the grass will always look greener on the other side.   My recommendation is to do both. Work and find time for your hobbies. Focus on financial stability. You’re 23. Your choices now will resonate into your later years.|||Bro realistic kura garum hai ta, as you are already aware of the Uniq Poet scenario, he is working in the software fields along with music creations, rapping writing songs and so on.

I’m trying to understand whether I should continue searching for opportunities in Nepal or if there are specific entry-level jobs or paths that would make more sense for someone in my position.  I’m not afraid of starting small, learning from scratch, or even taking low-paying roles if they help me gain experience and skills. I just want to move forward instead of feeling stuck.

It is only required to enter to US & it is stamped on the passport which US immigration use to verify that you're a legal alien entering the country. If your visa stamp is expired but your visa status is not expired, you can legally be within the US but you cannot enter US if you travel outside the country. For most of the country, visa stamping needs to be done from their own home country. It can done from US as well but it's a very lengthy process, so most H1B holders prefer stamping in their own country. Yes, Nepalese also need to do this from US Embassy in Kathmandu. The reason why we don't see such thing in Nepal is because 70% of H1B holders are from India and Trump is now cracking down on immigration and making it harder for non-US citizen to live and work.",

You just need good time management skills and a routine man. for eg: my routine most times (kept it flexible)  is: - wake up, drink enough water, freshen up - yoga mostly for 30 mins ( recommend downdog app, free and really really good) (if no time then stretch and dynamic warmups to wake my body) - shower  - prep lunch, do anything - start working around 11ish am - lunch break at 1-2 ( i don't have breakfast , just prefer coffee at least 1/1.5 hrs after i wake up and after drinking enough water) - work again until like 7/8 pm ( MNC so different time zone clients) [ i do sometimes have a low pressure afternoon , so I make sure to micro-learn multiple stuffs all day long) ( and obviously sometimes i waste those hours scrolling, I'm a human after all) - eat any fruit, go to gym 8-10  - dinner mostly 5 eggs omelette ,some left over rice fried and cucumber carrots etc etc salad. - 11-12 learn something ( Obv most days I don't have energy to anything anymore and just scroll and fall asleep, but i try to be aware about it and be conscious about my choices)   repeat T_T this repeats until i burn out and then every 2 months or so and go for a hike or just travelling. life feels monotonous inside my room all day long. so i make sure to go out on weekends, if i have to study on weekend then i go study outside. in libraries or cafes. anywhere.|||Stronger back = no back pain.

            "body": "https://reddit.com/link/1pu16w7/video/vl4ctfovxz8g1/player  I just open-sourced the most thorough, in-depth Transformer (GPT-style) educational resource I wish existed when I was learning - complete with a blog and fully commented code that explains EVERY. SINGLE. LINE.      It consists of a decoder-only Transformer (GPT-style) built entirely from scratch in PyTorch with every single component explained through intuitive analogies. I also made animation scripts so that you can export your tensors as they are in your code so its even easier to learn.      If you are interested in how transformers work, what happens under the hood, I have written and built something for you.This is NOT a repo for building production GPT models. This is specifically designed for developing deep intuition about how Transformers actually work under the hood. This is for people, who find [Andrej Karpathy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrej-karpathy-9a650716/)'s nanoGPT complex.      You'll genuinely understand:   • Why self-attention exists and how it processes relationships   • What Q, aK, V matrices actually represent (not just mathematically, but conceptually)   • How multi-head attention captures different perspectives   • Why positional encoding is necessary   • How text generation works step-by-step   • Every optimization technique and its purpose      This is thorough. Really thorough. If you want a quick overview, this isn't it. But if you want to develop intuition so deep you could explain transformers to anyone, this is for you.        GitHub: [https://github.com/sajalregmi/transformer-from-scratch](https://github.com/sajalregmi/transformer-from-scratch)    Blog ( Without Code ): [https://arkios.ai/blog/6945f99ef05b167684906de6](https://arkios.ai/blog/6945f99ef05b167684906de6)     Blog ( With Code ): [https://arkios.ai/blog/6945eb9af05b167684906dbc](https://arkios.ai/blog/6945eb9af05b167684906dbc)",

So I want to ask:  * Is it **realistically possible** to get an IT job without an IT degree? * Do companies actually hire based on **skills, projects, and portfolio**, or is the degree a hard requirement? * Should I continue pushing into IT and build strong projects, or would it be smarter to **switch to a different career path**?

Many companies now focus more on what you can actually build and how well you solve problems. A strong portfolio of real projects often matters far more than a formal degree, especially for junior roles or in smaller teams and startups.  The key is showing that you truly understand what you are building. When you create projects with Python and Django, make sure you can explain every decision, why the code works that way, and how you fixed bugs along the way. Interviewers notice quickly if someone has deep understanding or just followed tutorials without grasping the concepts.  If you are genuinely interested and enjoy the process, keep going. Passion makes learning faster and helps you push through tough parts. But if you are forcing yourself into IT just for the job prospects without real curiosity, it can become very hard. Even people with degrees struggle and burn out when the interest is not there.  Your current path of self-learning and building projects is one of the best ways in. Focus on finishing a few solid applications, put them on GitHub, and start applying widely. Many developers broke in exactly this way. Stay motivated and keep building.",

It's better to learn Chinese than Hindi from a purely logical pov|||Knowing a language is always a good thing, and if the indian person has to communicate somehow in Nepal so it is not a problem if they use Hindi to communicate.      You know where the problem lies? We imitating extravagant foreign customs like haldi, mehendi, sangeet, dhanteresh, baby shower etc. This is what is going to erase our identity.|||Yeah. Fck hindi|||Nepali uses Devnagari script which is also originated in India, maybe stop using that as well?|||As a human, isn't it better if you know more languages? Same as saying I know Python, C, Java.....|||Lol.  Firstly, I think Nepalis being able to speak Hindi is a plus point. It makes us multilingual, which makes them comfortable. We've always prided ourselves for being more tolerant than India and also hospitable. I don't see a problem in using a language that we know. If you go to Spain and you talk to people in English, are you expecting people there get offended too? And before you say English is an international language, Spanish has more speakers than English.   Secondly, Nepal is not just Kathmandu. There are communities in the south that use Hindi as their language. Even Nepali marwadis in Kathmandu use it. It is one of the 120+ languages used in Nepal. You saying Hindi bad kinda implies they are not Nepalis.   Thirdly, you make an issue with Indians assuming Nepalis are Indians, while you're similarly assuming India is just north India. South Indians generally don't speak Hindi. They speak English. South Indians have a much better impression of Nepal.   Indians generally don't think Nepal is a part of India. But we're bordered with UP and Bihar, which are not exactly places that are particularly respectful. A lot of them think Nepal is a place with similar cultures so it's a safe and beautiful place to visit where they don't have to deal with much cultural shock. It's just that they often overstep boundaries (pun intended) and try to get overly close, which kind of freaks us out because Nepalis are more reserved than Indians imo.|||Protect your language and mother tongue.|||This post has been tagged as serious.

Most Indians understand Nepali, and many of them actively try to learn it as well. One Indian colleague even speaks Nepali as fluently as we do.  Over time, you realize that people genuinely make an effort to learn each other’s languages. South Indians generally have strong English skills, but many of them don’t speak Hindi, while people from other regions may not speak English as fluently. So they talk in Hindi when they saw us.|||Hindi xodeiu sathi ma mandarin pani sikdai xu largest diaspora, you don't know how easy it will be once you able to connect with them in their language.

Lol, they don't even know the patriotism of a Bangladeshi.|||knowing english doesn't makes you american.|||There are better problems to worry about|||I don't think Hindi is the problem but the real problem is our failure to not prioritize our own language and culture. I was surprised to learn that China and Korea mandate all their cartoons to be in their own language and that is just one example but for me Nepali feels quiet foreign and as someone who did my entire schooling in Nepal upto +2, I don't know how to read Nepali fluently and have a terrible handwriting. I dont even think in Nepali for the most part as most of the cartoons back in my day were all in English.   So, I think what is happening now is that we are trying to rescue a building that is already burned to ashes and blaming things that have nothing to do with us. India is a massive country and just a few encounters with a few assholes shouldn't be generalized. I lived in India for 4 years for my Bachelors and I would find a few of such people that were illterate and assumed Nepal speaks Hindi but I had the vast majority that did not have that assumption. What we need now is to rebuild what has been burned as atleast I feel like I have already suffered the damages. We need to focus on teaching kids to be comfortable with Nepali just as much as Hindi and English. I think having Hindi as an additional language is almost like a superpower as you get access too all their free educational content on Youtube and its always a better thing to know a few extra languages. I think this anti Indian sentiment will really hurt us in the long run and we need to make sure we have diplomatic and peaceful ties with both our neighbors|||Yes, we should not normalize Hindi..

He was associate professor (lowest) in ITP-CAS. He has only 3 years of teaching experience and that as a foreign ASSISTANT professor in COMSATS. Being an associate professor in a research institute doesn't give you \"experience\" to be recognized in university where teaching a class is essential. So his real experience is only 3 years. Also there are requirements for every job in every institute.  Hiring someone on higher rank just because of their reputation isn't professional in any organizations as it is unfair to other employees. Everyone will have to start from the same level.  First, he doesn't even have the eligibility to be considered anything higher than Assistant Professor since his teaching experience is insufficient.  Many universities have the following hierarchy, Lecturer<Assistant<Associate<Professor. Even in other countries, a full fledged professor in one \"UNIVERSITY\" will not become a professor in another university immediately.  Y'all are stupid. No wonder Nepal is the country with the lowest IQ.|||Meanwhile if you have a few good publication in top tier journals and have a degree from a good university, you get a direct route to becoming a lab head or a Professor in China.

Like how is TU determining and giving equivalency for degrees from the worlds best university when their own state is like a patient in ICU was beyond me but I had to as I couldnt move ahead without it.

But growing up, i defended my mom, became her best friend to talk to and to visit places and also involved my dad in those things and then he started doing all those romantic and cute stuffs like bringing flowers sometimes, gifting her something sweet or like just talking to her sweetly and showing a bit more of love and affection. And to see that change on my dads behavior is something that ill cherish forever.

But in my experience, when we show care  and respect , ( respecting there boundaries) in subtle way, it made look me  desperate and boring in relationships. Though I haven’t asked her how she feels. But yeah! It made me feel boring and desperate. But I often hear my female friends say, that’s what we want. It’s so much confusing 😮‍💨|||What dream sounds like, my father is a great Dad but a nightmare of a husband, he cheated on my mom and still does, mind you he is pushing 60’s.

Some father makes their children believe in love while some be the reason for them to not to believe in all these things.|||I wish I grew up in a home like this my dad is wonderful father but not a great husband .|||Having a definition of what love should look like it prolly the most toxic thing one can do in any relationships. This behavior will have you be the toxic one in your relationship. Every one is different and their way of showing love is different. Not all that shows affection the way you mentioned are honest and also vice versa.|||Yei matra bhako bhaye hunthiyo.

I vote yes.|||Gaarai hunxa sustain garna. Cause not many movies are released on IMAX, only mostly Hollywood blockbusters. And few cinephiles and movie enthusiasts maybe willing to pay extra and enjoy the IMAX experience but it's a very small number.|||It is extremely difficult to have a true IMAX theater. The Imax film is insanely huge. Transporting it safely, then a team who can actually operate IMAX is needed and the cost is obviously gonna be off the charts. Plus, most people in Nepal won't even be able to afford tickets. So it's highly unlikely we'll get IMAX thetre anytime soon. Even most (if not all) the IMAX theatres in India aren't true IMAX theatres. They're all projected digitally I think. Testo khalko IMAX chahi maybe we can get sometime in the future. Idk about that. Hopefully we do.|||Nope: imax is expensive tech. License will cost millions: tickets will be in thousands. It’s impossible to achieve scale with this technology.|||Who's gonna invest? Who's gonna watch? I also think IMAX would be great and would like to watch movies there, but I don't see a big market for both investors and people who watch it. Normal Hollywood movie nai 600+ xa tickets aile. Jhan IMAX ayo vani 1800+ hunxa sure. Who's gonna watch paying that much? Maybe there are some rich people BUT not big enough market for investors to feel secure of ROI.|||IMAX ma movie herna paunu would be a dream come true. I think it’s a dream for many of us cinephiles. But to be realistic, there’s no way we’re getting IMAX here in Nepal.  As many people in the comments have already mentioned, it’s expensive, hella expensive. Bringing IMAX itself is costly. Then there’s the cost of maintenance and operation, which is huge. I don’t think any sane investor would want to take that risk.  Even the cinema halls we have right now, which I won’t say are great, but are at a decent level, aren’t able to upgrade themselves properly or even run consistently. So there’s no way IMAX is happening.  I also read some of your other comments where you said many cinephiles would be willing to come to Kathmandu to watch movies in IMAX. I agree. For any cinephile, watching their favorite movie in IMAX would be a dream come true. But IMAX isn’t a one-time thing; it needs regular footfall. No one is going to keep coming to Kathmandu every time just to watch a movie. It’s not time-feasible, money-feasible, or practical in any way.  Even in India, with such a massive population, maintaining IMAX is a big challenge. Now think about Nepal. Nepal is a small country with a relatively small population. There’s simply no way IMAX could sustain itself here.  On top of that, I recently read that many youth-focused businesses, movies, restaurants, cafes, clothing stores, are already struggling because the youth population is decreasing. Compared to decades ago, there are far fewer young people in the country now. Even these businesses are finding it hard to survive.  In a situation like this, there’s no chance anyone will invest in bringing IMAX to Nepal. Realistically, we’re never getting IMAX here because we just can’t sustain it.  That said, like you, I also wish I could watch my favorite movies in IMAX. IBut yeah I was just being realistic.|||if there was market to justify the investment, we'd have IMAX already.|||I don’t think there’s a market lol. Even regular prices are expensive, imagine double triple that.|||We don't need that shit. We just need a 4k native screens.|||It does not|||No, the maintainance cost is too high for IMAX|||No|||Skyrocket on Popcorn, and cold drinks price|||Nope.|||Noo lmao  Probably wouldn't succeed to run it|||yes we do and people worry about a their wallet. imax provides movie experience than any other cinema they use cameras used for space the quality of the is 4k from a projector the sound is ass shattering and i think a 1000rs is justifiable|||I votes yes cus I would also want those exclusive popcorn buckets and even some freebies and the most important of all those 4d seats|||Unless Nepali film industry makes 10 imax movies atleast a year, it will never happen, it’s that simple.|||No. You would be in the minority who would pay 1000+ for imax tickets. There's a reason why even places like australia, the vast majority of the population does not care about imax. Also, how many movies are actually made for imax, very few so its really not that important.|||Have you watched avatar 3 ?|||Bro these comments. 1000rs ma Imax re bro are u fr? India 1000 ic ma herya yaad cha malai. Nepal ma 2-3K ko range ma huncha lol. or even more|||![gif](giphy|spfi6nabVuq5y)|||What's ISMX Cinema? 📽️|||'Because  ~~Batman~~ imax is the hero  ~~Gotham~~ nepal deserves, but not the one it needs right now  ![gif](giphy|B4jfJqiIxvU08)  .|||Avatar 3 esmai herna paye hunthyo 60 fps ma 🥲|||Im not that huge into film but i have tried going to nepal ko movie hall and i have experienced imax aswell, honestly couldnt tell the difference|||Ya'll don't have one ???  Atleast in sl, the tickets are double the price. If it's worth it or not is upto the individual but it's for sure a different experience. If u dont like cinema's in general then Imax won't change it. If u do, then yes it's worth it but for select movies which are almost all Hollywood ones.|||Yeahh broo Nepal ma ni auta imax theater ta hunu parni ho k manchhe haru lai India janu parchha|||Not a big enough market to sustain. Maybe during big blockbuster releases they might be able to sell a few tickets. But most of the year they'd have to endure a huge operating cost. Maybe in a few years it might be viable but as an investor better put money elsewhere|||As a movie lover, yeah.|||What is one less than imax? I think that might be better.|||the amount it would require to build one is too expensive and i don't think nepal has any malls that would be able to incorporate it.|||Not worth it|||Actual imax theater hunu paryo not that digital one.|||tbh maybe no.. cause i am in nyc rn and a regular imax goer. to function the imax screen is no joke the cost is sooo high that only few theaters can afford. even in usa these are not very common. tho there are talks about installing new screens across the country before The Odyssey but the same problem,,, it is so expensive.  and again not every movie shines better on imax screen. most of the movies looks awful. I think Nepalese market is not sustainable enough to afford it rather i would love to see cheaper theaters in Nepal that will make footfall larger ig.|||hamro biratnagar ma vako eauta QFX pani jalaidiyen|||For entertainment yes, for the business , heck no.|||Even India just hv one true 70mm (15/70 projection) IMAX.|||No|||imax worthy movies eta dherei release nai gardenan vako navako eutei ho|||No|||NO, and its in caps.

(People call it is not real)  The thing is, people would make any man who said, \"God visited me in my dreams\" or \"I am the son of God,\" their prophet and women who said it, they would treat her as a schizophrenic. Just look at what they did to Joan of Arc when she said that Gkd told her to.lead an army. Theres also the origin of Mormanism. If you look into it, the dude bullshitted out of being caught about bullshitting. And that religion itself is so fucking predatory and oppressive that Christians dont even view them as Christians but like a cult. Do you know how bad you have to be if no branch of Christianity considers you to be Christian? Really fucking bad. Jahovah's witness ko ta kurai nagarm. If religion was made for community, then Jahovah's witness was made to isolate people and remove happiness from the world.  Don't get me wrong, I have my own issues with Islams (the way bangladeshi killed that hindu man was uncalled for even if their allegation was true) Infact, I have my issues with all the Abrahamic religions as they all treat other religions the same way: with contempt and a sense of arrogance. They have destryoed a lot of cultures and history all around the world because, \"God wills it.\" And they still continue to fight amongst each other because they dont realize that they serve the same god.  This doesnt mean that the Hindu religion is perfect. Aata ni bhagawan ko naam ma kati dherai atrocities committ bhaeko xha, especially against women ra \"lower\" caste ka manxhe haru, and even homosexual ra transgender manxhe haru (but that was most likely the result of EIC meddling in Nepal ko politics and that turned into religion) and all that. Mero bua ko phupu didi was widowed at 16 because she got married to an old man at a very young age, you know why? \"Means huno bhanda aagadi chori ko bihe bhayo bhane chori pakkai swarga ma janxhe.\" Sounds like making a way for a pedophile to marry a young girl to me.  You can critisize Islam for having a pedophile for a prophet and how it doesn't condem pedophilia. I do too. Tara you cannot act like every other religion isnt the same when it comes to protecting and enabaling pedophilia kinaki every religion has had a pedophile and predators leading their place of worship, and even hinduism, because the title comes wirh protection for their crimes and devotion from the people, and LOTS and LOTS of money. Catholicism ko ta kura nai nagaram cause Catholic priests haru le bhurabhuri haru lai molest gareko ta sterotype nai bhaisakyo.  Dont make this thing with Epstien a religion issue, its a politics, pedophilia, and a money issue. I am sure ki there are many richer than the world muslims who visited the Island, but the key word here is RICH. Epstien would let anybody in the island as long as they were rich, or a child they can exploit.|||I can't believe day would come nepali liberals will defend literal pedophile in comments not talking about epsiten btw|||Most people were Epstein 1500 years ago chill.

I struggle to fit in with my friends, put forward my opinion in mass with fear of idk what prolly judgement. This wouldnt be problem to me if i were like this in the past. I really was a confident person with strong opinion",

Previous BPKIHS, KU, IOM, PAHS entrance exams were very tough as compared to recent year's MEC exam!! Even the MAT exam questions papers of PAHS were made By Queensland University Australia which was very dangerous in terms of difficulty!!! Nowadays, if you prepare at your home with a strict routine with a familiar environment with the food made by your mom, then you will surely get a seat in your choice. There are lots of authentic online resources for FREE, just use it properly!!! Good luck!!!|||IMO self study is better, if you're having difficulties doing that then ig ambition could be a choice.  I did take the bridge course from them (1 month late) and didn't study that much, but their platform felt great honestly. Had daily rapid fires, could browse older sessions, provided notes and all.  I believe they provide 3 days of free access, try it and out and decide for yourself|||worth it",

From grades 8–10 I took home tuition, but for +2 it’s really expensive, so I want to switch to group tuition at a centre. I’ve also tried online tuition before, but I honestly couldn’t focus well. In a proper class setting, I do much better, so a tuition centre is what I’m looking for.  I’ve looked on Facebook, but all I find are home tutors. I want to know where I can actually look for tuition centres that offer group classes.  Also, for people who have been to such centres before, I wanna ask how much do they usually charge and are the classes held every day or around 2–3 days a week?",

However, for the sake of national security and peace, such measures remain essential for VVIPs. Whether we like them or not, an attack on a high profile figure can disrupt our national peace and damage our international reputation for years to come.  ​We can never be certain who might be planning an attack on a VVIP or for what purpose. These individuals hold their status for a reason, and they will have followers regardless of whether we perceive their character as good or bad. There will always be those who fight for their \"masters\" or those who have something to gain from these VVIPs, for them, personal interests and loyalty will always take priority over the country’s wellbeing. If an attack occurs, our country’s stability can derail overnight and Western media and racists in west love to make fun of \"third world countries\" to feel superior regardless of fact that they have been through worse. The global protocols built over centuries of human experience teach us that it is not worth risking national peace over the minor, occasional inconveniences caused by VVIP convoys.",

            "body": "As it says, I recently got this and was hoping for some help, especially on the markings. There isn’t a ton of info on these in English so I figured I’d do to the source. My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6. This is probably the longest shot of them all, but any ideas what species of critter might have eaten up the stock at one point? I put a picture of it on picture 2, I was thinking some type of termite or wood worm.",

During the Rana regime (1846–1951), gun manufacturing in Nepal was driven largely by the innovative efforts of Gehendra Shumsher, the eldest son of Prime Minister Bir Shumsher, who is widely regarded as Nepal's first scientist and modernizer of the military.   Key Manufacturing Factories  The Ranas established several sites for arms and ammunition production, primarily centered in the Kathmandu Valley and some regional hubs:   Nakkhu (Lalitpur): Notable for producing copies of the Martini-Henry rifle, specifically the \"De-Rifle\" in the late 1880s.  Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.  Jangi Megjin: Originally founded in 1793, it continued to function during the Rana period as a government foundry for manufacturing cannons and military equipment.|||You need someone from the Hanuman Dhoka Museum in Kathmandu. They’ll be able to clarify for you. Your next best bet is if you can convince one these redditors (or they do it out of sheer curiosity) and visit the museum to see if they can glean more info about your gun.   Most of the folks that come here are students and a majority of the population has no interest in guns.   All the best! Also I wouldn’t be surprised if this is actually British Indian made as Nepal might not have had the capacity to produce guns.|||Where did you buy?|||Looks 188 to me.|||Yeah the damage is likely done by termites.

            "body": "Bail does not mean someone is innocent or guilty. It just means that rather than keeping a person in prison while waiting for their trial (so they don't escape), they are set free for the time being. They have to give the court a large sum of money as a \"deposit\" so they are inclined to return.  If they show up to court as promised, they get their money back. If they run away, the court keeps the cash and sends the police to find them. It isn’t a decision on whether they did the crime, it’s just a way to let someone live their life until the judge or jury makes a final decision. This is usually done if the person in question does not have a high risk of escaping or evading from police.",

The person is required to follow the court orders, e.g., appearing in court on the date of hearings/schedules and not leaving a specific area or boundary, and following any other orders set by the court. If any of these orders are violated, the bail money is forfeited. Otherwise the money is returned after deducting some applicable court fees (if any) once the case is closed or a sentence is made.|||Exactly as you said if defendant is not flight risk and not risk to himself or others they can pay bail to wait for court date. Free up resources.|||In common law, right to bail or presumption of bail is based on the severity and the offense and the likelihood of accused posing an unacceptable risk to the community. Financial crime (white collar crime) usually favours bail provision once the defendants satisfy no flight risk.

But when it comes to GTM, growth, marketing, or just figuring out how to actually sell and scale a product… there’s a huge gap.  Most startups here are run by tech engineers, and naturally, the focus is on building the product perfectly. That’s great, but then things like growth strategy, customer acquisition, positioning, and distribution get ignored. People just assume if you build it, users will come. Spoiler: they don’t.  Most of the startups here in Nepal fail less because the product is bad, but instead because the distribution/game-plan is weak.   Here in Nepal, GTM skills aren’t really taught, nor are they considered “cool” compared to coding. Most people in IT industrychase programming jobs, freelancing gigs, or outsourcing contracts because that’s a safer bet financially.  I think this is actually a huge opportunity. Someone who can master GTM skis here like: user research, acquisition channels, funnel optimization, sales psychology could easily dominate the startup scene.   Instead of just learning yet another JS framework, you should also learn GTM skills.   What do you guys think?",

Now contrary to that you've Indonesia which is also a majority Muslim nation but follows Sufism school of thought which is why they are much more liberal. They're okay with currency having Ganesha, okay with garuda being national symbol(coat of arms), and even okay with naming kids from Sanskrit derived names like majority of their head of the states have Sanskrit origin names there will be some ups and downs in writing because Indonesia didn't follow devanagari it followed the Brahmi script earlier, in that way it's still preserving the culture. But if you tell this to a MUSLIM.from south Asia he will say it's shirk/haram in islam and that being associated with polytheism is bad and that they are a lost tribe of Turks and Arabs who had invaded our land.

Reading the other comments got me thinking  1. Being abusive only escalated things. 2. What is wrong is wrong, I dunno what the procedure for BSF to enter each other countries is, with the open border and all, but I'm sure they are only able to enter after some permission from each other's authorities. If that is not the case here, then it's wrong and us Indians should accept that. 3. Nepal is a beautiful country. People have more civic sense and overall better sense of community and cohesion from what I have seen.  4. What Nepali people have to understand is India is a big country 1.4 billion people is a lot. So, of all the counties in the world, India is probably the only one you should never generalize. 6. Both Nepali and Indian people can have good relationship with each other, just learn to talk properly and not take things to ego. 6. Yes, India is a bigger economy, and has more resources, but it is not in competition with Nepal. Nepal has it's own strengths that it should not forget.  7. Open border has it's pros and cons. Yes, many Nepali are in India, do they get to build a life, yes. Do they get discriminated, yes, and so are Indians from other states. And Nepali also discriminate against Indian tourists and workers. 8. Always remember, most average Indians will probably only have good will towards Nepal and no hate.  9. It is very important that rather than spreading unnecessary generalized hate, we judge people on individual basis.

            "body": "So I (27M) went to India for the first time. I was traveling solo turns out it was a bad idea. It was for work related events. After the event, I decided to explore a few places.   Until the work event, everything was fine. It was great learning and networking in the event. I actually speak Hindi very fluently so communication wasn’t an issue at all. After the event, I wanted to travel and explore.   I had booked a pretty average room for my accommodation. Nothing fancy, just the most budget friendly one I could find. There were a couple of people in the lobby and they greeted me nicely and asked for my ID. I showed them my passport and their faces instantly changed after seeing my Nepali passport. The guy said oh you’re from Nepal. I said yes and the another man said, this doesn’t work, we need to see an Indian ID. They weren’t smiling anymore and were giving me very skeptical looks. I tried not to overthink it. He kept insisting for an Indian ID and I explained to him that I am not from India, it’s my first time here so it’s not possible for me to have an Indian ID. Then they asked me for my contact number and I gave my phone number (didn’t have Indian number). Once again, they kept on asking for an Indian number. I was really surprised seeing their hospitality instantly changed after learning about my identity. Not sure if they did that because I was a foreigner to them or because I was specifically a Nepali guy.   While I was exploring the local market, I went to buy some souvenirs. One shop guy asked me where I was from and I said Nepal. He then started lecturing me saying don’t be close with China. They will do the same to you what Pakistan is doing to us. He kept yapping about how Nepal is a small part of India and that we should be grateful that we have a “bada bhai” like India. I left the shop without saying anything.    I wanted to travel by train but had absolutely zero idea about it. The people weren’t helpful there either. I was asking the various staff in the train station saying I wanna go here where can I find a ticket. They just vaguely pointed go there, it’s over there. Finally one guy at the ticket counter helped me get tickets after nearly couple of hours of running frantically here and there. I told him I’m not from India, traveling by train for the first time. The counter guy gave me a ticket saying this is for general class, it’s not safe to travel there..very crowded and chaotic, after your train arrives, meet the ticket guy and ask him to upgrade to AC compartment. I thanked him and went to the platform. There was a police officer whom I asked about upgrading the ticket. He too said the same thing i.e. meet the ticket guy once your train arrives and he will help you.   I still had about 3-4 hours before my train arrived. I just stayed in the platform watching movie. After the train arrived, I was frantically searching for the ticket guy. One police officer came near me charging with his baton. I was shit scared. He almost charged me saying why are you in the AC compartment with a general ticket in your hand. I was literally shaking at this point and with a shaky voice, I explained him my situation. He said haven’t you been in a train before where are you from. I said I’m from Nepal and he laughed saying oh you guys don’t even have trains there haha. Are you really from Nepal, your eyes don’t look like Nepalese. (I think he was referring to Mongolian eyes). I saw the ticket guy and went to him. He said me go to this seat and I’ll come. Later, he came to me and upgraded my ticket. The journey was a little over an hour long. And I was constantly replaying the entire experience from the hotel to the local market to the train station police guy.    Not sure if I just happened to meet all the wrong people or that everyone is the same there. Either way, I’m not going back to India for a long time. And I haven’t even mentioned the kids constantly following you begging for money, the dirt and litter everywhere, people peeing and even pooping in the open, unnecessary horns, air pollution.   PS: not trying to spread hate— just sharing my personal experience.",

Which cities did you visit, by the way? and as far as I know, many hotels in India especially smaller ones usually avoid foreigners because of paperwork and FRRO/police registration requirements. It’s better to stay at big hotels or resorts while traveling. I personally mostly stay at resorts, especially Club Mahindra ones they’re quite good, with solid service.  Also, try to do everything online in India train bookings, hotels, cabs. That way you’re much less likely to get scammed or harsh treated. Offline train ticket booking is honestly very hectic, even for Indians, so always book train tickets online. Use the official IRCTC website or authorized partners like MakeMyTrip, ConfirmTkt, or Paytm then you won’t face these problems.  And if you remember the time, location, duration, or the office name, you can also register a complaint on the Rail Madad portal or app. Lastly, there’s a huge generation gap in India you’ll mostly hear such racist things from older people or those in the 30–40 age group, but the younger generation is usually nicer and more helpful .You can even see this generation gap while speaking English. If you start speaking English in front of older people, they often treat you like some different person almost a ‘raja sahab’ type. But with the younger generation, it usually doesn’t make much of a difference. Anyway, I hope your journey was safe.|||Mods, how much racial abuse is tolerated here?

            "body": "My college head and a friendly botany teacher who has seen thousands of students always says just do enough to pass all subjects. Thats it. Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

I'm in a bit of a dilemma and would really appreciate some advice from this community: BBA vs. BBS? I'm leaning towards a management degree, but I'm unsure about the key differences between BBA and BBS programs in Nepal, especially regarding career prospects and curriculum rigor. Given my science background, which one might be a better fit?  Best Colleges near Lalitpur? Could anyone recommend the top-tier management colleges located near Lalitpur/Patan?  Am I too late for admissions? I just passed out in 2025. Have admission cycles already closed for this intake?  The Abroad Factor:  My primary reason for joining a local college immediately is to avoid a gap year, just in case my visa application for abroad studies gets rejected down the line. I want to have a safety net and continue my education smoothly. Any insights, recommendations for colleges, or general advice on navigating admissions timelines would be incredibly helpful right now.",

            "body": "Namaste rNepal,  My name is Mahendra. I wanted to share an update about my father’s health and the situation my family is currently facing.  My father has been diagnosed with metastatic gallbladder cancer, which is a very aggressive form of cancer. Since the diagnosis, our days have been filled with hospital visits, tests, medicines and treatment plans. On 30 November, he completed another round of chemotherapy. He is fighting bravely, but the side effects and the emotional strain have been extremely difficult for him and for all of us.  we come from very lower middle class family but with a dream to make me engineer and a good human my dad put all his life and sacrificed everything. He worked as a security guard in india din vari ubhiyar kaam garnu vo , hamro sapna pura garna lai and  i still  wonder \"why us\" ? He never consumed alcohol,cigarette, tombakhu or anything that is said to cause cancer now when he is admitted at hospital the main head of the family and i have to lookafter all the expenses i understand why all it happen. the burden of money to manage for studies, run family and survive was really hard for us but he never show us. That dherai chintaa about managing money became the cause for the cancer ig , chintaa le ni cancer hudo raicha. My dad is now ,, he's a cancer patient god!! I was a guy learning and doing everything to pass exams nthg more than that and still use to feel sometime \"life kati garo cha yrr,, Yo sem  ma pass vaidiana and all,,  and suddenly life put me in a place where I had to become the pillar of the family. being student and not even earning it's being extremly hard for us.  I am doing everything possible  via writing, reaching out, asking for help — because I don't want to lose my father. He is still hopeful. He still smiles even on the hardest days.  We have already used all our savings and borrowed money to continue his treatment. The cost of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, scans, tests and medicines has become overwhelming for our family. With the help of kind people, we have managed to raise a little over NPR 3 Lakhs so far, which helped cover the initial cycles, but we still have many more ahead.  I am sharing this post to provide a clear and honest update about our situation. I am not asking anyone to do work on my behalf. Anyone who wishes to support us in any form may do so if they feel comfortable. Even reading this and keeping my father in your thoughts means a lot to us.

Cholangiocarcinoma aka gall bladder cancer. He was 3rd stage when we received the diagnosis. Fortunately, the treatments worked and he's in total remission. He's recovered and cancer free for 4th year running.   He had lesions best the duct, with initial spread to lymph nodes.   We got treatment at Nepal Cancer Research Hospital, Chemo and radiation. And surgery at Teaching Hospital.   I don't remember the exact chemo meds, the radiation was about 17 18 cycles and the surgery went decently well.   There is hope brother, the financial strain was absolutely tough. I don't know if you can it lucky or not but my old man was a civil servant and this was right during COVID-19. I was studying, so had free time and he also didn't have to go to work. Everyone was supportive. I guess we spent close to 15 20 lakhs over all, some of which were covered by insurance and some were donations collected by kins and friends.  So, don't lose hope man. And idk but I would like to suggest consulting Dr Sudip at NCHRC hattiban if you decide to continue here in Nepal since it worked in my case. And it's a specialized facility, and they have a lotta data and experience with this stuff. Also, state of the art equipment.|||I don’t know how you’ll take this advice, because most people only follow mainstream chemo treatment for cancer. But I’ve read many testimonies on X about treating cancer with protocol using ivermectin, fenbendazole and other medicines. Which in most cases treated completely 4th stage cancer after following through the medications for 6 months +. Just letting you know these aren’t that expensive medicines, may be available in Nepal as well if not they’re easily available in India. And can be taken parallel to the current treatment. Found this guy on X “Dr William Makis”. Just sharing what I came across, it’s upto you to make the judgement though. Do your own research.

That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.

I never entertain anyone who assumes I speak Hindi and doesn't see a difference between our cultures and languages. I never willingly consume Indian media and always try to give Nepali content more of my attention. I think it's high time we did something about the rampant encroachment of not just Indian but also Western culture into our collective psyche.|||Bro, why did you even start speaking hindi ????   Your language is your weapon. Since hindi is not your identity, you have a disadvantage. They look down on you if you speak their language with them. That’s literally saying: you are my master, i will follow you.   You will only be a sidekick on someone else’s story.   You have more control and power over your own language. You can say anything in Nepali and no one can correct you cus you are the native speaker. You are fluent and can express yourself better. That gives you the leverage to take a stand for yourself.   I am surprised, that you used to speak hindi man. You compromised your language for their convenience. Ofcourse they will treat you like their follower.

I live in Delhi and even I speak more English than Hindi. Anyway, like some guy here said language is just a medium of exchange. I doubt the people who are making you feel inferior will automatically stop doing so if you stop communicating in Hindi.

The problem with my iPad remain unsolved though.  But if somebody (Normally senior citizens) asks for help in Hindi, I help them with my broken hindi.|||Agreed.

So from that day I have stopped speaking in Hindi to Indians and other people I only speak in English.|||Exactly.  Most Nepalis think it shows intelligence or something by speaking Hindi or broken hindi.  Speaking hindi as a Nepali is the best way to show that we are somehow part of India.   I have also seen firsthand that that some Indians will treat you shittier if you speak their language. Its not all indians, but there are too many.   Cmon people have some self respect. |||Yes, either speak Nepali or English, no other language|||wtf even talk in hindi|||I don’t really hang around Indians that much and whenever I do I just say I don’t understand Hindi at all. Which forces them to talk to me in English. Also whenever I mention I’m Hindu they’re like we have the same religion and all. I like to tell them that even tho we have the same religion our practices are different and I am not familiar with their practices and beliefs. I just try to separate myself and our country from them as much as I can, cause we’re not the same. I don’t like those who try to be like them in terms of everything. Like please have your own identity.|||Yaar ma hindi YouTube channel kholnu lako I'm Nepali but Indian audience is large 😭🙏💔🥀|||[deleted]|||It's unfortunate you had that experience, but Hindi is the 3rd most spoken language in the world, right behind English and Mandarin.   To tell someone to stop speaking that language isn't going to fix the issue. You should be confident and talk to the people who make you feel this way that Hindi is not your native language and you can only converse in a limited way. Any person who insults you by considering you \"inferior\" is stupid and arrogant. You have to call them out on it.   Since you are in Canada, there are many people who speak French. And French is the 6th most spoken language in the world. If you can learn it and speak, that'd give you a boost in talking to more people. It doesn't always have to be English.   Language is just a medium to communicate. It doesn't belong to any particular nation or a group of people. Don't be afraid to speak out your thoughts.   In Nepal, if you can't speak English well, the people consider you illiterate. It doesn't matter how good you can speak Nepali or a native language.  It's the behaviour and expectations of people in language that's judged.|||Bruh you need job application|||I dont think hindi is the problem here,instead that emploer.|||We should tell that to Nepali wanna be Bollywood’s artists also.|||This but speaking in hindi for indian tourist, why do we do that?|||It always depends on personal experience.

I used to say no, i am from nepal. But i started straight up saying i am not indian instead of nepal. Cuz the more i said nepal as a answer to they \"which state are you from\" question, i found them interpreting it as something like nepal is a part of india🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ and if someone asks me 'Are you from india?' I just say 'No' and that's the end of my answer. 😆😆😆 it bugs people so much and unless people ask me 'where are you from' i just avoid that question after 'No'|||Speak whatever the f you want and don't make it a national issue.

Most of the people in brazil speak Portuguese, does that change their identity? Most of the people in nigeria speaks english, does that change their identity?   Also just to let you know we share almost exactly the same culture, there is no difference.  No one is forcing you to speak hindi, even in india, many people can't even understand a word of it.   No need to hide the hate behind the words like 'our own identity's or ' our culture' or anything else. You directly say you hate indians, why? it's a trend now days to hate indian culture, skin colour, language or anything that comes from india.  You can google how much india has contributed in the development of nepal and also how nepal has contributed to the development of India. You will see the clear difference in how much India has helped  your country, but still if you want to fall for a trend then go on, we won't care cause we won't be affected.|||If we look at the Fact,  Nepali language is derived from Hindi and Urdu. We use same devnagiri script. Whereas many local languages are marginalised.|||Whenever I’ve switched from English and then spoken to someone in Hindi, I’ve felt a commonness and even respect. Being tri-lingual is a skill, not a downgrade.   I go to small family owned grocery store, I greet them in Hindi and they say namastey, and my usual the liquor store guy asks me how I’ve been doing and gives me discount.   Language was invented by humans to make connections. Rather than saying dont speak a particular language, maybe saying something about how to develop relationships would have been better.|||This post and the comments just reek of inferiority complex.|||Learning any language is good not speaking them in front of them is your choice.  If you don't want to speak in Hindi, that's fine, although Hindi and Nepali words are so much similar just the structure of sentences is what makes the difference between them(These similarities  made me understand the language more , listen to the song and even sing them as if I were an native speaker) .   If you show some love to the language outside of the valley will be even more meaningful as most of the language spoken out of the Valley is at a decreasing rate.  It will help save the culture and language, I would like you to focus on that.  Hey, just to be cleared I'm not trying to force you here. It's your choice at the end.|||I speak Hindi to my Nepali family for fun. but with exaggeration|||After reading all the comments I got to know that nepalis hate indians to the core just one bad instinct is enough to rage them against indian.

Good luck.|||dude you're just like me, but 10 years ago. i've been exactly where you are and it sucks ass. i had to maintain multiple jobs because none would pay on time, and i had to support my parents and two siblings. so when i say i know what you're going through, i mean it. and as much i appreciate people being nice here, no one (except for one) is trying to help you navigate this shituation.  the one thing that you need more of isn't money or opportunities, its time. **you need more time**. more time for proper sleep, more time to gather your thoughts, more time to pause and evaluate your current situation, more time to plan out the next few months. you're like a engine that's constantly running 24/7, and you haven't had the chance to rest for a single moment, and it sucks soooo much because as much as you want to stop, you just can't. its all on you, everything depends on you, and you have to keep moving, or else everything will fall apart. and this will only end one way, and its not good dude.  thats why you have to take your time back. you need at least 2 more hours of sleep (sleeping an hour early and waking up 30 minutes late). at least 1 hour of free time to plan your next steps. you weekends need to be for yourself, and yourself alone. whatever precious time you have, you keep it and don't let anyone or anything take it from you.   if you have college every morning, talk with the administration and ask them to let you check-in an hour late - explain your situation, tell them that you have no other option; this worked for me, and will work for you.  if you have small spare time where its not too long to start working but not too short to just sit around (like 25-40 minutes of downtime), just get to the next task/next job. baru duita day shifts ko bich ma kei downtime hunai nadeu. inform your office you'll arrive early and leave early. explain that you have a tight schedule and you don't want to waste your time. companies will try to make up some nonsense about proper timing and all that bullshit but don't let them bully you to submission. ask them to understand your situation, and make up shit like you also study and go to college everyday and do your assignments daily because you're a weak student, and normally don't get enough sleep because of that, so instead of just wasting time after college, you just come to work early - you know, make it sappy if that helps. but whatever you say, make sure that they let you leave early. take back your time.  if this helps you gather even 1-2 hours extra everyday, thats the time you can invest on yourself now. if you can get home by 5pm instead of 6:30pm, thats around 3 hours before your night shift starts. you can use that time to either plan your next move. work on your portfolio. add things to your showreels that you wish you could but weren't allowed to. talk with your parents about what you're going through and ask them to help you with planning for the future. like the other user said, actually start tracking all your expenses and see where all your money is going. excel is free in the browser, and you can search for \"excel free budget templates\". categorize all your expenses and see where the money is being wasted. do you smoke regularly? are your lunches expensive? is your electricity bill too high? not a single rupee goes untracked. you need every penny to be accounted for. if there's an unnecessary expense, cut it out completely. the more you can save, the easier it will be for you.  you can also request your night shift company to let you start early, and end early. sounds like it's a remote job, so your reasoning could be that you're already free by 6pm, and instead of waiting around, you'd like to start early when you're still feeling energized and not drained of energy by 3 in the morning. you can give your work report by 12 midnight and go to sleep 30 minutes early, even.  if you travel by bus or micros, take that time to complete errands that can be done via your phone. create a checklist for what you need to do before you can apply for better jobs. look for potential companies that have a good company culture (normally has better pay too). connect with past colleagues online just to say hi (this one might feel weird at first but its better to say hi how are you rather than hi do you have a job in your company). update your expense tracking sheet. look for templates and plugins that can help your portfolio be better than the rest.  spend every single free minute to get yourself on a better situation.  you're drowning every hour every day, but you're taking the first step towards pulling yourself out. it's going to be difficult the next few months and you may feel more drained than ever, but if you do all these for yourself, you'll be in a much better mental state in the next couple of months. here's to hoping that you update us in a few months that you got a job that pays as much as all three jobs combined 🤞  all the best. do yourself proud.|||On person told me, rather focusing making money from 2-3 small jobs. Be professional at single then! You can make more from one single job.  But right now I'm also in your situation searching for day jobs.|||I just want to add one more thing…  if anyone here knows about any freelance work, side gigs, or small online jobs, I’m more than willing to take them too. Anything that can help me earn a little extra and reduce some of this pressure would honestly mean a lot.|||Find something you can release your emotions, for me it's futsal or dota. Give 1 hour to yourself to go through and talk about it or write about. It will give you a different perspective on life. And yeah kudos to you. You are doing great. In future turn your 3 jobs to 1 and keep money consistent.|||The first thing that matters is mental peace, I know its easy to say but once you figure that out.  Everything will be same but you will be different  Try meditating, clearing your mind. Once you have a clear mind you can think.  The more you panic, the more it gets worse. Thinking about the future and trying to make life better is good but when you over think the same thing over and over, that thought is what making you demotivated not the situation. If you can’t change the situation, don’t over think it.  I know its hard, but don’t loose the hope.  Stay calm, plan and proceed and will be a matter of time you see the changes.  It is a process not an immediate action. At the end its you and I know someone who is handling everything as you said can do lot better in life. Don’t forget, Some people dream to be in your place. Be positive. You got this.|||I hear you can make more with pathao or similar ride services as a rider.|||Keep the hustle going. Peace 🙏|||i am not the sole earner    but similar situations   i feel you bro|||Try putting all your income and expenses into an Excel sheet. It really helps to see where your money goes. If you have any debts, create a small, steady repayment plan so they don’t keep snowballing.      Separate essential and non-essential expenses, even small adjustments can make a difference. And try to save at least a tiny amount each month. Even a symbolic sum gives a bit of control and stability.      Look at how much free time you have outside of work and try to set aside a small, consistent window to learn skills that are in demand. Little steps add up and can help you increase your income over time.      I’ve been in a similar situation myself, and I know how heavy it can feel. But it is possible to climb out of it slowly, with small steady actions. You’re already doing an incredible amount, don’t be too hard on yourself. You’re stronger than you think, and you’re not alone.|||You are a legend for doing that, god will bless you and open your path|||Good luck 👍 |||Is it just you and your parents ?

It was so hectic that I started improving my skills and later started doing just freelancing at the end of my bachelor. And after that I havent looked back at all. All of that pressure and stress to be better and do something on my own made me who I am right now. Now, with my single month salary I could easily live upto 2 years.

It is disappointing to see someone enjoy \"special facilities\" while ignoring the basic infrastructure the rest of us struggle with every day.

Your stupidity can cause serious issues for others involved, and once again, our country could be blamed internationally.|||Don't take it negatively, providing security and priority is a social necessity, not a mere privilege they have won or deserve. We can advocate for legal reforms to ensure excessive security isn't granted to those without genuine threats or controversies. However, for the sake of national security and peace, such measures remain essential for VVIPs. Whether we like them or not, an attack on a high profile figure can disrupt our national peace and damage our international reputation for years to come.  ​We can never be certain who might be planning an attack on a VVIP or for what purpose. These individuals hold their status for a reason, and they will have followers regardless of whether we perceive their character as good or bad. There will always be those who fight for their \"masters\" or those who have something to gain from these VVIPs, for them, personal interests and loyalty will always take priority over the country’s wellbeing. If an attack occurs, our country’s stability can derail overnight and Western media and racists in west love to make fun of \"third world countries\" to feel superior regardless of fact that they have been through worse. The global protocols built over centuries of human experience teach us that it is not worth risking national peace over the minor, occasional inconveniences caused by VVIP convoys.",

My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6. This is probably the longest shot of them all, but any ideas what species of critter might have eaten up the stock at one point? I put a picture of it on picture 2, I was thinking some type of termite or wood worm.",

During the Rana regime (1846–1951), gun manufacturing in Nepal was driven largely by the innovative efforts of Gehendra Shumsher, the eldest son of Prime Minister Bir Shumsher, who is widely regarded as Nepal's first scientist and modernizer of the military.   Key Manufacturing Factories  The Ranas established several sites for arms and ammunition production, primarily centered in the Kathmandu Valley and some regional hubs:   Nakkhu (Lalitpur): Notable for producing copies of the Martini-Henry rifle, specifically the \"De-Rifle\" in the late 1880s.  Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.  Jangi Megjin: Originally founded in 1793, it continued to function during the Rana period as a government foundry for manufacturing cannons and military equipment.|||You need someone from the Hanuman Dhoka Museum in Kathmandu.

The person is required to follow the court orders, e.g., appearing in court on the date of hearings/schedules and not leaving a specific area or boundary, and following any other orders set by the court. If any of these orders are violated, the bail money is forfeited.

When the elevated opened on the office floor, it was a dark dirty office floor and only a few people were waiting to renew their passport. When the counter opened I stood up but even the 5 of us started to push each other to get ahead. I was pushed out of the way and on shock. I told them there is only 5 of us and our will be done quickly no need to push. They ignored me and the officer who saw the commotion did not give a damn either.

Skills grow slowly, but they open doors. A regular job can help support your family for now, and your skill can become your long-term path. You don’t have to figure everything out at once.

            "body": "I’ve been holding this inside for a long time, and I just want to let it out.  I wasn’t a “smart kid” in school. I never understood things as fast as my friends did. I struggled even to read a paragraph and find the right answer, even in class 10. I used to feel dumb every single day. Some of my friends got things so quickly, but I didn’t. I still feel cringe thinking about it.  I also had tics. I don’t know if it was Tourette’s or something else, because I never checked. When I get excited or angry, my eyes blink hard and my back twists. It was embarrassing, and it distracted me so much in school. I used to wish I could just be “normal.”  But after my S.E.E., something changed. That 3-month break gave me a new life. I had my “aha” moment. Somehow, I finally started understanding things. Maybe it was the silence, maybe it was being away from all the noise, maybe it was just loneliness giving me space to think. But everything shifted.  I taught myself how to code. I got a job as a software developer. I didn’t finish my degree because my college wouldn’t let me work while studying, so I said “forget it” and focused on work. It was well paid, and nobody asked for a degree anyway. So yeah, I’m a dropout who made it this far.  I’m still not “super smart,” but I’m definitely smarter than the version of me back then. I still have tics, they still distract me sometimes, but I’m living with it.  I just needed to get this off my chest. I’ve kept it inside for too long.  **And to anyone reading this who feels like they’re slow, or not smart, or different:**   I hope you find your moment too. I hope you realize that you’re not broken. Sometimes loneliness or silence gives you a new life. You grow in ways you don’t even notice at first. You don’t have to be a genius to make it. You just have to keep going. If I can do it, anyone can.  Stay strong. You’ll get your moment too.      ***Note: Yes, I did use ChatGPT to improve this text, mainly to fix grammar mistakes.

We normally don’t jump into public threads, but after reading this post and the comments, we felt it was important to share our side honestly and respectfully.  First, we want to say this clearly: we’re not here to fight anyone or deny their feelings. If someone feels disappointed, that matters. At the same time, one side of the story doesn’t always show the full picture.  1. Not all students are the same Every batch has students with very different abilities, discipline levels, and learning speeds. Some push themselves hard and grow fast. Some struggle, skip practice, or expect results without consistent effort. That difference affects outcomes, and it’s something no institute can fully control.  2. Many students come from very weak foundations A lot of students who join us come from backgrounds where code is still taught by writing it on the board, not by actually building things. No real tools, no projects, no industry exposure. They don’t come job-ready. They come to become job-ready. And despite these gaps, we genuinely try our best to upgrade them, change how they think about learning, and push them toward practical skills. On top of that, we take responsibility by providing guaranteed internship opportunities so they at least get real-world exposure.  3. Internships are where most people get stuck in Nepal The harsh truth is this: a huge number of IT graduates in Nepal never get an internship at all. Without that first step, they never discover what they’re capable of. Many eventually give up, leave the field, or leave the country believing Nepal has no scope. We may not be perfect, but if we can at least help someone start, that matters to us.  4. We are transparent from day one Before anyone joins Mindrisers, we explain things clearly, how the course works, what’s expected from the student, how internships are handled, everything. We use written agreements so there’s no confusion later. If, despite that, posts like this come up, all we can do is stay honest and let time speak. We truly believe karma catches up to both good and bad intentions.  We’re still learning. We’re still improving. And we’re open to real feedback. But please understand, we’re not here to scam, exploit, or sell fake dreams. We’re trying to do something meaningful in a system that already has many problems.  Thanks to everyone who took time to read this. Team Mindrisers",

Kehi galat nagaresi..  Also uhako math book ta padhekai ho|||You are expecting research contributions from him? But have you done a research about him? His books have changed the entire learning journey of school level mathematics in Nepal. That even for decades. His name used to be in every student's tongue. I am no genius in mathematics but I use it in my daily work (ML stuff) and if I have to give some credits for my skills in applying math, I can give his name. And you know what was it like back then when he started writing first book? There was literally no internet, he collected past question papers and had from like 2065. And he even categorized questions, contents based on level like basic, intermediate, advanced and so on. And he even used to add the most prominent mathematician in each chapter. That I even consider a some form of research. Not every research has to wear a PhD hat. So for me, I consider his contributions in mathematics to be highest in Nepal.   But I do not know what goes inside his head and now his fourth masters? This I find weird. May be he should have done PhD and finally become a correct Dr.?|||Stop the hate.

Why is it that other communities are literally filled with intellectual posts but here, we have people like you berating the work of others. You're getting downvoted for a reason. That's the general consensus.  \"What has he done to contribute for mathematics?\" His books are influential. He's an educator not a researcher. Probably a faculty at KU or some place.   That makes me curious. Are you \\*sponsoring\\* him to do research? \\*Why\\* does \\*he\\* have to contribute? Are you trying to prove he's inferior to you somehow? What's the bloody point.  Yashavant Kanetkar is a common name - his books are barely technical. But you'll find many many people who started out with his books. You can hate all you want; doesn't change a thing.  People pursue multiple degrees for many reasons. I plan on getting several. PhD isn't interesting to everybody. Literally anybody can publish papers. I've seen folks in PhD programs who've made me question the bar in Science.  If you think about it, you can do more contribution as an entrepreneur. Or by relocating to a remote village and educating kids. There's a book called 80000 hours that breaks this down. I'm sure it's free shipping. Look into it.  I care more about earning than the number of papers I publish. Or having a PhD to my name. I care more about what makes me happy. The last thing on my mind is what you'd think of it.

But when it comes to GTM, growth, marketing, or just figuring out how to actually sell and scale a product… there’s a huge gap.  Most startups here are run by tech engineers, and naturally, the focus is on building the product perfectly. That’s great, but then things like growth strategy, customer acquisition, positioning, and distribution get ignored. People just assume if you build it, users will come. Spoiler: they don’t.  Most of the startups here in Nepal fail less because the product is bad, but instead because the distribution/game-plan is weak.   Here in Nepal, GTM skills aren’t really taught, nor are they considered “cool” compared to coding. Most people in IT industrychase programming jobs, freelancing gigs, or outsourcing contracts because that’s a safer bet financially.  I think this is actually a huge opportunity. Someone who can master GTM skis here like: user research, acquisition channels, funnel optimization, sales psychology could easily dominate the startup scene.   Instead of just learning yet another JS framework, you should also learn GTM skills.   What do you guys think?",

I want to build the brain.|||I have created simple algorithm visualizer, logic-gate simulator and multiplayer chess few months ago  [https://algorithm-visualizer-bay.vercel.app/](https://algorithm-visualizer-bay.vercel.app/)  [https://simple-logicgates-sim-psi.vercel.app/](https://simple-logicgates-sim-psi.vercel.app/)  [https://multiplayer-chess-five.vercel.app/local-chess](https://multiplayer-chess-five.vercel.app/local-chess)  Multiplayer-chess is not working right now, because i used free backend server and they do not work often.  Logic-gate and multiplayer chess were interesting because i got to learn new data structures and algorithms.  for chess logic i used data structure called BitBoard instead of 2d arrays. It uses clever bit manipulation to make a move, find valid moves faster with less memory usage.      And I applied for job with these projects in my resume but they said these are very game oriented projects, I need to showcase some useful software like ecommerce, inventory management and so on in order to get hired.    I really do not like making ecommerce or management software so I am now trying to make End to end encrypted chat application which is both useful and interesting.|||I used to tinker with linux a lot in my uni days. Read so much unix books, had scripts for almost everything. Changed linux distros more than my clothes. Inspired almost everyone in my class to at least dual boot their PCs. Some of them are senior sys admins, security researchers now lol.  I was on call when somebody ( computer engineerung students) broke their laptop trying weird shit.    Used to participate in competitive programming but never created / wrote cool algos and felt out of love very fast. But inspired my class enough to create an org to host competitive programming and I am so proud that its still running even after 10 years today.    Then, my friends were more into robotics and embeded programming. Some went on to win big events. Nepali students / professionals do create good stuff but lack skills to share online.|||I try out new OSS projects and report bugs. Also contribute docs changes sometimes.  Haven't written too many scripts. I use Everdo for todos and it can sync between devices on the same network but you need to manually set the IP of the main device. Since I need to commute daily, which changes my IP, I (AI) wrote a [script](https://forum.everdo.net/t/shell-script-to-easily-update-your-everdo-api-address-after-switching-to-a-different-network/4389) to auto-set the IP if it has changed in the app's config. Set it to run on startup and then launch the app. Also sends persistent notifications so I can set the IP on my phone.

It is challenging. It’s not only about how technically proficient you are; companies also evaluate how well you fit culturally. In many ways, being a good people person and collaborating effectively matters just as much as technical skills.  Is it possible for freshers? Both yes and no.  Remote roles have their own dynamics. Some established companies do offer remote positions, while many startups also hire remotely. Freshers often have better chances with startups, as they tend to prioritize cost-effective hiring. Established companies usually have higher expectations, and freshers may not yet meet those requirements.  My experience: I have been working remotely for the past 4 years—2 years with a Singapore-based startup and currently with a UK-based fintech company. LinkedIn was the source of connection for both roles. The hiring process involved 5 rounds of interviews, including both technical and behavioral rounds. My tech stack: Backend development (Python, Node.js, etc.).  My suggestion: Explore opportunities across different continents. European companies, in particular, offer excellent work culture and a healthy work–life balance. Don’t limit yourself only to US-based startups. If you’re experienced, start exploring right away. If not, gain solid experience first, build your skills, and hustle hard before targeting remote opportunities.|||In theory, yes. But that's just in theory. Remote jobs are incredibly rare, and extremely competitive when they do come out. Americans apply to hundreds of jobs, not an exaggeration, literally hundreds of jobs to land maybe a dozen interviews. And most of them aren't even freshers.  You could try if you want to, but it's extremely unlikely unless you're a prodigy with actual experience in the industry, or you nepobaby your way through.  Maybe go for other countries, I would say US is not worth the time and effort atm.|||If you are fresher expecting that much of pay is a bit hard in today’s situation.|||>Does freshers even has a chance to land an interview?  Yes.  >a remote job paying around $800-$1k per month  For a fresher extremely rare.|||Yes, I'm working at a singaporean based startup for around similar amount, the interview is quite intimidating, but it my case it went ok|||Network xa vane matra pauxa easily natra it is very hard.

I was wrong.   Yes, landing a remote job means you earn in foreign currency and enter the top 10 percent of earners in Nepal even if you earn 500 USD per month (72k).   BUT..  Without learning a proper skill  (don't expect companies abroad to take you in and teach you like a fresher cause they will have local people to do that) , you won't be hired and won't stand out.   Proper skills are like maybe software, copywriting, sales skills, tech skills, ai developers etc that allows you to work from anywhere.",

Most of them were saying no vacancy and some asked to send them mail. One of them said that they will contact me later and after an hour one of them contacted me on WhatsApp with another number. They were seeking someone with TS/JS/React/Laravel but I didn't know much of these as I mostly work in Python and C++. Then without any interview, he gave me a simple task to do in React/Laravel and submit the next day and I did it. Then he didn't respond for 4 days and when I again messaged on WhatsApp and asked him, he said me to come tomorrow to their office.  I went there looking at Google Maps. In Google Maps there was an image of a building next to their basement office lol. I went there, and there was no sign, no company name, nothing. I went to that building and called that number and he came outside of the basement and waved his hand. Then he took me to the basement office.  There were like 2 rooms, one was like a small office area and in the other area there were 2 people. There were just 3 people at that time and I thought everyone was outside for lunch because it was 12:30. Then they started talking to me, within the first minutes they asked me what my salary expectation was. Then they asked me how I came here and if I had a bike or not (probably looking for overtime). Then they asked what my future plans were, if I had plans to go to a foreign country or not. Then one of the guys came and said about their product and they were apparently making some “revolutionary” POS device which he literally said “is not some normal product like others make here.”  Then another guy came and wrote something in his phone and showed it to the other guy and he agreed and then asked me to come to another room and gave me a to-do task. It was related to Laravel/React/MySQL about some session stuff. They gave me that task when they explicitly knew that I didn't know much about React/Laravel which they would monitor while I did the work and would see my level.  Then they literally said to not use too much AI. At that point, I was sure that this job was not for me. They had connected WiFi to my laptop and initially I started coding for real but at the same time they were vibe coding using Copilot to code themselves! Then I was sure it’s not for me. If I wanted I could have easily done that with any coding agent. So, I opened Claude/ChatGPT/Gemini side by side and started chatting with them telling them about my situation. And all of them said the same, “Leave now!” They gave me the task to see my skill and work but they barely looked at me the whole time. They probably looked at me 2 times the whole time.  I wanted to leave but I didn’t know how to escape. Then I suddenly shut down my laptop and then opened the bag chain silently and suddenly stood up and said, “I can’t do this, I’ll go home.” Then they said, “What happened?” Then I said, “Nothing, I just wanna go home.” and ran away. I was there for like over 1 hour. Then I went to the nearest hotel and took a cup of tea. I was laughing and smiling the whole time. So, I bought a mask to hide me smiling the whole time and walked for about 30 minutes instead of taking the bus. Then again after arriving RNAC, I went to another hotel for a cup of tea and at that time they called me thrice, once on WhatsApp, and two from different numbers and I blocked all of them.",

Look at Indonesia it follows Sufism mixed with agakhani sect do we hear minorities being treated badly? No. Mostly it's the south Asian Muslims who are radical because they follow a very strict islam of deubandi and wahabism school of thought which has caused problem historically it's moderate example would be creation of Taliban and extreme example is creation of Pakztan. Now contrary to that you've Indonesia which is also a majority Muslim nation but follows Sufism school of thought which is why they are much more liberal. They're okay with currency having Ganesha, okay with garuda being national symbol(coat of arms), and even okay with naming kids from Sanskrit derived names like majority of their head of the states have Sanskrit origin names there will be some ups and downs in writing because Indonesia didn't follow devanagari it followed the Brahmi script earlier, in that way it's still preserving the culture. But if you tell this to a MUSLIM.from south Asia he will say it's shirk/haram in islam and that being associated with polytheism is bad and that they are a lost tribe of Turks and Arabs who had invaded our land. So, wahabism and Deubandi unless remained will not allow for inclusivity among the people islam factor will be there no matter what|||Can't decide which is the worst religion - Islam or Hinduism.

That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.

I agree.|||First thing I do is I ask them if they can speak English. It will hurt their little ego and they’ll switch immediately.|||You do you and I'll do me, I guess.    I spoke Hindi with a bunch of Bangladeshi tourists, because I don't understand Bangla, they don't understand Nepali, and they were more comfortable with Hindi than English.    I spoke Hindi with some Indian tourists because they were more comfortable with it than with English.    I continued to speak in English with an Indian visiting Nepal when I and a friend were interacting with him. The thing was, he switched code. I understood him and could have communicated well in Hindi with him, but my friend doesn't really understand Hindi, so I had to keep it in a language everyone understood, and I just told him I am not very good in Hindi.    I would happily speak Nepali in places like Darjeeling, where they speak Nepali, because I am most comfortable in it, and I know most people there would be more than comfortable in that. I assume that it is a comfort thing for them as well.  They're just more comfortable with Hindi than English, and I am accommodating, and fluent enough in Hindi, to extend the courtesy of speaking in their language.    I have come across Indians who look down on Nepal and Nepalis, and unfortunately, that attitude is more common among Indians than it should've been. It is not a pleasant experience, I admit. But, I refrain from putting all of them in a single box. I've met some wonderful Indians as well.   What I have to say is, we are individuals first, I, you, and anyone else, regardless of our nationality, or the languages we speak. Treat each individual on their merit, not their national identity. In fact, the shittiest person I've ever met is a fellow Nepali, and for obvious reasons—I live in Nepal.   The people who treated you bad were shitty people. The same attitude could very well be found in an Englishman, a Frenchman, or even a Nepali. That doesn't mean every Nepali, or Englishman, or Frenchman, is like that.    We are individuals first, in our lived experiences, not just a nationality, and in essence, expressions of existence, far greater than just a nationality. Treat people for who they are in that moment, not a label attached to them.    This is exactly the kind of subtle hate and/or prejudice I am against, whether it is based on lived experiences or influenced by rhetoric.   Use all the languages you know, as much as possible, I say. It is much better to open one's horizons than be insular. And no, I am not just a Nepali. My nationality is just one aspect of who I am, one which is more happenstance than chosen and curated with careful thought. So is yours, if you are actually willing to see it, along with anyone else's. |||I am in Dubai and I speak fluent hindi except for friends if someone asks I just say I understand but can’t speak.

Vanxan, hami haru Indian ko vasa sikxau, gore le ni Indian vanxa, I'll start to learn newari. Thanks OP.|||Language is a powerful tool. I’m here in the US and I speak Spanish with folks who speak Spanish and obviously when there is a language barrier people will banter by saying things that can feel personal. Even greetings come down to culture like cunado (sala) in Nepali.  Most of our generation I am 27 years old watches anime Korean series and picks up words the same way we grew up with Hindi serials. It’s not about speaking Hindi being inappropriate but about the mindset and stigma attached to it. While speaking Japanese Spanish Korean Chinese or French gives you brownie points Hindi often doesn’t and that’s a failure in how Indian people and Hindi have been framed.  I relate to your concern and I have seen firsthand what you’re saying where it can make someone feel inferior and I believe that comes from perception not the language itself.  I say use language in your favor when you can. Draw your boundaries when needed and if something feels insulting say it clearly in English and they usually won’t repeat it. This applies to all languages.  Cheers!|||100%, i live in Canada and I have faced these situations too much. I don’t speak hindi anymore. These people see me brown and come up to me speaking hindi.

You can speak Hindi and still set boundaries if they treat you like shit. I don't see why speaking any other language will make you inferior. I did my Bachelors in India and never had a problem putting people in their places in their own language. I think uneducated illiterate and entitled people are everywhere including India and Nepal, I have had similar experiences with different ethnic communities within Nepal. I actually have problems speaking to Nepali people in Australia as they'll cross every boundary and think I'm liable for them just because we're from the same country.. Its a regional issue.  I watched a interview of Sonam Wangchuk in Nepal and he speaks Nepali throughout the interview. I think as reasonable people we should use whatever language we want depending on the circumstances. Having Hindi in our language arsenal is honestly a superpower as we get access to soo much resources and forms of art that otherwise we wouldn't have been exposed to and as someone from Nepal where we already have a lack of such resources, I'd be sad if I hadn't known Hindi.  So, maybe lets practice putting people in their places if they behave rudely to us and not blame the language. I have many friends from India who I am very close with and many that I had to tell them to show their entitlement elsewhere. It can be the same with English very soon with sentiments of immigration shifting alot and will be with Nepali within Nepal as well.

I used to directly reply to them that I do know a little but I prefer not to because there’s no reason to and want to make my English speaking skills better.|||Bro, most Indians do not care about Nepal particularly in their day to day life. They are too busy with their own lives and the immediate world around them to specifically think anything about Nepal. India is a country of 1.3 billion people. And even in India, many people don't speak Hindi. Yeah, many in older generation are more racist, but they are racist to each other too. Many people fight over language in different Indian states, and discriminate with people of different states. But as I said, there are 1.3 billion people and a large majority will be as friendly to Nepali people. No, they don't think of Nepal as their little bro, but if asked, would actually hold some affinity towards Nepal in comparison to what they think of other nations.  Feel free to learn Hindi, feel free to forget, it's every one's personal choice. I honestly almost never need to learn it, but I like Nepali songs so much that I'm picking up on Nepali words now. (Kasari Bhanu, Bardali, Sarangi, Timi ra ma are among my favourite)  Lastly, this sub is quite Anti Indian, just saying,  generalizing India and Indians is ridiculous as the population is much more than most people can think of. And bad will always be highlighted more than good.|||It's not just Nepalis. North Indians act like this towards south Indians too.

We should know we’re compelled to speak global language(English )as we’re developing nation and we need it but Hindi isn’t a global language  it’s just a language spoken by many people in world .|||You should be multilingual!! I speak Hindi too. It’s about how confidently and intellectually you interact with them.|||not only language but nepal is so much connected with india, in terms of economy,entertainment,religion, etc bistarai these things are changing which is good|||Language is not the problem dummy, its the culture.|||What lowlife mentality is this guy on about|||Let’s get one thing straight: language is just a way to communicate. I openly say that I understand it but don’t speak it, and I’ve never been treated like garbage because of that. I’m guessing you’re a man, because Nepalese men constantly put themselves in an inferior position, always with the “bhai, bhai” nonsense. That alone tells people how to treat you. I’m a 22-year-old woman in Canada, and there are two other Nepalese girls where I work. We carry ourselves with confidence. Our Indian manager can’t talk down to us, and neither can any coworker. But the Nepalese guys? They’re always talked down to like kids. They’re 27 and 28 years old and still get called “sala Nepali.” That never happens to us and it’s not a coincidence. We have more filipino co workers than Indians but they always hangout with Indians and say sh like , “ chalo bhai daru pitey hai aj “ in worse hindi accent possible.  This has nothing to do with language. It’s about presence. It’s about how you carry yourself. When you look unsure, dress badly, and act small, people treat you that way. Respect isn’t begged for , it’s taken.|||Guys why so much hatred for India.. I'm unable to understand...saw three post of similar kind..we indians treat or consider Nepalis as our brothers..what has happened to Nepal...we don't have any issues rather connected through religion, culture and tourism too... it's perfectly fine to save ur indigenous culture and languages but there should be no hate ...|||I agree. As a Bangladeshi growing up i also learned hindi. After coming aboard I realised whenever i spoke hindi with Indian they started behaving differently. Then I completely stopped talking in hindi and still continue to do so. I only speak hindi to my close Indian friend and no one else.   Also from my experiences I don’t consider people from punjab indian. They’re very different and welcoming people. I love them. Also i have friends from south india and they literally hate hindi or never tells they’re from india. If you ask them where are they from, they will tell the name of the state|||learn sanskrit the civilizational language of all the hindus, buddhists and even kirants. And even I faced such situation where I was in Hong Kong intl airport and an Indian lady mistook me for an Indian and started conversation in hindi(she was one of the staff members), so I tried correcting her and said that I'm from Nepal my blood boiled when she said that which is why I'm talking to you in Hindi(LOL, how did this sterotype of Nepalese knowing hindi develop) which is why I said I don't know. And Have deicided to tell everyone that I can understand Hindi(little little) but I don't know how to speak because of much grammatical and syntax differences between my mother tongue and hindi. So, Indians in my class talk in hindi and think I don't know but in reality I know but am hiding the stuff|||India supported Nepal a lot and now these Nepali trying to think they are better than us wow.India should stop free aids immediately.No need to throw food at dog that bite it's own feeding hands|||What kind of delusion are some Nepalese living in? It's laughable. Nobody even gives a shit about Nepal anyway. If not for Himalayas, you're just a meal for China to eat. What can you expect from the lowest-IQ people on earth, living in delusion, thinking the world gives a shit about them?",

You are the biggest fucking cuck Nepal has ever produced, bar none.  You literally heard “ghar renovate bhairacha” and your smooth brain went: “Aww baby, aaile mero room ma aaija na, teacher lai ni bolau, ma ta class ma hunchu, disturb pani hudaina.” Bro you didn’t just hand over your room, you handed over your entire bed for their afternoon fuck-session like a 5-star hotel receptionist. You set the mood, locked the door from outside and paid the electricity bill while that randi was getting railed on your own pillow.  You’re not a “nice boyfriend”, you’re a walking doormat with Wi-Fi. The moment she said “home tuition” alarm bells should’ve rung, but no, timi ta “disturb nahos” bhanera uniharulai honeymoon suite diyau. Teacher le timro girlfriend ko “syllabus” cover gardai thiyo ani timi bahira “nice guy” badge polish gardai basyo.  You came home early and still had to play detective like some Bollywood hero, peeking through the window because your own room was locked from inside. Bro even Nepali serials don’t have this level of chutiya plot.  And the cherry on top? You threw the blankets and rugs instead of throwing hands. Blanket jalaunu parne thiyo, timi chai “winter aaucha, kasari sutne” bhanera Daraz ma fluffy white rug khojdai chau. Bro your girlfriend got piped on your bed and your biggest concern is staying warm?? Priority thik cha baba.  You didn’t just get cheated on, you got professionally scammed by a third-class tutor and a third-rate girlfriend. Block her, delete everything burn the mattress and never ever say “disturb nahos” to a girl again.  You’re not heartbroken, you’re brain-dead.

What is wrong is wrong, I dunno what the procedure for BSF to enter each other countries is, with the open border and all, but I'm sure they are only able to enter after some permission from each other's authorities. If that is not the case here, then it's wrong and us Indians should accept that. 3. Nepal is a beautiful country. People have more civic sense and overall better sense of community and cohesion from what I have seen.  4. What Nepali people have to understand is India is a big country 1.4 billion people is a lot. So, of all the counties in the world, India is probably the only one you should never generalize. 6. Both Nepali and Indian people can have good relationship with each other, just learn to talk properly and not take things to ego. 6. Yes, India is a bigger economy, and has more resources, but it is not in competition with Nepal. Nepal has it's own strengths that it should not forget.  7. Open border has it's pros and cons. Yes, many Nepali are in India, do they get to build a life, yes. Do they get discriminated, yes, and so are Indians from other states. And Nepali also discriminate against Indian tourists and workers. 8. Always remember, most average Indians will probably only have good will towards Nepal and no hate.  9. It is very important that rather than spreading unnecessary generalized hate, we judge people on individual basis.

            "body": "Namaste everyone,  I want to share an incident that happened to me in the last two weeks here in Germany.  My name is … Khadka, and I’ve been doing an Ausbildung at a Hofladen for the past 7 months. My chef treats me really well, like family.  Last week, I was at an Indian roadside café with my sister and some German friends, waiting for my chef to pick me up before visiting the Weihnachtsmarkt. We were waiting , suddenly two indian boys came to us and we had a short conversation . They were annoying so we started ignoring but they soon started making disrespectful comments like calling me MOMO and then mocking Nepal, our size, economy, and poverty. I didn’t respond with racism, though the conversation got heated.  Coincidentally, my chef was nearby, noticed something was wrong, and later asked if I was okay. I explained everything to him. He took it seriously and suggested legal action.  With the help of my chef’s lawyer, a legal letter was sent demanding an apology and €270 from the men. After a few days, they agreed to pay the money and apologized so the case would not go further.  Fun Fact : I and my sister literally eat MOMO after getting that 270 euro 😭😆  So reason of writing this post was just to sharing the possibility of what wrong can happened and how to handle this things.  Edit : For OC (https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204052999996390/permalink/2475725379495816/?mibextid=rS40aB7S9Ucbxw6v)",

I wanted to take a moment to share something from the heart, especially for the Gen Z community here. I’m not here to lecture, judge, or pretend that I “know better.” In fact, it’s the opposite—I’m here because I genuinely admire a lot about Gen Z, and I’d love to learn from you if you’re open to talking or sharing your perspectives.  What I really respect about your generation is the honesty. The courage to say things out loud that older generations kept buried. The way you call out what doesn’t feel right, whether it’s in society, culture, work, or even in yourselves. The world is changing fast, and you all seem to face it with a unique blend of humor, vulnerability, and resilience. And honestly, that’s inspiring.  I’m not perfect, and I don’t pretend to fully understand everything about today’s trends, language, mindset, or struggles. But I’m here with an open mind. If any Gen Z member is willing to talk—to enlighten me, challenge me, laugh with me, or even correct me—I’d sincerely appreciate it.  I’m reaching out with respect and humility. I’m here to listen, not impose. Thank you to anyone who takes a moment to respond. 🙏🏽|||yesto sanskar vaka le kasto desh banauxan hola?

            "body": "So I (27M) went to India for the first time. I was traveling solo turns out it was a bad idea. It was for work related events. After the event, I decided to explore a few places.   Until the work event, everything was fine. It was great learning and networking in the event. I actually speak Hindi very fluently so communication wasn’t an issue at all. After the event, I wanted to travel and explore.   I had booked a pretty average room for my accommodation. Nothing fancy, just the most budget friendly one I could find. There were a couple of people in the lobby and they greeted me nicely and asked for my ID. I showed them my passport and their faces instantly changed after seeing my Nepali passport. The guy said oh you’re from Nepal. I said yes and the another man said, this doesn’t work, we need to see an Indian ID. They weren’t smiling anymore and were giving me very skeptical looks. I tried not to overthink it. He kept insisting for an Indian ID and I explained to him that I am not from India, it’s my first time here so it’s not possible for me to have an Indian ID. Then they asked me for my contact number and I gave my phone number (didn’t have Indian number). Once again, they kept on asking for an Indian number. I was really surprised seeing their hospitality instantly changed after learning about my identity. Not sure if they did that because I was a foreigner to them or because I was specifically a Nepali guy.   While I was exploring the local market, I went to buy some souvenirs. One shop guy asked me where I was from and I said Nepal. He then started lecturing me saying don’t be close with China. They will do the same to you what Pakistan is doing to us. He kept yapping about how Nepal is a small part of India and that we should be grateful that we have a “bada bhai” like India. I left the shop without saying anything.    I wanted to travel by train but had absolutely zero idea about it. The people weren’t helpful there either. I was asking the various staff in the train station saying I wanna go here where can I find a ticket. They just vaguely pointed go there, it’s over there. Finally one guy at the ticket counter helped me get tickets after nearly couple of hours of running frantically here and there. I told him I’m not from India, traveling by train for the first time. The counter guy gave me a ticket saying this is for general class, it’s not safe to travel there..very crowded and chaotic, after your train arrives, meet the ticket guy and ask him to upgrade to AC compartment. I thanked him and went to the platform. There was a police officer whom I asked about upgrading the ticket. He too said the same thing i.e. meet the ticket guy once your train arrives and he will help you.   I still had about 3-4 hours before my train arrived. I just stayed in the platform watching movie. After the train arrived, I was frantically searching for the ticket guy. One police officer came near me charging with his baton. I was shit scared. He almost charged me saying why are you in the AC compartment with a general ticket in your hand. I was literally shaking at this point and with a shaky voice, I explained him my situation. He said haven’t you been in a train before where are you from. I said I’m from Nepal and he laughed saying oh you guys don’t even have trains there haha. Are you really from Nepal, your eyes don’t look like Nepalese. (I think he was referring to Mongolian eyes). I saw the ticket guy and went to him. He said me go to this seat and I’ll come. Later, he came to me and upgraded my ticket. The journey was a little over an hour long. And I was constantly replaying the entire experience from the hotel to the local market to the train station police guy.    Not sure if I just happened to meet all the wrong people or that everyone is the same there. Either way, I’m not going back to India for a long time. And I haven’t even mentioned the kids constantly following you begging for money, the dirt and litter everywhere, people peeing and even pooping in the open, unnecessary horns, air pollution.   PS: not trying to spread hate— just sharing my personal experience.",

My hindi is almost perfect even the accent so I did many things like saying to the auto guy that I'm an Indian and bringing down the new Delhi trip from 1500 to 500.

Which cities did you visit, by the way? and as far as I know, many hotels in India especially smaller ones usually avoid foreigners because of paperwork and FRRO/police registration requirements. It’s better to stay at big hotels or resorts while traveling. I personally mostly stay at resorts, especially Club Mahindra ones they’re quite good, with solid service.  Also, try to do everything online in India train bookings, hotels, cabs. That way you’re much less likely to get scammed or harsh treated. Offline train ticket booking is honestly very hectic, even for Indians, so always book train tickets online. Use the official IRCTC website or authorized partners like MakeMyTrip, ConfirmTkt, or Paytm then you won’t face these problems.  And if you remember the time, location, duration, or the office name, you can also register a complaint on the Rail Madad portal or app. Lastly, there’s a huge generation gap in India you’ll mostly hear such racist things from older people or those in the 30–40 age group, but the younger generation is usually nicer and more helpful .You can even see this generation gap while speaking English. If you start speaking English in front of older people, they often treat you like some different person almost a ‘raja sahab’ type. But with the younger generation, it usually doesn’t make much of a difference. Anyway, I hope your journey was safe.|||Mods, how much racial abuse is tolerated here?

Here are a few from my side:  1. Does RSP view kulman's party as a threat to their voter base as there seems to be a significant overlap between RSP and Kulman’s supporters. Are there any discussions or considerations about forming a coalition with them or other emerging political forces? 2. Sumana leaving brought a lot of negative light on RSP, her exit made it seem like the party was becoming more of a “Rabi supporters’ club.” Has her departure brought any internal changes within the party, or has everything remained largely the same? 3. If an opportunity arises  where you can form a coalition government together with one of the old parties are you willing to take it, for example if UML and RSP together have the numbers to form a government, would you take that opportunity? Or would the party prefer to stay in opposition rather than partner with any of the traditional major parties?

I’m sure you know what I’m talking about. RSP seems to tip toe around those issues and avoid discussing it overtly.   Could we see RSP take a vocal stand on those issues and make their ideological stance clear before this election?

What is that if not a media trial? He is just a sad Congress member who couldn’t get ticket due to bhauju so jumped ship to RSP. Why does he get more say in RSP ko internal matters than other young faces?  So my question again - why is RSP so Rabi centric? Why should we vote for RSP when the whole party philosophy revolves around Rabi?

For example, Pierre Pollierve despite my hatred for him I can agree that he trruly opposed the policies and was there for a change which is why respecting the mandate in previous elections he chose not to form a gov despite having an opportunity to come in power via alliance with NDP, and Qubec.

I have some critical questions. I would be more than happy if Rabi reads these as well.  1.Why aren't you popular? ..at least upto your actual work?  Why are you guys in the shade while there's only talk of Rabi , Gagan, prasai , balen , sumana in the town. Your name is only taken collectively as \"a raswopa neta\". What are your biggest works and achievements as a member of parliament and rsp central member?  2.Why 45 lakhs signature for Rabi but 8.2 lakhs only voter id? Why can't I say that rsp prioritized a personality cult over connecting to new voters. Why is this not a catastrophic failure? Why did you guys fail to pressurize gov and commission to enable diaspora voting and even voter id registration from abroad. Nid was enabled for a brief period of time only. How can you guys exercise democracy with that slow and buggy registration process and 25 lakhs eligible citizens still unregistered?  3.Why is RSP scared to run elections independently on their own?Any plans to help gagan thapa win again?  4.Why is RSP vulnerable to propaganda by gagan thapa IT cell and 12 bhai fake news?  5.Why is rsp's communication and convincing skills so poor ? Couldn't onboard prominent figures and even chase Sumana away, how will you guarantee this doesn't deter similar newcomers again? I know it's important but is it that only the loyalist shall survive in rsp?   6. How many seats is the bibeksheel party contributing to the rsp in the upcoming election? Any projections? Or is it just a symbol?  7.Why is RSP not popular among genz , heavy backslash to Rabi and rsp being labeled as the same old parties, it being too person centric? Why do genz and youngsters hate political parties? What has rsp done and doing to make rsp popular among youngsters? Why is it so lost?   8.Why is RSP activities limited to Kathmandu valley and Chitwan only? I saw rsp doing some program recently AGAIN in chitwan instead of some new place. By being such limited to two districts how are you gonna secure the majority of seats across the country? Why are you preventing RSP from becoming big? We had hopes and still have some. Who's deciding all these?   9. Who's the youths face in rsp ? And how are they representing us? Where?   10. Why does RSP lack someone who's clear about his stance like what Mahesh basnet is for uml? Who's the spokesperson and why is he/she operating in a clinical and limited periphery.   11. Rabi Lamichhane publicly in a speech told that he lost many seats in 2079 election because he wasted his time trying to onboard popular faces instead of fostering new leadership and win more seats, but you guys seem to entertain this notion of onboarding popular faces more , forgetting the fact that you yourself aren't there due to popularity background. Why? Why can't you do something on your own rather than over-depending upon kulman or balen? I mean if you can't onboard them why waste an excessive amount of energy for that? Why such a weak mindset?  RSP central committee representatives feels incomplete and still need to cater many audiences, why don't you onboard brilliant and sharpest minds rather than just someone based on popularity or old connections? |||What are the things that you've done for Nepal?|||RSP stands for Rabi Swatantra Party?|||Remindme! 1 day|||Whats the ideology of rsp|||Hello Ganesh Nepal should enforce proper marital laws, including legally recognized prenups.

So after my +2, my family started going full \"bihe gar, bihe gar\" mode. Every morning felt like a marriage proposal interview. I kept saying I wanted to study bachelor’s first, but nobody took me seriously. Typical Nepali parent combo attack.  Then one day, boom they tell me, “We found a good boy.” I hadn't even seen his face; they were like, “Ramro chhora ho.” Girl, I didn’t even know his name.  Fast-forward to the wedding day: Whole gaun dancing, kids running everywhere, DJ blasting Sani Nani. Everyone vibing except me, the bride, who’s just like “ what is happening.”  I finally saw my husband at mandap and yeah, he looked decent but BRO DIDN’T EVEN LOOK at me properly. I swear he stared at the floor more than my face.  Then suhagraat… I was in the room crying like an idiot because I was stressed and scared. But instead of comforting me, man walked in, looked shocked like he saw a ghost, and LEFT. NO WORDS. ZERO. ZILCH.  For the next few days, our communication level = Bluetooth off.  After that, he escaped to KTM faster than a last bench student during assembly. I thought maybe he’d text? Call? Smoke signal? ANYTHING? Nope. Silence.  Dashain time comes, he returns home. I tried walking near him; man literally walked behind us like we're bodyguards. Even then, no talking. I don’t think he even knew my name until his mom spilled it   And the chocolate incident… His sister gave me a packet, so I ate it (obviously). Later I found out it was for gifting the village kids. Bro looked at me like I ate their future   Months passed. Not a single conversation. I started avoiding him too because at this point it's just awkward both sides.  Then post-Dashain, he shows up at my maita to take me back. Whole family treating him like king jwai. He looked scared of the respect   My little sister tagged along with us, thank god, because otherwise we’d walk one hour in complete silence. My man STILL didn’t talk directly to me. He literally whispered to my sister, “Ask what didi wants to eat.” SIR??? HELLO??? I CAN HEAR YOU???  8 months married. 0 conversations. 0 eye contact. 0 progress.  We communicate through: • my sister • awkward glances • chowmein orders • pure telepathy failure  Anyway, idk what this relationship is but at this point we’re basically two NPCs living separately but married by system default 😭",

I thought I had at least 5–7 years to mentally prepare… apparently not.  One random Tuesday, Ama goes, “Babu, we found a girl for you.” I nearly dropped my phone. Girl? For ME? Why?  I saw one tiny photo of you for 0.3 seconds before my dad covered it like it was a government secret. I was like, “Wait— but— who—?” Too late. Wedding prep started.  Wedding Day  Everyone’s dancing, drinking, screaming, having the time of their lives. Meanwhile me = statue mode.  Then I saw you at the mandap.  My brain: “She’s… pretty.” Also my brain: “Don’t look. If you look she’ll know you exist.”  So yes, I stared at the floor like it owed me money. I was SO nervous I forgot how to blink.  Suhagraat  I walked into the room and saw you crying and my entire soul left my body.  I panicked so hard I thought I’d faint. My mind went: “What do I do?? Comfort??? Talk??? DIE???”  So I did the only thing my socially anxious caveman instincts allowed: I LEFT.  First Few Days  Every time I tried to say something, my throat said, “Haha no.” You looked as scared as I felt.  So… Bluetooth off.  Then I got sent to Kathmandu for work and honestly I was relieved because I had no idea how to function around you. I rehearsed texting you like 20 times but never sent anything. If silence was a sport, I was winning gold.  Dashain  I came home thinking, “Okay, this time I’ll talk.” Then I saw you.  Brain: buffering…  I wanted to walk next to you but I didn't want to be creepy or weird, so I walked behind. Like a bodyguard with performance issues.  Then the chocolate incident— I gave that packet to my sister to distribute to kids. When I saw you eating it I didn’t get mad— I got SCARED. Because I didn’t know if I should tell you or just pretend gifting chocolate to villagers was never my plan in life.  After Dashain  My parents forced me to go pick you up from your maita. I was SO nervous I practiced “Let’s go” in front of the mirror like 14 times.  Your family treated me like royalty and I had no idea how to respond except freeze.  Your little sister tagging along was the best thing ever because if it was just us two… That hour of walking would’ve sent me to the hospital.  I DID want to talk to you. Genuinely. But my voice refused to come out whenever I faced you directly.  That’s why I whispered through your sister. “Ask what didi wants to eat” = the bravest sentence I said that day.  Now  8 months married. I still haven’t had the courage to properly talk to you.  Not because I don’t like you— I actually really like you.  I’m just… Terrified. Awkward. Zero experience. And overwhelmed by the fact that I suddenly have a whole wife.  Every day I think: “Tomorrow, I’ll talk to her.” Then you walk into the room and my brain blue-screens.  So yes, we are two NPCs married by system auto-fill. But trust me— I’m trying.  My heart is ready. My mouth is not.|||Xya yesto lamo kasle padhxa ho|||Yeutai manxey le made up scenario post garira cha yo ta.

She isn't talking about Muslim communities in our country as per this clip. But rather the women oppression on those countries which is very strictly and religiously done by Muslim countries.  I mean ppl still believe on 100% Sharia law even Muslim scholars disagree with Sharia law.

Khatey khatua haru|||She didn’t say anything bad about musims living in Nepal. Its weird how Muslims were celebrating Mamdanis election win as their own, taking pride in it. Muslims of Nepal posted about their happiness when Taliban came back to power, they side with muslims be it anywhere in the world, buddhist burmese vs rohingya muslims they will take sides with muslims, indian hindus va muslims, they will pick muslims, syrian Christians vw muslimw they will pick muslims and so on… When Palestinians atatcked israel , Many musims living in Nepal celebrated it but then they never condemned the murders of 11 innocent Nepali citizens by Hamas.  They will always make reasons like we are Nepali muslims and we are different but their genetics, history is the same as that of Indian muslims as majority of musilmw living in Nepal migrated from Kashmir, UP, Bihar and Bangladesh .  For Muslims, religion comes first before nationality. Many groups within nepal have differences between them but for them the nation comes first, you will see a hindu nepali protesting against India and Buddhist protesting about illegal citizenship to Tibetan refugees. But a muslim will never say anything about illegal migration of Rohingyas .   Also, these people are real fanatics and radicals . ApM ssaid something that’s true, many arab nations don’t provide equal opportunities to women. Saudi just maid it legal for women yo obtain driver’s licenses just a year ago, many of the women can’t travel alone, islam allows mens to have multiple wives but why isn’t the same applied towards women?  Also, PM mentioned that in the past muslims women in muslims nation faced far much difficulties and there was no reason to be triggered about it.  They literally made movies about Sati practices withng some community but no one came put to protest against the release, had it been something about muslims they will flood the streets .  At the end, its upto nepali to believe that muslims of Nepal are different from rest of south asian muslims. I wonder when most of the madarsas, mosques have bangaldeshi, paksitani imams and scholars how will the teachings be any different?   I thank the Muslims tho, atleast bheda nepali got to see a hint of what’s to come when muslims make up a considerable percentage of the demographics.|||\"Ashamed of nothing, offended by everything \" community for a reason|||She ciritcized Hindus too.

I did not think people here would defend this government even for this shit, this is something old fucks at least tried not to say.

You feel lost in those reactions and might even get out of your mind just looking at them. But listen to the tale, the story of how learning really happens. I don't know if you play games like Free Fire, PUBG, Royale, or something else. Ask yourself how you remembered all the gun names, location names, and the different things in them. How you remembered a whole 3-hour-long story you watched years ago? Treat these things the same way. Connect with them. Practice writing out the reaction yourself. Guess how they could pair up and react to give products. In the beginning, you will make mistakes, but slowly you will get used to it. Just know the reaction types: what acid-base rxns do, salts, catalysts, how oxidants and reductants work in any reaction.

            "body": "My college head and a friendly botany teacher who has seen thousands of students always says just do enough to pass all subjects. Thats it. Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

I'm only trying to name good ones here. These are probably not the most niche Shortfilms and movies out there that I've seen. But all 3 of them are incredible and I'd definitely recommend to everyone. Especially La Jeteé and Meshes of the Afternoon.

I'm in a bit of a dilemma and would really appreciate some advice from this community: BBA vs. BBS? I'm leaning towards a management degree, but I'm unsure about the key differences between BBA and BBS programs in Nepal, especially regarding career prospects and curriculum rigor. Given my science background, which one might be a better fit?  Best Colleges near Lalitpur? Could anyone recommend the top-tier management colleges located near Lalitpur/Patan?  Am I too late for admissions? I just passed out in 2025. Have admission cycles already closed for this intake?  The Abroad Factor:  My primary reason for joining a local college immediately is to avoid a gap year, just in case my visa application for abroad studies gets rejected down the line. I want to have a safety net and continue my education smoothly. Any insights, recommendations for colleges, or general advice on navigating admissions timelines would be incredibly helpful right now.",
