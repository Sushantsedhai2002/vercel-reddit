            "body": "I am being honest and critical here. For those who genuinely want Nepal to become a better place and be recognized as a developed nation, we must acknowledge that we are critically failing. Lets start with history here, If we look at the result of Chitwan Constituency No. 1 in the 2079 election, our level of awareness becomes painfully clear. On one side stood Bishwanath Paudel — a PhD graduate from the University of California, Berkeley, with experience in national and international policymaking, university teaching, advisory roles in institutions like the ILO, and currently serving as the Governor of Nepal Rastra Bank. On the other side stood Hari Dhakal, who represented rebellion and “newness,” despite not meeting the commonly accepted standards of excellence by which Paudel would normally be judged.  If competence, experience, knowledge, and contribution had truly been the criteria, the result should have been one-sided. But it was not. Dhakal won by a large margin, and Paudel finished third. This happened because people did not vote for a candidate; they voted out of anger toward old politics. Paudel did not lose because he lacked ability, but because he was seen as a symbol of the old party and of Sher Bahadur Deuba.  This reveals a deeper problem: our consciousness is only half-awakened. We are frustrated with the old parties and the system, yet we still fail to apply proper standards when choosing alternatives. We vote in anger, not with reason. We react, but we do not evaluate. Competence is not defined by a degree alone; it is built from education, knowledge, experience, contribution to policymaking, character, and integrity.  When a person with such qualifications loses solely because of party identity, it is not that person who loses — it is the country. Preventing capable individuals from losing elections is not an emotional demand; it is a demand of the time. A nation is built or destroyed not inside the ballot box, but inside the voter’s awareness. That awareness is not measured by speeches or slogans, but by the choices made during elections.  From now on, people must decide with judgment, not with the momentum of the crowd. They must judge with the mind, not with the anger of the heart. The day voters begin choosing candidates based on knowledge, ability, experience, character, and intention, opportunists will leave politics in shame, capable individuals will step forward naturally, and democracy will finally belong to the people.   Let us remember this: when good people begin to win, the nation never loses.",

First, fill the mind with facts and then spit out the analysis , not analyze with your limited fact. C K raut is from cambridge. Well, my tu professor did his post doc from kotyo university which was one of the great. I have seen harvard graduates. When the roots are dried up, the green leaves won’t make any difference. What RSP is trying to do is to win first - take these old people down and then build the nation. Remember you have to first take cancer out if it’s wildspreading - it shouldn’t matter if that makes your dick large - it should be cut off.  That’s what this election is. RSP choosing “popular faces” because they have to win this -  they are trying to pull samanupatik vote. Look at RSP people and how they behaved well previously. They raised issued, dare to speak which noone would have.  Now are they gods? No. But this is the time for new team to rise - not the old one. It congress get to power, they won’t punish the vaujus and shits. If emale get into power, they will punish the genz in name of “desdrohi”.

Not just the party, not just the slogan, but the person. What have they done in the past? What do they stand for? How do they plan to speak for us in parliament?  Right now, we have MPs who show up only during elections. They ask for votes, promise everything, and once they win, they disappear. No contact, no accountability. That’s not representation.  I’m not saying every MP needs to be a Harvard graduate or some top expert. That’s not the point. Even someone who regularly talks with their voters, listens to their problems, raises local issues in parliament, and stays reachable would already be doing better than most.  Instead, many MPs start acting like they’re above the people once they get the title “माननीय.” They forget who gave them that title in the first place. A representative who forgets the people is not a representative at all.  Democracy isn’t about perfect leaders. It’s about leaders who remember who they work for.|||But our parliament system is not based on individual.

But they still have lots of Jholey (blind loyalist or followers for personal gain) supporting them. They have been parts of lots of scandals and really corrupt. The old parties have ruled for decades and the development is unacceptably slow that it can't even be called development. The lack of development and job and stuff has caused people to work in other countries, out which a lot of them are in dangerous job and die there, leaving thier family without bread earner, fater, husband, son or brother. They had their chance many times and they fumbled every time. Its time to change the status quo.  RPP are the hindu nationalist political party. and they don't have any notably good achievements.  Should be voted:  these parties have brought some notable positive change giving them credibility.  RSP: Rabi has been journalist speaking and spreading awareness against the corrupt government for years. Balen, rapper, civil engineer and the former mayor of KMC, has brought notable changes to KMC compared the other parties in the past. While RSP might not be perfect and have room for improvement, they are the best alternative.  UNP: Kul Man Ghising had also brought some notable changes while serving in the electricity authority.  SSP: Harka, former mayor of Dharan also did lots of work in his tenure.  Mahabir Poon is a Scientist who founded the National Innovation center, and made many contribution like wireless networking projects. He is humble, based, generous, hardworking and not greedy or corrupt at all, in fact he tried to sell all his medals and possessions to fund the projects.  he is also supported by UNP and RSP and many other parties.|||these are very simple to understand   you can easily find them in Google and AI Tools too  the highly anticipated candidates are Balen (full name Balendra Shah - former Mayor of Kathmandu Metropolitan City and currently competing from Jhapa-5 which is Home Turf of former PM KP Sharma Oli \"The Infamous Nepali GenZ Killer\"), Rabi Lamichhane (founding and still current president of RSP and former MP from Chitwan-2 currently competing from same electoral area), They are faces of Rastriya Swotantra Party.

Blind support kills accountability and slowly turns politics into fandom. Support ideas, question everyone, even the ones you like.   DISCLAIMER:  I'm a non-partisan 34yo male, still trying to make it here, without going abroad.  FULL:  This isn’t about left or right, or any one party.        It’s just something I’ve noticed over the years, especially in Nepal.        Whenever a politician starts getting hardcore, die-hard supporters, things tend to go wrong sooner or later. Not instantly, not dramatically, but slowly. Power plus blind loyalty is a bad mix.        Problem ke ho bhane, we stop treating politicians like public servants and start treating them like heroes. Ani hero banepachi, normal criticism pani disrespect jasto lagna thalcha. Question garyo bhane hater, anti-party, anti-nation bhandincha.        But politicians ta job apply garera aayeka hun. They made promises, we voted based on those promises. If they actually deliver, that’s good. Tara tyo kaam gareko ma puja garnu parne hoina. That was already expected when we elected them.         I’m not saying don’t appreciate good work. Acknowledge results, give credit where it’s due. Just don’t turn people into gods. Once that happens, accountability slowly disappears. Galti bhayeni justify garincha, “at least aru bhanda ramro cha” becomes the excuse for everything, and loyalty matters more than competence.        At that point, politics stops being about policies and starts feeling like fandom. And fandoms are terrible at admitting when they’re wrong.        Support ideas, not personalities. Question even the people you like. Critical hunu ko matlab hate garnu hoina. In a democracy, we’re supposed to be citizens, not fans.       Just sharing how I see it. Curious what Gen-Z and millennial folks think. do you notice the same pattern, or am I overthinking this?",

But I’m deeply disappointed.  Most people I’ve met—especially in the 18–40 age group—seem cunning and self-centered. There is very little willingness to work together, build teams, or engage seriously in social issues. Information isn’t shared. Ideas aren’t welcomed. People aren’t interested in listening.  Instead, I was labeled an “outsider” simply because I lived abroad for nine years.  No one asks for volunteers. No one wants to organize. Everyone seems comfortable inside their own small circles, hiding behind social masks.  And then there are the so-called political parties and leaders.  I honestly haven’t met a single leader who feels capable of truly leading this country. There are no clear agendas. No strong principles. No real ideology. No respect for the voice of the people.  It’s all driven by ego and personal interest.  What is their party? What do they actually stand for? What is their vision for Nepal?  No clue. No respect. No real plan.  Just a constant political circus.  I once believed Balen represented change. But after seeing certain things up close, I now feel he is surrounded by people who are not very different from the rest. I bet that will influence his decisions in the future.  This hurts to admit, but I genuinely fear that unless something changes, this country will continue to suffer.",

I have also been back to my village, almost twice a year, and has been in constant contact with many of the socially and politically active people, including the political leadership of the village development committee. Wait, the people from outside are differently seen as a  threat and mostly as a cash cow by these politically active creatures, who unfortunately are the one sitting in the position of power.  Let me also remind you that, these people are in a minority, and most of the people are fed up with the system and are very much apathetic and pessimistic about the changes one can bring through process. Everybody wants fast and rapid change, which is unfortunately is not possible in the second like hours, that is I’m talking about a third economy.

It's a safe country in general, you could even blend in as a local since we have a significant mongoloid population, hehe   Living expenses are like, 100$ a month for a decent room in Kathmandu,  store rent might start from 500$ / month onwards depending on location and size, if you're planning on opening a store.   Healthcare is good enough, in Kathmandu that is.  Public hospitals are affordable, private hospitals are way better in service and infra, but are slightly expensive.   Bakery is a growing business here at the moment, so market is there. Specially in Kathmandu valley.|||I would definitely recommend you to go there at least once first. While there are problems, Life there can be slow and fun in it's own way. I don't know how good the courses offered in Nepal are for baking. Matter of fact, You might have to join a College there formally to learn. Make sure to look it up beforehand. I think you'll have tons of fun cafe hunting around Kathmandu Valley.  If you're there, get yourself a cake from Nepal Dairy \\[{Not the sliced ones(They are not juicy enough), order the big one, usually one pound. They are the best. }\\]|||check out korea makery cafe.|||Yes, you are welcome here.|||People are themselves dissatisfied with system that's it. Personally healthcare is cheap and much better if you come from western world. Just you need to figure out. Pollution, AQI is very poor in Kathmandu, but you won't feel it. Other cities kinda have lower than KTM. Since there are no proper weather sensors everywhere, I kinda feel the index is biased. Your identity in cities, they won't gaf, but in villages they may have issues. Yeah finding rent would be hard, for any foreigner cause we nepalese have dual standard and price differently for foreigners. Cake and Baking, make sure the learning center are not scams.   If I have to rate my country out of 10, I'd rate 7-8/10. If I have to choose between USA and Nepal, with salary of 700 USD/month, I'd choose Nepal.   Politics, other problems and all they come and go. We have instability in government and system. Society is functional since ages and they're much more mature and stable than west.|||Come To Nepal for short period first. Of course, Your skill (cake decoration) is niche. But, Kathmandu is the place where if you play your cards right, it can pay well. Plus all good hospitals are in Kathmadu valley( includes Kathmandu and Lalitpur) so you dont worry about healthcare. When you are in Lalitpur, visit Cafe Hessed in Pulchowk, Lalitpur and Korea Makery , Bhainsepati, Lalitpur visit these 2 bakeries owned and run by Korean Nationals. They will give you an idea how good or bad things are. There are some other places in Thamel and Boudha are too. But considering niche talent I would advise to target Baluwatar, Maharajgunj and Pulchowk area. LALITPUR area is more foreigner friendly less expensive.. So tread your water first before jumping in.   There is Academy of Culinary Arts and Hospitality Management in Lagankhel, Lalitpur. Next to Patan Hospital. Enquire online if you want to.  (Use google maps to locate those places)|||Don't come.|||Nepal is known for a lot of things. Cake decorating isn't one of them.|||Don’t! study in US or somewhere else. Nepal is great but don’t go there to study bakery - what are you doing?",

The price must have gone lower...i'm sorry if my comment wasn't useful for you  wasn't|||Well, I also sold my LOQ after using it for just three months and switched to an M2 MacBook Air, and honestly, that was a great decision for me. Mine is the 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD variant, and I’ve found it to be a really cool device overall. It’s been working fine for my use, and everything’s been going well.   I’ve seen quite a few listings on Facebook Marketplace where people are selling them for cheap, so it’s worth checking out. Just make sure there’s some warranty remaining, if possible. Otherwise, buying new is safer. If you can add a little more to your budget, getting a new M4 MacBook Air would also be a solid option.  That said, I wouldn’t really recommend the M2 8GB RAM variant for everyone, since it can feel a bit slow depending on usage. If you’re considering M2, it’s better to go for a higher RAM option if you can. And if you’re buying used, always check the battery health and SSD health as well.|||make sure to get 16gb ram. storage 256 or 512 doesnt really matter.   for 80-90k you might get and m2 air or m3 air. m4 air 16gb ta aaudaina.",

You should look into having more hands on experience for all the mentioned techstack preferably from your current work experience or running locally. You can run terraform and AWS combo using localstack without having an AWS account.   Look into infrastructure provisioning documentation provided by localstack and terraform, make it, break it, learn from it, document it. Start with something simple like 3 tier architecture, then look into provisioning EKS, CI/CD pipelines using open source tools (Gitlab, Github), for moderately complex application (can get code from open source), host on your own, learn about nginx, use ansible… the list goes on.

I don't know what works anymore. On the flip side it seems like more and more work is getting outsourced as the skill of people outside of the western countries have started to level up and with AI it seems like people everywhere are going to level up massively or equally.  What I see is crucial for the future is AI literacy, being able to leverage coding agents and be productive with it. But from my experience you need experience building applications to have good intuition with these AI agents. So if I was to give advice to people who want to stay in this field learn system design, architecture and build projects to implement them. Don't one shot applications/project. Build something complicated enough with these coding agents that you are forced to review the code, and if something feels unmaintainable learn to drive these agents in a way that you understand what you are building. And if you want to really stand out just build in public X, YouTube, tik tok but easier said than done cause us engineers by default are introverted. Just know that it's not you the market is just brutal, less hiring AI fear mongering holding new hires.  I spend too time in the X AI bubble so might not relate but this is where I see things heading. Maybe AI will be the level up that will bring more jobs to countries like ours so if I have hedge my bets it will be coding agents, system designs and building your own stuff.

He ran in 2079 provincial election as an independent and got a little more 1000 votes.  https://preview.redd.it/9nss5g1amtfg1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a6614656eb2aa886ced6c8437f8591b9ebd9183|||![gif](giphy|10uEX5kfeodYgo)  We need people like him.|||Yes! He must win!!|||He is a really good candidate.  And I’m from Kathmandu 5 as well. But the thing is, he’s still not that well-known among the masses here. From Kathmandu 5, we also have two big names running: Pradeep Paudel and Ishwor Pokhrel. Among them, Pradeep Paudel still has strong support, and he won from here last time as well. So Sasmit’s main competitors are Pradeep and Ishwor.  The issue is that there are other candidates too who will cut into the vote share, which is going to affect Sasmit. We have Kamal Thapa, even though he will likely lose, he will still cut some votes. Then we have Nisha Adhikari Malla. She is going to loose badly, but she will still take some votes. There are other candidates as well who may not win, but even in losing, they will split votes that could have gone to Sasmit.  So right now, for Sasmit to win, he needs to attract voters who would otherwise vote for Pradeep and Ishwor. We have only 37 days left now, so let’s see how things go. I do support him, but I’m worried that his chances are quite low.  One advantage for him is his election symbol, Ghanti, which might help. But still, he needs to grow bigger than Pradeep when it comes to influence in this area.|||I’m planning to vote for him, but three members of my family aren’t familiar with him at all. They only recognize the “Ghanti” symbol and aren’t convinced enough to vote for him. I really think he should start a door-to-door campaign in Kathmandu-5. Most people here only know about NC and UML, and that’s where their loyalty naturally goes. We need to see and know the actual face of our constituency candidate. The lack of visible campaigning is a serious disadvantage and could hurt his chances of winning.|||he has also done computer engineering before llb|||Replicate garne re 😂  Currently sab bhanda padauna kharchilo and mahango…ktm valley ma cha…plus 2 students lai scholarship Jun purano scheme ho Pahilei bata thyo Tslai prachar prasar matra garya hun!!!!

First of all, I owe a thank you to the mosquitoes in your house and the fan in mine the unlikely reasons we started talking and stayed up all those nights together.  You set the standard for me that love truly knows no boundaries. You chose a man who had nothing to offer but love, time, and an ear for all your \"yappings.\" You were there when I was at my lowest, constantly motivating me, telling me, \"You’ll make it.\"  You waited 3 years for me. You fought with your father when he gave you an ultimatum...(when he saw us talking)...  you deleted Instagram at home and reinstalled it at college just to send me a message, only to delete it again before walking through your front door. My days began and ended with you. I always believed love should be about freedom, not a cage so I gave you that freedom, and instead of flying away, you chose to stay closer than ever, even when we were miles apart.  I was a stubborn kid back then. You handled me with more care than I probably deserved. Your words still ring in my ears: \"Dhanna ma chhu ra timro jiddipan handle gareko chhu, aru bhayeko bhaye uile chhodera janthey.\"  You built my confidence and taught me how to fight for myself. You were a great cook yourself and even took the time to teach me🥹(I still follow your recipes). I introduced you to my family, and I still remember how much everyone loved you. Even when we fought, you were almost always the first to come back. Maybe I took that for granted...I was so sure you’d always return.  You saw the quicksand I was sinking into, and you kept holding on. You weren't the one who gave up...I was!. As I saw my own future drifting away, I felt like I was pulling you down with me. You were too kind and too sweet to be trapped in my mess. So, I slowly let go of your hand. You kept reaching out, but I refused to take it. I let myself sink so you wouldn't have to.  Eventually, I managed to pull myself out of that dark place. But by the time I was standing on solid ground again and ready to reach back for you, it was too late. You told me you were getting married. All I could do was congratulate you.  Seeing you happy now is what matters most. I never hated you, and I know you never hated me...I see you still liking my Instagram stories, and it's a quiet reminder of what we had. I haven't deleted my Instagram highlights where I mentioned you with your gifts.    Thank you for everything you gave me. You were the best part of my journey.  TL;DR: I pushed away the only woman who loved me when I had nothing, thinking I was \"saving\" her from my own failures and the \"quicksand\" of my life. By the time I got my life back together and reached out, she was already married. This is just a final thank you to the girl who fought for me when I couldn't even fight for myself...",

And you are again advocating that. One of the reason RSP is getting momentum is not because they will be good policy maker but because previous one didnt do much in development and this narrative wasnt set by RSP it was set by Congress and UML themselves. Check Election result patterns in many area, it always rotates between Congress and UML cz every time they go there for vote they use this narrative and now it is hunthing them.  MPs are not just for policymaking, they need to raise voice of their area too. But we need to make sure that people look them first as Policy makers more than Mayor type work (obvisouly they should be able to complain to their representative when mayor is not working or having problem)  People should understand whom to go for things  \\- Tap water/Certificates : Wards  \\- Roads/Education/Health: Muncipal  \\- Types/Standards of roads/education/health: Representative  MPs going for lobby is already a problem, This means basically who can influence more can get more budget like Parchanda or Oli. Government should have plans and local level should also submit their plans and it will be upto the government to pick projects as per budget, necessity and urgency. There was an idea about MPs getting development fund around 5cr for this exact reason where MP will have budget and invest but it can be misused and used both. Media potrayed it in bad way so people started going against it. If there was proper transparency then I think this is not bad, Mahat tried to introduce it but",

Isn't that really obvious though?|||Thats like asking, “Was Jesus a christian?”. Jesus was born as a Jew, but later promoted his own teachings. Likewise, Karl Marx was born in some form of monarchial bureaucracy, and later promoted his own philosophy( or idea). IMO, he was a communist because his belief lead to hundreds of communist revolutions throughout.|||K k ho yo communist ani yo aru k k ho socialist jata tatai xa aaile but don't know its meaning|||Ts ain’t tuff bub…|||[deleted]|||Was Adam Smith Economist?|||https://preview.redd.it/heqwwqodiffg1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c083dc45d51b17d83926436f0ff4538f13bac12b|||Did Hitler hate Jews 🤔|||\"Is KP Oli a child killer ?\" ahh question|||tait muji reddit ma ni sab pakhe nai hune raixan. basic humour ni bujhdainan. comment section checks out|||Is Bruce wayne Superman ?|||Yeah. Communism is really stupid if you look back at humanity now.|||This should be categorised as fictional book|||some deep shit ! ... op is not asking for superficial answer|||Technically, yes, he wrote the manual. But, Marx was a man who saw a disease but prescribed a medicine that was more toxic than the sickness. He wanted to fix the world by changing who owns the \"stuff\" without changing the \"human being\" who uses the stuff.  ​When you try to enforce \"equality\" through a state, you don't get a paradise; you get a prison. This is why Marxism has failed wherever it was tried as a rigid political tool.  ​Why \"Harkabad\" is the Antidote TODAY:  ​The reason we look toward a philosophy like Harkabad (Prakriti, Samskriti, Pravidhi) instead of Marxism or Western Capitalism is because it addresses the foundation, not just the \"economics.\" Harka Smapang has time and again said it has nothing to do with his name. He is suggesting a solution that isn't a western copy but suitable to the soil we stand on.   ​Marxism says: \"Who owns the factory?\" ​Capitalism says: \"How much can the factory produce?\" ​Harkabad says: \"Do we even need the factory if it kills the river (Prakriti) and destroys the community's soul (Samskriti)?\"  If you ask me if we need \"Harkabad,\" I would say we need Consciousness.  ​Harka Sampang is essentially bringing consciousness to governance. When he goes out and carries stones with his own hands (Shramadaan), he is moving from the \"ugly\" socialism (taking from others) to the \"wonderful\" socialism (giving of oneself).  ​We don't need a \"Communist\" revolution where blood is spilled to change the law. We need a \"Harkabad\" style evolution where sweat is spilled to restore the land. ​You don't need a book from 19th-century Germany to tell you how to live. You just need to look at the earth beneath your feet and the people around you.",

I think it makes more sense to focus first on chapters that carry the highest marks and revise them multiple times.|||Jn Milan  Rajesh sir & organic padaune suta sir k ho naam birse  Biology chae Milan gaire   I guess these are best teacher  Ma chae engineering gareraxu but mero sathi haru mbbs padeko ani ma pani bio padeko ho so alli thaxa .",

Ofc sapna bokechau hola voliparsi kehi garni and u gotta work hard. But dont push yourself too hard , enjoy your life a little . Your life wont end due to a damn exam there is much more to do in life. Aba parents haru ta karai rahanchan . What even can we do lol? Ani btw you are pretty damn good in maths . You will improve in other subjects too . Dont stress out|||I am in 12 now. 11 ko first term was best for me all 60 above (except that damn physics) chem ma ta 64 aathyo but i didn't think that much and tried to do good in physics.   2nd term ma physics ma 49 aayo but chemistry ma 45 that drop of 19 marks made my mental health go blind. I gave up on chemistry and physics, I didn't even want to study these two anymore tara after 3rd term 11 final 12 pre term, finally 12 ko 1st term ma physics and chem ma 52 and 53 aathyo respectively. I was satisfied enough. Ani 2nd term ma ahile physics dhostai xa, chem chain tight teacher parexa k huni ho thaxaina.   So to explain what happened here: 1. Course ko amount badhepaxi the marks drastically drop as you and I both faced.  2. The amount of stuff you have to remember is always more than you remember.  3. For mcq and reasoning questions you must read books cuz teachers don't cover everything.  At last, 11 doesn't matter that much as marks and grades, 11 class is just about the memories you build that 12 might not give you.  You look like a study kinda guy so you might have friends like that too, so i am telling you the reality here. The friends you have might not have that chill attitude later in 12th so enjoy the memories you are building cuz in 12 everyone around you will suddenly start focusing on studying and you might fall behind so 12 ma jani bittikai start learning concepts especially physics ko.   Tips for you in 11  1. Grab any opportunity you have become CR club member Host of program sing or whatever you are good at cuz you will be remembered by that more. Also being a CR or club member will benefit your bidesh ko lagi.  2. Try understanding concepts of everything. Science is all about logic if you don't understand the logic behind it you can't understand the science behind it.  3. Feel free to ask to teachers, they are not your enemies. Friends might suppress your curiosity but it doesn't mean teachers won't listen to you. Concepts bujhdainau bhane teachers lai gayera sodha If you are shy to ask them in public. Go to the teachers in the staff room or meet them in the corridor, hallways and question them. Doing this, some of your friends might call you teacher ko chatne or something like that ignore them cuz you are the one who is gonna stand in that interview after 12th not them.  4. Chill.  Tips for 12 Doing 1 will help you be a face that everyone recognizes in 12. If you don't do 1 you might regret it in 12 so go for it.  Keep doing 2 and 3. After a few months into 12, you will realize that its all about what you understand. If you can understand the concept you will remember the formulae. Like physics ko nai kura garda, concept bujhexa bhane timle mathematically k garne yaad hunxa tespaxi dimaag ma or paper mai tyo derive garera formula lekhna sakxau.   This is all about the tips rant and motivation i have for you|||dm me",

There seems to be a sudden surge of tourists who come only to make content, create mess, and show no respect for the city. It doesn’t feel like tourism anymore it feels careless.On top of that, the local leadership has also disappointed me.

In my opinion RSP and Nepali Congress will form a coalition government.|||mathi ko duita madhe euta tala ko duita le election nai jitdainan|||First of all remove Harka and put Prachande in there because that mf is a mastermind, no idea what that dickhead would cook from behind.

I want Oli to lose at any cost, I am not even sure why is he even back on polls. He should know he’s been a failure by now.|||Gagan 30% KP oli 20% Prachanda 10% Balen 39% Harke Pagal 1%|||I personally believe Gagan Thapa have that’s guts and courage to run this full of shit country,good diplomacy, can differentiate between right and wrong(bishesh adhibeshan) Balen on the other hand don’t even know what he will do, just like his tenure as a Mayor.Another person than can actual do work is Renu Dahal. Believe me or not Balen is just a social media hype he’s will never be a good politician |||I think Gagan will win. Balen has a huge support base, but much of it exists mainly on social media. Many of his supporters don’t actually live in Nepal and therefore can’t or won’t vote for him. I personally would vote for him, not because I am his blind supporter but because he is the best candidate among all. I also think that many will assume that enough people will turn up to vote for him and decide not to vote themselves, which could ultimately work against him...  Gagan, on the other hand has an established base of supporters, many of whom belong to an older demographic and live in Nepal. This makes them more likely to show up and vote, giving him an advantage...      Edit to add: Let's also not forget the power of algorithm. What we see on our socials is merely the reality. My Insta is full of Balen supporters, but these people are similar to me in terms of demography. Whereas, the algorithm of my dad's TikTok is entirely different from mine.|||If RSP cannot form government with majority seat \"in this election\", they won't in any near future.|||Why is harka even there?|||Why us harka in the pms's conversation 😭😭|||Anyone from above except KP OLI is ok !|||If Balen wins in Jhapa-5, the government will probably be formed by RSP with Congress or RSP with CPN (Maoist Centre) and other small parties.|||There’s one guy in this list that the country needs now and it’s not Harka Sampang.|||At least for the immediate future, Oli doesn't have a good chance of becoming the prime minister again. Everyone will come out to the streets if that happens regardless of how \"democratic\" the system is. UML will still be a formidable opposition though. Frankly I don't think Balen can beat Oli in his own area. My prediction is it's gonna be Gagan Thapa as PM with RSP in a coalition. Gagane has been in this game for a long time, his meticulous plan for a party coup supported by Shere's stubborness worked out fantastically. Balen is hugely popular with the Gen-Z. Today's gen-z will be tomorrow's millenials, day after tomorrow's gen x and old people. He'll definitely be prime minister someday. Just not this time.

KP Oli has some chance but I doubt either RSP and Gagan led NC will make Oli PM after his role in Gen Z protest.   So it is either Gagan or Balen (provided both win from their tough places). Aba, it also depends on whether RSP or NC becomes the largest party pani. Like if NC becomes largest party, Gagan may try to form government and I think he will try to do it without either UML or RSP suruma. I doubt it is gonna happen. He may try to get RSP help but no chance it will happen. Next possibility is RSP becomes largest party or second largest and Gagan proposes Balen as PM based on some common agenda and they govern together.   So, either Balen or Gagan imo.|||Harka Sampang le afnai area ma jitdaina jasto lagchha based on what he says.

RSP might get seats not less than 60 and not more than 93. With coalition with Nepali congress, they might get seats enough to form a government. If they opt to go to opposition with such position, the establishment, which will certainly try to form the government will try to cleanse the presence of RSP.  Thus, RSP will indeed go for forming the government. Looking at present scenario, either NC or prachanda might involve themselves in the coalition with RSP. Prchanda maynot get enough seats to form the government. RSP and Gagan led NC might go for the government.|||none  gagan ethically not correct person  balen didnot finish what he asked for in ktm kp just a dictator who pride on self harka just showcase of words|||Non other then Gagan Thapa ✌️|||balen > kulman > harka >rest of what's left|||Oli le pheri bajaucha hoina bhane Balen.

Get it done and get certified by government recognized armorer, .  Get it permanently and irreversibly incapable of firing, not just unloaded, not just missing parts. It must be impossible to restore it to a working weapon. The item should be legally treated as a historic artifact, not a weapon  You'd require a deactivation certificate from the country of origin (authorized proof that it is government recognized armorer). Clearly stating:  * Serial number * Model * That it is permanently deactivated * That it cannot be restored * Date + official stamp  AND,  Historical documentation stating:  * WWII-era German pistol * War trophy * Family inheritance * Passed down generations * No intent to use or sell  Before doing any of that consult an immigration/firearms attorney in your country.  And contact Nepal embassy beforehand specifically asking if you can import a permanently deactivated historical firearm with certificates and historical documentation.  Bring printed copies of everything, declare it openly on arrival. There’s still is no guarantee you’ll get them back promptly. Also i think you require a licence once you're here or beforehand in the country. A lot of work.|||As a foreigner, it is next to impossible unless you have some really good political connections. Hunting rifles are permitted for hunting seasons, but the owners are required to take them back with them. Only .22lr rifles and 12 gauge shotguns are legally permitted to own for Nepalese nationals. Your best chances of getting correct information is by contacting the Kathmandu District Administration Office. They're the one issuing gun licenses.|||It depends on how much effort and money it is worth to you. There is virtually no way to prevent you from getting a gun into the country if you have time and money enough. As long as you can get it through the point of departure, Nepalese airport security is probably not equipped to identify components of a disassembled gun in electronic devices or jewelry, especially if just a few parts are taken across the border each trip. Gun smuggling is relatively common in Nepal, usually done through the open border with India though, where I'd imagine it to be much easier/straightforward.   Moreover, law enforcement in Nepal is very corrupt. Even if you were found out, I think keeping your family heirloom would only be around 2000$ max., and that only if your case makes it to the desk of a higher-up.|||Get a safety deposit box or storage unit in the states and leave it here|||Just leave it somewhere safe bruh|||Just curious, if you have consulted with lawyers/bureaucrats regarding visa status, if you plan to move permanently.

So, it's been creating hassle.|||Do the same thing you did with the car your grandfather used or his dining chair. BTW what did you do with those?|||You don’t need to bring a Nazi gun to Nepal.|||Sorry for all the rude comments. Idk whats up with nepalese these days, since the genz protest everyone seems rude.   They don't allow it here. If its dissembled and you manage to get a permit from your home country, and in Nepal as an artifact then they'll allow to bring it to Nepal according to the law but they just don't allow it thru the airport anyways. Whats most likely gonna happen if you bring it here after getting the documents is they'll seize it. And you'll have to go thru court hearings to get it back which is not gonna proceed so its lost forever. You could sneak it in and they wouldn't mind after cz you got the docs but yeah thats illegal and not endorsing any illegal activities here. But landing in Indian airports then entering Nepal thru land could be an option although I'm not very familiar with the boarder situations on land or the ones at indian airports|||Leave it in USA for now. Its too troublesome to get a permit here, plus for a foreigner it becomes even more harder.|||I would say it will be extremely difficult but not impossible. However I would suggest you leave it in the US. It's not worth the hassle imo.|||One can only get permit if they prove owning gun is essential for their safety. Mostly high level ex police army and top level officials and leaders own private gun form what I can see.  But in case of antiques there might be some exceptions specially if its made inert.  P.S. Even people with licence cant hold gun till mid april due to election. and guns are often held by DOA during election months.|||[Are guns legal in Nepal? - 2026 Laws and Regulations](https://legalitylens.com/are-guns-legal-in-nepal/)|||Yes, you can legally own a gun in Nepal, but only with explicit government approval, since firearms are not treated as a personal right and all possession is licensed under the Arms and Ammunition Act. In practice, this means you would need both an import permit to bring the firearm into the country and a separate ownership license issued after arrival, and while foreigners can receive permits ( especially for historical or collectible pieces ) the process is discretionary, slow, and not guaranteed, so before moving you would need to contact the Nepali authorities to confirm procedures and ensure the heirloom is not treated as contraband.|||No sir, you aren't allowed to carry firearms and there's no loophole or an exception made in that regard.   It'll be better to give it to a trusted friend or family member for safekeeping back in the states.   Good day.|||Safest bet is to leave the gun in safe hands back in the states. Talk to authority at the Kathmandu Airport and bring/leave it next time you come around.|||Free guns for the police👍🏼|||You can only have a Gun license if you have enough proof of your life being in so much danger that not even the Police can protect you and you yourself have to have a gun to protect yourself. That applies to Nepali Citizens only. As you're a Foreigner it's illegal for you to get a gun under our Law.. Even if you bring in a Gun Shaped jewellery from abroad and get found out in TIA it can lead to prosecution.|||Very strict gun laws.   Not just for foreigners but also for Nepali citizens.  I know that you can bring a gun if you are hunting, there is one hunting reserve in Dhorpatan.  But you will likely not be allowed to bring it and keep it in the country.  Furthermore pistols and side arms are considered to be for self defense and not hunting therefore the controls are stricter.

If you dig deeper and treat our history not as a series of accidents, but as a dataset, a clear algorithm of disillusionment emerges.  Someone once said religion is the opium of the people. In Nepal, Hope is the opium. And every few years, we get a new \"dealer\" who feeds us a specific drug (hope) to keep us high while the system remains exactly the same.  # The \"Drug\" and the \"Dealer\"  If you look at the historical data (same thing applies for Rana's and Panchayat era as well), every major shift follows this pattern:  * The Dealer: Prachanda (treated like a God). * The Drug: One ruling family is the only obstacle. * The Result: We took the drug, got the high, the King left, but we woke up and Singapore and Switzerland was hallucination. * The Dealer: KP Oli (treated like a God). * The Drug: Ultra-Nationalism & Chuchhe Naksha. * The Result: A lot of speeches and a new map, but the \"trains and ships\" were just hallucinations. * The Dealers: The Balen/Ravi duo (treated like Gods). * The Drug: Accountability & Managerial Heroism. * The Status: The public is currently \"peaking\" on this high.  # Pani Maa Paadeko Effect  We are currently obsessed with the bubbles. Bulldozers clearing slums, viral parliamentary speeches, and aggressive social media posts create a lot of noise. But as the saying goes, it’s all \"Pani maa paadeko jasto.\" It creates a lot of air bubbles on the surface, it makes a sound, but once the bubbles pop, the water level (system) hasn't moved an inch. The water is just as deep and just as stagnant as it was before.  # Model ko Overfitting  For the tech minded, the problem is overfitting. Every new leader trains their model on a very narrow set of public frustrations (e.g. corruption, or India). Because the model is so overfitted to the public's current anger, it looks perfect during the training phase (campaign). But when they face the Test Data the actual reality of an old patronage network, a resistant bureaucracy, and international pressure, the model fails. A linear solution of one strong leader cannot fix a non linear, complex system.  # How to Break the Loop  If history and data trends tell us anything, today’s excitement will hit the same wall as the Maoists and the UML before them. Politics cannot escape the cycle of patterns. The \"Drug of Hope\" feels good, but it doesn't build nations. We will only break the loop when we stop looking for a dealer to make us high and start focusing on the unglamorous work of fixing the source code: our institutions, our rules, and our own civic responsibility.",

            "comments": "Sanitation engineer's (Janitor) perspective  I don't have datasets or algorithms. I have keys, a broom, and a schedule that never changes no matter who is in power. From where I stand, politics isn’t complicated at all. It’s like a building that keeps changing managers, but nobody ever fixes the plumbing. People argue about ideology upstairs. Down here, the pipes still leak. The Building and the Managers. Every few years, a new manager comes in wearing a clean suit and big promises. They don’t ask how the building actually works. They don’t talk to the people who clean it, guard it, or keep the lights on. They just repaint the lobby and change the signboard. From my logbook, the pattern is always the same:  The Maoist Management:  The Manager: Prachanda (spoken of like he’d demolish the old building and build a new one).  The Promise: “Once the King is gone, everything will flow.”  What I Saw: The portraits changed. The leaks didn’t. The same people kept using the service elevator.  The UML Management:  The Manager:KP Oli (spoken of like he’d modernize the whole place).  The Promise: New wings, new routes, new connections.  What I Saw: More speeches in the lobby. Still power cuts. Still broken toilets on the top floor.  The Current Management:  The Managers: Balen and Ravi (spoken of like they finally understand the mess).  The Promise: Discipline, order, accountability.  What I See Now: Sudden inspections. Loud scoldings. Cameras everywhere. The dust is finally visible but it was always there.  Cleaning During Office Hours  When bulldozers come, people cheer. When speeches go viral, people clap. But I know this rule: If you only clean when visitors are watching, the dirt just moves to another room. Slums get cleared, but no one checks where the waste water goes. Files get shouted about, but no one updates the maintenance manual. A lot of noise, a lot of dust—then silence. By evening, I’m still sweeping the same corridor.   Temporary Fixes, Permanent Problems  Some managers love quick fixes. Tape over a crack. Paint over mold. Replace a worker instead of fixing the system that broke them.They think one strict supervisor can fix a building that’s been neglected for decades. But old pipes don’t respond to shouting. Rust doesn’t care about speeches. This place isn’t broken because one person was bad. It’s broken because everyone learned how to survive the brokenness.   How Buildings Actually Get Fixed.   I’ve seen one thing that works, and it’s never glamorous. You shut down sections, even when people complain. You replace pipes nobody ever sees. You write rules and follow them even when it’s inconvenient. You train people, not just fire them. You accept that real repairs take time and look boring.Most importantly, you stop pretending the problem is the previous manager.  Final Note from the Basement.  From where I work, hope isn’t a drug. It’s a cleaning schedule.If you only feel hopeful when a new manager arrives, the building will always stink. Real change is when the lights stay on, the water runs clean, and nobody needs to clap because things just work.Until then, I’ll keep mopping the same floor while upstairs, they argue about who deserves the credit.|||[deleted]|||Software Engineer's perspective  Nepal’s democracy behaves like a legacy system with frequent leadership swaps but no structural upgrades. Every election is a new deployment trained on short-term public mood - hope, anger, anti-corruption talk. It passes campaign tests, then fails in production when it hits the real stack: bureaucracy, patronage networks, coalition maths, foreign pressure.   Same bugs, every cycle: - Overfitting: slogans over reality. - Single-leader illusion: PM treated as the whole system. - Frontend noise: speeches, ordinances, symbolism — backend untouched. - Hope as cache: feels instant, expires fast.   Why nothing changes: - No regression tests against past governments. - No rollback when policies fail. - Institutions never get a schema migration. - Incentives reward noise, not delivery.   What democracy actually needs: - Fewer “strong leader” releases. - Slow, boring institutional refactors. - Reduced discretionary power. - Clear contracts between parliament, bureaucracy, courts, local governments. - Real observability: transparency, audits, consequences.   You can’t fix Nepal’s democratic system by rotating prime ministers. That’s not a leadership issue - it’s an architectural one.|||Not reading all that AI generated slop.|||\"Paani ma Paadeko\"    That is the worst analogy I've ever read in my life.|||Whats a data scientist?|||Kaslai vote dida ramro huncha, timi vanana ta.

There is very little willingness to work together, build teams, or engage seriously in social issues. Information isn’t shared. Ideas aren’t welcomed. People aren’t interested in listening.  Instead, I was labeled an “outsider” simply because I lived abroad for nine years.  No one asks for volunteers. No one wants to organize. Everyone seems comfortable inside their own small circles, hiding behind social masks.  And then there are the so-called political parties and leaders.  I honestly haven’t met a single leader who feels capable of truly leading this country. There are no clear agendas. No strong principles. No real ideology. No respect for the voice of the people.  It’s all driven by ego and personal interest.  What is their party? What do they actually stand for? What is their vision for Nepal?  No clue. No respect. No real plan.  Just a constant political circus.  I once believed Balen represented change. But after seeing certain things up close, I now feel he is surrounded by people who are not very different from the rest.

            "body": "I am being honest and critical here. For those who genuinely want Nepal to become a better place and be recognized as a developed nation, we must acknowledge that we are critically failing. Lets start with history here, If we look at the result of Chitwan Constituency No. 1 in the 2079 election, our level of awareness becomes painfully clear. On one side stood Bishwanath Paudel — a PhD graduate from the University of California, Berkeley, with experience in national and international policymaking, university teaching, advisory roles in institutions like the ILO, and currently serving as the Governor of Nepal Rastra Bank. On the other side stood Hari Dhakal, who represented rebellion and “newness,” despite not meeting the commonly accepted standards of excellence by which Paudel would normally be judged.  If competence, experience, knowledge, and contribution had truly been the criteria, the result should have been one-sided. But it was not. Dhakal won by a large margin, and Paudel finished third. This happened because people did not vote for a candidate; they voted out of anger toward old politics. Paudel did not lose because he lacked ability, but because he was seen as a symbol of the old party and of Sher Bahadur Deuba.  This reveals a deeper problem: our consciousness is only half-awakened. We are frustrated with the old parties and the system, yet we still fail to apply proper standards when choosing alternatives. We vote in anger, not with reason. We react, but we do not evaluate. Competence is not defined by a degree alone; it is built from education, knowledge, experience, contribution to policymaking, character, and integrity.  When a person with such qualifications loses solely because of party identity, it is not that person who loses — it is the country. Preventing capable individuals from losing elections is not an emotional demand; it is a demand of the time. A nation is built or destroyed not inside the ballot box, but inside the voter’s awareness. That awareness is not measured by speeches or slogans, but by the choices made during elections.  From now on, people must decide with judgment, not with the momentum of the crowd. They must judge with the mind, not with the anger of the heart. The day voters begin choosing candidates based on knowledge, ability, experience, character, and intention, opportunists will leave politics in shame, capable individuals will step forward naturally, and democracy will finally belong to the people.   Let us remember this: when good people begin to win, the nation never loses.",

I’m not saying every MP needs to be a Harvard graduate or some top expert. That’s not the point. Even someone who regularly talks with their voters, listens to their problems, raises local issues in parliament, and stays reachable would already be doing better than most.  Instead, many MPs start acting like they’re above the people once they get the title “माननीय.” They forget who gave them that title in the first place.

            "body": "For a long time in Nepali political arena we needed the the big parties to completely reform and move with the flow of time. Led by leaders since panchyat system, their mindset was never going to understand the demand of time. So a big reform was necessary right after the constitution was promulgated.  As much as I absolutely despise the 10 year long violent \"war\" led (in part) by Dr. Bhattarai, he realized that communism and the political agendas like किसान मुक्ति, भुमि वितरण etc were far outdated. He tried to start a political party with mostly economic reform agenda (आर्थिक क्रान्ति). But an ideologue barely makes a good crowd-puller a rabble-rouser of some sort, he had Prachanda as a demagogue in the so called \"war\". I have to give props to Dr. Bhattarai for taking a complete U-turn right after constitution was promulgated, although he kept insisting using the word Socialism, I bet he favoured free market economy of some sort. Anyway the point is he felt the need of reform and tried doing so.  It was clear that Oli led UML, Deuba led Congress and Dahal led (whatever party names he keeps on chaning everyday) was never going to understand the demand of time. Their whole mindset was so cooked up in cycle of getting to power and remaining in power till next election, it was almost a perfectly curated impregnable wall. Voices like Gagan Thapa tried to voice reforms in the Nepali Congress party, but the wall was impregnable. For example, in one of the central committee meetings he is seen saying things like (upto my translation), \"Why precisely do we need to be in government? What are we going to do that we won't do if we are in opposition? What plans do we have and how are we executing this?\" These were very important question and almost none in the central committee would understand the true depth of what he was trying to convey.  Gagan Thapa was somewhere in the middle. He was neither a true demagogue like Oli or Dahal despite his very strong oratory skills. Nor somebody who could start from scratch like Bhattarai on a true ideologue spirit. And the Nepali Congress party kept hanging by a thread. There had been constant tussle between the old guard and the new, but the thread never quite broke. The other two, Oli led and Dahal led party had absolutely no room for any dissent. Any and every opposing voice would be silenced and expelled.  It was clear, Oli and Dahal led parties stood no chance of any reform and Gagan Thapa and co couldn't muster enough strength to finally break that thread in congress. We needed alternatives. Ujjwal Thapa (not sure how politically mature he was) attempted to do it completely from scratch, but the literacy and overall intelligence of average Nepali wasn't quite ready enough to accept the ideal political culture. And this was going to need a lot of time and people were running out of patience.  It was as if we needed a new demagogue in the political discourse, one who would capture the public sentiment. The rise of Rabi Lamichhane and RSP is the approval from the public of their desire of new demagogue. He promised reforms in the whole political landscape almost by magic. The only political ideolgy he ever needed to sell was, getting rid of three Bas, Kepi Ba, Nanika Ba and Deu ba. He didn't quite tell how he would do that, but people liked the idea of breaking the musical chair circus, that they immediately jumped ship.  Where are we now, we have a new party led by a demagogue, who are completely dearth of any sort of constancy in their ideology either economically or politically. People who seek any hint of their economic ideology are confused by whether it is free market economy (Dr. Wagle) or more socialist विना ढेऊवाके, (Balen). Dr. Wagle started a sentence with, \"People portray us as anti federalist but ... \" and then went on to stretch that sentence so long I had no idea what it was. In that long sentence all I was able to glean was that he equivocated between getting rid of \"pradesh sabha\" (very cunningly curated phrase) and denying that they were anti federalists. I would think this is not a lack of clarity within themselves, but a tool they use to please everyone. Both the anti-federalists and federalists think that they are one of them and both the socialists and the capitalists accept them as one of them. This blatant hypocracy is not because Dr. Wagle, a PhD in economics, doesn't understand the difference, but that he knows its a powerful weapon to attract votes.  People don't realize it, but they are in this trap now. Rabi is the hero they needed, the promises he makes, the emotional soap opera he recites are perfect. So much so that they are completely turning blind eye on the very reform that they actually are seeking. Making the institutions stronger, improving trust in the institutions and never compromising in the rule of law are some fundamental pillars, that he is completely shattering. The trap is that its almost unthinkable that you'd support the Oli-Deuba-Dahal trio, but also extremely hard turn blind eye on the fundamentals. People don't realize this trap, they are in this euphoric phase of escaping the Ba trio, that the fundamentals are far down in the order of priorities. But that's precisely how we make base for new age disappointment to be realized only decades later. I sometimes think the blatant disregard of rule of law (Attorney General letters), the complete distrust in institutions that RSP has perpetrated in the public might be more damaging than this power hungry ba musical chair. But it would be disingenuous to pretend that the ba trio have not damaged the fundamental pillars. So this trap is obvious and yet not so easy to get out of.  We don't have to go far back in history. We were in almost precisely identical state in the recent past as a society. It was a mixture of both euphoria and fear due to the end of so called \"war\". Another demagogue in Dahal equivocated between accepting the parliamentary politics to the public and outright describing it as another step of state capture to his cadres. He probably had better dreams to sell than Rabi now, like claiming singapore etc. Despite the vast majority his party received in the first election, he had to organize a laughable press meet during the counting phase of the following election, claiming extremely baseless accusation of widespread voter faud. It only took 5 years for people to realize that a demagogue isn't taking us anywhere. But the damage had been done, he still uses his tricks everytime to get the \"magical number\" to always be in the ba trio, to form the impregnable wall.  Take for example the events of the last month alone, Rabi got out of jail, had part of his case withdrawn (still in process I believe at this point), had the ministers the \"public government\" deny their involvement in RSP until the very last nanosecond and immediately go run for election. Now running for election isn't anything wrong, the opposite infact is the case, its the beauty of democracy. But the denial to the very last second, begs a question why? Why not declare that you are running, what did you have to hide? Self managed newspaper printed that he wasn't going to run in the morning and in the evening he resigned to register candidacy next morning. Fishy much? Not one but three ministers of \"public government\" (wanted to) joined the new party denying till the last nanosecond.  Sounds like I am selling pessimism too much. Its undeniable, the hope that RSP has sparked is truly commendable, the future PM Balen has made visible changes in the city he was Mayor of. Equally undeniable is the kind of mindset RSP has triggered out of euphoria has a long term effect. I encourage them to question and have alternative view given fair bit of thought.  Another minor qualm I have is how petty the RSP supporters are against any minor hint of opposition to RSP, especially here in reddit. But it seems like, we as a society are like that, making very petty personal attacks against opposition, so can't uniquely attribute RSP for this. This also means on average that they don't necessarily have have higher moral fibre as they grew out of the ba trio.",

The trap you are talking about feels real to me, as someone who saw the rise of prachanda, then oli, i cant help but notice the same pattern with rabi and balen. I fear, this new frenzy, in some ways can be even more detrimental than previous ones, fueled by social media we are seeing groupthink like never before,  we are witnessing the birth of a new jholeygiri. A generation that was largely apolitical till sept 8 was suddenly forced and required to understand politics, and where did they go to do so? to social media where clout=competence. All of them are united not by principle but by the mere fact that they arent the oldies, this is just tribal instinct not politics.    With regards to RSPs ambiguity, we know in the case of swornim wagle its strategic but for most of RSP its ignorance. They sit on the fence because they have no ground to stand upon, no principle to adhere to, they are a motley crew of dissidents, influencers, tv loudmouths and youtubey wannabes. To give them credit they have few good ones who actually know whats up, but can they make rational decisions against the force they have relied on, the populist base?? Can they please both  federalists and anti federalists at once, the ones who believe government should run industries and the ones  who believe the opposite?? if tomorrow swornim says mcc was a good agreement he will be branded a \"bideshi dalal\" by many of  the RSP supporters. The only thing they can do to keep up the act will be more doublespeak.   The disillusionment this type of politics eventually brings is the real issue. 5/10 years down the line where will the people look to. Our institutions are barely surviving, oldies did no good to them, new ones are already making it worse. My fear is people will give up on democracy itself and hand this country to some \"benevolent dictator\", a fascist. Just looking around the world,  the liberal world order is dead, trump posts edicts on social media, the world is heading to absolute chaos, our leadership, our institutions are severly ill equipped to handle the coming era.|||It’s inevitable that the party is gonna break even if they win the election. A party fueled by the need-for-change by non like minded influencers turned politician will barely get anything done. A guy who believes in free market economy cannot write policies who advocates for the Nationalization. Regardless I really hope they prove me wrong stick together, win the majority, and let few highly intellectual people at the party write the laws and support it despite their ideological differences for the next five years. Because let’s be clear we only need few competent ministers.|||\"Criticism is rarely pleasant, but it is necessary.\" Winston Churchill said it, though the attribution matters less than the truth behind it. In Nepal, criticism is not merely discouraged; it is treated as betrayal. Anyone who questions dominant narratives is quickly labelled a bideshi dalal or a bheda serving another ideology.  This attitude existed during the Panchayat era, persisted through the monarchy, continued under the so-called Tin Tauke period, and it is likely to survive into the current Rabi Balen Gagan moment as well. And might as well pass onto the generation after that. Dissent here is only tolerated when it targets the other side. You will become bheda of opposite ideology if it comes inwards.  Nepali society understands pain, and they treat it. When the hand hurts, it is treated. When the pain returns, it is treated again. But we always avoid to look for why the pain keeps coming back.  Also, there is a persistent black and white view of politics here. Either he is Completely good or he is completely bad. Either he is god/Messiah or he is a devil. There is no in between. Today’s villain can easily become tomorrow’s hero, and vice versa. Political dialogues and debates can not foster in such society and until that happens, we can not get a government that is accountable to it's people. We will just pass on the baton from one Messiah to another and country will be in the same place it was 50 years ago.|||Damn i was thinking similar. After Gen z protest almost everything is happening the way majority of nepali people want to see except the investigation. Until balen went to jhapa malai election hudaina hola jasto lageko thyo, balen ko hype dekhera it adds more fuel to general people expectation of change in nepal politics but the wave we are seeing now was always there during election. Kaile congress ko wave kaile uml ko kaile maobadi ko, pachi gathbandan ko etc these wave of musical chair has always existed and last election bata to wave hataune bhanera RSP aayo and they are in this.

Thats the basis most people are voting for the new party. Well written|||In politics, patterns inevitably repeat. That is a given. Genuine reform can only emerge from within society itself, and development will always be gradual, regardless of who comes to power.  I disagree with your claim that Balen is a socialist. My reading of his speech is that he was mocking the old politicians who label themselves as socialists while failing to practice it in any meaningful way. By saying that his actions are more “socialist” than theirs, he was not affirming himself as a socialist. Rather, he was highlighting the hypocrisy of those politicians and implying that even without claiming the label, his work aligns more with what they claim to stand for. The underlying message is that he does not need ideological branding to deliver results.  As I said, political patterns repeat. Just as there was massive public support when the three traditional parties first emerged....allowing them to thrive, build cadres, and consolidate power.....the same process is now happening with RSP and a new generation of politically engaged citizens.  Despite being aware of these cycles, I will still vote for RSP and Balen.....because why not? It is my democratic right. More importantly, seeing the old cadres confront the consequences of their incompetence after losing elections is part of the democratic process itself. This contestation helps democracy mature and strengthens democratic culture in the long run.|||got hooked into it right from the start; it was a great read. enjoyed it thoroughly.

Will it really create an ideological war just because of it?    I completely agree with RSP's lack of transparency and support Sumana Shrestha's decision.

            "body": "I know many youths here and across Nepal are thinking about either voting for RSP or NC (Some might go for other parties but I don’t think it is a lot). Here are my reasons for voting for RSP this time.  **1.Fundamental Changes:** I believe that RSP has more chance of bringing fundamental changes in Nepal, be it amending laws or creating new ones or reforming our civil service or public education/health institutions than Gagan led NC. Gagan Thapa seems better than most old politicians but he has been part of the same system for decades and so Can he fundamentally bring changes to Nepal?? RSP is the only major political party right now with no student unions (in colleges and schools), no trade unions (in our civil service and other public institutions) while we know Gagan came from Nepal students Union. So can he then bring laws that will ban student unions in colleges or ban party unions in our bureaucracy?? Can he do really merit based appointments when we know there will be enormous party pressure to appoint their own people?? RSP has their supporters but it is much less than NC and they can do merit based appointments. Can NC bring serious changes in our economy when we all know who funds them?? I think not. The new appointments for anti corruption body CIAA is coming up, Will NC appoint people there who are gonna investigate many of their own leaders or RSP will do so who were in govt for a very small time.   **2. Diversity of candidates:** Vast majority of NC candidates have been in politics their whole lives but either changed their camp from Deuba  to Gagan, or Gagan picked his own people. Contrast that with RSP where you have some candidates involved from other parties but also many who were not in politics before, some are Doctors, many are engineers (including Balen himself), many social activists and community organizers. There is diversity and this will help in forming laws in Nepal.   **3. Balen as Prime minister:** Balen Shah is RSP PM candidate and a vote for RSP is making Balen PM. Is he perfect?? Absolutely not and he has to improve certain things but let us look at his record as KMC Mayor. Zero corruption allegations against him (If there was even a little, he would have been arrested and jailed already as CIAA is under control of old parties) and that is a major plus. His administration has preserved over 200 ropanis of publicly encroached land before, he provided scholarships in private schools and colleges to thousands of lower income students which was never done before, there has been development in KMC too. He did all this, and he also worked with other parties especially NC and UML ward chairs in doing so. Many times, his plans were thwarted by Nepal govt. With this record already in place, yes I think we should give him  a chance this time and let us see what changes he can bring as Prime minister of Nepal. There will also be checks and balances against him within his own party and in Parliament.   **4. Gen Z protest acknowledgment:** RSP was the first major party to acknowledge Gen Z movement, you have some Gen Z leaders in their central committee and also are given tickets. I believe if RSP has a government they can bring people who killed Nepali youths in Bhadra 23 to justice. Can NC do that??     These are just some reasons I have in voting for RSP this time. It is basically in hope of fundamental changes. Their party manifesto is yet to come for this election. Here are their mission and vision, [https://rspnepal.org/about/mission-and-vision](https://rspnepal.org/about/mission-and-vision). Even if you don't vote for RSP, I hope no youth will vote for KP Oli's UML party.",

            "body": "I want to start by saying this clearly: I am not anti-Balen.  I respect many things he has done and I understand why people see him as a symbol of change.  But BECAUSE he represents something new, I think it’s important that we hold him to a higher standard NOW, not later.  It is the only way democracy survives.  Recently a journalist proposed interviewing multiple leaders together in a public debate format. Balen rejected the idea, saying he would not share a stage with someone he considers a murderer. In his comment under KP Oli’s post, he wrote a long rant framing public debate itself as morally unacceptable.  This raises a few serious questions.  **First: Does debating someone mean you endorse them?**  If a scientist debates an anti-vax person, does that make the scientist anti-vax? If a human rights activist debates a war criminal, does that mean they support war crimes? Of course not. Debate is not endorsement.  Debate is how the public tests ideas, intentions, and competence. By refusing to debate, Balen is not morally isolating bad leaders. He is isolating himself from public scrutiny.  **Second: If Balen avoids debates, how do we know his agenda?**  So far, we mostly know what he is against.  We don’t clearly know:  * What kind of Prime Minister he wants to be * What his economic priorities are * How he plans to handle federalism, foreign policy, corruption, or social issues  **Third: Inflating numbers weakens moral arguments.**  In his comment, Balen says 76 children were killed.  But according to most credible sources, the number is closer to around 40. Forty murdered children is already horrific. Why inflate it?  When a leader who is “janne-bujhne, padheko” exaggerates facts, even for a moral cause, it damages credibility. Truth matters, especially when you claim moral superiority.  If we do not question our “good leaders” now, we are quietly preparing the ground for the next KP Oli or the next Prachanda. Unaccountable leaders don’t appear suddenly.  They are created by supporters who stop asking hard questions.  How should citizens evaluate him without hearing him defend his ideas? If he doesn’t explain these in a public, confrontational setting, then what mandate are people actually supporting? Are we voting for a plan Or just for a personality?  Are we supporting a vision or just an image?",

            "comments": "I feel like with Balen, the core issue is this: he’s a populist leader, and we’re living inside ahis populist wave. He knows it. He plays it well. And honestly, that’s not new in Nepali politics. Oli was a populist once. Prachanda too both rode massive emotional waves before settling into the same old politics.  So when Balen refuses to debate, he frames it as a moral position. In his mind, sharing a stage with someone he sees as corrupt or violent makes him look like he’s lowering himself. That works for his brand. It fits the image he’s built.  But underneath that, I think the context matters. Nepal is extremely divided after the recent protests. UML people have not recognised the martyrs , and anti-corruption protestors got labelled as foreign agents or anarchists .  So when Balen avoids debates, I don’t think it’s only moral disgust. I think he knows he’s riding a media-driven populist wave. He knows the youth are with him. He knows social media amplifies him more than anyone else. And he knows that an open debate where his statements can be pulled out of context, clipped, twisted could puncture his momentum.  He’s smart. He understands optics better than any politician in the country right now.  Meanwhile KP Oli is not operating on the same wavelength. Different generation, different communication style, different political instincts. Balen knows he benefits from contrast, not confrontation.  What I don’t fully get is the extreme skepticism toward Balen as if he’s already the next dictator-in-waiting. What do people want? Should we dive straight into chaos and pretend we don’t need any leader at all? Should we pretend there’s a magical alternative hiding somewhere?  If we distrust every single new face, then who exactly are we left with? UML? NC? Maoists? Or the monarchists’ fantasy of a saviour king? Because that’s basically the menu.  Nepal is a very young and very unstable country. I genuinely think we need a new symbol for a little while someone who can surf the populist wave without sinking the country. Four years, not a lifetime. Someone who isn’t carrying the entire weight of the old system.  I think Balen is avoiding debates because he’s protecting his narrative. And in this phase of Nepali politics, narrative is everything.|||Bhedas follow loud mouths coz they are too lazy to use their brain or just straight-up dumb to understand intellectual arguments. Just see indian netas giving speech. It's just a manipulation game. Doesn't matter whatever bullshit you spew. If you are confident and loud enough, dumb people will follow. And if Balen tries the same tactic as being loud mouth, and spewing insubstantial bullshit, he is gonna lose his current supporters.|||If anyhow the debate even initiates , balen would be the first victim of that debate coz oli and gagan would certainly make him nanga . Coz their whole life has been revolved around debates ,manipulating and false promises ones.  they would certainly raise some issues where balen would be speechless and the others will consider this as their win and  helping in  their election campaign.  For me ,Rabi would be far better than balen to face other possible pm candidates .|||At some point around 2020 US election, I used to follow the candidates, debates etc. I came across a video of Al-Gore conceding defeat, because apparantly there was some court issues etc. That rabbit hole lead me to a video, where they were analyzing how debate performance enhanded/diminished the changes of a presidential candidate. They found out that every very unrelated topics to policies and fitness of office affected candidates' chances. Like if they coughed at some point, started to fidget with something or things like that. Its because debates like this have too much spotlight in one (or few) events. And your margin of error is extremely low, and that is risky. And Balen at least seems to have understood this.  It is possible that Balen thinks he can't win in policy discussions. He has massively overpromised in the mayor election and underdelivered (common across world political scene I think). Although as Rabi dai said, \"Daaktar saap, bajet lekhna thalnus\", they certainly have capable person to make economic policy, Balen might fear accurately representing daktaar saap's work.  Another possibility I think is his public speaking ability. I was underwhelmed by his Janakpur presentation. Understandable that he came to such large crowd to speak for the first time in his life as a politician, he had massive pressure. In that 2020 or 16 may be not sure, US election I followed, there were people thinking somebody called Marko Rubio as a potential candidate and people say Trump just absolutely devoured him because Rubio was nervous.  Another one, that most people here in reddit are assuming, is that, a known charlatan in Oli will overpower him in terms of speaking. Oli might use this to whitewash his name and get more validation for himself.  It could be one or combination of these to avoid debate. The logic he posted in Oli's comment certainly seems weak in my eye. He should rather have not commented at all in his classic silence fashion.  Its not correct to assume that we wouldn't know his agenda if he doesn't come to debate. We have ghoshanapatra system in nepal. Me personally, I'd like my PM to at least face media. Be confident enough to speak confidently to the public. Its absolutely frustrating that we haven't had Balen answer any question from the public media ever.|||A public debate among all parties PM candidate should happen. Hamro questions haru answer garne. Afno plan and policies clearly vanne, yo sab debate bata tha hunchha.|||I agree with your first point.      \\> **Second: If Balen avoids debates, how do we know his agenda?**  Debates are not the primary source of a party's agenda. There are other ways of knowing his (RSP's) agenda. Balen is RSP now. And you can find lots of things on their website.   Also, RSP leader Swarnim Wagle said that they're purposefully delaying their election manifesto because they don't want it to be copied, which kinda makes sense.  You can check RSP's website and see if it answers questions.

Recent agitation of Balen during nomination, i mean now he really need to decide whether he wants to be a politician like others are or want to be a LEADER? who can bring the change for good (please don't BS like dherai manche thiyen and blah blah, what if everyone start behaving like this at the time of stress be a politician, government servant, teachers, medical people, police?)  And most importantly if they win Balen will be Pm but he is not gonna be \"The Government\", there gonna be other ministers and member aswell, so my thought is we should not make a single person \"The messiah\" as it is not gonna help us in long term, lets not make someone that powerful that people cannot question him (eg is neighbor, where they made one politician so powerful that people started comparing him to God and anyone who question the supreme is antin@tional, and bizarre is no minister is competent and got free pass because of one face).  Have u guys checked whether previous \"mananiya\" has live upto the standard be it of any party, what good they bring to their constituency? where is their report card or they just wanna swim in the wave of Balen. where is there accountability? (people may call me anything but  its totally genuine to ask question to the people u support, people u have hope with)  **Lastly** more power to current PM, she is the one standing there for all the causes and making sure nothing can put a break on her purpose. But very much hurt by all the other ministers as they used the sentiment of youth against previous government to strengthen their political game and left her in the middle of the road to fight alone. having political ambition is not wrong in itself but if u had such ambitions one shouldn't have joined the interim government  **(Ashamed)**",

(Should I personally ask them to deduct 5% TDS?)  I also receive USD payments from an EU-based company. In that case, tax is deducted twice: first by the platform itself (approximately 3.5%), and then another 5% TDS is deducted here. When the funds arrive, my bank automatically converts the USD to NPR based on the prevailing exchange rate and credits it to my account in Npr.  I opened a USD account (dollar card) using my PAN. The annual limit is USD 500, but as far as I understand, this limit is only for payments/spending. Is it possible to increase this limit or ask the bank to keep incoming USD directly in that USD account instead of converting it to NPR?  Another question is that, if i’am to receive payments from a subscription based service from a platform apps i made, i basically can’t from nepal, for that i either need the LLC or C-Corp registered in US banks that accepts remote workers no ?

I was working for one of the renowned company.. they made us use the cursor. They kept telling us to have 2x productivity.

This is already happening, and it will accelerate rapidly over the next 12–24 months as AI tools get mass-adopted inside companies.  That said, the outcome isn’t as simple as “developers are done.”  What’s actually happening is a restructuring of value.  As companies begin laying off junior and mid-level developers, they won’t eliminate development teams entirely. Instead, they’ll rely on fewer, highly reliable developers who can handle much more work with the help of AI. This creates a paradoxical situation: layoffs on one side, high demand on the other, but only for the right people.    If you come from a development background, the smartest move right now is simple:  * Become exceptional at using AI as a force multiplier. * Just knowing how to code won’t be enough anymore. That used to be the differentiator; now it’s table stakes.    **What matters now is:**  * Knowing how to think in systems * Translating vague requirements into clear specs * Using AI to generate, refactor, test, debug, and ship faster * Understanding architecture well enough to spot what AI gets wrong * Owning a specific niche deeply enough to solve high-value problems quickly    Companies won’t pay top dollar for someone who can “do everything moderately well.”  They will pay very well for someone who can fix a very specific, painful problem reliably.  And let’s be honest: saying “AI won’t replace humans” is already outdated. It has started replacing roles; not because AI is perfect, but because it’s good enough when paired with the right person.  If a non-technical person, like myself, someone who loves tech but never formally learned coding, can now build a full-fledged system using tools like ChatGPT and Replit, then the competitive bar has fundamentally shifted.  AI isn’t coming for jobs.   It’s coming for generic skill sets.    **So the choice is clear:**  * Either level up into a top-tier senior developer who designs systems, makes decisions, and leads execution * Or become a highly specialized mid-level developer with deep expertise in one niche and excellent AI leverage  Anything in between is the danger zone.  This isn’t a threat, it’s an opportunity.  But only for those who adapt early and intentionally.  Cheers!|||Lmao CRUD/landing page ta garihaalxa ni.

            "body": "I’ve been using Cursor for years.  Not just as a tool, but almost as an extension of how I think while coding. It helped me explore ideas faster, remember syntax I hadn’t used in a while, and move smoothly from thought to implementation. Over time, I stopped noticing it as a separate thing—it just became part of my workflow.  Until one day, I couldn’t access it.  For some reason, Cursor just wasn’t available. No quick fixes. No workaround. Just… gone.  At first, I thought it would be fine. *I’ve been coding for years,* I told myself. *I should be able to handle this.*  But then something unexpected happened.  I couldn’t code.  Not in the dramatic “I forgot everything forever” sense—but in a much quieter, scarier way. My mind felt blank. Things I *knew* I knew weren’t coming to me. Simple patterns felt distant. I stared at the screen, unsure how to begin. Even planning the solution felt harder than it should have been.  It felt like trying to write with a pen after years of typing—except the pen was there, and my hand just wouldn’t move.  What bothered me most wasn’t the slowdown. It was the realization of how dependent I had become. Cursor hadn’t replaced my skills, but it had been carrying a lot of cognitive load for me: memory, structure, momentum. Without it, I had to face the raw version of my thinking—and it wasn’t as sharp as I assumed.  That day forced me to sit with an uncomfortable question:  **How much of my ability was mine, and how much was outsourced?**  This isn’t a post against tools. I still believe tools like Cursor are incredibly powerful. They make us faster, more confident, and more creative. But that experience reminded me that tools can quietly reshape how we think—not always in obvious ways.  Since then, I’ve tried to rebalance things a little:  * Writing rough logic before touching code * Letting myself struggle longer instead of immediately reaching for help * Rebuilding trust in my own memory and problem-solving  I still use Cursor. I probably always will.  But now I’m more aware of the line between **augmentation** and **dependence**.  Losing access for a day didn’t just block my workflow—it exposed a blind spot. And honestly, I’m glad it did.  Sometimes, a blank screen isn’t a failure.  Sometimes, it’s a mirror.",

The current world is evolving and we are actually getting productive with AI. On the other hand imposter syndrome and fear of AI taking the job and all is normal i believe.  Cursor isn’t just autocomplete.. it holds context and your coding patterns.. when that disappears suddenly, it’s normal to feel blank for a bit. I think it’s your brain missing its external cache.  If it was down for few more days, I’m pretty sure you will still get the work done with another tool, just slower. The scary part is the interruption. I agree that awareness is valuable. Knowing what we’re making and that you can rebuild it when needed is probably the healthy middle ground.|||![gif](giphy|RlrcXMffVZaouUVPGD)  AI good for idiot like me, like I'm CSS developer (I only code CSS). code only CSS my entire life(2006 - till this date) I never bother myself to learn PHP or JavaScript.

I’ve been working in this industry for the past 3 years although not in software side but on the infrastructure side.   I can assure you that this is definitely the case. Not all the companies will fail but 98% will for sure. The industry is super saturated, no new innovation is happening the chatbots won’t be sufficient as we now know how dumb and rudimentary they are. Of course some will survive like grok Gemini OpenAI Claude as they have massive corporations backing them up. And every other “AI tool” is basically a wrapper of one of these.   The head-cost of data centre operating alone is enormous not even counting the compute and hardware just utilities alone apart from GPUS, RAM, Server and Storage is more than what most companies can afford.   Ad is another factor that could change things but remember how many AIs there are, the ads have to super cheap as there’s always another company in china  with the same capabilities that’ll undercut your prices. So it’s not a stable solution either.   After the boom of social media there were 1000s of new social media platforms but 99% failed that is the same case here. Only the ones that are specialist in their broad field will succeed that is the ultimate fate.|||AI as a whole ta failed ma na halum j hos considering how dependent people are in generative AI, tyo chai fail teti easily na hola except chatGPT cuz holy moly they are going recklessly baru google le rmaro apporch gari rako xa espically apple wala deal where they just provided them model ani host garne and all sab apple le nai hernu parne re soo no additional overhead cost.  tara it will be interesting to see how these AI companies will make the best out of it cause aile ko condition herda ads halo vane ni its a chatbot soo  firstly ta people will keep asking ani secondly tyo jun answer generate garna lagne cost xa tyo level ko return ads le dela ki na dela tei mathi kati chai halxan hola ra ads ni.

            "body": "Hello everyone,  I am a 16 year old Class 10 student from Nepal. I am currently working on a personal AI assistant project called Sorvx AI. I would like to share it with the community to gather technical feedback and suggestions. I also build and share other development projects and experiments on my personal website, [sagarb.com](https://sagarb.com) .You can find general information about the Sorvx platform at [sorvx.com](http://sorvx.com) , while the beta application is hosted separately.  This project started as a tool to improve coding workflows. It included AI supported coding and debugging. Over time, it has grown into a general purpose assistant that can handle tasks like research, summaries, planning, learning, and problem solving. The main goal of this project is to combine research tools, sandboxed execution, and multiple AI models into one user friendly interface for developers and general users.  I developed this project alongside my academic studies, and it is currently my largest personal software project. I continue to work on improving the system architecture, performance, and reliability.  The platform is currently in beta testing, and some features are still experimental. I recently integrated the Brave Search API for web searches. Because Brave limits requests to one per second, I am using a queue based system to handle requests. This may slow down responses during busy times. The sandbox based command execution is also in beta and may be slow or unstable in some cases. Additionally, file and image uploads are temporarily disabled due to current API limitations. Sometimes, if the OpenRouter API rate limit is exceeded, the chatbot may return an empty or failed response. I am actively monitoring and addressing these limitations.  At this stage, I am seeking feedback on usability, performance, reliability, and overall system design rather than promotion. I have hands on experience with AI integrations and web application development. I am especially interested in technical insights, best practices, or constructive suggestions from those with experience in AI platforms, search APIs, backend scaling, or production deployment.  If I receive enough community support or funding in the future, I plan to introduce additional LLM model options within the platform. I will also implement a credit based system for usage after my SEE examinations to help with scalability and fair usage management.  If you would like to test the beta version and provide feedback, the application is available here:  [https://sorvx.io/](https://sorvx.io/)  Thank you for taking the time to read this post. I truly appreciate any feedback, advice, or technical suggestions from the community.",

I don't know what works anymore. On the flip side it seems like more and more work is getting outsourced as the skill of people outside of the western countries have started to level up and with AI it seems like people everywhere are going to level up massively or equally.  What I see is crucial for the future is AI literacy, being able to leverage coding agents and be productive with it. But from my experience you need experience building applications to have good intuition with these AI agents. So if I was to give advice to people who want to stay in this field learn system design, architecture and build projects to implement them. Don't one shot applications/project. Build something complicated enough with these coding agents that you are forced to review the code, and if something feels unmaintainable learn to drive these agents in a way that you understand what you are building. And if you want to really stand out just build in public X, YouTube, tik tok but easier said than done cause us engineers by default are introverted. Just know that it's not you the market is just brutal, less hiring AI fear mongering holding new hires.  I spend too time in the X AI bubble so might not relate but this is where I see things heading. Maybe AI will be the level up that will bring more jobs to countries like ours so if I have hedge my bets it will be coding agents, system designs and building your own stuff.

Understand why these services are offered, what specific business problems they are trying to solve.  3. Identify the best service to use for your problem in hand. use VM or container-based approach? or use Lambda instead)  4. Use Infrastructure as Code, e.g. terraform, pulumi, or AWS native CloudFormation to manage the Cloud Infra.  5. Be able to deploy the services offered by a company (e.g. execuaibles, containerized applications, web-pages, etc.) on the Cloud Infra.   6. Troubleshoot and support the services and infrastructure.

RaSaPa ko ki Mutton Kaji Farm ko?|||Lol, honestly I didn’t even know he had uploaded something yesterday, but my post had perfect timing and it blew up. Even Bibek Thapaliya was hiding his affiliations, and KMAG still hides theirs. This guy just picked up that post and used it to make himself look good again.  I know how biased he is or maybe he doesn’t even realize how he got used. This is how Gagan operates. He invites these influencers, keeps them close, so they don’t post or make content against him. By doing these meetings, he slowly creates a soft corner in their mind and heart. So later, when Gagan messes up, they hesitate to criticize him because they’ve met him personally and think, “He’s a good guy.”  This is also how Gagan has managed to influence journalists across different media houses. Not all of them are in his inner circle, but he subtly shapes how they think. He invites them, talks to them, and slowly pushes the narratives he wants—who’s bad, what’s bad, and how to counter certain people.  The social media ban happened when Congress was in government, right? He won’t openly say, “Support me” or “Make things favor me,” but indirectly he keeps planting ideas like, I’m the only one who can fix this, and stuff like that.  This is a very familiar pattern with Gagan Thapa. First, influencers like these create noise online, and once it starts getting attention, he jumps in and talks about the issue as if he really cares. If he genuinely cared about social media, he could’ve spoken up against the social media ban when Congress was in power.  Even during the Gen Z protest, he subtly planted leaders like Tanuja and Rakshya Bam through his media outlet, Setopati. Their interviews were pushed again and again, filling the feed with news about what Rakshya and Tanuja were saying. Slowly, that turned into posts supporting Gagan Thapa. In the end, neutral and unaware people start feeling like, oh, Gagan is the hero we were looking for, just because these figures they follow are also backing him.  Ask him if he made any contents on Gagan Thapa?  \\-  Did he made video when Congress tried to sneak in a loophole in the cooling period? What happened to Khatiwada then after?  \\- Did he made how gagan thapa surviving without doing a single job?  \\- When Congress/UML tried to pass 5 years corruption expiry bill.  \\- Even to debunk PACT corruption where Gagan Thapa was alleged, even to debunk the allegation. (he wont, cz truth or not, many will know about this case and will have -ve perception of Gagan)  \\- Why is he surrounded and hangs out with Goons?  \\- Why WikiLeaks has Gagan Thapa as key embassy contact?  No, he won’t do that, because he’ll always have a soft corner for Gagan Thapa. That’s how Gagan Thapa works he spreads narratives through influencers like him, who knowingly or unknowingly end up producing such content.  Another example is Gagan doing small meetings on “populism” and then letting influencers create content around that topic to “spread awareness.” For influencers, it looks like he’s thinking about the nation. But from Gagan’s point of view, he knows those influencers will create content that ends up being subtly targeted at new faces.  https://preview.redd.it/x4nqjclj1veg1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=5303b0b09e8b772195bbc2a80116bd3b9f25bdb5|||RONB le tetro Balen ko chusekai chusai cha ta 3 4 barsa bata yo vanda badi jholagiri ta kai dekhechaina kunai media le koi lai gareko.

Balen always kept quiet & kept going, ended winning the election convincingly. Then Oli came around in power and absolutely chokeslammed Balen as mayor because Oli was heading central government.  I feel like the tenure under Oli was why Balen is hell bent on uprooting Oli from his root itself & I'm so so so here for it. UML is back to its way of attacking Balen everyday & Balen hasn't said a word about them. I like the way pattern is repeating.|||Yes|||yo photo therathum ko hoina hola..|||History repeats itself haha, this guy will turn out into a new dictator.

            "body": "As you can see, the person highlighted in the red circle is Binayak Kuikel, a YouTuber who runs a channel called *‘Why So Offended’*. He subtly pushes a narrative portraying RSP/Rabi/Balen negatively, often labeling them as populist. You will hardly find him criticizing Gagan Thapa. He is there to set narratives.  Most of the people seen in the photo are from Gagan’s core group, who are very active on Twitter and regularly share pro-Gagan and anti-RSP posts, one of them being Raghav in the brown jacket.  You can support any leader you like, but you can’t pretend to be neutral while subtly pushing your own agenda and narratives.  ーーーー  Lol, honestly I didn’t even know he had uploaded something yesterday, but my post had perfect timing and it blew up. Even Bibek Thapaliya was hiding his affiliations, and KMAG still hides theirs. This guy just picked up that post and used it to make himself look good again.  I know how biased he is or maybe he doesn’t even realize how he got used. This is how Gagan operates. He invites these influencers, keeps them close, so they don’t post or make content against him. By doing these meetings, he slowly creates a soft corner in their mind and heart. So later, when Gagan messes up, they hesitate to criticize him because they’ve met him personally and think, “He’s a good guy.”  This is also how Gagan has managed to influence journalists across different media houses. Not all of them are in his inner circle, but he subtly shapes how they think. He invites them, talks to them, and slowly pushes the narratives he wants—who’s bad, what’s bad, and how to counter certain people.  The social media ban happened when Congress was in government, right? He won’t openly say, “Support me” or “Make things favor me,” but indirectly he keeps planting ideas like, I’m the only one who can fix this, and stuff like that.  This is a very familiar pattern with Gagan Thapa. First, influencers like these create noise online, and once it starts getting attention, he jumps in and talks about the issue as if he really cares. If he genuinely cared about social media, he could’ve spoken up against the social media ban when Congress was in power.  Even during the Gen Z protest, he subtly planted leaders like Tanuja and Rakshya Bam through his media outlet, Setopati. Their interviews were pushed again and again, filling the feed with news about what Rakshya and Tanuja were saying. Slowly, that turned into posts supporting Gagan Thapa. In the end, neutral and unaware people start feeling like, oh, Gagan is the hero we were looking for, just because these figures they follow are also backing him.  Ask him if he made any contents on Gagan Thapa?  \\- Did he made video when Congress tried to sneak in a loophole in the cooling period? What happened to Khatiwada then after?  \\- Did he made how gagan thapa surviving without doing a single job?  \\- When Congress/UML tried to pass 5 years corruption expiry bill.  \\- Even to debunk PACT corruption where Gagan Thapa was alleged, even to debunk the allegation. (he wont, cz truth or not, many will know about this case and will have -ve perception of Gagan)  \\- Why is he surrounded and hangs out with Goons?  \\- Why WikiLeaks has Gagan Thapa as key embassy contact?  No, he won’t do that, because he’ll always have a soft corner for Gagan Thapa. That’s how Gagan Thapa works he spreads narratives through influencers like him, who knowingly or unknowingly end up producing such content.  Another example is Gagan doing small meetings on “populism” and then letting influencers create content around that topic to “spread awareness.” For influencers, it looks like he’s thinking about the nation. But from Gagan’s point of view, he knows those influencers will create content that ends up being subtly targeted at new faces.",

I thought he had a very balanced views and used to follow his contents.|||This video is being pushed with a really misleading narrative.   Binayak Kuikel wasn’t part of any “core” or secret meeting of Gagan Thapa.  This happened when the Social Media Bill was being discussed. Influencers and digital stakeholders were openly invited to share their views. It was a public consultation, not some behind-the-scenes planning session. Some of those inputs were later reflected in changes to the bill, which is exactly how participatory policymaking is supposed to work.  Calling this “propaganda coordination” by cutting out all context is misleading. Criticize policies, question leaders, that’s fair. But pushing edited clips with false framing only lowers the quality of political discussion.  Before reacting to viral videos, shouldn’t we first ask what the full context is and who actually benefits when it’s removed?|||Tei vayera raixa ajkaal anti balen kura garne    tallu le chance payo aba garxa  Gagan ra unka supporters ni rsp kei kura copy garne pheri rsp lai nai populist vanne?

Pages like Nepal of Routine Banda often do the same with Balen Shah—presenting him as a lone Robin Hood fighting the system, where everything else is shown as conspiracy or sabotage.  Real governance isn’t that simple. Cities aren’t run by heroes alone, and democracy doesn’t work when context is removed for clicks. If Balen is the leader people are looking for, his work should be judged with facts and honesty, not viral clips and emotional framing.

Communism is really stupid if you look back at humanity now.|||This should be categorised as fictional book|||some deep shit ! ... op is not asking for superficial answer|||Technically, yes, he wrote the manual. But, Marx was a man who saw a disease but prescribed a medicine that was more toxic than the sickness. He wanted to fix the world by changing who owns the \"stuff\" without changing the \"human being\" who uses the stuff.  ​When you try to enforce \"equality\" through a state, you don't get a paradise; you get a prison. This is why Marxism has failed wherever it was tried as a rigid political tool.  ​Why \"Harkabad\" is the Antidote TODAY:  ​The reason we look toward a philosophy like Harkabad (Prakriti, Samskriti, Pravidhi) instead of Marxism or Western Capitalism is because it addresses the foundation, not just the \"economics.\" Harka Smapang has time and again said it has nothing to do with his name. He is suggesting a solution that isn't a western copy but suitable to the soil we stand on.   ​Marxism says: \"Who owns the factory?\" ​Capitalism says: \"How much can the factory produce?\" ​Harkabad says: \"Do we even need the factory if it kills the river (Prakriti) and destroys the community's soul (Samskriti)?\"  If you ask me if we need \"Harkabad,\" I would say we need Consciousness.  ​Harka Sampang is essentially bringing consciousness to governance. When he goes out and carries stones with his own hands (Shramadaan), he is moving from the \"ugly\" socialism (taking from others) to the \"wonderful\" socialism (giving of oneself).  ​We don't need a \"Communist\" revolution where blood is spilled to change the law. We need a \"Harkabad\" style evolution where sweat is spilled to restore the land. ​You don't need a book from 19th-century Germany to tell you how to live. You just need to look at the earth beneath your feet and the people around you.",

Ofc sapna bokechau hola voliparsi kehi garni and u gotta work hard. But dont push yourself too hard , enjoy your life a little . Your life wont end due to a damn exam there is much more to do in life. Aba parents haru ta karai rahanchan . What even can we do lol? Ani btw you are pretty damn good in maths . You will improve in other subjects too . Dont stress out|||I am in 12 now. 11 ko first term was best for me all 60 above (except that damn physics) chem ma ta 64 aathyo but i didn't think that much and tried to do good in physics.   2nd term ma physics ma 49 aayo but chemistry ma 45 that drop of 19 marks made my mental health go blind. I gave up on chemistry and physics, I didn't even want to study these two anymore tara after 3rd term 11 final 12 pre term, finally 12 ko 1st term ma physics and chem ma 52 and 53 aathyo respectively. I was satisfied enough. Ani 2nd term ma ahile physics dhostai xa, chem chain tight teacher parexa k huni ho thaxaina.   So to explain what happened here: 1. Course ko amount badhepaxi the marks drastically drop as you and I both faced.  2. The amount of stuff you have to remember is always more than you remember.  3. For mcq and reasoning questions you must read books cuz teachers don't cover everything.  At last, 11 doesn't matter that much as marks and grades, 11 class is just about the memories you build that 12 might not give you.  You look like a study kinda guy so you might have friends like that too, so i am telling you the reality here. The friends you have might not have that chill attitude later in 12th so enjoy the memories you are building cuz in 12 everyone around you will suddenly start focusing on studying and you might fall behind so 12 ma jani bittikai start learning concepts especially physics ko.   Tips for you in 11  1. Grab any opportunity you have become CR club member Host of program sing or whatever you are good at cuz you will be remembered by that more. Also being a CR or club member will benefit your bidesh ko lagi.  2. Try understanding concepts of everything. Science is all about logic if you don't understand the logic behind it you can't understand the science behind it.  3. Feel free to ask to teachers, they are not your enemies. Friends might suppress your curiosity but it doesn't mean teachers won't listen to you. Concepts bujhdainau bhane teachers lai gayera sodha If you are shy to ask them in public. Go to the teachers in the staff room or meet them in the corridor, hallways and question them. Doing this, some of your friends might call you teacher ko chatne or something like that ignore them cuz you are the one who is gonna stand in that interview after 12th not them.  4. Chill.  Tips for 12 Doing 1 will help you be a face that everyone recognizes in 12. If you don't do 1 you might regret it in 12 so go for it.  Keep doing 2 and 3. After a few months into 12, you will realize that its all about what you understand. If you can understand the concept you will remember the formulae. Like physics ko nai kura garda, concept bujhexa bhane timle mathematically k garne yaad hunxa tespaxi dimaag ma or paper mai tyo derive garera formula lekhna sakxau.   This is all about the tips rant and motivation i have for you|||dm me",

I am in US, and I can say 98% of my friends don’t support his policies. There are a few who do but there’s always an exception.   Now many, including myself, do support some level of checks and restrictions on immigration. Those who didn’t get in take that as being opportunistic or slamming the door after I got in. Far from it.   What I don’t support is people coming through illegal means. What I don’t support is people cheating and providing 100% false representation while applying. Then once they get in, they try to game the system and just be a leech sucking in the benefits without contributing. They are making it harder for the legitimate immigrants and that’s exactly what we hate.  Now I don’t support the current position of not granting any immigration visa indefinitely to Nepal. But you know why this happened? Because almost 40% of Nepalis, about 70-80k take welfare benefits from the US government. You don’t need it if you are a contributing member of the society (except for in some disability/age related case).   There are people coming to US to get free medical treatment. One performer got the treatment and left the Us without paying the medical bills- that person is now banned from coming. Another famous pair got the DV and justified their entry by saying they get free medical for their kid (their case may be legit, but I am just giving an example of what people have been doing).   The administration is going to the other extreme to curb this- but some of it is because the past administration didn’t do anything to prevent it from happening.|||I seriously doubt the accuracy of this sentiment. Nepalis who have settled in America invariably work to bring other family members here. The effort is long and hard, and many are still in process, meaning that spouses, siblings, and others are now cut off from coming over. My brother in-law was able to finally secure his wife's visa a few weeks ago, after working on it for 2 years.  a few weeks later and she wouldn't get to come, so no, Nepali uncles and aunties aren't supportive, and there is no indication that most nepalis voted for trump.  The other thing to consider is the message behind the visa suspensions.  The trump administration is basically saying that immigrants who have come here have not improved conditions, but rather they have made it worse by taking advantage of government programs that they are not entitled to. In other words immigrants are lazy, and thieves. Not a lot to take pride in about that.|||Let me know what you are smoking..seems like good stuff.|||Just like the viral trend chori manchey ko khutta tanney chori manchey naai huncha.

Why would anyone be happy about the current situation ? All of you who agree with the statement are in Nepal who couldn’t make it to the US.|||May I dare present a different perspective?   Not everyone who votes Republican is \"hiding the ladder since they've made it\". That claim is lazy, false, and ignores basic economic reality.  Some of us vote based on numbers, not slogans. When you are paying over $100,000 a year in taxes (household)—income tax, state tax, property tax, sales tax—and you don’t see proportional benefits in return, fiscal policy starts to matter a lot. At that level, voting conservative isn’t ideological—it’s rational. Lower taxes, limited government, and accountability in spending simply align better with that reality.  Paying six figures into the system and being told you’re “privileged,” “selfish,” or morally inferior for questioning where that money goes is not persuasive—it’s alienating. Wanting to keep more of what you earn does not make you hateful. It makes you financially literate.  Many Republican voters reject racism and extremism outright. What they do reject is runaway taxation, bloated government, and being constantly generalized or morally lectured by people whose policies they fundamentally can’t relate to. The same way not all Democrats are extremists, not all Republicans are villains.  And yes—we are also tired of being lumped together with fringe elements just because we don’t align with extreme progressive ideology. Disagreeing with activist politics, identity absolutism, or ideological purity tests does not make someone anti-human. It means they prioritize practicality over performative outrage.  People vote based on lived experience. For households paying $100k+ in taxes every year, conservative policies often make more sense. That’s not hate. That’s math.",

Will you question or take responsibility for the recent GenZ killings? Your party member Ramesh Lekhak was also the Home Minister at that time—have you questioned him about this?  - You have been a Member of Parliament four times, and during your tenure, the Congress has formed the government multiple times. Can you point to any concrete, policy-level achievements you delivered during your party’s time in government?  - What about Aftab Alam case during your party's government was he rightfully being prosecuted or your party's government have him impunity from jail, what about that case?",

Deuba, as an individual, may once have been a true leader—but over time, the gang culture around him is what turned everything rotten and made him look bhrasta.  From this point onward, Gagan is free.  Free from:  All blame linked to Arzu  All accusations about money in Deuba’s house  All baggage related to Bhutani saranarthi  All the kandas, Teramox, and backroom deals  All blame connected to Lekhaks and their networks  These were never Gagan’s sins to carry.  So why should he keep answering for other people’s cults? Why should a reformist voice be held hostage by the corruption, compromises, and power games of an old guard that refuses to let go?

Don't get me wrong there are shortcomings from him and nobody is perfect but most of the questions you raised here are poor attempt to make him look bad.  You have to realize that even though Gagan is a prominient member of Nepali Congress, he was never the executive. Every decision the party makes as a whole, the chairman (Deuba) has the supreme authority and he is little to no say in any of the decisions.  Even then, he has clearly spoken against all wrongdoings. And you say \"just speak\". But that's the problem of not being in executive power, he can only speak.  You trying to  make the money burnt in Deuba's house somehow a crime by Gagan Thapa clearly tells me that you are just trying to hate. Otherwise as everyone else has said, there is a special probe commission formed to specifically study the burnt money case and all we can do is wait for their report and the government will file the case if there is wrongdoing (which we all believe there is). And Gagan has clearly affirmed this, as any sane person would. You should read him and listen his many public interviews/videos and not just assume he didn't say anything.  He has clearly said multiple times that any and all involved in sahakari kanda should be investigated including naming people from his own party by name, again multiple times in multiple of his public appearences and writings, you should read/watch/listen those. The government should file cases. I don't understand how this would be his fault.  If you again watch his comments in good faith and listen to his parliament speeches, he as said multiple times that  the public is angry, they need delivery. He said he opposed the coalition and publicly opposed it multiple times. But he is not the executive, deuba is. When there is coaliation, he has the moral responsibility to make the government successful. He was indeed in the efficiency team and he said he tried is best to make the government successful because he knew people needed delivery even though he opposed the coalition. He publicly told long before the Gen-Z protest that he couldn't get the government to do what the efficiency team was supposed to do, and he left it. So I don't think that makes him culpable for the massacre during gen-z protest.  But still he has taken moral responsibility for what happened during the protest. He has apologized multiple times for any moral culpability he has. He said he immediately asked the party leadership to break coaliation in the first day of protest and asked Lekhak to resign. Lekhak did resign but the party didn't leave coalition because again Deuba is executive and makes the decision.  He has been parliament member four times. The first time and he failed to deliver the constitution as promised which he was elected for. The second tenure was again the CA election, which delivered the constitution and you can't deny he played crucial role in making the constitution, and he (among all others) delivered the constitution. The next term he went to the parliament again and became health minister and people say he delivered some reforms in health sector (again refer to public catalogues of his works during this tenure). And you have to grant that he has been constant voice in the parliament on various issues, which the MP is sent for. This last time was a short tenure, but as everyone he has played crucial role in voicing concerns in the parliament. Ironically he strongly demanded there be independent probe in sahakari case and there have been multiple arrests and cases filed against some major fraudsters. You should grant that this was successfull. But we can always demand more. I am not his prabakta but to me seems like he could have definitely done more here and I am sure he agrees.  Yeah what about the case? Alam was a proven convict. But congress did dirty by lobbying to release him. I haven't seen him support Alam's release. Again, I am not sure the details of his release but how is Gagan culpable for the crime Alam committed?  Again I am not his prabakta. I try to speak with reason. You could certainly question that he didn't do enough at policy level as MP to propose new laws and pass them. You could ask him that he could not do enough to break Deuba stronghold. But he precisely did that recently.  Now I am watching him closely, he is now in the position to deliver at least from his party level. Make him accountable ask him tough questions. But the aforementioned questions seemed more like an attempt to make him bad (except may be how many policy changed did he make in 1 1/2 tenure as MP except CA MP which they delivered constitution).

At home, my bags were 23 + 22 kg, and my carry-on was 20 kg.  At the check-in counter, the agent told me to move some items from my carry-on into one checked bag so I’d only have to pay excess for one bag. I did exactly that and reduced my carry-on to 12 kg.  Magically, after this:  •\tChecked bags became 32 kg and 25 kg    •\tCarry-on became 13 kg  Somehow, between weighing the bags at home, weighing them again at the counter, and then re-weighing them a third time, my bags gained weight out of nowhere.  I was exhausted and didn’t have the energy to argue, so they charged me for two excess bags — $80 each. No leeway, no consideration.  To make things worse, the agent openly suggested that if I paid cash and didn’t need a receipt, they could lower the price. At that point it was obvious they were trying to pocket the money. Absolutely shameless.  I paid by card, waited until they gave me a proper Turkish Airlines receipt, and made sure everything was legit.  If you’re flying Turkish Airlines out of Tribhuvan International Airport, I strongly suggest avoiding the chubby girl working at the Turkish Airlines check-in counter. She was incompetent from the start — struggling to even open the computer system and issue a boarding pass, while agents at nearby counters were processing passengers with ease.  Extremely bad service and blatant attempts at corruption. This kind of experience is one of the many reasons I seriously hesitate to visit Nepal anymore.",

Happened to me in airport outside nepal as well.  The main difference is that airport scales are \"trade-legal\" industrial devices required by law to be regularly calibrated for high precision, whereas home scales are consumer-grade gadgets that use cheaper sensors and are almost never recalibrated. Additionally, the environment distorts the numbers; weighing a bag on a soft home carpet or trying to balance a large suitcase on a small bathroom scale often creates a \"lighter\" reading than reality, unlike the airport's large, stable platforms embedded in hard concrete. Because of this, the airport scale is generally accurate, while your home scale is just an estimate that tends to drift.|||[removed]|||Are we allowed to video record our interactions there?

There’s corruption everywhere in the airport. IMS group controls the airport, god knows how much they paid in corruption money to be able to do that and how much corruption money they get paid back in return through their control. The normal everyday workers working in bhansar get shitloads in corruption money as there are news about people smuggling things in the airport everyday, and those are the unsuccessful cases, thousands of cases we don’t even about that happens everyday. I know someone who worked in airport bhansar and had so much corruption money that their house was under custody by the CIAA and they were only a normal employee.

I know why he is liked by so many given how dysfunctional your political system as been lately, but Balen's performance during his stint wasn't that great either. Sadly, no culture of constructive criticism in Nepal.|||I am satisfied with his work because I know it’s not easy. The system itself is messed up, so obviously one person alone can’t fix everything on their own. There will be tons of hurdles, especially in the capital city of the country. Not just the capital, honestly, you can even say Kathmandu as Nepal itself, because it has become the center for everything. No matter what work you have, you somehow have to come to Kathmandu for it. So yeah, I understand his situation.  The one thing I really criticize him for is his lack of communication. That is something I am very disappointed about. During his entire campaign, he kept saying that he wouldn’t be like previous mayors and that he would stay in constant communication with the public. But after winning, he almost completely stopped connecting with people. There is no proper accountability, just one-sided Facebook status updates. This is the part where I am extremely disappointed in him and openly criticize him.  Other than that, I think he has actually shown that work can be done. He has also given inspiration to young people to enter politics.|||Done In some ways  . Even non Exciting programs .Some Jhara tareko type. Some Unfeasible .. some better options appear and done.

Being a voter of KMC i can see a lot of changes in the city after Balen came as a mayor but when i saw same changes in every big cities of Nepal. It didn’t took me long to understand that he was just overhyped.   After he joined RSP where each members are opportunistic and work in Nepal for western interests it’s clear that he is not good candidate for prime minister.  He was voted to serve as a mayor, He could have waited until next election but for him misusing people’s trust and make them go against government by burning the Nation was easiest way to experience power.

(Should I personally ask them to deduct 5% TDS?)  I also receive USD payments from an EU-based company. In that case, tax is deducted twice: first by the platform itself (approximately 3.5%), and then another 5% TDS is deducted here.

The annual limit is USD 500, but as far as I understand, this limit is only for payments/spending. Is it possible to increase this limit or ask the bank to keep incoming USD directly in that USD account instead of converting it to NPR?

Cant see both.|||if its real whatdo you do  ??? can you give some info or context|||I can see the angle of “look what you can get even from Nepal,” and yeah, that part can actually be motivating because a lot of people still assume they need to leave the country to reach certain compensation levels. But motivation usually comes from showing the path, not just the end result. A screenshot shows where you landed, not how you got there.  People here asked genuine questions about niche, stack, timeline, experience, etc because that’s the part that actually helps others move in that direction. That’s where the value would have been. Without that context, the post ends up reading more like a soft flex than mentorship. Nothing wrong with flexing, just don’t call it motivation if you’re not giving people anything they can learn from or replicate.  With 5+ years of experience you’ve seen enough of the field to know that the “how” matters more than the “what,” especially for people in Nepal who are trying to break into the global market. If the goal was to motivate, sharing the path would have done it way better than just the screenshot.|||Chyya kasto salty manche haru comments ma.

First, you’re told to learn:   HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, Python, C, C++, SQL, React, Angular, Vue, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL.      Then comes the mandatory grind:   DSA, LeetCode, CodeChef, Codeforces, System Design, OOPs, OS, DBMS, Computer Networks.      Then tools & cloud pressure:   Git, GitHub, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, GCP, CI/CD, Jenkins, Terraform.      Then frameworks & buzzwords:   Next.js, Spring Boot, Django, Microservices, REST API, GraphQL, WebSockets.

IT is no longer a “safe” career.   It’s a constant race with uncertainty.      This isn’t fear-mongering...it’s reality.

Sure, it is not realistic to overlook the economy or the job scarcity that is so prevalant now, maybe for the longest time yet but it doesn't adjucate to the premise of Software Engineering isn't feasible as a career anymore, at least to the degree people are making it out to be. AI-driven development may very well be a 'bubble', and when it pops and the dust settles, the next big thing will provoke a similar reaction. While it is evident that people with years of experience are at a loss right now, and even more so for students trying to make it in tech, undergrads or young aspirants.  I believe it was never about how greatly any technology overshadows the current technology even if it transforms areas of it by overwhelming amounts but the ability to use it to your advantage. That is how you thrive here. You embrace, and not reject. AI cannot replace engineering but it does accelerate aspects of it that if you don't keep up, you get left behind. I mean, with AI-driven development so rampant right now, startups are at an all time high. People adapt and make it work. That mindset is obligatory now more than ever. Well, I could be speaking regardless of facts that I have yet to know, but I stand firmly on my grounds of not rejecting engineering as it has never been easier than now.|||I have 4 YOE.

An industry can only take so many people before saturation, especially in face of disruption / paradigm shift as is the case now. As with any other field, you have to dedicate time and effort to be good and stay good. If you are a computer engineer worth your salt, you know it's a lot more about structured and critical thinking, problem solving skills and architecting solutions than coding in the field, and if you have the basics right, tech stack changing shouldn't scare you as much.  As with any other field, only the most committed, knowledgeable and competent people will remain in the industry and that should always be the case. The gold rush is over.|||Difficult times? Yes.  First time? No.   I really want to see what time has. Best wishes.  Best will have the best.|||Not only in Nepal.

Hamlai uni ma kaile pani research based vayera kaam garna sikayena, or maybe Malai Testo feel vayena. Tara the best way to develop skills nowadays is that you could be creating projects written on someone's research papers.   For example: Visual transformers haru ko progress sangai there have been numerous researches using ViTs in the field of Medicine, so if you want to work in the field of AI/ML kunai pani euta research linus, if they are using free dataset, use that ani replicate the process foe which you can use the same Language models to write code but it would be entirely different than all the projects your competitors have.

You will be adding more skills as you go, as your project requires it.   Yes its a challenging job but so are other jobs. If you enjoy learning/working in this field then its good for you else people can and should look for other carrier option. Do what feels natural to you.   Regarding AI, its here to stay wear we like it ir not. We don't need to me AI/ML experts we just have to learn how to use it, or embrace it, and not reject it. Its on the hype but it will die down and come back to its default.|||Jack of all with understanding of Ai tools and how to implement wins. Be the jack of all. Don’t try to master one thing. That’s what I suggest.   Decent apps can be build in a day if you know the requirements, understand system design and  logic needed. You need to understand things like how apps are build, deployed etc.  At least in US, Ai replacing engineerings is not exactly false.   With Automated workflows and Ai agents, team needing 100 members could only need couple members. That does mean Ai replaced 98 people among 100. That’s how I see.",

Cursor created it almost accurate in first attempt also while using Nextjs. I was shocked by the result, everything was perfect too, no messy code either. Just clean code.  I told it to improve the code better as well as the issues I'm seeing while in mobile view, it did the work.  Now I have the frontend ready that would take me a week, the code also looked like real person wrote it. Now I'm just adding few things in that code and using it.  I'm just shocked, free version of cursor can do this much, why even need of frontend dev in upcoming few years now?  I haven't tried using it to create functionalities yet as I ran out of free token but I'm just shocked how good it is.

Demand is decreasing, supply is too much.|||It will take my backend job too. I have no clue how to navigate further.|||Well, senior dev here !!  Sharing the experience.   I was working for one of the renowned company.. they made us use the cursor. They kept telling us to have 2x productivity. We also able to burn the tickets more that we used to do in non AI days.. cursor was able to grasp a project context and was able to finish our 5 sp task as of 1 sp task 😅😅.  we work in micro service architecture and we need to constantly give cursor the context about other services and there was also dependency with others team and well cursor cannot communicate with other team like a actual human do 😁 So the point is that if the system is complex cursor/AI won't be able to do all things on its own.   But recently I switched company. Here we are now building smaller smaller project and sending it to the mass to get subscriptions as fast as possible.. and guess what we are using lovable to build the system. Lovable + supabase + stripe = boom product.   So in this case the point is that if the system you are building is simpler and you have clean vision even people from marketing can now build the system. And believe me marketing head from my company had done that in 2 weeks.    I don't know what future holds.. but guys sakney belaa paisaa shorna sakey shorum hai 😅😅|||The thing to contemplate on is : \"The job was never to write code it was to think in that case it's only the typing long lines with a keyboard that has replaced been replaced\".

Everything was finalized with the product owner and I researched a bit in the code base what existing tested methods exist. Then boom, give cursor clear instructions. Done in 10 minutes. So then I realized what I have in hand that an inexperienced ones have - already useful skill, product knowledge and codebase knowledge. That is helping me in productivity. But the real growth and survival will happen if I gain the skills of a lead like a team lead, a manager, a product owner, or solution architect or any kind of lead is fine. And you won’t see many leads in a team. Leads are already out standing. So You have to figure out how you can be the lead.|||All|||AI will **replace a significant portion of developers**, and not in some distant future. This is already happening, and it will accelerate rapidly over the next 12–24 months as AI tools get mass-adopted inside companies.  That said, the outcome isn’t as simple as “developers are done.”  What’s actually happening is a restructuring of value.  As companies begin laying off junior and mid-level developers, they won’t eliminate development teams entirely. Instead, they’ll rely on fewer, highly reliable developers who can handle much more work with the help of AI. This creates a paradoxical situation: layoffs on one side, high demand on the other, but only for the right people.    If you come from a development background, the smartest move right now is simple:  * Become exceptional at using AI as a force multiplier. * Just knowing how to code won’t be enough anymore. That used to be the differentiator; now it’s table stakes.    **What matters now is:**  * Knowing how to think in systems * Translating vague requirements into clear specs * Using AI to generate, refactor, test, debug, and ship faster * Understanding architecture well enough to spot what AI gets wrong * Owning a specific niche deeply enough to solve high-value problems quickly    Companies won’t pay top dollar for someone who can “do everything moderately well.”  They will pay very well for someone who can fix a very specific, painful problem reliably.  And let’s be honest: saying “AI won’t replace humans” is already outdated. It has started replacing roles; not because AI is perfect, but because it’s good enough when paired with the right person.  If a non-technical person, like myself, someone who loves tech but never formally learned coding, can now build a full-fledged system using tools like ChatGPT and Replit, then the competitive bar has fundamentally shifted.  AI isn’t coming for jobs.   It’s coming for generic skill sets.    **So the choice is clear:**  * Either level up into a top-tier senior developer who designs systems, makes decisions, and leads execution * Or become a highly specialized mid-level developer with deep expertise in one niche and excellent AI leverage  Anything in between is the danger zone.  This isn’t a threat, it’s an opportunity.  But only for those who adapt early and intentionally.  Cheers!|||Lmao CRUD/landing page ta garihaalxa ni.

After +2, I applied to Canada and the USA for further studies, but my visa got rejected. Instead of wasting a year, I joined BBS , and now I’m in my 3rd year.  When the visa didn’t work out, I decided to take responsibility for my own future. I started learning about AI, automation, and new technologies. Over time, I picked up practical skills, experimented a lot, and eventually started freelancing. Right now, I work as an AI Developer on Upwork, and even in the early stage, I’m earning more than 1 lakh NPR per month.  I’m not an expert and I still have a lot to learn but I know my strengths. I’m good at managing things, people, sales, content, and marketing, and I can execute fast. I have learned most of this by consuming real-world information online and applying it through actual work.  I have big plans in the AI space, but I also know that building something great alone is very difficult. That’s why I am looking for a technical co-founder, someone strong on the engineering side so we can build, learn, and grow together.  The idea is to:  * Start very small and lean * No heavy investment * Focus on AI services / automation / agency-style work * Only basic costs like hosting or APIs * Aim to generate revenue within 2–3 months  I currently live with my parents in Butwal, but I want to move to Kathmandu, take a small flat, and fully focus on building. I also plan to start creating content alongside the business.  I’m looking for someone who:  * Is disciplined and focused * Serious about long-term growth * Not into unhealthy habits * Wants a simple lifestyle with deep work * Has strong technical skills or is deeply committed to developing them  Most importantly, I want a co-founder who understands that things won’t always work. There will be hard times, failures, and uncertainty. During those phases, we should push and motivate each other, stay consistent, and keep moving forward. Even if something fails, we should come out smarter, stronger, and more experienced than before.  We don’t need much money to start just enough for basic living expenses. I have savings that allow me to manage accommodation and food for a long time, and I strongly believe we can make this sustainable within a few months.  The goal is simple:   Live together. Build together. Learn together. Grow together.  If you’re technically strong, disciplined, and serious about building a real AI business from Nepal, let’s connect.",

This has now gotten out of hand, and this type of behavior will surely spread to other tourist areas, especially those closer to the border like Sauraha and others. I have seen these 'tourists' in Thars and other SUVs riding recklessly on our highways, mocking our rules and laws. In my local area in the Terai, there have been a couple of incidents where such SUVs have hit locals, including traffic police, and fled to India.  Let's continue to do what we can from our end - I have reported the videos and his channel, and let's keep reporting those videos wherever we find them, and from any other Indian 'YouTubers'. Influencers from Pokhara need to raise their voices collectively on other popular social media channels like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Local influencers need to unite and raise this issue from their platforms in their individual capacities. Otherwise, we might be just one incident away from breaking news.  I will share this thread with a popular Indian YouTube journalist-The Deshbhakt. I have been following him, and he has made videos on such stupidity by Indian tourists. I will leave his Instagram link here so that everyone with evidence can share information.

We talk about decentralization, Federal system, we claim to have provincial capitals, yet when it comes to real power, real identity, and real rights, we are still forced to knock on Kathmandu’s doors. Why should that be?

Minor improvements to streets and basic municipal actions are being celebrated as extraordinary achievements, while far more serious national issues are at stake.  Nepal is a country with a deep-rooted identity, culture, and values that have existed for centuries. Yet today, we seem to be losing our sense of judgment, influenced heavily by social media popularity rather than thoughtful evaluation. In the process, we are slowly drifting away from our ethics, integrity, and understanding of how we should act as citizens and how we should choose to be governed.  Governance should not be reduced to visibility and viral moments. Appreciation must be based on substance, responsibility, and long-term impact, not hype.

Even Bibek Thapaliya was hiding his affiliations, and KMAG still hides theirs. This guy just picked up that post and used it to make himself look good again.  I know how biased he is or maybe he doesn’t even realize how he got used. This is how Gagan operates. He invites these influencers, keeps them close, so they don’t post or make content against him. By doing these meetings, he slowly creates a soft corner in their mind and heart. So later, when Gagan messes up, they hesitate to criticize him because they’ve met him personally and think, “He’s a good guy.”  This is also how Gagan has managed to influence journalists across different media houses. Not all of them are in his inner circle, but he subtly shapes how they think. He invites them, talks to them, and slowly pushes the narratives he wants—who’s bad, what’s bad, and how to counter certain people.  The social media ban happened when Congress was in government, right? He won’t openly say, “Support me” or “Make things favor me,” but indirectly he keeps planting ideas like, I’m the only one who can fix this, and stuff like that.  This is a very familiar pattern with Gagan Thapa. First, influencers like these create noise online, and once it starts getting attention, he jumps in and talks about the issue as if he really cares. If he genuinely cared about social media, he could’ve spoken up against the social media ban when Congress was in power.  Even during the Gen Z protest, he subtly planted leaders like Tanuja and Rakshya Bam through his media outlet, Setopati. Their interviews were pushed again and again, filling the feed with news about what Rakshya and Tanuja were saying. Slowly, that turned into posts supporting Gagan Thapa. In the end, neutral and unaware people start feeling like, oh, Gagan is the hero we were looking for, just because these figures they follow are also backing him.  Ask him if he made any contents on Gagan Thapa?  \\-  Did he made video when Congress tried to sneak in a loophole in the cooling period? What happened to Khatiwada then after?  \\- Did he made how gagan thapa surviving without doing a single job?  \\- When Congress/UML tried to pass 5 years corruption expiry bill.  \\- Even to debunk PACT corruption where Gagan Thapa was alleged, even to debunk the allegation. (he wont, cz truth or not, many will know about this case and will have -ve perception of Gagan)  \\- Why is he surrounded and hangs out with Goons?  \\- Why WikiLeaks has Gagan Thapa as key embassy contact?  No, he won’t do that, because he’ll always have a soft corner for Gagan Thapa. That’s how Gagan Thapa works he spreads narratives through influencers like him, who knowingly or unknowingly end up producing such content.  Another example is Gagan doing small meetings on “populism” and then letting influencers create content around that topic to “spread awareness.” For influencers, it looks like he’s thinking about the nation. But from Gagan’s point of view, he knows those influencers will create content that ends up being subtly targeted at new faces.  https://preview.redd.it/x4nqjclj1veg1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=5303b0b09e8b772195bbc2a80116bd3b9f25bdb5|||RONB le tetro Balen ko chusekai chusai cha ta 3 4 barsa bata yo vanda badi jholagiri ta kai dekhechaina kunai media le koi lai gareko.

My nephew, **Liam Thapa**, is battling **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)**.  It is a rare, cruel genetic disease that causes muscles to waste away. Without intervention, boys with DMD lose the ability to walk by their early teens, and many don’t survive past their 20s.  But, there is a ray of hope: A one-time **Gene Therapy (Elevidys)** that can stop this progression. But the cost is a staggering **$2.9 Million USD**.  I am posting from a business Reddit ID to maintain total transparency and accountability.  Yes, we know $2.9M sounds impossible, but we are fighting for every cent.  * Total Goal: **$2.9 Million USD** * Cost in Nepalese Rupees: **Approx. रु 41,92,00,000 (41.92 Crore NPR)** * Raised so far: **$85909** * Remaining: **$2814091**  Liam is nearly 4. This therapy is most effective the earlier it is given. We are racing against time and biological markers that could disqualify him if we wait too long.

DMD is heartbreaking, and I genuinely hope he gets the care he needs 🙏  Just sharing information for awareness (not to diminish the importance of Elevidys): there are FDA-approved medications available for DMD today that can slow progression and improve outcomes, depending on the child’s mutation and age. These include corticosteroids (like deflazacort or vamorolone), exon-skipping therapies (for specific mutations), and non-steroidal options like givinostat, in addition to gene therapy.  Of course, treatment choice depends on genetic testing, eligibility criteria, and specialist guidance, and early intervention is critical, which I understand is why Elevidys is being pursued.  Posting this only so families reading this thread know there are multiple therapeutic pathways worth discussing with a neuromuscular specialist. Wishing Liam strength, access, and support and hoping this campaign reaches the right hands. 🤍|||.|||I am sorry, baby. He is so cute. Ma yei ausadi banaune thau ma kaam garchu.

Isn't that really obvious though?|||Thats like asking, “Was Jesus a christian?”. Jesus was born as a Jew, but later promoted his own teachings. Likewise, Karl Marx was born in some form of monarchial bureaucracy, and later promoted his own philosophy( or idea). IMO, he was a communist because his belief lead to hundreds of communist revolutions throughout.|||K k ho yo communist ani yo aru k k ho socialist jata tatai xa aaile but don't know its meaning|||Ts ain’t tuff bub…|||[deleted]|||Was Adam Smith Economist?|||https://preview.redd.it/heqwwqodiffg1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c083dc45d51b17d83926436f0ff4538f13bac12b|||Did Hitler hate Jews 🤔|||\"Is KP Oli a child killer ?\" ahh question|||tait muji reddit ma ni sab pakhe nai hune raixan. basic humour ni bujhdainan. comment section checks out|||Is Bruce wayne Superman ?|||Yeah. Communism is really stupid if you look back at humanity now.|||This should be categorised as fictional book|||some deep shit ! ... op is not asking for superficial answer|||Technically, yes, he wrote the manual. But, Marx was a man who saw a disease but prescribed a medicine that was more toxic than the sickness. He wanted to fix the world by changing who owns the \"stuff\" without changing the \"human being\" who uses the stuff.  ​When you try to enforce \"equality\" through a state, you don't get a paradise; you get a prison. This is why Marxism has failed wherever it was tried as a rigid political tool.  ​Why \"Harkabad\" is the Antidote TODAY:  ​The reason we look toward a philosophy like Harkabad (Prakriti, Samskriti, Pravidhi) instead of Marxism or Western Capitalism is because it addresses the foundation, not just the \"economics.\" Harka Smapang has time and again said it has nothing to do with his name. He is suggesting a solution that isn't a western copy but suitable to the soil we stand on.   ​Marxism says: \"Who owns the factory?\" ​Capitalism says: \"How much can the factory produce?\" ​Harkabad says: \"Do we even need the factory if it kills the river (Prakriti) and destroys the community's soul (Samskriti)?\"  If you ask me if we need \"Harkabad,\" I would say we need Consciousness.  ​Harka Sampang is essentially bringing consciousness to governance. When he goes out and carries stones with his own hands (Shramadaan), he is moving from the \"ugly\" socialism (taking from others) to the \"wonderful\" socialism (giving of oneself).  ​We don't need a \"Communist\" revolution where blood is spilled to change the law. We need a \"Harkabad\" style evolution where sweat is spilled to restore the land. ​You don't need a book from 19th-century Germany to tell you how to live. You just need to look at the earth beneath your feet and the people around you.",

The feeling of lying in the bed with inherent thoughts of disperse happiness and the want to be able to understand if that happiness is as true as it seems is not new and it's also not wholly mine   I look at all these motion picture hoping to find something. And what that might be is as ananomus to me as it is to you. I look at these things, listen as they talk, but the existence of this feeling of watching doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm lying on this virgin earth, unmolested and untouched, devoid of any feeling of any sort except for one; consciousness. The consciousness reigns supreme within and without all within the vicinity of my existence.  At this point, life as you call it feels not a moments passing by or time flowing like my thoughts.  My head feels particularly heavy, as if I'm thinking but a thought is yet to process. But how can this be? Without a thought, how can you think? How can one live, without knowing the value of death? But that's not right either. For one to know the value of death,.one must first know of its qualities, it's feature in all it's dimensions. The inherent idea of a thought being, and to think not sounds stupid as if not funny enough. But you can't overlook the idea behind such ponder.   I take very long breaths as I think. My heart beats loud enough for me to hear it. And all my bodily functions seems very much obvious to me. This isn't new but it's not wholly mine.   Ahh now my head hurts a little to. But this shall too pass.   Theres this lingering feeling of solitude that I feel very sensationally. For solitude has been my friend far longer then any. The silence that made me feel alone after some years felt not pleasing but good enough to make me feel a bit stingy if it got disturbed.  But now this solitude engulfs me, strangles me so that I choke these thoughts out of me which are yet to be. But it was this very solitude that made me form a thought but now it want it back. Like how death waits right Infront of you, lingers above you with it's hands around neck, and then takes you through the stairs of lifelessness while you climb oblivious. Similar is the solitude that I experience right now, but instead of lifelessness, I climb and climb but towards nothing, I climb and climb but climb on empty thoughts.

            "body": "This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

My dad brought quite a few for me from KTM every few months, and I used to colour, solve crosswords etc. I event sent crossword solutions (never got published). This is where I knew about sudoku and still love sudoku to this day. I have read a lot of stories in this magazine and some of them  have been life changing for me. I still refer some stories that I read there and refer them during my philosophical discussions and how they shaped me.  There was another one called सुनकेसरी too.  Few years later, through sheer luck (and a bit of reputation in my Nepali class), I got to be the guest editor of one edition of this magazine. Basically they came to our school and  collected articles/drawings/poems etc from interested students. Based on our teachers' recommendation, I got to be one of the three editors of all those articles. We basically sat together throughout a week and proofread, edited some and selected some articles and published it in one edition. And we were given the title of guest editor(अतिथि सम्पादक) for that edition, our pictures were published with school address.  And out of nowhere, a few months later, one of our teacher called me to the office and handed me an envelope. One of those classic red and blue striped envelopes. It was from somebody from the other side of Nepal. That was  my first ever  penpal (पत्रमित्र). I still absolutely vividly remember that letter, the paper, the handwriting, almost the content (almost 20 years later). The sender had found my information from the guest editor section.

I am in US, and I can say 98% of my friends don’t support his policies. There are a few who do but there’s always an exception.   Now many, including myself, do support some level of checks and restrictions on immigration. Those who didn’t get in take that as being opportunistic or slamming the door after I got in. Far from it.   What I don’t support is people coming through illegal means. What I don’t support is people cheating and providing 100% false representation while applying. Then once they get in, they try to game the system and just be a leech sucking in the benefits without contributing. They are making it harder for the legitimate immigrants and that’s exactly what we hate.  Now I don’t support the current position of not granting any immigration visa indefinitely to Nepal. But you know why this happened? Because almost 40% of Nepalis, about 70-80k take welfare benefits from the US government. You don’t need it if you are a contributing member of the society (except for in some disability/age related case).   There are people coming to US to get free medical treatment. One performer got the treatment and left the Us without paying the medical bills- that person is now banned from coming. Another famous pair got the DV and justified their entry by saying they get free medical for their kid (their case may be legit, but I am just giving an example of what people have been doing).   The administration is going to the other extreme to curb this- but some of it is because the past administration didn’t do anything to prevent it from happening.|||I seriously doubt the accuracy of this sentiment. Nepalis who have settled in America invariably work to bring other family members here. The effort is long and hard, and many are still in process, meaning that spouses, siblings, and others are now cut off from coming over. My brother in-law was able to finally secure his wife's visa a few weeks ago, after working on it for 2 years.  a few weeks later and she wouldn't get to come, so no, Nepali uncles and aunties aren't supportive, and there is no indication that most nepalis voted for trump.  The other thing to consider is the message behind the visa suspensions.  The trump administration is basically saying that immigrants who have come here have not improved conditions, but rather they have made it worse by taking advantage of government programs that they are not entitled to. In other words immigrants are lazy, and thieves. Not a lot to take pride in about that.|||Let me know what you are smoking..seems like good stuff.|||Just like the viral trend chori manchey ko khutta tanney chori manchey naai huncha.

Everyone is so nice, the food is great and there are so many interesting and beautiful places.   I was a little nervous since it was only a few weeks after the Gen Z protest, but everything seemed pretty calm.

These are my friends and neighbors, I don't ask people what their immigration status is, I could care less.

They pay taxes since it's automatically deducted from the paycheck to a social security number that doesn't belong to them. If they try to use the services they're caught and deported  We're fighting back but our leaders are ineffective, the police are working with ICE and if we call in the military we're unsure of whose side they'll take.

Not everyone who votes Republican is \"hiding the ladder since they've made it\". That claim is lazy, false, and ignores basic economic reality.  Some of us vote based on numbers, not slogans. When you are paying over $100,000 a year in taxes (household)—income tax, state tax, property tax, sales tax—and you don’t see proportional benefits in return, fiscal policy starts to matter a lot. At that level, voting conservative isn’t ideological—it’s rational. Lower taxes, limited government, and accountability in spending simply align better with that reality.  Paying six figures into the system and being told you’re “privileged,” “selfish,” or morally inferior for questioning where that money goes is not persuasive—it’s alienating. Wanting to keep more of what you earn does not make you hateful. It makes you financially literate.  Many Republican voters reject racism and extremism outright. What they do reject is runaway taxation, bloated government, and being constantly generalized or morally lectured by people whose policies they fundamentally can’t relate to. The same way not all Democrats are extremists, not all Republicans are villains.  And yes—we are also tired of being lumped together with fringe elements just because we don’t align with extreme progressive ideology. Disagreeing with activist politics, identity absolutism, or ideological purity tests does not make someone anti-human. It means they prioritize practicality over performative outrage.  People vote based on lived experience. For households paying $100k+ in taxes every year, conservative policies often make more sense. That’s not hate. That’s math.",

When you are going to protest against a bad government, practically I don’t think anyone have religion, race, color or anything of that sort in the back of their mind, the adrenaline is so high you are only focused on one thing.   During protests, when you see protesters burning down or breaking down anything, it is usually because that structure represent something significant. I know a lot of structures were burned, broken because they represented the tyranny under fascism. A significant driver behind Nepali uprising was corruption from what I understand, and I’m pretty sure this hotel was owned/majority stakeholder by some Nepali politicians, if so, then I see them burning a symbol of rampant corruption rather than a hotel.

            "body": "It’s 2026 now, and we’re still having to deal with this.  A few days ago, early in the morning, I was on the street and saw a public bus with people literally hanging from the door. It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

This problem needs to be adressed and public transportation should be well organized and planned.|||Finally, someone spoke about this. This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this. This issue really needs more attention and more noise.|||KTM has enough budget with 40 percent going unused. these transportation comes under metropolitan ko authority. ask Mayor balen.

Will you question or take responsibility for the recent GenZ killings? Your party member Ramesh Lekhak was also the Home Minister at that time—have you questioned him about this?  - You have been a Member of Parliament four times, and during your tenure, the Congress has formed the government multiple times. Can you point to any concrete, policy-level achievements you delivered during your party’s time in government?  - What about Aftab Alam case during your party's government was he rightfully being prosecuted or your party's government have him impunity from jail, what about that case?",

Deuba, as an individual, may once have been a true leader—but over time, the gang culture around him is what turned everything rotten and made him look bhrasta.  From this point onward, Gagan is free.  Free from:  All blame linked to Arzu  All accusations about money in Deuba’s house  All baggage related to Bhutani saranarthi  All the kandas, Teramox, and backroom deals  All blame connected to Lekhaks and their networks  These were never Gagan’s sins to carry.  So why should he keep answering for other people’s cults? Why should a reformist voice be held hostage by the corruption, compromises, and power games of an old guard that refuses to let go?

Don't get me wrong there are shortcomings from him and nobody is perfect but most of the questions you raised here are poor attempt to make him look bad.  You have to realize that even though Gagan is a prominient member of Nepali Congress, he was never the executive. Every decision the party makes as a whole, the chairman (Deuba) has the supreme authority and he is little to no say in any of the decisions.  Even then, he has clearly spoken against all wrongdoings. And you say \"just speak\". But that's the problem of not being in executive power, he can only speak.  You trying to  make the money burnt in Deuba's house somehow a crime by Gagan Thapa clearly tells me that you are just trying to hate. Otherwise as everyone else has said, there is a special probe commission formed to specifically study the burnt money case and all we can do is wait for their report and the government will file the case if there is wrongdoing (which we all believe there is). And Gagan has clearly affirmed this, as any sane person would. You should read him and listen his many public interviews/videos and not just assume he didn't say anything.  He has clearly said multiple times that any and all involved in sahakari kanda should be investigated including naming people from his own party by name, again multiple times in multiple of his public appearences and writings, you should read/watch/listen those. The government should file cases. I don't understand how this would be his fault.  If you again watch his comments in good faith and listen to his parliament speeches, he as said multiple times that  the public is angry, they need delivery. He said he opposed the coalition and publicly opposed it multiple times. But he is not the executive, deuba is. When there is coaliation, he has the moral responsibility to make the government successful. He was indeed in the efficiency team and he said he tried is best to make the government successful because he knew people needed delivery even though he opposed the coalition. He publicly told long before the Gen-Z protest that he couldn't get the government to do what the efficiency team was supposed to do, and he left it. So I don't think that makes him culpable for the massacre during gen-z protest.  But still he has taken moral responsibility for what happened during the protest. He has apologized multiple times for any moral culpability he has. He said he immediately asked the party leadership to break coaliation in the first day of protest and asked Lekhak to resign. Lekhak did resign but the party didn't leave coalition because again Deuba is executive and makes the decision.  He has been parliament member four times. The first time and he failed to deliver the constitution as promised which he was elected for. The second tenure was again the CA election, which delivered the constitution and you can't deny he played crucial role in making the constitution, and he (among all others) delivered the constitution. The next term he went to the parliament again and became health minister and people say he delivered some reforms in health sector (again refer to public catalogues of his works during this tenure). And you have to grant that he has been constant voice in the parliament on various issues, which the MP is sent for. This last time was a short tenure, but as everyone he has played crucial role in voicing concerns in the parliament. Ironically he strongly demanded there be independent probe in sahakari case and there have been multiple arrests and cases filed against some major fraudsters. You should grant that this was successfull. But we can always demand more. I am not his prabakta but to me seems like he could have definitely done more here and I am sure he agrees.  Yeah what about the case? Alam was a proven convict. But congress did dirty by lobbying to release him. I haven't seen him support Alam's release. Again, I am not sure the details of his release but how is Gagan culpable for the crime Alam committed?  Again I am not his prabakta. I try to speak with reason. You could certainly question that he didn't do enough at policy level as MP to propose new laws and pass them. You could ask him that he could not do enough to break Deuba stronghold. But he precisely did that recently.  Now I am watching him closely, he is now in the position to deliver at least from his party level. Make him accountable ask him tough questions. But the aforementioned questions seemed more like an attempt to make him bad (except may be how many policy changed did he make in 1 1/2 tenure as MP except CA MP which they delivered constitution).

At home, my bags were 23 + 22 kg, and my carry-on was 20 kg.  At the check-in counter, the agent told me to move some items from my carry-on into one checked bag so I’d only have to pay excess for one bag. I did exactly that and reduced my carry-on to 12 kg.  Magically, after this:  •\tChecked bags became 32 kg and 25 kg    •\tCarry-on became 13 kg  Somehow, between weighing the bags at home, weighing them again at the counter, and then re-weighing them a third time, my bags gained weight out of nowhere.  I was exhausted and didn’t have the energy to argue, so they charged me for two excess bags — $80 each. No leeway, no consideration.  To make things worse, the agent openly suggested that if I paid cash and didn’t need a receipt, they could lower the price. At that point it was obvious they were trying to pocket the money. Absolutely shameless.  I paid by card, waited until they gave me a proper Turkish Airlines receipt, and made sure everything was legit.  If you’re flying Turkish Airlines out of Tribhuvan International Airport, I strongly suggest avoiding the chubby girl working at the Turkish Airlines check-in counter. She was incompetent from the start — struggling to even open the computer system and issue a boarding pass, while agents at nearby counters were processing passengers with ease.  Extremely bad service and blatant attempts at corruption. This kind of experience is one of the many reasons I seriously hesitate to visit Nepal anymore.",

Happened to me in airport outside nepal as well.  The main difference is that airport scales are \"trade-legal\" industrial devices required by law to be regularly calibrated for high precision, whereas home scales are consumer-grade gadgets that use cheaper sensors and are almost never recalibrated. Additionally, the environment distorts the numbers; weighing a bag on a soft home carpet or trying to balance a large suitcase on a small bathroom scale often creates a \"lighter\" reading than reality, unlike the airport's large, stable platforms embedded in hard concrete. Because of this, the airport scale is generally accurate, while your home scale is just an estimate that tends to drift.|||[removed]|||Are we allowed to video record our interactions there?

Stood for political, social and economic justice throughout his life and didn't compromise for anything.    He took most of the responsibility and he did make mistakes (and he has accepted them gracefully in is biography).      You see, the problem with our generation is we read too less to judge a person and almost fail to account the then social and political scenario of the country. So, my suggestion would be you read yourself and don't judge him based on my opinion or other few incidents or stories mentioned in the comments.   Personally, He gave me the definition of democracy. Here is one story of his conversation with his nephew Naresh Koirala.   *Naresh himself had been puzzled by his uncle’s decision to accept the result. On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP. Mahendra and Birendra believed themselves to be the savior of common \"*naive\"* Nepali.    While BP simply believed that Nepali people irrespective of their education, culture, caste, religion, sex or whatsoever are capable to choose their leaders themselves and make them responsible.|||One of the greatest writers, Nepal has ever produced.|||This guy high moral values unlike present  Congress.

The artwork vividly deplicts the sacred Tuladaan ritual, in which the prince was ceremonially weighed against gold, silver, pearls, and precious stones, all of which were then offered to Goddess Taleju Bhavani, the royal deity of the Malla kings.  The painting is currently housed at the \"Collège de France\" in Paris. Despite being a pricrless masterpiece, it has never been publicly displayed and remains far from its rightful home, Nepal.

If you want mediation and your relationship to continue, have a serious discussion with your husband and let him know what the stakes are, either to work on the relationship together, or to end it. Couples therapy is also helpful for many. There's no point fighting forever. Has anyone else witness the violence, do you have kids? Does your husband drink? Does he have his own social life? Does he have any mental health issues? Many things factor. But a discussion with your husband should be your first thing to do and let him know boundaries and also reflect on yourself too.   2. If you want to end it, depends on where you are. Think through everything and then only decide. If you have kids or not. You need to contact a lawyer as well. What is your financial situation.

Also you mentioned that “maile pani farkauthe”, if he hits you don’t hit back but report it to police (unless it is life threatening) and also talk to your parents/relatives/friends about it don’t bottle up till too late.

For the love of yourself, you should leave asap.|||I just realized you said tmle pani haat haltheu, hmmm.... If you both truly want to work it out.... Now I'm thinking about it after reading your comments that you really love him....   In that case, talk to him what is bothering him, if he has had lot of childhood trauma, stress, unprocessed emotions, it really does affect a person, they become like time bomb and a small trigger can make them very angry ..... Now note that I'm saying this in hopes that you both truly want to work it out..... Talk to him, let him know anger at this level is not normal and he can gently start a talk therapy or men's circles, or somatic healing sessions, emdr therapy (if it's a part trauma), etc. there are so many options in today's time to start a healing journey. I'm in full support for people to move this route, even if you are violent in the past. It's not easy being human and I get it. Please consider, I hope this helps. But please remember, if you are going to lead this journey for both of you, remember to be patient, kind, and loving. Sometimes you will have to let the other person be so angry and be able to watch them (it's a specific emotional release session) without you absorbing their emotions. For him, and for you too probably, when emotions come, you both have to remember it's NEVER about the other person. If you would like each other to do something, you can request but nobody is obliged to follow, just having this much boundary will help you both to process your emotions on your own. Start therapy or just start writing on your own, you will notice you stress or anger is often coming from something else within yourself, not from people around you.   I hope this help a little bit. Take care, pass love to each other. If it's easier, bring serious talk when you are getting romantic, I think that helps you both absorb and understand better. Take care please. It's not impossible to change yourself and your relationships in this time, especially with so much options, start meditation, therapy, dance, especially moving body helps move your emotions too. Take care.|||Just have a conversation with your husband. Ask him why is he is acting like that? IS he insecure about you or what? make everything clear. Why is he acting in that manner? Also, clearly state what you feel about his behaviour. You both will get a chance to understand each other. Make sure he is not going to do it again or what you think will be better.

It doesn’t feel like tourism anymore it feels careless.On top of that, the local leadership has also disappointed me.

I know why he is liked by so many given how dysfunctional your political system as been lately, but Balen's performance during his stint wasn't that great either. Sadly, no culture of constructive criticism in Nepal.|||I am satisfied with his work because I know it’s not easy. The system itself is messed up, so obviously one person alone can’t fix everything on their own. There will be tons of hurdles, especially in the capital city of the country. Not just the capital, honestly, you can even say Kathmandu as Nepal itself, because it has become the center for everything. No matter what work you have, you somehow have to come to Kathmandu for it. So yeah, I understand his situation.  The one thing I really criticize him for is his lack of communication. That is something I am very disappointed about. During his entire campaign, he kept saying that he wouldn’t be like previous mayors and that he would stay in constant communication with the public. But after winning, he almost completely stopped connecting with people. There is no proper accountability, just one-sided Facebook status updates. This is the part where I am extremely disappointed in him and openly criticize him.  Other than that, I think he has actually shown that work can be done. He has also given inspiration to young people to enter politics.|||Done In some ways  . Even non Exciting programs .Some Jhara tareko type. Some Unfeasible .. some better options appear and done.

As it relies on secondary sources, it never goes deep. It stays on the surface of issues, prioritizing smooth editing over raw facts.  3. The channel’s main narrative is simple: 'The country is doomed.' This is a lazy narrative. Telling us that politicians are bad or the system is broken is stating the obvious.

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.  I (21M) and my sibling (15F) are taking care of our parents during the day and our cousins help at night. Because of this, we’ve missed months of classes but we don’t really have a choice right now.  If anyone is able to help even a small amount, it would mean a lot to us.  I’ve verified the case with two of the mods and I’ll be posting medical reports in the comments as well.  Please DM or comment if you can help in any way. Even sharing this post would really help.",

Esto kaam ekdum kam huncha hamro desh ma|||Kudos to subham vai. I remember when he talked about doing this in his free time.|||This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

Most of the teachers in school and college all of the are pedophiles.|||I'm not aware of the definition - is it like somebody who's grooming girls under 18? Are you using the term loosely?  It's an individual-thing and not a profession-thing. Girls sending DMs to get referred (when they have no skills) is also more common than you think. I get many DMs asking for free help (refactors)/ referrals (barely know them/ barely seen their code) and I just ignore them. I help many people (m/f) on a daily basis, and I've never met most of them. I know many of my 'male' senior friends (no female senior dev friends) do the same.  You should clear your exams first. Last bullet point sounds like a good plan.  Most people here will be happy to review 1-2 projects for free. I'll jump in if it's Python/ Next.js/ ML. Just post your github repo on some relevant community and they'll do free reviews.   Edit: I dont do free mentorships, happy to review repos/ coding practices.|||In my experience, Girls seem to help girl only when they are on some “female tech organization” and it’s rarely a technical mentorship. They should be helpful without such aids too. I am sorry that you had to deal with these. that’s extremely disgusting.  Still there are bunch of female led tech groups - they have ties with it company - approach them.|||I get what you r saying but the term pedo applies to people who r way older and trying to groom n trap minors (under 18).

A young girl in her early 20s reached out to me for a referall for associate engineer. I hesitated a bit seeing her technical knowledge. She offered sex plus 1 months of her salary if I referred and she got hired. Was a weird encounter. I am still not sure if she qas serious or not. But I immediately got off connection.|||Dark side is on both side ! If male posted this not a single person would have asked i have connection i can refer vanera !! Sorry you had to go through that.

I left my job after a year because of a toxic culture. I swear, I couldn't find a position (I was even applying for internships) at any tech company in Kathmandu. I thought it wouldn't be that difficult since I have decent projects and a year of experience, but I remain jobless for next three months. It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

You in your need for a job and them in their need for someone.|||Muji haru",

(Should I personally ask them to deduct 5% TDS?)  I also receive USD payments from an EU-based company. In that case, tax is deducted twice: first by the platform itself (approximately 3.5%), and then another 5% TDS is deducted here. When the funds arrive, my bank automatically converts the USD to NPR based on the prevailing exchange rate and credits it to my account in Npr.  I opened a USD account (dollar card) using my PAN. The annual limit is USD 500, but as far as I understand, this limit is only for payments/spending. Is it possible to increase this limit or ask the bank to keep incoming USD directly in that USD account instead of converting it to NPR?  Another question is that, if i’am to receive payments from a subscription based service from a platform apps i made, i basically can’t from nepal, for that i either need the LLC or C-Corp registered in US banks that accepts remote workers no ?  Up to how much extent can nepal banks provide services to be able to pay and receive payments internationally ? Or which banks ? That can win over the limitation of dollar cards ?

Cars that cost ₹7–10 L in India often cost 2–3× more in Nepal (sometimes even higher when taxes + import duties are added), and this is widely reported.  This means:  1. The same car/automobile can cost roughly 2–3 times more in Nepal because of heavy import taxes and logistics costs. 2. Almost everything (especially cars, electronics, imported goods) is more expensive in Nepal, except for some basic categories like food and rent, which are generally cheaper compared to big Indian cities.",

Cant see both.|||if its real whatdo you do  ??? can you give some info or context|||I can see the angle of “look what you can get even from Nepal,” and yeah, that part can actually be motivating because a lot of people still assume they need to leave the country to reach certain compensation levels. But motivation usually comes from showing the path, not just the end result. A screenshot shows where you landed, not how you got there.  People here asked genuine questions about niche, stack, timeline, experience, etc because that’s the part that actually helps others move in that direction. That’s where the value would have been. Without that context, the post ends up reading more like a soft flex than mentorship. Nothing wrong with flexing, just don’t call it motivation if you’re not giving people anything they can learn from or replicate.  With 5+ years of experience you’ve seen enough of the field to know that the “how” matters more than the “what,” especially for people in Nepal who are trying to break into the global market.

Essentially doing a drill over and over until you're fairly confident to take on almost any curve ball interview question.  Whilst you wouldn't be asked to invert a binary tree on your interview, it'd help you understand in a broader sense how to break down a problem and solve it.  Not to mention NPath, Cyclomatic, Coupling, and time complexity. These are things you need to absolutely nail down when working with anything beyond a basic crud app, which can be vibe coded easily these days.  So how'd that set you apart? Well, essentially, it'd enable you to be a quick thinker.

When you know exactly what to do it's pretty easy to write the code for it.

Shitty code, more bugs and more opportunities for IT devs. Not every company can afford AI that is going to cost fortune in long run. Mid-level devs would collapse, there would be junior then senior. Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||[deleted]|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||Skill issue.

Don't get me wrong - vibe coding and low code/no code methods are getting popular with some LLM coders (Claude, Gemini) becoming absolute beasts, but, the real need of a human is in problem solving and building scalable systems. My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.  The problem is people jumping on the bandwagon which is creating a terrible environment for business owners, recruiters and stakeholders.  I hope you do well in your career my friend.

Sure, it is not realistic to overlook the economy or the job scarcity that is so prevalant now, maybe for the longest time yet but it doesn't adjucate to the premise of Software Engineering isn't feasible as a career anymore, at least to the degree people are making it out to be. AI-driven development may very well be a 'bubble', and when it pops and the dust settles, the next big thing will provoke a similar reaction. While it is evident that people with years of experience are at a loss right now, and even more so for students trying to make it in tech, undergrads or young aspirants.  I believe it was never about how greatly any technology overshadows the current technology even if it transforms areas of it by overwhelming amounts but the ability to use it to your advantage. That is how you thrive here. You embrace, and not reject. AI cannot replace engineering but it does accelerate aspects of it that if you don't keep up, you get left behind. I mean, with AI-driven development so rampant right now, startups are at an all time high. People adapt and make it work. That mindset is obligatory now more than ever.

We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

If I have the time, I might join if I'm free. If they were inviting Harvard professors, it'd cost you 10x more to attend. Events take time and effort. Many costs. Let's switch the focus to you. Have you organized an event? Was it easy? Who did you invite as a speaker?   If you're a student, why care about an enterprise AI event? I fail to see your criticisms. Not everybody needs to start a business to prove their credibility. It literally takes <20k.  I don't expect them to cover hf peft best practices. It's an event for enterprises. I don't have expectations for food. If I meet somebody interesting, that's good enough for me.  I think you're being confused between training courses and networking events. Plenty of events if you want to learn. ANAIS, NAAMII charged 12k for students this year. Was fine. Good stuff. Made many friends.  I dislike AI non-profits that claim to do research and fail to have any publications or research projects, yet say they're open to collaborations. But the AI association isn't a research body, probably does just events. Executives don't open up VS code and grind all day. That's a very small minority. They're skilled, just not in a way that appeals to you. They bring in investors, organize events, lots of things. If you ask me, there's a lot more to a product than PRs and merges. If you're not already the Lead for some MNC, some humility helps. It's dumb to say a CEO doesn't have skills because they don't code like you do, don't you think?  I'm not affiliated with naamii or any non-profits.|||On one hand, I can see the low effort poster with multiple mistakes and the fluffy pointless nonsense that is the main paragraph probably written by ChatGPT with a 6 word prompt. There's no mention of the \"Experts\" that are supposed to lead the thing.  On the other hand, your post has offered no genuine criticism of the event. It is just as pointless as the poster. Maybe offer anecdotes? Some tangible verifiable reason to justify your \"nrs 350 for 2.5 hours is a massive waste\".  Organizing an event comes with some cost, and some of that must be passed to the visitor. NRS 350 is some money, it is definitely not a lot of money. It is most definitely not \"expensive\" for an event in any sense of the word.   Justify your claims. Why is this a \"scam\"? What other way can a person \"use nrs 350 to learn by yourself\" (your words)? Who are the speakers and why are they unqualified to speak on this program?  *disclaimer: not affilaited to this org or event*, *just a random angry redditor*",

I was working for one of the renowned company.. they made us use the cursor. They kept telling us to have 2x productivity.

Here we are now building smaller smaller project and sending it to the mass to get subscriptions as fast as possible.. and guess what we are using lovable to build the system.

And you won’t see many leads in a team. Leads are already out standing. So You have to figure out how you can be the lead.|||All|||AI will **replace a significant portion of developers**, and not in some distant future. This is already happening, and it will accelerate rapidly over the next 12–24 months as AI tools get mass-adopted inside companies.  That said, the outcome isn’t as simple as “developers are done.”  What’s actually happening is a restructuring of value.  As companies begin laying off junior and mid-level developers, they won’t eliminate development teams entirely. Instead, they’ll rely on fewer, highly reliable developers who can handle much more work with the help of AI. This creates a paradoxical situation: layoffs on one side, high demand on the other, but only for the right people.    If you come from a development background, the smartest move right now is simple:  * Become exceptional at using AI as a force multiplier. * Just knowing how to code won’t be enough anymore. That used to be the differentiator; now it’s table stakes.    **What matters now is:**  * Knowing how to think in systems * Translating vague requirements into clear specs * Using AI to generate, refactor, test, debug, and ship faster * Understanding architecture well enough to spot what AI gets wrong * Owning a specific niche deeply enough to solve high-value problems quickly    Companies won’t pay top dollar for someone who can “do everything moderately well.”  They will pay very well for someone who can fix a very specific, painful problem reliably.  And let’s be honest: saying “AI won’t replace humans” is already outdated. It has started replacing roles; not because AI is perfect, but because it’s good enough when paired with the right person.  If a non-technical person, like myself, someone who loves tech but never formally learned coding, can now build a full-fledged system using tools like ChatGPT and Replit, then the competitive bar has fundamentally shifted.  AI isn’t coming for jobs.   It’s coming for generic skill sets.    **So the choice is clear:**  * Either level up into a top-tier senior developer who designs systems, makes decisions, and leads execution * Or become a highly specialized mid-level developer with deep expertise in one niche and excellent AI leverage  Anything in between is the danger zone.  This isn’t a threat, it’s an opportunity.  But only for those who adapt early and intentionally.  Cheers!|||Lmao CRUD/landing page ta garihaalxa ni.

            "body": "Hi, I’m a 20-year-old student and freelancer who genuinely wants to build something meaningful in life.  After +2, I applied to Canada and the USA for further studies, but my visa got rejected. Instead of wasting a year, I joined BBS , and now I’m in my 3rd year.  When the visa didn’t work out, I decided to take responsibility for my own future. I started learning about AI, automation, and new technologies. Over time, I picked up practical skills, experimented a lot, and eventually started freelancing. Right now, I work as an AI Developer on Upwork, and even in the early stage, I’m earning more than 1 lakh NPR per month.  I’m not an expert and I still have a lot to learn but I know my strengths. I’m good at managing things, people, sales, content, and marketing, and I can execute fast. I have learned most of this by consuming real-world information online and applying it through actual work.  I have big plans in the AI space, but I also know that building something great alone is very difficult. That’s why I am looking for a technical co-founder, someone strong on the engineering side so we can build, learn, and grow together.  The idea is to:  * Start very small and lean * No heavy investment * Focus on AI services / automation / agency-style work * Only basic costs like hosting or APIs * Aim to generate revenue within 2–3 months  I currently live with my parents in Butwal, but I want to move to Kathmandu, take a small flat, and fully focus on building. I also plan to start creating content alongside the business.  I’m looking for someone who:  * Is disciplined and focused * Serious about long-term growth * Not into unhealthy habits * Wants a simple lifestyle with deep work * Has strong technical skills or is deeply committed to developing them  Most importantly, I want a co-founder who understands that things won’t always work. There will be hard times, failures, and uncertainty. During those phases, we should push and motivate each other, stay consistent, and keep moving forward. Even if something fails, we should come out smarter, stronger, and more experienced than before.  We don’t need much money to start just enough for basic living expenses. I have savings that allow me to manage accommodation and food for a long time, and I strongly believe we can make this sustainable within a few months.  The goal is simple:   Live together. Build together. Learn together. Grow together.  If you’re technically strong, disciplined, and serious about building a real AI business from Nepal, let’s connect.",

This has now gotten out of hand, and this type of behavior will surely spread to other tourist areas, especially those closer to the border like Sauraha and others. I have seen these 'tourists' in Thars and other SUVs riding recklessly on our highways, mocking our rules and laws. In my local area in the Terai, there have been a couple of incidents where such SUVs have hit locals, including traffic police, and fled to India.

Influencers from Pokhara need to raise their voices collectively on other popular social media channels like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Local influencers need to unite and raise this issue from their platforms in their individual capacities. Otherwise, we might be just one incident away from breaking news.  I will share this thread with a popular Indian YouTube journalist-The Deshbhakt. I have been following him, and he has made videos on such stupidity by Indian tourists.

Minor improvements to streets and basic municipal actions are being celebrated as extraordinary achievements, while far more serious national issues are at stake.  Nepal is a country with a deep-rooted identity, culture, and values that have existed for centuries. Yet today, we seem to be losing our sense of judgment, influenced heavily by social media popularity rather than thoughtful evaluation. In the process, we are slowly drifting away from our ethics, integrity, and understanding of how we should act as citizens and how we should choose to be governed.  Governance should not be reduced to visibility and viral moments. Appreciation must be based on substance, responsibility, and long-term impact, not hype.

Even Bibek Thapaliya was hiding his affiliations, and KMAG still hides theirs. This guy just picked up that post and used it to make himself look good again.  I know how biased he is or maybe he doesn’t even realize how he got used. This is how Gagan operates. He invites these influencers, keeps them close, so they don’t post or make content against him. By doing these meetings, he slowly creates a soft corner in their mind and heart. So later, when Gagan messes up, they hesitate to criticize him because they’ve met him personally and think, “He’s a good guy.”  This is also how Gagan has managed to influence journalists across different media houses. Not all of them are in his inner circle, but he subtly shapes how they think. He invites them, talks to them, and slowly pushes the narratives he wants—who’s bad, what’s bad, and how to counter certain people.  The social media ban happened when Congress was in government, right? He won’t openly say, “Support me” or “Make things favor me,” but indirectly he keeps planting ideas like, I’m the only one who can fix this, and stuff like that.  This is a very familiar pattern with Gagan Thapa. First, influencers like these create noise online, and once it starts getting attention, he jumps in and talks about the issue as if he really cares. If he genuinely cared about social media, he could’ve spoken up against the social media ban when Congress was in power.  Even during the Gen Z protest, he subtly planted leaders like Tanuja and Rakshya Bam through his media outlet, Setopati. Their interviews were pushed again and again, filling the feed with news about what Rakshya and Tanuja were saying. Slowly, that turned into posts supporting Gagan Thapa. In the end, neutral and unaware people start feeling like, oh, Gagan is the hero we were looking for, just because these figures they follow are also backing him.  Ask him if he made any contents on Gagan Thapa?  \\-  Did he made video when Congress tried to sneak in a loophole in the cooling period? What happened to Khatiwada then after?  \\- Did he made how gagan thapa surviving without doing a single job?  \\- When Congress/UML tried to pass 5 years corruption expiry bill.  \\- Even to debunk PACT corruption where Gagan Thapa was alleged, even to debunk the allegation. (he wont, cz truth or not, many will know about this case and will have -ve perception of Gagan)  \\- Why is he surrounded and hangs out with Goons?  \\- Why WikiLeaks has Gagan Thapa as key embassy contact?  No, he won’t do that, because he’ll always have a soft corner for Gagan Thapa. That’s how Gagan Thapa works he spreads narratives through influencers like him, who knowingly or unknowingly end up producing such content.  Another example is Gagan doing small meetings on “populism” and then letting influencers create content around that topic to “spread awareness.” For influencers, it looks like he’s thinking about the nation. But from Gagan’s point of view, he knows those influencers will create content that ends up being subtly targeted at new faces.  https://preview.redd.it/x4nqjclj1veg1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=5303b0b09e8b772195bbc2a80116bd3b9f25bdb5|||RONB le tetro Balen ko chusekai chusai cha ta 3 4 barsa bata yo vanda badi jholagiri ta kai dekhechaina kunai media le koi lai gareko.

And everyone knows it is because of high vote share madesh have, and they want to capitalize it. Even beside Balen today every other RSP leader mostly focused on the state matter of Madesh rather than the whole of Nepal, so it is evident that they want to capture proportional candidate vote as much as they can.

She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

Without intervention, boys with DMD lose the ability to walk by their early teens, and many don’t survive past their 20s.  But, there is a ray of hope: A one-time **Gene Therapy (Elevidys)** that can stop this progression. But the cost is a staggering **$2.9 Million USD**.  I am posting from a business Reddit ID to maintain total transparency and accountability.  Yes, we know $2.9M sounds impossible, but we are fighting for every cent.  * Total Goal: **$2.9 Million USD** * Cost in Nepalese Rupees: **Approx. रु 41,92,00,000 (41.92 Crore NPR)** * Raised so far: **$85909** * Remaining: **$2814091**  Liam is nearly 4. This therapy is most effective the earlier it is given. We are racing against time and biological markers that could disqualify him if we wait too long.

DMD is heartbreaking, and I genuinely hope he gets the care he needs 🙏  Just sharing information for awareness (not to diminish the importance of Elevidys): there are FDA-approved medications available for DMD today that can slow progression and improve outcomes, depending on the child’s mutation and age. These include corticosteroids (like deflazacort or vamorolone), exon-skipping therapies (for specific mutations), and non-steroidal options like givinostat, in addition to gene therapy.  Of course, treatment choice depends on genetic testing, eligibility criteria, and specialist guidance, and early intervention is critical, which I understand is why Elevidys is being pursued.  Posting this only so families reading this thread know there are multiple therapeutic pathways worth discussing with a neuromuscular specialist. Wishing Liam strength, access, and support and hoping this campaign reaches the right hands. 🤍|||.|||I am sorry, baby. He is so cute. Ma yei ausadi banaune thau ma kaam garchu.

Communism is really stupid if you look back at humanity now.|||This should be categorised as fictional book|||some deep shit ! ... op is not asking for superficial answer|||Technically, yes, he wrote the manual. But, Marx was a man who saw a disease but prescribed a medicine that was more toxic than the sickness. He wanted to fix the world by changing who owns the \"stuff\" without changing the \"human being\" who uses the stuff.  ​When you try to enforce \"equality\" through a state, you don't get a paradise; you get a prison. This is why Marxism has failed wherever it was tried as a rigid political tool.  ​Why \"Harkabad\" is the Antidote TODAY:  ​The reason we look toward a philosophy like Harkabad (Prakriti, Samskriti, Pravidhi) instead of Marxism or Western Capitalism is because it addresses the foundation, not just the \"economics.\" Harka Smapang has time and again said it has nothing to do with his name. He is suggesting a solution that isn't a western copy but suitable to the soil we stand on.   ​Marxism says: \"Who owns the factory?\" ​Capitalism says: \"How much can the factory produce?\" ​Harkabad says: \"Do we even need the factory if it kills the river (Prakriti) and destroys the community's soul (Samskriti)?\"  If you ask me if we need \"Harkabad,\" I would say we need Consciousness.  ​Harka Sampang is essentially bringing consciousness to governance. When he goes out and carries stones with his own hands (Shramadaan), he is moving from the \"ugly\" socialism (taking from others) to the \"wonderful\" socialism (giving of oneself).  ​We don't need a \"Communist\" revolution where blood is spilled to change the law. We need a \"Harkabad\" style evolution where sweat is spilled to restore the land. ​You don't need a book from 19th-century Germany to tell you how to live. You just need to look at the earth beneath your feet and the people around you.",

The feeling of my heart having faster and my stomach twisting like an eel holding it's prey is not new to me but still it's not wholly mine.   The feeling of lying in the bed with inherent thoughts of disperse happiness and the want to be able to understand if that happiness is as true as it seems is not new and it's also not wholly mine   I look at all these motion picture hoping to find something. And what that might be is as ananomus to me as it is to you. I look at these things, listen as they talk, but the existence of this feeling of watching doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm lying on this virgin earth, unmolested and untouched, devoid of any feeling of any sort except for one; consciousness. The consciousness reigns supreme within and without all within the vicinity of my existence.  At this point, life as you call it feels not a moments passing by or time flowing like my thoughts.  My head feels particularly heavy, as if I'm thinking but a thought is yet to process. But how can this be? Without a thought, how can you think? How can one live, without knowing the value of death? But that's not right either. For one to know the value of death,.one must first know of its qualities, it's feature in all it's dimensions. The inherent idea of a thought being, and to think not sounds stupid as if not funny enough. But you can't overlook the idea behind such ponder.   I take very long breaths as I think. My heart beats loud enough for me to hear it. And all my bodily functions seems very much obvious to me. This isn't new but it's not wholly mine.   Ahh now my head hurts a little to. But this shall too pass.   Theres this lingering feeling of solitude that I feel very sensationally. For solitude has been my friend far longer then any. The silence that made me feel alone after some years felt not pleasing but good enough to make me feel a bit stingy if it got disturbed.  But now this solitude engulfs me, strangles me so that I choke these thoughts out of me which are yet to be. But it was this very solitude that made me form a thought but now it want it back. Like how death waits right Infront of you, lingers above you with it's hands around neck, and then takes you through the stairs of lifelessness while you climb oblivious. Similar is the solitude that I experience right now, but instead of lifelessness, I climb and climb but towards nothing, I climb and climb but climb on empty thoughts.   My agitated muscles ache in the silence of my breath while my breath gets shorter and heavier each micro instant.",

The goal wasn’t to teach a full curriculum in an afternoon; it was to show these kids that technology isn't out of reach.  As a student-led initiative, we don't have a big corporate engine behind us. We’re just a group of peers showing up and leading where we can. This reel captures some of the curiosity we saw that day—it’s a small start, but a meaningful one.
