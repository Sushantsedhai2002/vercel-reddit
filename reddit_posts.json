Hope everything turn out to be how you want.|||I would just divorce|||where do you live OP?|||Have an open conversation with your husband. If there is any kind of abuse involved next time, you need to stand up for yourself. Strictly tell him if he does the same again, you are going to report him to the police. Get support from the help available around you.|||This is an escalating behaviour. He has no regards for consequences. Next time he might do something even more severe. And at that moment, His response would be something along the lines of the heat of the moment.  You do not deserve to be treated this way, no matter what the reason maybe.    I would suggest to take drastic measures given out by some concerned redditors. Distance yourself from him either by involving & going to your parents home and discussing the plan moving forward or if that is not possible to the authorities.   Your safety is of utmost priority。|||You justify, you cave in, and he gets more bold, draws the line little further. He will not change for you.    When you say abroad I guess in place where it's common to separate. So just do that. Get away.

Not the man you need to have in your life.Please please report  before its too late|||Keep evidences of his violence towards you (like photos of any bruise wounds he might’ve inflicted in your body), contact someone close to you and make them a third party witness to your situation.|||He is projecting. He is cheating on you|||most probably, he is cheating. better check him instead|||If not for you divorce him for your kids. Even if you don't have them now it will be harder when kid is involved.    If you keep this going your kid will someday blame you too, if not entirely. Because for a kid when they come to world first environment they grow up will be normality and every time your husband gets mad at you, for the kid it will be your fault. That day you will look back and think where you went wrong.   The more you wait the more it gets worse.|||Once a beater, always a beater. File a case didi. Let him rot in a bidesh ko jail.

Why this post: Wanna escape of off current role.   Could you share more details: Yeah, Why not? My current role mostly involves aggressively punching the keyboard with minimal brain engagement. The pay isn’t great either: CTC is around 50k per month. I’m in my late twenties and would really like my life to level up both financially and intellectually. In my spare time (a.k.a. when I question my life choices), I’ve learned advanced Excel, worked on a few projects at my job, and even received an award. Right now, I’m learning DAX for Power Query.  I want to move into an analytics role where I can actually use both my finance background and technical skills, instead of just exercising my fingers. What are some rewarding career paths that make sense for someone like me: both in terms of brain usage and income? I’ve considered moving to another department within the bank, like treasury, but that door seems half-closed and crowded with very qualified elbows. My interests keep bouncing between data analytics, financial risk management, actuarial work, by giving the relevant exams, and related fields.  I’m looking for genuine, realistic guidance that’s relevant to Nepal.

            "heading": "Nepal politics - what do we need to understand? Part 2",
            "body": "Previously, I wrote a post in this group outlining my views on politics. It seems many readers did not fully grasp my position, and some responded with personal attacks. However, given recent shifts in global geopolitics (US attack on Venezuela, India buying more gold, China keeping quiet) and the fact that much of the Nepalese media does not address what I consider to be the core issues, I think it is necessary to clarify the arguments I raised earlier and connect them to recent political developments in Nepal.  I will begin with the Western education model. My argument is not against education itself. It is against how the Western education system, and its underlying assumptions, are imported and treated as universally correct. In the previous post, this distinction was misunderstood. To explain this properly, let's dive into democracy. Democracy is a system of government in which power is exercised by the population, usually through elected representatives. The problem is that democracy is taught and consumed as an inherently good system (see news and school books). Like any system of governance, democracy has flaws. These flaws are rarely discussed openly. At the same time, the failures of other systems are emphasized through narratives. As a result, people are educated to criticize alternatives while remaining largely unaware of the weaknesses within democracy itself.  This mindset is visible in Nepal’s political discourse. There is a growing tendency to frame politics as a moral binary: old parties are entirely wrong, and new parties or new faces are entirely right. This framing is simplistic and analytically weak. Political systems do not function on moral purity. They function on power, incentives, and institutional constraints.  This brings me to corruption and meritocracy. Phrases like “the right person in the right place” are vague and often used to mislead. They assume that governance is primarily a technical problem, when in reality it is a political one. In practice, power is sustained through trust networks, not abstract merit. The second-in-command is chosen based on loyalty and reliability, not only competence. Without this, no organization, whether a family, a firm, or a state, can function. There is no moral judgment here. This is how systems operate.  The same logic applies to corruption. Corruption is often discussed as an anomaly, but it is better understood as a behavioural feature of human systems. States do not survive despite corruption. Many survive because of it. The most corrupt countries in the world are not Nepal or India. Countries like Nepal, India, and China have endured for centuries precisely because people did not fully depend on the state and instead relied on personal networks, informal arrangements, and self-interest. This is what is labelled as corruption. When historically dominant states decline, it is often because governments become rigidly capitalist while populations become dependent and socialist in behavior. Nepal has survived because people remain economically self-reliant and do not expect the state to provide everything. As the current fiat monetary system weakens, this reality will become clearer, so I will not elaborate further here.  Regarding figures like Balen and Oli, I am not commenting on personal traits, only on public roles. Both have contributed to Nepal in different ways. Oli, given his long tenure, has had a broader impact. Balen, like Oli, has overpromised and underdelivered. This is not an endorsement of one over the other. Politics is not about moral correctness. It is a competitive game governed by rules. Those rules can be changed, but only by those who understand the system well enough to win within it. If one side loses, the rational response is to comply, reassess, and prepare for the next round.  Finally, I believe we have been taught incorrectly at a foundational level. Many of our political and social assumptions, inherited through western education frameworks, do not align with human behavior. Competition, not idealism, is the fundamental driver of human systems. Any attempt at reform that ignores this will fail. To change a system, one must first understand it fully. By system, I mean it more than elections. Asia’s population dominance over Europe is not accidental. Asian societies adapted to systems rather than idealizing them. That adaptability, not moral superiority, explains survival and scale (both time and number).     I want you all to consider development in light of this. What does the definition of development mean without the framework of western education system/definition? And how would you like Nepal to develop?",

Share the resources (ofc not paid resources anything free or valuable), someone who enjoys learning and sharing milestones, enjoys doing some projects together.   Thanks for reading up-until here. 🙌",

            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

These types of sellers are taking advantage of lack of easy payment access/ability for their advantage and making ridiculous profits. There is no ethical way they can give legitimate copies for the price they are let alone 200+ $40-60 games for Rs. 1500. I don't know about PS and Xbox but for Steam they are using Steam's family sharing option to share the game bought in one account to 5 or so other accounts, then give the login credentials to the buyer of a game, you download and run the game once(in case of denuvo to get a ticket) and then you have to use steam on offline mode to play the game. You are forced to use someone else's account on offline mode and won't be able to go online or change to your own account because its family share, and one game can only be played in one instance so 2 or more people can't play it at the same time hence forced offline.   With denuvo secured games like Black Myth: Wukong, it only grants 5 tickets every 24 hrs so if 5 tickets have been passed, you have to wait 1 day to launch the game before going offline, and the best part is, any sort of system modification or OS update removes the ticket(speaking from personal experience). So its a hassle regardless and these predators gain benefit. I calculated(yes really) 67k profit within 2 weeks from just one game from the story \"reviews\" of one these types of accounts.  BTW the thing with Steam family share, pretty sure what they are doing is against Steam ToS so its not any better than piracy.|||https://preview.redd.it/nsvk2blsomcg1.jpeg?width=259&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f84db831d40e4c99a68e05cf17345abfe3753a72|||You can pirate those games. I'll tell you cons and pros of buying a shared account.  Pros: - You can easily install and play games in the library.  Cons: - You never know when the account will no longer work - Cannot play online or any multiplayer (it's fully offline) - Account is shared with many people - Denuvo games might still not work properly (for eg: Denuvo let's you authenticate around 7 or 10, i forgot exact mumber. So let's say other user had already opened a game with denuvo like Black Myth Wukong then you'll have to wait for it to be 24 hours to validate Denuvo again also need to goto online and authenticate denuvo every week)  So except for easy access and install of games, it's the same as pirating.|||Saw this page and gamedeals np page selling arc raiders for like 700 smth felt sketchy so i didnt even try buying   Let me know if its real if u decide to buy from them|||Bought one with single game for rs 200/250.

Kharcha garne development program lyauna panu sakna paryo ta,|||I do agree that budget is not distributed with equity in mind and neither is the budget equal for everywhere. I agree we need to allocate budget more proportionally. However, I do have to disagree with what bro was going on about \"having this big budget means they'll just work on surface and make fool of the public\" tangent.   I do not know about Jhapa but being from Chitwan 3, meaning being from Renu's own area, this felt like a personal take on her rather than a mayor. I agree how she got elected (मतपत्र च्यातेर) was pure power play from Maobadi in last election because congress was with them (cause Vice Mayor, Chitra Sen Adhikari of NCP is also from Chitwan 3).  Coming to the expenditure, Bharatpur has highest rate in Nepal with ~77% (?) and Bharatpur's budget is justified cause of the population with its 29 wards & ~350,000 population which is steadily increasing. And I'm not defending her as a politician, I'm defending her & team's work as Mayor. We've had road expansion (which is only focus of everyone weirdly for publicity & criticism idk why), *khanepani* is now available in all of Bharatpur metro, also irrigation has been upgraded, the expo center is under construction still but was used as make shift hospital during covid with like 50-60 beds (cant remember exactly), also public schools have been getting a makeover with new buildings and infra etc.   I agree there are still a lot of problems like despite having 6 lane highway, if a truck hits wrong turn on Pulchowk, its absolute grid lock from Gaindakot to Chaubiskoti, from Kshetrapur to Pokhara Buspark, no traffic lights (coming up soon tho), no proper parking, waste management is happening but not happening properly enough etc. but that doesn't mean the work isn't being done. We do have to acknowledge that work is being done even tho its not flashy and won't make a good headline for it.  So TL;DR Bharatpur has changed a lot in last 8 years & I understand why Chitwan (even tho its just Chitwan 3 that too just for Renu's work as Mayor and not Maobadi party) is considered a stronghold for Maobadi. As a voter here, in this election Chitwan 1 & 2 will be Ghanti and 3 will be Renu imo.|||omg they are voting politicians because they allocated budget and did something.|||But people like deuba win by keeping people uneducated. 😆|||81/82 ma who was in power?

Nepali people are developing antibiotic resistance and no one gives a shit about it.  I myself have been a chronic patient of tonsillitis and common cold from childhood. Don't know how much unneeded antibiotics I've taken.   After knowing about the harmful side effects of it, I've completely restricted myself taking antibiotics unless I'm sure I'm having a severe bacterial infection.   People please don't take antibiotics given by random clinics or pharmacists. These mfs just give you antibiotics randomly without a proper checkup.

            "body": "Lately, I’ve been noticing something that feels like a bitter truth. Many youth-focused media platforms (like RONB) and several popular influencers and YouTubers seem increasingly biased toward figures like Ravi Lamichhane, Balen Shah, and the RSP.  This makes me wonder: what’s really different between the old parties and the new ones? In the past, traditional parties had strong control over mainstream media. Now, it feels like a similar influence is being exercised through social media, influencers, and youth driven platforms. The medium has changed, but the power dynamics don’t seem very different. Personally, I don’t think the RSP has a clear long-term vision or a concrete roadmap to lead the country. Their politics often appear driven by majority sentiment rather than consistent principles or well-defined policies. I wouldn’t be surprised if the party shifts its stance or even compromises its core values when public opinion turns against it. That brings me to the most important question: who is holding them accountable? Without strong internal checks, institutional discipline, and truly independent critical media, any political force old or new risks repeating the same mistakes it once promised to fix.  Curious to hear what others think. Am I overthinking this, or are you seeing the same pattern?",

Ronb is the Fox News of nepal.|||Media & social media bias has always been part of the game & it always will. In US, you have Fox & now CBS who are pro trump while CNN & NBC are more pro democratic. UK has The Sun & Telegraph, China has CCTV.  In India, we all know mainstream media is all effectively strangled by pro BJP/ Modi that they're named Godi media.  In Nepal, its no different. We all know Kantipur is congress mouthpiece, Avnews used to be Maobadi etc etc.  Social media just amplifies that. And also, social media allows everyone to voice their voices forming an incredibly opinionated groups. Then, the algorithm slowly encircle you within a echo chamber. And it starts to skew your vision. Then suddenly if you question anything within that echo chamber, be it a valid question or rage bait, both get equally seared. And it provides the voices to be heard from safety of their own bedroom, the more polarising voices rise, the populist idea of what is right gets propped.  I unfollowed RONB the day Balen got elected cause I knew what RONB were doing. For my own sake, if I developed the habit of second guessing every \"news\" from all these online channels and it does pay off and also it feels almost illegal & sad to see what long game they're playing and how people are lapping it up without question. And no, I don't dare question them cause I don't want others to go through my profile and react \"haha\" on \"समवेदना पत्र\" of my grandma just cause our political ideology doesn't match.

Shady past in U.S. (Active court cases) 2 Sahakari Case ( there are people - common people that are affected by his misadventure at the end of day) 3. Radio Jockey and TV personality - focused more on criticizing other than coming up with solution 4. Ambuguity ( what laws he will act upon that will help speed up Nepal growth rate - heard none yet) 5. Questionable moral integrity( employee suicide case, personal life, escaping jail) 6. Reactive - will quickly switch to whatever becomes flavor of the year Pros: Populist (democracy at the end of day works on populism) , charismatic 3. Reactive - (will listen more to mass, for ex he might have unbanned social media immediately if he was in that position)  4. Might create a good momentum against laggard old politicians even though he is only out in bail VS kulman -> 1. No active court cases in Nepal or outside Nepal ( pretty sure he has earned tons of enemies - rich enemies, atleast they haven’t unearthed anything substantial yet 2. Engineer ( Nepal needs more engineer in gov) with an MBA 3. Has clear ideas about Nepal strength and weaknesses - green economy, Forest laws, labor laws 4. Good leader (however you look at it, he gave new life to moribund institution) - led an institution with more employees than KMC 5. Experience - splendid work on chilime project - watershed moment for hydro dev in Nepal from profit sharing to organization growth) Cons - 1 straight talker ( probably not a strength in nepali politics) 2. Egoistical ( could have dealt hitendra situation better ) 3. Average Public speaker ( pretty sure this is most important for any politician, he is not good at it)  These are my personal observations which could be biased and could be wrong but still I think we need a technocrat to run this country not a sweet talker. We will find fault even if we get Gautam Buddha today, but still I hope whoever comes top do good for our nation.|||Ghante Thag ko support garne bhayera|||Propaganda to divide nation and people , need raaaja asaap , every political party are puesonof any type of foreign power , let's go for blind raaaja aau desh bachaau|||Due to formal Ravi's cooperative, citizenship issues ???|||Cause he is not baun or chhetri, this sub makes you hate anyone who is not baun or chhetri|||Didn't knew he was so power hungry. 😬|||Kulman for PM|||Ahh, I wasn't wrong.

Then one day, that day a person brought a big tire and left it in that ground and my brother and his friends started playing with that tire.  They all could carry it up and all tried but then when that skinny guy's turn came he said no and avoided even trying to carry. Lol he would injure himself if I did so as tire looked heavier than him.  Then at the evening when it was dark, I was seeing from the window and I see someone going to the ground. I can 100% tell it was that skinny friend of my brother. He went there and looked at the tire for few seconds and tried to lift it up.  I was laughing so much when I saw that he couldn't even move properly let alone pick it up.  He tried, he couldn't, he tried again very hard but still the tire only just moved a little, he tried hardest and he felled to the ground. Then he just quit and left the ground.  I was laughing so hard thinking that, lol poor guy tried to test if he could pick it up but was embarassed to fail infront of friends.  Next morning I wake up, I couldn't think anything else but just about him. The more I think about that moment, I smile but I have this small feeling in heart (good feeling) when I remembered him. It grew more and more and I started looking at him a lot when he was in the ground.  Looking at him, made me happy and reduce my stress so much. I am totally in love with him now.  When he come to our home, I go downstair to mainly see him closley and ask everyone if they want tea or not. I ask each of them so I can talk to him.  I am scared, he's very introverted and he wouldn't come to our home after knowing his friends sister is in love with him.  It all started because, he was weak I guess cause everything happened after that tire incident.  Edit: WTF guys, I'm not a ped0! He is 19 year old, just 2 years younger than me. They play football in that ground and the ground is their meeting place too so they are frequently there, yes and a group of 19-21 year old guys saw tire on the ground and started having contest of who can pick that up.  Why you people acting like cause they did that, they may be just teen, I've seen men doing much goofier things in their adult than their teens, 10 times more childish thing than that.",

            "body": "Invasion is when you destroy the culture of people, destroy the practices and don't integrate. War is not an invasion, the aftermath of what happens is an invasion. Look at Pakxtan's father of nation level figure Mahmood of Ghazni, he looted the temples, he imposed his culture to the entire population(or at least tried), he sold the women from lahore and sindh and karachi to central asia as slave/commodity.  Another example is Cholas and Chalukyas, they were fierce enemies. Cholas used to destroy the temples of Chalukyas and bring the diety of the temple to their homeland.  Another example is Babur, the turko-mongol king who invaded modern day afghanistan lost his homeland to a persian king and tried to rebuild the army to get his homeland but failed. overtime his empire stretched to much of the northern region of india but even then he chose to keep his graveyard in the afghanistan region precisely because it was nearer to his homeland. Babur was also the one who ordered to destroy the temples, the temples that withstood for thousands of years famous one is the rama mandir.  Attacking somebody and defeating their army is not invasion. What British did in America, Africa, and India is invasion.  Another example is Kushans, they were from the central asia are said to be descendants of scythians they invaded us, yes but later they integrated and stayed in this land, they adopteed our culture promoted it, they were the reason central asia was once a buddhist majority, they promoted buddhism which was foreign to them.  Prithvi Narayana Shah didn't do an invasion, he was from the same cultural sphere as those of his contemporaries. After he invaded(as per you) Malla kingdoms of Kathmandu where stands, he went on to integrate he was a shavite there was no need to worship the centuries old Malla kul devta taleju bhawani but he worshipped her as well, and even imposed dashain on the rest of the kingdom as a sign of integration to the shakta traditions. Yes he imposed the khas arya language but he also tried to integrate.   The Turko-Mongol kings Mughals are invaders, the british were invaders, the french, the spanish(they infact changed the demography and culture of phillipines and mexico to a complete christian majority like in phillipines you had about 30-40% hindu population before the spaians and portugese conquest they essentially did how iranian regime controls the people, a complete demographic change was done there).  By these metrics, I have come to the conclusion that PNS was not an invader, he was a king who wanted to expand his kingdom.",

It traces its roots to the powerful Khasa-Malla Kingdom (also called the Khas Empire), which flourished from roughly the 11th to 14th centuries in what is now western Nepal and parts of Uttarakhand. This medieval kingdom, ruled by Khas kings , was a significant trans-Himalayan power at its peak under rulers like Prithvi Malla (around 1413 AD), stretching from regions like Guge and Purang in the north to Dullu and beyond in the south.  After the Khasa-Malla Kingdom fragmented in the late 14th century (following the death of later rulers like Abhaya Malla), it splintered into dozens of smaller principalities. These included the Baise Rajya (22 kingdoms in the Karnali-Bheri region) and Chaubise Rajya (24 kingdoms in the Gandaki basin). These were not random new states....they were the direct remnants and successor entities of the old Khasa-Malla realm, governed by local Khas, Magar, Thakuri, and other dynasties tied to the same historical, linguistic (Khas language evolving into modern Nepali), and cultural lineage.  Prithvi Narayan Shah did not invent Nepal out of thin air. He launched a deliberate campaign in the mid-18th century to reunite and revive the fractured remnants of this older Khasa heritage under a single, strong banner. Starting from the small Gorkha principality (itself part of the broader Khas-Shahi tradition), he systematically brought the Baise and Chaubise states, the Malla kingdoms of the Kathmandu Valley, and eastern principalities together. This was unification, not mere conquest from nowhere.  Those who label PN Shah's actions as \"invasion,\" \"colonialism,\" or \"Gorkha imperialism\" are either historically illiterate or pushing a selective, divisive narrative. Calling it colonialism is particularly absurd....colonialism involves distant foreign powers exploiting and subjugating locals for external empires (think British in India). PN Shah was a native hill ruler reuniting indigenous Himalayan principalities that shared deep ethnic, linguistic, and historical ties. His campaign was an internal consolidation of related territories, not foreign domination.  Yes, wars are brutal, and PN Shah employed ruthless tactics when needed (e.g., sieges, blockades, and harsh measures against resistance). But context matters: the 18th century was a brutal era of constant warfare among petty states, with the British East India Company aggressively expanding just south of the hills. Without unification, these fragmented Baise-Chaubise and Malla states would have been easy pickings for colonial powers, likely swallowed up like the rest of the subcontinent. PN Shah himself recognized this threat.....he explicitly aimed to create a strong, independent \"asali Hindustan\" (true Hindustan) as a buffer against foreign invaders.  Critics who romanticize the pre-unification era as some idyllic collection of independent states ignore reality: those tiny rajyas were constantly at war, economically weak, and politically unstable. Without PN Shah's and Bahadur Shah's vision, strategic brilliance, diplomacy, and military genius, there would be no modern Nepal today...just a patchwork of forgotten principalities, probably absorbed into British India or later India/China spheres.  His intentions? We can debate personal ambition (every great leader has some), but the end result is undeniable: a sovereign, multi-ethnic nation that preserved Himalayan identity, language (Nepali), and independence against overwhelming odds. Nepal exists as an independent country because of him.....not in spite of him.  To the modern revisionists, ethnic separatists, or those cherry-picking \"colonization\" buzzwords to undermine national unity: read actual history before rewriting it. Dismissing PN Shah doesn't empower marginalized groups....it weakens the very foundation that allowed Nepal to survive as a distinct nation for over 250 years. Nepal wasn't \"invented\" in 1768...it was reclaimed and saved.|||In the name of unification many ordinary people lost their lives and later their families generation got oppressed by royal elites that's why monarchy failed later in nepal.   I respect PN Shah a lot for giving the existence of this nation but not his generations|||Prithivi Narayan Shah definitely did the invasion and unified all those small kingdoms into a bigger, more powerful Gurkha Kingdom.  That’s how things worked like 300 years ago. No point in crying about it now. If he didn’t do that, Nepal might not even exist today.   I see Kirat people moaning about PNS and how Khas-Arya cultures, language were forcefully imposed on them. There’s some truth to that but that’s what happens when a larger kingdom occupies a smaller one. This is worldwide phenomenon since forever.  And his famous saying was “Nepal is a common garden of 4 castes and 36 ethnicities”. So he definitely acknowledged different cultures and didn’t try to erase their uniqueness. Kirat activists need to chill down a bit and respect PNS’s contributions in nation building.|||I know that most people from one community only call King Prithvi Narayan Shah an invader or a murderer.||| What he did was unification, also pritivi Narayan Shah lea  present Day whole Nepal lai unification garnu vayako hai na. he only unified nuwakot, makwanpur and Kathmandu valley. paratap Shah , Rajendra laxmi , Bahadur Shah haru ko Pala ma baru dherai unification vayako thiyo.

A lot of the Kathmandu valley's culture and language was lost.|||No Prithvi Narayan Shah no modern day Nepal. The Nepal that exists today is because of Prithvi Narayan Shah. Before that there was 22/24 different smaller kingdoms and only the Kathmandu Valley was refered as Nepal.   If not for Prithvi Narayan Shah then the British would have annexed all the different 22/24 different smaller kingdoms. After the British when India gained independence all the different 22/24 states and modern day Nepal would be a part of India.   The modern day Terai belt would be a part of UP and Bihar states of India. The hilly and the Himalayan regions of Sudurpashim province would have joined the Himachal Pradesh of India. The remaining areas would have joined Darjeeling and a separate state with Darjeeling and the remaining parts would have been created in India.   Modern Day Nepal exists because of Prithvi Narayan Shah, Bahadur Shah, King Mahendra and King Birendra.|||Pns bhanda ta prachanda le more likely Nepal Lai unify gareko ho.|||malai sirf ek byekti ko kura garnu mann lagdaina, kina bhane tyo actually matter nai gardaina. tei vayera pura shah dynasty ko kura rakhye   1. shah dynasty oppressed other's cultures.

There is a free program called Flavortown run by Hack Club in collaboration with GitHub for high school students ages 13–18. Students build and ship open source projects on GitHub and earn points for the time they spend.  Those points can be exchanged for real prizes like a MacBook Air, iPad Air, Quest 3, Nothing headphones, and more. It is not a competition and there is no cost to join.  Seems like a good way to encourage younger students to actually build projects instead of just following tutorials. Worth sharing with younger siblings or any high schoolers interested in coding.

After long hours of searching through junlges and residental areas, we finally found the friend on the highway while he was walking his way to ktm from butwal. he was running away from us. The thing is, something inside his brain snapped. maybe life happened. we wanted to take him to sudhar kendra.  After finally catching him up, i tried to have a normal convo with him. there were only two of us who found and caught him at that time. we were waiting for others to come. my another friend went out to bring water for him. Suddenly, he leveraged the situation to run away from me. I got injured in my head and hand  Then i tried chasing him. The only thing in my mind was, dude it took so long and effort to finally find him. He was attempting to harm himself at times. So, we couldn't let him get away.

As I grew older I started to accept that it is completely okay and even necessary to do the things I enjoy and love and just hang out with the people I like, and that I don't have to try so hard to fit in. Only by pursuing what I myself wanted to do (and not getting involved in things I didn't really) did I start feeling like my authentic self, who I had kept suppressed inside me. It helped that I'm abroad now and also seeing a therapist occasionally to talk through such trauma.  Push yourself to do the things you want and don't judge yourself so harshly.

That is a natural progression to what you’re feeling. You did not grow in a social environment, of course it won’t feel natural to socialise.   On one hand you will begin to improve in socialising if you keep doing it and also realise that socialising is a two way street. On the other hand, what you learned in your childhood will stick with you for a long time. You will always be hyperaware of your surroundings. Specially the people.   Don’t forget to realise a few facts every once a while. This is the loneliest generation there’s ever been. Everybody is afraid to make the first move. We didn’t deserve to be burdened with the pile of shit they received from someone else but such is life. Let’s get on with it.

I don't ask anything and I don't even dare to become angry with my elders ..even though I feel resentment. 😭|||I felt this man, the relatives visiting and mom getting moody is so real. I had the exact same environment and I'm just starting to see how it's so deeply rooted in me now in my early twenties. I can't voice my feelings out or express what I want without feeling like my throat is tied with barbed wires bro.  Everytime I try and speak my emotions or feelings, even basic ones that don't seem like much to other people, I start getting tears in my eyes and I automatically shut down. Can't get a word of my opinion out. Don't even get me started on fights, misunderstandings and disagreements. They feel like hell to me even though I know it's nothing big.  It might feel like there's nothing you can do about it but trust me, it will go away even if it takes a lot of sacrificing your comfort zones. Don't cancel plans when your friends ask to hangout, start letting them in your heart, relationships require sacrifices too, you gotta do things that you don't really wanna do and instead just sit in your room alone. Get out of this loop, go for a short hangout with people that you feel comfortable with, start investing in friendships and I'm sure it's gonna start feeling better.  There's times where I feel like I'd be better off alone in this world, I don't need people at all, and that friends are just intervening my life. That happens so often. You don't need to push these feelings away, let it come but then let it go. Humans do need people after all. So please get out and make changes, even if you have to fake it. It will get you going.  Also the most important part, let your parents be disappointed, as controversial as this may sound, that's the only way you can brace your heart and start doing what you want. Parents do get worried and that's valid but as a saying goes \"ships are safe in the harbor but ships are made to sail\", yes you are comfortable and safe and away from your parents nagging in that room, but how long will you let that keep you lonely?|||You have my sympathy.|||It's same for rebel too.....I'm very rebellious but the amount of energy u drain is crazy.......so to restore it I stay back at home most of the time..........|||Rebelling is the key  I just entered adulthood, and I rebel a lot and eventually they'll give up (hopefully)|||Just believe in ‘teleology’ instead of ‘aetiology’.

The few times I hung out with Nepalis I realized they're basically living in Nepal with Nepali mentality while abroad. Many had moved abroad and lived there for decades but were still unaware of many Western customs-they just didn't assimilate into the culture. I could see how much they missed out on. I just didn't want to be in that situation. So, you're right, because as many others have mentioned, immigrants don't get out of their comfort zone, they miss out on a lot.

For most young people: -   Most Nepali come here to work on a student visa, not for study. They enroll in a cheap college which is mostly populated with Nepali or foreigners from south asian countries.   Then, they need to find work, since they can’t work more than 20 hours legally, they need to find work in cash, so they need to network with Nepali people who work in cash to bypass the work hour requirements.   Then, they need to find a cheap place to stay. Probably 2-4 people crammed in a single room sleeping in bunk beds. Guess who is willing to do that ? Other Nepali or south asians.   For married couples :  They don’t live in crammed rooms but navigating lives and work pressures help them better relate with eachother than foreigners of that land.  ——————————  It is not a nepali trait or south asian trait. It is a socio-economic trait.   Nepali students who actually can afford their tuition without working illegally having a partner just to make ends meet live a completely different life.   They have the luxury to go out after college to socialize, visit new places with friends, participate in clubs and events. Become members of universities bodies, a representative or host in Universities, and many other involvement where they make connections with people of all backgrounds. They explore leadership opportunities and develop their social skills.  All this while most Nepali students don’t have enough time to sleep cus they have to earn, pay for tuition and send money back home. God bless them, they are so tough. I could have never been able to do that.   ———————  I was lucky enough not to worry about money and my tuition. So i had a lot of free time. There was a point where I knew almost everyone in my Uni ( literally speaking ) and i used to host weekly events in uni. I have got friends from all over the globe. I knew just 2 nepali people from my uni, just 2 ( one was a girl i dated, if i wasn’t dating her, I don’t think we would have spent any time together ). I tried to find more but i never bumped into nepali people in any in places i found myself in.   Not a single Nepali person besides me, in my entire college degree, across all courses. Not a single Nepali person in any events I attended. I was the only Nepali in the first two jobs i did.   Unless i went to nepali events, i was not around Nepali people. I go to Nepali events just to meet Nepali people so i can make more Nepali friends because almost none of my friends are Nepali.   ———————  So yeah, there are some language and cultural barriers but these are insignificant. I think the socioeconomic barrier is the biggest reason why Nepali people stick together. Although for some people the cultural barriers might hold more weight|||Most People are naturally attracted to people  similar to them|||It really depends on Where you're located and type of Community you in.

I have a handful of non-Nepali friends whom I truly value and enjoy. It’s not that I don’t want Nepali friends but I simply don’t have many Nepali people around me that are my age to regularly hang out with (Nepali population that I have seen around me are either they are college students way too younger or way too older with kids).

I came to US and started working directly!  So I have worked in 2 firms so far, I haven’t met any Nepali.   I also feel that if you move abroad for education, you’re more likely to meet many Nepali friends.

Did we really cross ethnic lines in Nepal or did we stay comfortably within our own circles? Did a Pahadi genuinely sit, eat, celebrate, and struggle alongside a Madhesi and vice versa? How many close friends did we truly have from so called lower castes not just as acquaintances but as people we regularly hung out with, defended, and learned from? How many of us who ask this question actually learned Maithili, Bhojpuri, Newari, Tamang, Gurung, or Tharu by choice and not because we had to?  If we did not assimilate in a country as diverse as Nepal, why do we expect people to suddenly become global citizens the moment they cross a border?  Isn’t it human nature to seek familiarity when everything else language, culture, food, accent is unfamiliar? When someone is already navigating visas, racism, homesickness, and identity struggles, is it really surprising that they hold on to the one space where they do not have to explain themselves?  And when Nepalis abroad spend time with other Nepalis, is it exclusion or survival? Is posting vlogs and photos with familiar faces a rejection of the world or simply documenting comfort? Do we ask the same questions about Italians Chinese or Mexicans abroad or do we reserve this criticism only for Nepalis?  Maybe the real question is not why they do not explore but why we romanticize exploration abroad while ignoring the lack of it at home.  If we could not fully embrace diversity in Nepal a country with dozens of languages countless cultures and everyday diversity, what makes us think a plane ticket alone changes that?|||1) Just because you want to hang out with them doesn’t necessarily mean they also wanna do the same. Lot of White colored people do want to hangout with other white people only. Lot of white people only want to date white people. It doesn’t have to be racism and could just be of choice. Whats happening in the US today isn’t happening because of 1 person disliking non white population, there are many as such. So yea, for 1 they also do not like to hangout with non white people so thats kinda why Nepali are seen hanging out with their own.  2) Its also not very easy to hangout with different cultures. The reason nepali people gets along with Indians is due to commonality between our culture the way we are brought up. That just makes it easy to communicate and of course functions and religion bring us together. Sometimes our upbringing makes it so difficult to hangout with white culture. Something Thats very basic or normal to us might be offending to them.   These are some basic reasons why nepali are seen hanging out with other nepali or just desi community. Even our struggles are similar, so it’s out of convenience and commonalities.|||Why do Nepali people abroad only eat Nepali food?? There are so many better options|||I avoid Nepalis like the plague",

I’m particularly interested in:  ​The Newar script: It’s such a powerful cultural statement to see it in a public, political space.  ​The Urdu/Tibetan choice: These feel like very specific demographic \"nods.\" Is this happening more frequently in certain districts?  ​I’d love to hear from anyone who lives in these areas or knows more about the political strategy behind this. Is this a new trend for the upcoming 2026 elections, or have I just been blind to it until now?",

            "body": "After spending the last three years moving between digital marketing, software projects, and teaching, I thought I was building the “right” life. Good income, modern work, flexibility on paper but something felt missing.   So during breaks and holidays, I started asking myself a serious question:  What kind of work actually leads to a happy life?  I began researching different sectors and talking to people. Eventually, I kept coming back to agriculture.  I started visiting farms and speaking with farmers. I asked almost every one of them a simple question: \"Are you happy with your life?”  Almost all of them said yes  without hesitation.  And that surprised me.  These weren’t people living in luxury. Some of them had loans. Some worked long hours. Some didn’t own fancy things. But they had something that felt rare:  * They controlled their time * They worked with their hands and the land * They lived close to their families * They saw the direct result of their effort every day  Meanwhile, I noticed something else. In places like the USA and Australia, many people spend 30 years paying off homes and farmland. On paper, they are “successful.” But many of them barely see their families, live under stress, and don’t feel free.  So what actually makes someone happy?  It doesn’t seem to be money, or job title, or how modern your work is. It seems to be perception, freedom, purpose, and family.  Farmers may not be rich in the way society defines it but many of them are rich in time, peace, and connection. And those are things money can’t easily buy.  This made me rethink everything I was chasing.  Maybe happiness isn’t about climbing higher.   Maybe it’s about standing somewhere that feels right.  I ask everyone what happiness define you ?",

Will he be happy when his children blame him for not being able to give them good schooling and a stable income source?   Your analysis of happiness is valid if the farmer earns well enough for basic needs+emergencies. Even if we forget other luxuries.

Case 2: Deuba and old parties are instructed to hold on to power by India and China.  Why?- Lets look in Europe. Lookup Victoria Nuland: she is high level US diplomat (probably retired now)believed to be the mastermind behind election of Zelensky in Ukraine and probably pushing for the war (there are leaked audio clips too probably available in internet.).  A coincidence that she happened to have visited Nepal and Bangladesh in 2023.   A coincidence that most of the emerging Gen-Z leaders happen to have ties to US and Europe supported leadership programs. For instance Rakshya Bam was part of it back in 2021-22 or something like that. Let us not forget that that Late King Birendra was killed in one of the most secured places in Nepal. Something about police shooting young people all of sudden doesn’t make sense at all.   A coincidence that she is closely linked with Gagan Thapa who coincidently happens to have the biggest voice for MCC and has close ties with US embassy. Could be a ploy to weaken existing parties to bring RSP to power. With RSP in power you get a government and youngsters who grew up hating neighbours (india and china-probably china not as much)which can now be easily manipulated and controlled.  Why again? India and China are aligning with Russia and in process of formation of alliance to stand up against US. Lookup BRICS. Not to forget their rise and rising dominance in global trade while US is sinking in debt.  Nepal, bangladesh, pakistan are going to be nerves which US and Europe would like to press every now and then to pressure India and China.   Could it be that Nepal is just a battleground for war being fought somewhere else? Very likely.   I would not be surprised if Nepal turns into a battleground in next 5-10 years, where madesh, free Tibet and gorkhaland issues start to resurface.  Interesting and dark times could be ahead. Probably not the best times to godify western taught youth leaders to align and take command of Nepal. Tada ko deuta vanda najik ko bhoot thik. Probably need organic nepali politicians to lead. Best case scenario for Nepal could be the return of king or have pro-china or pro-india gov. Gagan is probably not the best person. Possibly why Deuba could be backed by India and KP and PKD by china.  Chances are there are bigger things at play. See what happens.",

I see a lot of foreigners in my area and shop nowadays so it might be the best option for now.  I wouldn’t recommend gems or United universal type of schools cause although they are great for Nepali people, students can’t get away with saying “my dog ate my homework” like my friends could in ullens 🥲|||Good private schools are quite expensive in Kathmandu but you have to invest in education especially at a critical young age when they are forming their identity. The ‘best’ ones are British and Lincoln but I would say Rato Bangla also lives up to par. Back in the days schools like St Xavier’s, St Mary’s and Budhanilkatha used to be considered good and cheap schools with reputation but I don’t think that’s the case anymore.|||Don’t have anything to add about schools but kudos to you and your wife for moving to take care of her parents.

If in lalitpur, st.xavier or rato bangla is your best bet.|||kaasthamandap is a safe option|||Hiya, Ive seen some concerns abt St. Xavier's and as a student who studied there from 1 to 12 in both the Jawalakhel and Maitighar campus i can assure you that religion or pushing christianity down your throat is like the least concerning part of the school. Most teachers aren't christians, similarly with the students. Its non existent. The most christian part of the school is that they can provide catechism classes to some Christian students if they want it and they have mass or smthing (i was never went/had to go).   I'm an atheist and grew up in a Buddhist family so i can say that much. Other than that, the school is pretty good, not as modern as other schools since the fee is def at the lower end of the spectrum for good schools. The school campus is nice but the classrooms are meh at best. They have pretty nice clubs and has the whole traditional english house system like in hogwarts with a head girl/boy situation. The A levels dept in maitighar defo got the most funding. Also the +2 dept in maitighar is def one of if not the best in ktm. Like people prep for the entrance exams to study there but personally it's more the students that are good. Also your child needs to pass an entrance exam to even get into grade 1 actually, i forgot abt that.|||I come from a diplomat family so we move places often. My little brother went to Kathmandu World School and he loved it. Other decent options include Ideal Model School (Jhamsikel), St. Xavier's, and Malpi.|||Thats not much budget..

            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!  (TL;DR: This app is exclusive to KU students, but we are posting here because we want the community's technical feedback on our architecture and stack.)",

            "body": "I completed a Bachelor of Software Engineering at Pokhara University, which I thought was similar to or equivalent to Computer Engineering. However, I've recently realized that this isn't the case in Nepali government institutions. I recently tried to apply for a Technical Lieutenant (Computer Engineer) position in the Nepali Army, but they told me I needed a TU equivalence for it. This left me confused. Aren’t all universities in Nepal considered similar?  I did get the equivalence, but it says it’s equivalent to a “relevant subject,” and the Army told me it’s not enough to proceed with the application. They essentially said that unless I have a certificate specifically stating that my course is equivalent to Computer Engineering, there’s no point in continuing. (They suggested I should show up for the bearing and physical tests, but couldn’t confirm whether I’d even get the opportunity. So, I decided to drop out of that path.)  Now, after seeing the NEA vacancy announcement, I noticed they also specifically require a Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering. Are there any Government Institutions in Nepal that would recognize my degree as eligible for such positions?",

            "body": "Hi everyone,  I just passed the AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C03) exam on my first attempt! As a final-year CSIT student, I didn't have a corporate budget, so I had to be strategic with free and low-cost resources.  I see a lot of people asking if 1 month is enough. It is, but I studied **6 hours a day** strictly. Here is exactly how I did it.  **The Timeline (30 Days)**  * **Days 1-12:** Watched the FreeCodeCamp AWS course (Andrew Brown) on YouTube. I didn't just watch; I took notes on *everything*. * **Days 13-20:** Deep dive into **Tutorials Dojo Cheatsheets**. This was a lifesaver for confusing topics like VPC peering vs. Transit Gateway. * **Days 21-29:** The Grind. I used **ExamPrepper** and went through **1,019 practice questions**. * **Day 30:** Rest & Light review.  **The Resources:**  1. **FreeCodeCamp (YouTube):** Best free resource to understand the basics. 2. **Tutorials Dojo (Cheatsheets):** Mandatory for understanding the small differences between services. 3. **ExamPrepper:** I did 1,000+ questions. This helped me build speed and learn to spot \"distractor\" answers.  **Exam Experience:** The questions were wordy. Managing time was harder than I thought. Because I practiced so many questions beforehand, I could quickly identify keywords (e.g., \"highly available\" vs \"cost-optimized\").  Happy to answer any questions about the exam or my schedule!",

She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

            "body": "I've been tempted to write this for a long time.       I was in a relationship with a popular male influencer for a long time. We broke up 2 years ago. During our 3+ year-long relationship, I got to be in his inner circle and hung out with Sisan and gang (and Shrinkhala too, before she went to Harvard). We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective. Just like Shrinkhala shamelessly posted those yellow highlighted Excel Sheets as her proof of innocence which had no third party audit or any verification.|||I have never watched Sisan Baniya, but I didn't feel that he ever portrayed himself as self made or coming from a humble background. He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Yeah, Sisan isn't 'dudh ka dhula' as he shows himself to be, he might be even worse.

Before he was viral. Even mod a subreddit for his work. And I do understand separating between the art and the artists. This all sounds very true and feels consistent with his person out of his art (videos)  It’s funny to see Sisan’s Simp Boys here, not even ready to listen to a different perspective. And they give such an Incel vibe, hating up on a woman.  I really hope they are all kids who will grow out of this someday and realize how lame they were.  Sisan 500% milked his breakup while Shrinkhala and was so out of character for the graceful guy character he tries to build up in vlogs.|||The day when he was targeting his ex.

Always good guy, never saying anything is ever bad. No negative reviews, ever. That is not a normal human behaviour. People are allowed to dislike things. Tesaile I knew his vlogs were heavily scripted or edited to discount the bad parts, meaning not the real thing.|||Never liked Sisan. All the hype building around him. Never watched his Vlog.

I think i know who you are. I also worked and hung out with and around Sisan Shrinkhala a lot. So after the breakup, the way he acted like a kicked dog and gained public sympathy from incels licking on his balls and slut shaming Shrinkhala was so insane. And the way he spoke up about the Miss Nepal funds k k when the hate for her was at an all time high. Personally I have no sympathy or love for Shrinkhala so I am not saying this to defend her.   But everyone who has been around Sisan knows how opportunistic he is. Dhunga faalera haat lukaune khaalko manche ho. And everyone talks about it too in our circle.|||Well, the tea was fantastic.

What an absolute joke. Absolute witch hunting behaviour. She was cool until she was relateable to most women but once you marry rich thats the end of it for women. Take away every thing that she has ever achieved and yeah jump on the hate train wagon.Most people who know sisan personally know that he is absolute shit head. Absolute narc. I know some of them and they all say that he didnt pay half of his saff well. Always made them work extra hours with out paying them well. And those who know them up and close know that the rumour about shrinkhala putting an extra effort on the relationship is true. I have even heard that Shrinkhala was ready to marry him but he kind of side lined and said he is not ready or something. He was always a snob dont know what took people so long to recognise. When he was in relationship with shrinkhala he would always put thumbnail of her in every video he posted to cash in the view and any body can tell he did the same thing after they broke up, used  every opportunity to capitalise her name, when we all know she was quite for the longest time.

I used to watch his vlog in 2019 and haven't been following him for a long time. The way he portrays himself, his Paradygm TV nonsense, I never liked that. And the way he helped to intensify hate and misinformation about Shrinkhala during that difficult time for her, shows the true character of the person.  It was (still is) unpopular to support Shrinkhala and criticize Sisan but we should never hesitate to tell the truth. Plus anybody whose father owns a house in Kathmandu is never struggling. I don't ever believe that nonsense.|||Sharing your personal experience is fine. But why are you referring to his ex as 'Buddhist girl'?

The circumstances favored him because she then went on to date the business family heir shortly after.

So so very capable of taking advantage of another person or situation for personal gains.

He seems the most capable guy among all the fkin leaders, including balen and rabi. When he speaks , he always seems calm even when he is provoked, unlike balen. He does not have an ongoing corruption case like that of rabi. He is an engineer who studied at the most prestigious university of our country and also studied at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. he went as a Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar to study water science, policy, and management. This is different from most engineering degrees  because he isn't just an engineer who can build a hydropower or dam. He has knowledge of policies and understands the economics and geopolitics of water—Nepal's most valuable resource. Has worked in developing countries in Africa. Seems like he has some political knowledge. Also, rabi and balen were celebrity figures, but he wasn't and dared to challenge one of the biggest political figures in a less urban or even rural city(dadeldhura). In a time where every nepalese wants to leave the country, a guy from oxford who could have easily left the country, not only staying but wants change in his country, shows bravery and patriotism. He hasn't been in power, so we can't gauge him, but we can gauge him based on what we have seen so far - a calm, educated, brave and exceptionally brilliant young guy, and i would definitely prefer him over any politican i have witnessed so far.|||\"Oxford padheko bhandai ma should be a leader\"  Can see the mindset of OP here.

Renu has made a name for herself in Bharatpur but this will be an election for parliament and not mayor. Last election chitwan had a rabi effect where people in other constituencies voted for him because he was contesting from chitwan and his influence was so immense even the constituency in the neighbouring district were effected. Nawalpur which was considered a stronghold of NC nearly lost to RSP in 2079. Also, chitwan - 3 was won by RPP and previously by prachanda. Even though renu had influence in the constituency, they did not risk prachanda. After what happened in sept 23/24, i don't think people are going to vote for individual and would rather vote for a party other than the big 3. Expect to see rabi campaigning aggressively in chitwan -3 than chitwan - 2|||from being chitwan 3 I see it very unlikely Renu would lose this election. Despite she being Prachanda's daughter, she has made a name for herself as a mayor here. If Rabi was going against her, then this would've been a tight competition imo. Yes, ghanti gang do be making noise in chitwan but deep down we all know Renu has brought visible and tangible change on the ground level. I do not support the way she won her last election (a can of worms there) but I do have to acknowledge the work she has done.|||Renu will not lose in Chitwan immovable object|||Media trial, if she runs from chitwan -3, rsp is sacrificing such a gem.

She has done wonders for bharatpur people|||Bikram Pandey laughing from Chitwan 3|||Haha balen lai Mayor re party ko upa sabhapti bhnnera kina nabhneko hol|||RSP can sweep chitwan 3. First, rsp has a good base there. Second, Renu has done some works, but more manipulation of media people and influencers to brand her as developmentalist. She has been surrounded by few controversies. One example: dumping of waste in narayani river. Third, prachanda ran away from chitwan-3 last election thinking ravi will contest from chitwan-3. Ravi´s craze is even more now with balen and kulman joining rsp. A strong rsp candidate can be victorious. Fourth, there is a decline in craze of uml and congress among under 35 people of chitwan. I myself interacted with few people from different wards of bharatpur and madi and barring few, all said they won`t vote for big 3 and bikram pandey and are looking for new political force.  P.S.- Personally, I do not think shobita will contest from chitwan -3 against renu. Her businessman husband is super close with prachanda and even shobita has become close with prachanda due to family matters. Plus she won kathmandu-2 last time just because of ravi craze at that moment. Not even 500 people from kathmandu-2 heard about her before. She is indeed a good orator and law student. i have known her since AYON days when she lost a election in ayon. Besides good oration in parliament, she has literally not done anything for kathmandu -2. ( You can ask any voter of kathmandu 2, like tinkune, sinamangal area, pepsocola what she has done for kathmandu-2 ) I hope rsp will bring some local candidate from chitwan with clean image. If rsp brings shobita, she will definitely cut vote of other candidates and any unpredictable result can come. She can grab good votes, but not enough to win the election.   - And i m not Rsp member or fan, just a curious youth following nepali politics 😀|||Balen mulla KP oli ko against ma uthne bhanera ufrirathiyo ta",

One evening, during a casual conversation, my friend shared that over time he noticed the person trying to become emotionally closer to him. He said that although he initially had no such intentions, she later expressed a desire for a secret relationship, emphasising that it was not about emotions or commitment.|||Xya kasto disgusting..man ta man vayi halyo (not excuse but ghero se kya umeed) Tara afnei buini testi??

A man has needs. Intimacy and Respect.  Good on him for finding someone better when he didn’t get what he want from his partner. It’s good to leave people who don’t talk to you for 1-2 months after a spat and can’t find it within themselves to apologize.",

Shady past in U.S. (Active court cases) 2 Sahakari Case ( there are people - common people that are affected by his misadventure at the end of day) 3. Radio Jockey and TV personality - focused more on criticizing other than coming up with solution 4. Ambuguity ( what laws he will act upon that will help speed up Nepal growth rate - heard none yet) 5. Questionable moral integrity( employee suicide case, personal life, escaping jail) 6. Reactive - will quickly switch to whatever becomes flavor of the year Pros: Populist (democracy at the end of day works on populism) , charismatic 3. Reactive - (will listen more to mass, for ex he might have unbanned social media immediately if he was in that position)  4. Might create a good momentum against laggard old politicians even though he is only out in bail VS kulman -> 1. No active court cases in Nepal or outside Nepal ( pretty sure he has earned tons of enemies - rich enemies, atleast they haven’t unearthed anything substantial yet 2. Engineer ( Nepal needs more engineer in gov) with an MBA 3. Has clear ideas about Nepal strength and weaknesses - green economy, Forest laws, labor laws 4. Good leader (however you look at it, he gave new life to moribund institution) - led an institution with more employees than KMC 5. Experience - splendid work on chilime project - watershed moment for hydro dev in Nepal from profit sharing to organization growth) Cons - 1 straight talker ( probably not a strength in nepali politics) 2. Egoistical ( could have dealt hitendra situation better ) 3. Average Public speaker ( pretty sure this is most important for any politician, he is not good at it)  These are my personal observations which could be biased and could be wrong but still I think we need a technocrat to run this country not a sweet talker. We will find fault even if we get Gautam Buddha today, but still I hope whoever comes top do good for our nation.|||Ghante Thag ko support garne bhayera|||Propaganda to divide nation and people , need raaaja asaap , every political party are puesonof any type of foreign power , let's go for blind raaaja aau desh bachaau|||Due to formal Ravi's cooperative, citizenship issues ???|||Cause he is not baun or chhetri, this sub makes you hate anyone who is not baun or chhetri|||Didn't knew he was so power hungry. 😬|||Kulman for PM|||Ahh, I wasn't wrong.

            "body": "This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

And the major businesses that were attacked were in some kind of overtly public affiliation with political actors|||at least not in religious way.|||I know you did not watched or followed Bangladesh zen-z protest.  Government killed 1000+ youths and they burned down so many buildings. Even media houses for spreading false narrative.   And every time I see this kinda post they always undermine people’s life.   What would you do if your brother or sister were killed in that protest ?  Did you forget those videos of kids being shot??   And I hate this logic of that much destruction and all.  Do not ever compare human life against any short of building.   Building can be recreated or rebuilt. Can you recreate those innocent lives ?? Precedent has to be set that if you ever kill innocent people, consequences are inevitable.   And hate to see people preaching about businesses and job like they care.  Why the fuck import based economy who is fully dependent on remittances talking about job ?  Job in kantipur ? Job in bhatbhateni ?  These are blood sucking insects , Have you checked bhatbhateni business model ? Whole atmadaha in front of BICC was bcuz of bhatbhateni not paying money.   Even if they leave someone will come up to replace them.   Get your life together and find some kindness towards lost lives.|||Destruction is not an competition|||At least we are not as extremist as the dutch.   They shot their PM, mutilated the PM and his brother's body. Then they strung it up on a gibbet and cooked and ate their livers.|||I don't feel any sympathy for these conry capitalist and their political overlords, with their illegal building made from ill-gotten gains. These businesses have been involved in tax evasion, quid pro quo, illegal construction, land grab scams, corruption, and lord knows what else. I actually feel really sad that our public properties and institutions got torched along with millions of documents. Whatever happened shouldn't have happened. It was very unfortunate. But let's not sympathize with these cronies and corrupt politicians. For decades, the real victims have been the everyday citizens of our country. Our Parliament, the Supreme Court, and Singha Durbar getting burned down is a bigger tragedy than some 5-star hotel or supermarket chain. We have been screwed over by these politicians and their business counterparts for so long that on that day, the entire country became a rage room.

And these were live ammunitions... videos of cops giving the middle finger after shooting and terrorising the shops till 9-10 o'clock at night  were circulating .. What happened on September 9th was a reaction to that. Yes heavy damages were done and many anarchists got the chance to create chaos on September 9th.. but only an idiot would compare this event which was completely reactionary .. to the on going protests and acts of violence going on in Bangladesh in the name of religion without any proof .. these acts of violence in Bangladesh is not reactionary .

I don’t think Nepali youth burning down this hotel or Bangladeshi youth burning down/breaking during the uprising in both countries have anything to do with extremism or religion for that matter. When you are going to protest against a bad government, practically I don’t think anyone have religion, race, color or anything of that sort in the back of their mind, the adrenaline is so high you are only focused on one thing.   During protests, when you see protesters burning down or breaking down anything, it is usually because that structure represent something significant. I know a lot of structures were burned, broken because they represented the tyranny under fascism. A significant driver behind Nepali uprising was corruption from what I understand, and I’m pretty sure this hotel was owned/majority stakeholder by some Nepali politicians, if so, then I see them burning a symbol of rampant corruption rather than a hotel.  That’s their perspective I suppose, nonetheless, I think it’s foolish to do things like this, and I’m sure some of them will look back and realize maybe it was foolish.|||You witnessed a freaking big-ass revolution, not some child-play games.

            "body": "It’s 2026 now, and we’re still having to deal with this.  A few days ago, early in the morning, I was on the street and saw a public bus with people literally hanging from the door. It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this. This issue really needs more attention and more noise.|||KTM has enough budget with 40 percent going unused. these transportation comes under metropolitan ko authority. ask Mayor balen.

Here is one story of his conversation with his nephew Naresh Koirala.   *Naresh himself had been puzzled by his uncle’s decision to accept the result. On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP.

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.  I (21M) and my sibling (15F) are taking care of our parents during the day and our cousins help at night. Because of this, we’ve missed months of classes but we don’t really have a choice right now.  If anyone is able to help even a small amount, it would mean a lot to us.  I’ve verified the case with two of the mods and I’ll be posting medical reports in the comments as well.  Please DM or comment if you can help in any way. Even sharing this post would really help.",

            "body": "**Disclaimer** : this is not an Ad. I have been using menstrual cups for around 8 years and have recommended it to many women in my life. All have loved it and have made the switch from pads/tampons. So i decided to spread the word here.   **Tldr**: Menstrual cups will change your life. it will give you much more freedom and flexibility than period products like pads or tampons.   First of all, what is a Menstrual cup?   A menstrual cup is a reusable, flexible silicone cup inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual fluid. It can be worn up to 12 hours and can be used for several years with proper care.   I have made a list of pro and cons that i have faced in these years. You are welcome to ask more questions. I will answer as many as i can. Serious questions only please!   **PRO**:   1. To start with the basics, menstrual flow is more than just liquid blood. it has many semi-solid/solid things like mucus and blood vessels. So a pad or tampons just cannot ‘absorb’ them. these things just lay there on the surface making you feel slimy and uncomfortable. Instead the cup ‘collects’ it so it doesn’t have this issue.  2. You dont have to worry about a pad shifting from its place. you know the feeling, when the pad is too far back or too far on one side. Also, you dont feel the blood flow ‘out’ like when you laugh or sneeze or stand up. Menstrual cup catches the blood before it gets out.  3. Its an upfront investment but one that will be much cheaper in the long run. You wont have to cash out hundreds of rupees each month on period products.  4. Its better for the environment as it creates little to no waste.  5. Its better when you are out, for example, at other people’s place. you dont have to worry about where to dump your used period products.  6. You dont feel it at all once its inside. you can just live your normal day and forget about it. then only at the end of the day you empty, clean and put it back on. (if its a heavy flow day then i empty it once in the middle of the day too)  7. No issues with friction / rashes on the inner thighs.   **CON** :   1. It has a slightly steep learning curve. I know a lot of people have anxiety of putting it in and getting it out. i did too. but once you have done it a couple of times, you will get a hang of it. There are many tutorials available online for this. I personally fold the cup in a C shape and put it in and then to be sure its secure, I check for suction by pulling/rotating it a bit. Getting it out can feel a bit scary at first. When getting it out, i hold the cup on its body and not just the tip to be sure that the tip doesn’t break. But like i said, once you have done it a few times, it will feel normal.  2. I find it most comfortable to empty the cup in a toilet that has a basin inside it. so I can empty it in the basin, clean the cup and put it in again. it can be done in a toilet stall (without basin) too but you have to be a bit more careful and you will need some tissues to clean the blood off your hands before coming out of the stall.  3. it requires a bit of investment in the beginning even to try (but it will pay off long term if it works out)  4. It can leak, very rarely but sometimes. The leakage is usually minimal so for this, you can use something light like panty liners or period panties. You can try out your options here.   **Recommendations**:   1. When first trying it out, you can try it for a couple of hours at a time when you are not having heavy flow and when you are staying home. This way you will also have an idea of how much blood comes out (spoiler alert: its much less than what you would expect) and how frequently you need to empty the cup.  2. always clean your hands with soap before and after putting/removing the cup.  3. hold the cup by its body (base of the cup) and not just its tip when pulling it out.  4. There are a lot of tutorials, feedback, helpful materials available online. Please be brave and give it a try. you will thank me later :)  —————————————————————————-  **Edit 1**: some people are asking about which brands to use. If someone is a new user of Menstrual cups, could you please let us know about your experience with it and which brand you are using?",

You can't plan on quitting it has to be sudden with no backups or cheeky puffs!!   Stopped smoking since may 2023 its been a life changing decision. And about the urge to smoke it never left me.

I quit smoking cigarettes and weed couple of years ago. Weed ta aboh kaam ma Drugs and Alcohol test le garda kheri ho tara cigarettes was coz one morning I was at work and some guy walked in after smoking. Teti bela I just started thinking to myself, is this how bad I smell and does everyone in the office look at me disgusted like I am doing right now? So tya bata I just stopped smoking automatically. I also threw away all my packs.  Later on I got urges to smoke after couple of months and that’s when I fucked up… I started vaping and that shit was too addictive than cigarettes because you can literally vape in your room, car anywhere… so it took me a while to decide to stop vaping too after 3 years…   Whatever you are all doing, please don’t turn to vaping thinking it will help you quit cigarettes… it will just reverse everything!  To all the quitters, please stay strong 💪🏼|||crazy|||Life won't get any better. I quit for 4 years and started again.|||Great job. I did that with weed.

I remember when he talked about doing this in his free time.|||This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

Most of the teachers in school and college all of the are pedophiles.|||I'm not aware of the definition - is it like somebody who's grooming girls under 18? Are you using the term loosely?  It's an individual-thing and not a profession-thing. Girls sending DMs to get referred (when they have no skills) is also more common than you think. I get many DMs asking for free help (refactors)/ referrals (barely know them/ barely seen their code) and I just ignore them. I help many people (m/f) on a daily basis, and I've never met most of them. I know many of my 'male' senior friends (no female senior dev friends) do the same.  You should clear your exams first. Last bullet point sounds like a good plan.  Most people here will be happy to review 1-2 projects for free. I'll jump in if it's Python/ Next.js/ ML. Just post your github repo on some relevant community and they'll do free reviews.   Edit: I dont do free mentorships, happy to review repos/ coding practices.|||In my experience, Girls seem to help girl only when they are on some “female tech organization” and it’s rarely a technical mentorship.

Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

When you know exactly what to do it's pretty easy to write the code for it. The hardest part of IT is trying to find out what the right questions to ask is so that you have a semblance on what exactly to code. It's trying to understand what the users of your software want. Have AI figure that out for you and then tell me.|||You are just here because of money which is not bad, but  for some programming is getting their vision on screen, a way to show creativity. You dont get to decide who is a fool|||with the increase in AI expect to get shitty codes delivered faster than we have ever seen. Shitty code, more bugs and more opportunities for IT devs. Not every company can afford AI that is going to cost fortune in long run. Mid-level devs would collapse, there would be junior then senior. Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||[deleted]|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||Skill issue.

Don't get me wrong - vibe coding and low code/no code methods are getting popular with some LLM coders (Claude, Gemini) becoming absolute beasts, but, the real need of a human is in problem solving and building scalable systems. My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.  The problem is people jumping on the bandwagon which is creating a terrible environment for business owners, recruiters and stakeholders.  I hope you do well in your career my friend.

            "body": "Yesterday I posted about how I felt like a Pathao for my girlfriend, and almost everyone agreed that I was being used. So I finally talked to her about it. She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

            "body": "I've been tempted to write this for a long time.       I was in a relationship with a popular male influencer for a long time. We broke up 2 years ago. During our 3+ year-long relationship, I got to be in his inner circle and hung out with Sisan and gang (and Shrinkhala too, before she went to Harvard). We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective. Just like Shrinkhala shamelessly posted those yellow highlighted Excel Sheets as her proof of innocence which had no third party audit or any verification.|||I have never watched Sisan Baniya, but I didn't feel that he ever portrayed himself as self made or coming from a humble background. He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Yeah, Sisan isn't 'dudh ka dhula' as he shows himself to be, he might be even worse.

I think i know who you are. I also worked and hung out with and around Sisan Shrinkhala a lot. So after the breakup, the way he acted like a kicked dog and gained public sympathy from incels licking on his balls and slut shaming Shrinkhala was so insane. And the way he spoke up about the Miss Nepal funds k k when the hate for her was at an all time high. Personally I have no sympathy or love for Shrinkhala so I am not saying this to defend her.

What an absolute joke. Absolute witch hunting behaviour. She was cool until she was relateable to most women but once you marry rich thats the end of it for women. Take away every thing that she has ever achieved and yeah jump on the hate train wagon.Most people who know sisan personally know that he is absolute shit head. Absolute narc. I know some of them and they all say that he didnt pay half of his saff well. Always made them work extra hours with out paying them well. And those who know them up and close know that the rumour about shrinkhala putting an extra effort on the relationship is true. I have even heard that Shrinkhala was ready to marry him but he kind of side lined and said he is not ready or something. He was always a snob dont know what took people so long to recognise. When he was in relationship with shrinkhala he would always put thumbnail of her in every video he posted to cash in the view and any body can tell he did the same thing after they broke up, used  every opportunity to capitalise her name, when we all know she was quite for the longest time.

And the way he helped to intensify hate and misinformation about Shrinkhala during that difficult time for her, shows the true character of the person.  It was (still is) unpopular to support Shrinkhala and criticize Sisan but we should never hesitate to tell the truth. Plus anybody whose father owns a house in Kathmandu is never struggling.

He seems the most capable guy among all the fkin leaders, including balen and rabi. When he speaks , he always seems calm even when he is provoked, unlike balen. He does not have an ongoing corruption case like that of rabi. He is an engineer who studied at the most prestigious university of our country and also studied at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. he went as a Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar to study water science, policy, and management. This is different from most engineering degrees  because he isn't just an engineer who can build a hydropower or dam. He has knowledge of policies and understands the economics and geopolitics of water—Nepal's most valuable resource. Has worked in developing countries in Africa. Seems like he has some political knowledge. Also, rabi and balen were celebrity figures, but he wasn't and dared to challenge one of the biggest political figures in a less urban or even rural city(dadeldhura). In a time where every nepalese wants to leave the country, a guy from oxford who could have easily left the country, not only staying but wants change in his country, shows bravery and patriotism. He hasn't been in power, so we can't gauge him, but we can gauge him based on what we have seen so far - a calm, educated, brave and exceptionally brilliant young guy, and i would definitely prefer him over any politican i have witnessed so far.|||\"Oxford padheko bhandai ma should be a leader\"  Can see the mindset of OP here.

We skipped the formal lectures and kept things simple—just hands-on demos and honest conversations. The goal wasn’t to teach a full curriculum in an afternoon; it was to show these kids that technology isn't out of reach.  As a student-led initiative, we don't have a big corporate engine behind us. We’re just a group of peers showing up and leading where we can. This reel captures some of the curiosity we saw that day—it’s a small start, but a meaningful one.

Timle real life ma ni notice garya holau, when you may have thought of reading, tetibela chai you will be getting out of your comfort zone to read where nervous system senses it as danger ani it will shut your system down ani procrastination huney type ko huncha.

Ani when your mind wants to tell but nervous system detects it as problem, it will shut your system down ani you will go in loop of regret and overthinking ani after that depression.

            "body": "This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

And these were live ammunitions... videos of cops giving the middle finger after shooting and terrorising the shops till 9-10 o'clock at night  were circulating .. What happened on September 9th was a reaction to that. Yes heavy damages were done and many anarchists got the chance to create chaos on September 9th.. but only an idiot would compare this event which was completely reactionary .. to the on going protests and acts of violence going on in Bangladesh in the name of religion without any proof .. these acts of violence in Bangladesh is not reactionary .

I don’t think Nepali youth burning down this hotel or Bangladeshi youth burning down/breaking during the uprising in both countries have anything to do with extremism or religion for that matter. When you are going to protest against a bad government, practically I don’t think anyone have religion, race, color or anything of that sort in the back of their mind, the adrenaline is so high you are only focused on one thing.   During protests, when you see protesters burning down or breaking down anything, it is usually because that structure represent something significant. I know a lot of structures were burned, broken because they represented the tyranny under fascism. A significant driver behind Nepali uprising was corruption from what I understand, and I’m pretty sure this hotel was owned/majority stakeholder by some Nepali politicians, if so, then I see them burning a symbol of rampant corruption rather than a hotel.  That’s their perspective I suppose, nonetheless, I think it’s foolish to do things like this, and I’m sure some of them will look back and realize maybe it was foolish.|||You witnessed a freaking big-ass revolution, not some child-play games.

            "body": "It’s 2026 now, and we’re still having to deal with this.  A few days ago, early in the morning, I was on the street and saw a public bus with people literally hanging from the door. It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this. This issue really needs more attention and more noise.|||KTM has enough budget with 40 percent going unused. these transportation comes under metropolitan ko authority. ask Mayor balen.

Here is one story of his conversation with his nephew Naresh Koirala.   *Naresh himself had been puzzled by his uncle’s decision to accept the result. On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP.

The Koteshwor traffic jam finally started moving, and I was riding slowly when I noticed three people inside the car infront of me were staring and gesturing aggressively at me and fellow vehicles.  ​Then, the high beams flickered from the car behind me. I realized it was a VIP or a politician's vehicle.  They wanted us to move, but we didn't. Why should we? Why should we give way to them when the pace of the traffic is slow, we didn't have enough space to let them pass.   ​I don't know who was in that car, but I am tired of this. It is disappointing to see someone enjoy \"special facilities\" while ignoring the basic infrastructure the rest of us struggle with every day. If they want a clear road, they should use our tax money to fix the roads for everyone, not just for their own convoys.  Note: The way they were gesturing from a compact car was pretty much close to the 3 monkeys of Gandhi , only less wiser.",

We can advocate for legal reforms to ensure excessive security isn't granted to those without genuine threats or controversies. However, for the sake of national security and peace, such measures remain essential for VVIPs. Whether we like them or not, an attack on a high profile figure can disrupt our national peace and damage our international reputation for years to come.  ​We can never be certain who might be planning an attack on a VVIP or for what purpose. These individuals hold their status for a reason, and they will have followers regardless of whether we perceive their character as good or bad. There will always be those who fight for their \"masters\" or those who have something to gain from these VVIPs, for them, personal interests and loyalty will always take priority over the country’s wellbeing. If an attack occurs, our country’s stability can derail overnight and Western media and racists in west love to make fun of \"third world countries\" to feel superior regardless of fact that they have been through worse. The global protocols built over centuries of human experience teach us that it is not worth risking national peace over the minor, occasional inconveniences caused by VVIP convoys.|||What if it was not a politician, but someone special like an Army Chief, Police Chief, Nobel Peace Prize winner, international delegate, or the Dalai Lama himself ?

My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6. This is probably the longest shot of them all, but any ideas what species of critter might have eaten up the stock at one point? I put a picture of it on picture 2, I was thinking some type of termite or wood worm.",

During the Rana regime (1846–1951), gun manufacturing in Nepal was driven largely by the innovative efforts of Gehendra Shumsher, the eldest son of Prime Minister Bir Shumsher, who is widely regarded as Nepal's first scientist and modernizer of the military.   Key Manufacturing Factories  The Ranas established several sites for arms and ammunition production, primarily centered in the Kathmandu Valley and some regional hubs:   Nakkhu (Lalitpur): Notable for producing copies of the Martini-Henry rifle, specifically the \"De-Rifle\" in the late 1880s.  Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.  Jangi Megjin: Originally founded in 1793, it continued to function during the Rana period as a government foundry for manufacturing cannons and military equipment.|||You need someone from the Hanuman Dhoka Museum in Kathmandu. They’ll be able to clarify for you. Your next best bet is if you can convince one these redditors (or they do it out of sheer curiosity) and visit the museum to see if they can glean more info about your gun.   Most of the folks that come here are students and a majority of the population has no interest in guns.   All the best!

            "body": "Bail does not mean someone is innocent or guilty. It just means that rather than keeping a person in prison while waiting for their trial (so they don't escape), they are set free for the time being. They have to give the court a large sum of money as a \"deposit\" so they are inclined to return.  If they show up to court as promised, they get their money back. If they run away, the court keeps the cash and sends the police to find them. It isn’t a decision on whether they did the crime, it’s just a way to let someone live their life until the judge or jury makes a final decision. This is usually done if the person in question does not have a high risk of escaping or evading from police.",

The person is required to follow the court orders, e.g., appearing in court on the date of hearings/schedules and not leaving a specific area or boundary, and following any other orders set by the court. If any of these orders are violated, the bail money is forfeited.

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two.

We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.

            "body": "**Disclaimer** : this is not an Ad. I have been using menstrual cups for around 8 years and have recommended it to many women in my life. All have loved it and have made the switch from pads/tampons. So i decided to spread the word here.   **Tldr**: Menstrual cups will change your life. it will give you much more freedom and flexibility than period products like pads or tampons.   First of all, what is a Menstrual cup?   A menstrual cup is a reusable, flexible silicone cup inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual fluid. It can be worn up to 12 hours and can be used for several years with proper care.   I have made a list of pro and cons that i have faced in these years. You are welcome to ask more questions. I will answer as many as i can. Serious questions only please!   **PRO**:   1. To start with the basics, menstrual flow is more than just liquid blood. it has many semi-solid/solid things like mucus and blood vessels. So a pad or tampons just cannot ‘absorb’ them. these things just lay there on the surface making you feel slimy and uncomfortable. Instead the cup ‘collects’ it so it doesn’t have this issue.  2. You dont have to worry about a pad shifting from its place. you know the feeling, when the pad is too far back or too far on one side. Also, you dont feel the blood flow ‘out’ like when you laugh or sneeze or stand up. Menstrual cup catches the blood before it gets out.  3. Its an upfront investment but one that will be much cheaper in the long run. You wont have to cash out hundreds of rupees each month on period products.  4. Its better for the environment as it creates little to no waste.  5. Its better when you are out, for example, at other people’s place. you dont have to worry about where to dump your used period products.  6. You dont feel it at all once its inside. you can just live your normal day and forget about it. then only at the end of the day you empty, clean and put it back on. (if its a heavy flow day then i empty it once in the middle of the day too)  7. No issues with friction / rashes on the inner thighs.   **CON** :   1. It has a slightly steep learning curve. I know a lot of people have anxiety of putting it in and getting it out. i did too. but once you have done it a couple of times, you will get a hang of it. There are many tutorials available online for this. I personally fold the cup in a C shape and put it in and then to be sure its secure, I check for suction by pulling/rotating it a bit. Getting it out can feel a bit scary at first. When getting it out, i hold the cup on its body and not just the tip to be sure that the tip doesn’t break. But like i said, once you have done it a few times, it will feel normal.  2. I find it most comfortable to empty the cup in a toilet that has a basin inside it. so I can empty it in the basin, clean the cup and put it in again. it can be done in a toilet stall (without basin) too but you have to be a bit more careful and you will need some tissues to clean the blood off your hands before coming out of the stall.  3. it requires a bit of investment in the beginning even to try (but it will pay off long term if it works out)  4. It can leak, very rarely but sometimes. The leakage is usually minimal so for this, you can use something light like panty liners or period panties. You can try out your options here.   **Recommendations**:   1. When first trying it out, you can try it for a couple of hours at a time when you are not having heavy flow and when you are staying home. This way you will also have an idea of how much blood comes out (spoiler alert: its much less than what you would expect) and how frequently you need to empty the cup.  2. always clean your hands with soap before and after putting/removing the cup.  3. hold the cup by its body (base of the cup) and not just its tip when pulling it out.  4. There are a lot of tutorials, feedback, helpful materials available online. Please be brave and give it a try. you will thank me later :)  —————————————————————————-  **Edit 1**: some people are asking about which brands to use. If someone is a new user of Menstrual cups, could you please let us know about your experience with it and which brand you are using?",

Now everyone is fully behind Balen as the PM while Rabi will be the party man .. it's a great thing , probably the best news to come out for our contry in a while but I fear people will turn on them sooner than later. Single man, single constituency Ra executive elections and legislative elections are very different things, to run an organisation of over half a million supporters is a HUGE HUGE task . People didn't even look at what terms they agreed on .. no policies no vision just the news that they came together was enough and it will more than likely be enough to win the elections but the real problems will come after that. People who are with them are also Nepali people , the same people who were once close to the old parties , not all but most of them. And they will have their flaws , there will be problems related to distribution of power but all this comes in the later phases when there will be many winners and many leaders . I just hope Rabi becomes more grounded in terms of his promises and Balen starts interacting with the public and media .. sadhai Facebook ma status matra halera ta hudaina these people will make fake news and assumptions because He doesn't ever talk to the media and provide regular press releases . Citizens of Nepal, please support whoever you want to support but support them for thier vision and policies not for their fiery speeches and just because they are against Congress UMl and Maoists .

He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

A young girl in her early 20s reached out to me for a referall for associate engineer. I hesitated a bit seeing her technical knowledge.

I left my job after a year because of a toxic culture. I swear, I couldn't find a position (I was even applying for internships) at any tech company in Kathmandu. I thought it wouldn't be that difficult since I have decent projects and a year of experience, but I remain jobless for next three months. It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

Cars that cost ₹7–10 L in India often cost 2–3× more in Nepal (sometimes even higher when taxes + import duties are added), and this is widely reported.  This means:  1. The same car/automobile can cost roughly 2–3 times more in Nepal because of heavy import taxes and logistics costs. 2.

Essentially doing a drill over and over until you're fairly confident to take on almost any curve ball interview question.  Whilst you wouldn't be asked to invert a binary tree on your interview, it'd help you understand in a broader sense how to break down a problem and solve it.  Not to mention NPath, Cyclomatic, Coupling, and time complexity. These are things you need to absolutely nail down when working with anything beyond a basic crud app, which can be vibe coded easily these days.  So how'd that set you apart? Well, essentially, it'd enable you to be a quick thinker. If you don't need to get stuck when programming on the basics, you are able to instead divert your faculties to actual problems that require your energy.|||That is not leetcode, that is codeforces which is a much higher level than leetcode.

            "comments": "You have 4 years of experience but you don't seem to understand that writing formatted code syntax was never the hard part. When you know exactly what to do it's pretty easy to write the code for it. The hardest part of IT is trying to find out what the right questions to ask is so that you have a semblance on what exactly to code. It's trying to understand what the users of your software want. Have AI figure that out for you and then tell me.|||You are just here because of money which is not bad, but  for some programming is getting their vision on screen, a way to show creativity. You dont get to decide who is a fool|||with the increase in AI expect to get shitty codes delivered faster than we have ever seen. Shitty code, more bugs and more opportunities for IT devs. Not every company can afford AI that is going to cost fortune in long run. Mid-level devs would collapse, there would be junior then senior. Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||[deleted]|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||Skill issue. While i agree to most part, if AI is already suggesting you things you can never think of or think you are not writing / thinking yourself - i dont think you are 4yoe of engineer.

Don't get me wrong - vibe coding and low code/no code methods are getting popular with some LLM coders (Claude, Gemini) becoming absolute beasts, but, the real need of a human is in problem solving and building scalable systems. My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.  The problem is people jumping on the bandwagon which is creating a terrible environment for business owners, recruiters and stakeholders.  I hope you do well in your career my friend.

And he even categorized questions, contents based on level like basic, intermediate, advanced and so on. And he even used to add the most prominent mathematician in each chapter. That I even consider a some form of research. Not every research has to wear a PhD hat. So for me, I consider his contributions in mathematics to be highest in Nepal.

You should go two ways:-  1) Report at police's cyber bureau.  2) Do self investigation. Police is slow, case like yours is matter of everyday for them. So, try following:-  - Is their phone still ringing? If yes try as a new client from new number, new voice (friend) and try to meet before paying. If one guy is ready to meet then you can get them nabbed. - If you have family or friends in any of the banks scammers used, then ask them to find their original name, number, location, if account still has any money (this worked for me, I got number and names)  If you got details you can ask police to help by scaring them or freezing the amount etc. You can try these and come back to me here to proceed.|||cyber bureau ma report garne all details .|||haha movies haina ni bro. reverse hack hanera location track hanera firta linu sounds good in fantasy only . only logical option is to go to police/bank or whatever institutions involved|||Sakyeo no chance ull ever recover ur amount..but register ur case to cyber bureau|||First do register police complaint.

But when it comes to GTM, growth, marketing, or just figuring out how to actually sell and scale a product… there’s a huge gap.  Most startups here are run by tech engineers, and naturally, the focus is on building the product perfectly. That’s great, but then things like growth strategy, customer acquisition, positioning, and distribution get ignored. People just assume if you build it, users will come. Spoiler: they don’t.  Most of the startups here in Nepal fail less because the product is bad, but instead because the distribution/game-plan is weak.   Here in Nepal, GTM skills aren’t really taught, nor are they considered “cool” compared to coding. Most people in IT industrychase programming jobs, freelancing gigs, or outsourcing contracts because that’s a safer bet financially.  I think this is actually a huge opportunity. Someone who can master GTM skis here like: user research, acquisition channels, funnel optimization, sales psychology could easily dominate the startup scene.   Instead of just learning yet another JS framework, you should also learn GTM skills.   What do you guys think?",

The islamic countries here in Asia are being sponsored by various other countries to spread violence. The islamic crowd needs to understand that they are not made for religion, religion is made for them. Religion is for your inner peace and it does not need anything from the people.

In the protest you guys killed and the burned the politician and beated them on road to death. You guys destroyed public property and also the government property made by your own tax money. Stealing from malls and local shops,  those who were stealing they were all educated people, you guys are corrupt yourself and what better can we expect from government. I saw videos of Indian youths crying in pokhara for help when some group of protesters came to beat them because they were indians. Now I guess after doing all this Nepal will surpass india and germany, china, japan etc right? A politicians wife was burnt alive in her house and she died while going to the hospital.  I am not blaming the people who did nothing like this, and if you didn't then congrats 👏🏻 you hold a special place in my heart. My comment is for those who did these things not for those who didn't.  ![gif](giphy|iNPNqI81MvDQ4D4n6D)  Don't be a fool, I know truth is harsh and you can't accept it.

But the irony of the protesters is hilarious.|||It's not muslims the problem but the hanafi, wahabism and Deubandi school of thought which makes them radical. Look at Indonesia it follows Sufism mixed with agakhani sect do we hear minorities being treated badly? No. Mostly it's the south Asian Muslims who are radical because they follow a very strict islam of deubandi and wahabism school of thought which has caused problem historically it's moderate example would be creation of Taliban and extreme example is creation of Pakztan. Now contrary to that you've Indonesia which is also a majority Muslim nation but follows Sufism school of thought which is why they are much more liberal. They're okay with currency having Ganesha, okay with garuda being national symbol(coat of arms), and even okay with naming kids from Sanskrit derived names like majority of their head of the states have Sanskrit origin names there will be some ups and downs in writing because Indonesia didn't follow devanagari it followed the Brahmi script earlier, in that way it's still preserving the culture. But if you tell this to a MUSLIM.from south Asia he will say it's shirk/haram in islam and that being associated with polytheism is bad and that they are a lost tribe of Turks and Arabs who had invaded our land. So, wahabism and Deubandi unless remained will not allow for inclusivity among the people islam factor will be there no matter what|||Can't decide which is the worst religion - Islam or Hinduism.

What is wrong is wrong, I dunno what the procedure for BSF to enter each other countries is, with the open border and all, but I'm sure they are only able to enter after some permission from each other's authorities. If that is not the case here, then it's wrong and us Indians should accept that. 3. Nepal is a beautiful country. People have more civic sense and overall better sense of community and cohesion from what I have seen.  4. What Nepali people have to understand is India is a big country 1.4 billion people is a lot. So, of all the counties in the world, India is probably the only one you should never generalize. 6. Both Nepali and Indian people can have good relationship with each other, just learn to talk properly and not take things to ego. 6. Yes, India is a bigger economy, and has more resources, but it is not in competition with Nepal. Nepal has it's own strengths that it should not forget.  7. Open border has it's pros and cons. Yes, many Nepali are in India, do they get to build a life, yes. Do they get discriminated, yes, and so are Indians from other states. And Nepali also discriminate against Indian tourists and workers. 8. Always remember, most average Indians will probably only have good will towards Nepal and no hate.  9. It is very important that rather than spreading unnecessary generalized hate, we judge people on individual basis.

She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess. Aba Don feri Bumble ma janxa haha  Thankyou everyone for your suggestions sabai Lai mero tarfa Bata coffee ly",

This is further emboldened by the recent strong statements UML has put out.  The old parties have their base established, and the more the new parties run for election, the more they dilute their own votes. Furthermore, they aren't organized yet to be a major national party and to compete in 165 different constituencies .

Then make them (and everyone who breaks civic conduct) pay.   Border restriction, daily charges in USD, yada yada haru implement garna sajhilo chaina. But fines are pretty simple and can be implemented locally. No approvals, no drama.|||![gif](giphy|uFmLnTtvbv5yBdpfzV)|||Commented earlier also in same topic:-  1. Restrict all. 2.

            "body": "I've been tempted to write this for a long time.       I was in a relationship with a popular male influencer for a long time. We broke up 2 years ago. During our 3+ year-long relationship, I got to be in his inner circle and hung out with Sisan and gang (and Shrinkhala too, before she went to Harvard). We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective. Just like Shrinkhala shamelessly posted those yellow highlighted Excel Sheets as her proof of innocence which had no third party audit or any verification.|||I have never watched Sisan Baniya, but I didn't feel that he ever portrayed himself as self made or coming from a humble background. He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Yeah, Sisan isn't 'dudh ka dhula' as he shows himself to be, he might be even worse.

And the way he spoke up about the Miss Nepal funds k k when the hate for her was at an all time high. Personally I have no sympathy or love for Shrinkhala so I am not saying this to defend her.

He seems the most capable guy among all the fkin leaders, including balen and rabi. When he speaks , he always seems calm even when he is provoked, unlike balen. He does not have an ongoing corruption case like that of rabi. He is an engineer who studied at the most prestigious university of our country and also studied at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. he went as a Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar to study water science, policy, and management. This is different from most engineering degrees  because he isn't just an engineer who can build a hydropower or dam. He has knowledge of policies and understands the economics and geopolitics of water—Nepal's most valuable resource. Has worked in developing countries in Africa. Seems like he has some political knowledge. Also, rabi and balen were celebrity figures, but he wasn't and dared to challenge one of the biggest political figures in a less urban or even rural city(dadeldhura). In a time where every nepalese wants to leave the country, a guy from oxford who could have easily left the country, not only staying but wants change in his country, shows bravery and patriotism. He hasn't been in power, so we can't gauge him, but we can gauge him based on what we have seen so far - a calm, educated, brave and exceptionally brilliant young guy, and i would definitely prefer him over any politican i have witnessed so far.|||\"Oxford padheko bhandai ma should be a leader\"  Can see the mindset of OP here.

            "heading": "Went to India recently and it was immensely traumatizing",
            "body": "So I (27M) went to India for the first time. I was traveling solo turns out it was a bad idea. It was for work related events. After the event, I decided to explore a few places.   Until the work event, everything was fine. It was great learning and networking in the event. I actually speak Hindi very fluently so communication wasn’t an issue at all. After the event, I wanted to travel and explore.   I had booked a pretty average room for my accommodation. Nothing fancy, just the most budget friendly one I could find. There were a couple of people in the lobby and they greeted me nicely and asked for my ID. I showed them my passport and their faces instantly changed after seeing my Nepali passport. The guy said oh you’re from Nepal. I said yes and the another man said, this doesn’t work, we need to see an Indian ID. They weren’t smiling anymore and were giving me very skeptical looks. I tried not to overthink it. He kept insisting for an Indian ID and I explained to him that I am not from India, it’s my first time here so it’s not possible for me to have an Indian ID. Then they asked me for my contact number and I gave my phone number (didn’t have Indian number). Once again, they kept on asking for an Indian number. I was really surprised seeing their hospitality instantly changed after learning about my identity. Not sure if they did that because I was a foreigner to them or because I was specifically a Nepali guy.   While I was exploring the local market, I went to buy some souvenirs. One shop guy asked me where I was from and I said Nepal. He then started lecturing me saying don’t be close with China. They will do the same to you what Pakistan is doing to us. He kept yapping about how Nepal is a small part of India and that we should be grateful that we have a “bada bhai” like India. I left the shop without saying anything.    I wanted to travel by train but had absolutely zero idea about it. The people weren’t helpful there either. I was asking the various staff in the train station saying I wanna go here where can I find a ticket. They just vaguely pointed go there, it’s over there. Finally one guy at the ticket counter helped me get tickets after nearly couple of hours of running frantically here and there. I told him I’m not from India, traveling by train for the first time. The counter guy gave me a ticket saying this is for general class, it’s not safe to travel there..very crowded and chaotic, after your train arrives, meet the ticket guy and ask him to upgrade to AC compartment. I thanked him and went to the platform. There was a police officer whom I asked about upgrading the ticket. He too said the same thing i.e. meet the ticket guy once your train arrives and he will help you.   I still had about 3-4 hours before my train arrived. I just stayed in the platform watching movie. After the train arrived, I was frantically searching for the ticket guy. One police officer came near me charging with his baton. I was shit scared. He almost charged me saying why are you in the AC compartment with a general ticket in your hand. I was literally shaking at this point and with a shaky voice, I explained him my situation. He said haven’t you been in a train before where are you from. I said I’m from Nepal and he laughed saying oh you guys don’t even have trains there haha. Are you really from Nepal, your eyes don’t look like Nepalese. (I think he was referring to Mongolian eyes). I saw the ticket guy and went to him. He said me go to this seat and I’ll come. Later, he came to me and upgraded my ticket. The journey was a little over an hour long. And I was constantly replaying the entire experience from the hotel to the local market to the train station police guy.    Not sure if I just happened to meet all the wrong people or that everyone is the same there. Either way, I’m not going back to India for a long time. And I haven’t even mentioned the kids constantly following you begging for money, the dirt and litter everywhere, people peeing and even pooping in the open, unnecessary horns, air pollution.   PS: not trying to spread hate— just sharing my personal experience.",

Which cities did you visit, by the way? and as far as I know, many hotels in India especially smaller ones usually avoid foreigners because of paperwork and FRRO/police registration requirements. It’s better to stay at big hotels or resorts while traveling. I personally mostly stay at resorts, especially Club Mahindra ones they’re quite good, with solid service.  Also, try to do everything online in India train bookings, hotels, cabs. That way you’re much less likely to get scammed or harsh treated. Offline train ticket booking is honestly very hectic, even for Indians, so always book train tickets online. Use the official IRCTC website or authorized partners like MakeMyTrip, ConfirmTkt, or Paytm then you won’t face these problems.  And if you remember the time, location, duration, or the office name, you can also register a complaint on the Rail Madad portal or app. Lastly, there’s a huge generation gap in India you’ll mostly hear such racist things from older people or those in the 30–40 age group, but the younger generation is usually nicer and more helpful .You can even see this generation gap while speaking English. If you start speaking English in front of older people, they often treat you like some different person almost a ‘raja sahab’ type. But with the younger generation, it usually doesn’t make much of a difference. Anyway, I hope your journey was safe.|||Fake story|||Mods, how much racial abuse is tolerated here?

You feel lost in those reactions and might even get out of your mind just looking at them. But listen to the tale, the story of how learning really happens. I don't know if you play games like Free Fire, PUBG, Royale, or something else. Ask yourself how you remembered all the gun names, location names, and the different things in them. How you remembered a whole 3-hour-long story you watched years ago? Treat these things the same way. Connect with them. Practice writing out the reaction yourself. Guess how they could pair up and react to give products. In the beginning, you will make mistakes, but slowly you will get used to it. Just know the reaction types: what acid-base rxns do, salts, catalysts, how oxidants and reductants work in any reaction. Try to understand these basics, and then you will not have to blindly learn rxns.|||On youtube watch pw lecture |||Old is gold ma vako haru pada yo sabb padna maile ta sakena yrr thett|||Haina ho sab Chinese letter dekhchu ta|||dont read all just read half the syllabus tara tyo half chai purai aunu paryo ......and u will pass|||Heri raakhnu parxa, kasto ma displacement, kasto ma substitution vanne crack vayesi sajilo hunxa|||I skipped the all organic portion but still got B+|||I didn't.

            "body": "My college head and a friendly botany teacher who has seen thousands of students always says just do enough to pass all subjects. Thats it. Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.
