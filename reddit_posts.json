            "body": "My house was vandalized in the name of \"Gen z protest.\" My dad is a civil servant, and we live in a humble 3 story house (the third story was only recently built). It was a small house when we moved in, which was 17 years ago— few months after I was born.   After working for over 25+ years for the government, this country, and its public, my dad still has a very clear history. No bribery, no corruption, no money laundering— nothing. Rising high in status and the post, he is recognized for his diligent work and highly stable work ethic.  Now, back to the present. The protestors had reached our house. I had once thought, why would anyone target our house? It's a civil servant, not some minister or anything of that sort. My father rose high due to his hard work and competitiveness, not any connection or bribery. We can all see from how my parents lived rental first (he was already a civil servant then). Only after a few months of me being born did they buy a house, not without taking loans.  I don't know why it happened because our house was aba and definitely not supposed to be a part of whatever that was. The protestors were going to burn our house, but because of it being attached to other houses, the neighbours finally calmed them down into not burning our house. Instead, they burned our bikes, went into our house, and threw things out to burn them. What's worse? When the protestors left, all the people living nearby, went in and out for 2 days straight— morning, day and night, pickng whatever things they liked amd taking it home with them as if our house was some kind of thrift store giving away our stuff for free.  We were at our relative's house, and when we saw all the black smoke coming from the direction of our house, we were devastated. \"Our house got burnt.\" That's what we thought. As i was the oldest child in the family, i couldn't let myself break down. I can still hear those devastating gut-wrenching cries and sobs from my mom, haunting me like a ghost every time i close my eyes.   I am a college student. My uniform is gone, and so are my books and copies. My sister is in middle school. Her uniform and books and copies are nowhere to be found as well.   Our money and jewelries, of course, are gone too. The same money my father earned and mind you, a civil servant's earnings isn't much. Only enough to label us as a middle-class family. The same money my sister sent us, her hard-working money(which was in dollars at that).  Our clothes, bags, and even utensils are gone, and so are our food storage(stuff). My mom is someone who saves money. However, she can just like my dad because she knows she has experienced the hardships with my dad. Because they know. Because they have experienced hardships and complications in their life. Because they have faced obstacles.  We have never wore any designers, no luxury fashion brand. All are affordable and comfortable. The only designer my mom and dad ever even had is when my big sister from abroad visited us and surprised us with some designer bags (which she also got scolded for spending so much because she is still studying and working in between only).  Our guests'clothes, laptops, phones, everything is gone. Me and my sisters' savings and my mom's little spending for managing our household— nothing is left. Not even our puja ko thaan(a small place we had to worship and pray gods).   We have tons of debts. I am old enough to learn that by now. Now that our house was totally and utterly robbed and vandalized while my dad kept on working for the same public, we have nowhere to sleep on. No clothes to wear. There is no place to shower or bathe.  We had to hide away from our own house we once called home to keep ourselves alive. My father was lucky enough to be safe because if it was even a few seconds late, it would have all been over. We were fortunate to be alive, even though we had done nothing wrong to people.  Morality? Humanity? Conscience? Guilt? Remorse? None. The same people, the same public, that my dad is working so hard to serve with his whole heart, has done this to him, to his family.  Gen z, huh? Protest against corruption, huh? My dad, having the cleanest history— no corruption, bribery, connection, whatsoever. So why our house? Why? What had we ever done to them? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.   I have no hope left. None for this country, none for the people of this country. This is now a country full of robbers and thieves. Humans are jealous. Humans are greedy. People are full of themselves, full of greediness and selfishness. In my heart, humans are creatures who have ruined any hope for more in me and my family. My father, who once poured his heart for this country and the people in this country, is on the verge of giving up on it.  You people, opportunists, and robbers who call yourselves voice of justice— I'll be watching, watching who you are going to tame to pull this country back together. People like my dad who are so wronged will be out of all this mess soon, Who are you going to pull to patch this broken country? I'll be watching. I'll be happily watching everything crumble and fall apart with your \"justice.\" You have given the opportunists a sense of win. You've let them think anything is possible, and now, everything will fall apart while you watch everything crumble in front of your eyes.  Lastly, I'd like to be a little vulgar and uncensored. If you are uncomfortable, scroll away.  Whoever has participated in vandalizing my house and robbing it empty— You are going to see hell and worse. I hope you feel yourself rotting away. I hope you don't think it's over now because whatever you stole, it will haunt you for the rest of your life and afterwards. I will forever haunt you, even in your dreams, converting it into a disastrous nightmare. You'll see hell. You are going to suffer.",

But It should be the highest priority of the current government to give justice to you and your family.

I hope god gives strength to you and your family during this hard time.|||I know this will be an unpopular opinion, but I feel the Gen Z protest got out of control. While the deaths of innocent people rightfully shook everyone and fueled the anger, more innocent lives were lost in the chaos that followed. Gen Z cannot ignore the fact that others died in fires, or that people were looted and harmed during the unrest. It’s easy to say the movement was hijacked by goons, but the videos and reports show some protesters themselves vandalizing property and stealing from people who had nothing to do with the issue. Ironically, those who stood up against corruption ended up damaging the lives and livelihoods of ordinary citizens. They should have taken more responsibility, like that young girl with her younger brother who was blocking the protestors from vandalising the mall.  My heart goes out to you for your loss.

The moment I condemn their brutality, they rush to label me as “jholay,” as if that insult could erase their own guilt. Their selective outrage is sickening. And now, when things are finally settling down, looking back in retrospect, it is clear that we failed as a society.

This goes beyond a single mayor, whether it's Balen or Salen or whoever the fuck. No one should ever be displaced in the name of \"organising\" anything. This is a problem of sustainable leadership, governance, and development.  Solving issues and problems that have been piling up for decades can't be solved overnight or even a year. It needs strategy, planning, and proper execution. And that's exactly what we lack.  I don't know, maybe it's in our culture or something, but as I've seen, most people want to win, succeed, and they want it now, right away. Most of us will always choose the easy way. We will always opt for the results that just satifies our KPIs. Why? Because that's what getting a job done means in Nepal, right?  Too much traffic on the road? Ok, demolish buildings on the side of the road (only which we can, of course) and don't give a fuck about the rise in the number of vehicles in regulation.  Euta naya gadi launch huna pako hunna, Kathmandu ko sadak ma dekha parisakcha, and then road pugena bhanera ghar bhatkauchau hami nepali haru.  I'm not saying we shouldn't buy vehicles, but there are definitely other solutions towards the same problem.

He is no different than the current leaders, EGOTISTICAL to the core.|||The idea is right, but the implementation, the way of dealing is terrible. Nepalese people are innocent, they seek help, empathy and trust from people. Yehi nagari mahanagar police (who nowadays under Balen think they are something kinda great), could have assured them first. The words matter , little gestures matter in Nepalese society. They are working for their living for their family. Maybe be little less harsh, a little bit more polite, show them assurances and do. Nepal has always been a country with a lot of empathy among people. Let it not die in the name of doing these things.   Everything revolves back. These netas had looted country for entire decades and more and the time showed them the place. That will comeback to these people too.|||mayor hunda ta esto xa. pradhanmantri banyo bhane ta kk garla. sabaiko uthibas lagaunxa|||People are commenting, the vendors were warned beforehand, and this is what happens when they don't listen. For those vendors, pushing their stalls on that street is literally how they make a living and feed their children. This needs to be removed, yes, but they should be provided with proper management and alternatives. You can't just tell them to leave immediately and expect them to know what to do starting tomorrow. This situation absolutely warrants criticism. As the op said, The post isnt meant to be 'antiBalen.' Criticizing something doesn't mean you're speaking against a person or just venting anger.   On another note, even if Balen is doing a good job (he did some) where exactly is Kathmandu's annual budget going? I know there are some visible changes happening in the city, but I still haven't seen any significant, new transformation compared to the past. I understand that rapid change or development is unrealistic, but it genuinely seems like the entire budget isn't being utilized effectively.

            "heading": "RSP should dismantle themselves as a party now?",
            "body": "This made me wonder: if people really hate an unproven and untested party like RSP, should they just dismantle themselves and let another new party rise? But the negative side is that people might lose faith in *any* new party, thinking it will end up like RSP. Members who left their old parties for RSP would feel betrayed and angry, and eventually return to Congress or UML. Aunties and uncles would go back to apologizing to their local committees and rejoin. This cycle would discourage people from voting for new alternatives, leaving us stuck with the old parties again.  # “But I don’t like Rabi, even if I have a soft corner for RSP?”  That’s fair. Many people dislike Rabi because they only follow politics at a surface level through headlines, where he’s often portrayed negatively. And that’s okay — you don’t have to like him. I’m not here to advocate for Rabi, but those of us who follow politics more deeply understand what actually happened.  Here’s another way to think about it: even if you hate Rabi, instead of him using us, we can use him. He is the most targeted politician by all three parties — Oli and Lekhak are his biggest enemies, and Gagan is his rival. If we let Rabi fight that battle, he takes the hits instead of us. With all media and political attacks focused on Rabi, leaders like Balen will face less pressure. Rabi may not be perfect, but he can lead this fight.  On the other side, RSP has many fresh, energetic faces. If we support them, more capable leaders will join, and competition among skilled people will increase. Over time, Rabi may even become irrelevant as a new leader emerges to head the party.  RSP has already built grassroots networks, which is very important to reach people outside of social media — daily laborers, older folks, and those who don’t understand hashtags but listen to trusted local figures convincing them to vote RSP.  This is basically for those who don’t want the old parties to return, and who are confused about RSP, Balen, and independent supporters.  From being just a well-wisher to becoming a supporter of RSP, there’s actually a story behind it. When the party was first formed, I expected Rabi to bring in people like Jwala, Ramesh Prasai, Krishna Kandel, and Punya Gautam. Still, I wished them well because at least a new alternative was being formed by a popular face, which could create momentum for change.  By the time of the election, to be honest, I didn’t know any of their candidates. I only came to know about Toshima after a controversy during her campaign. For the rest, I had no idea who they were — just random names. Even Shishir, Sumana, and Biraj were unknown to me at that time. I only learned about them after they won. But I was genuinely happy that RSP won seven seats and gave tough competition in many places.  This was surprising for me. For example, in Butwal where I live, no one even knew the RSP candidate, but people still voted RSP just because it was Rabi dai’s party. Bishnu Paudel only won luckily by about 1,000 votes. Similarly in Dharan, Goma Tamang from RSP lost to Ashok Rai, backed by UML, by just a few hundred votes. This wasn’t just in Dharan or Butwal — in Pokhara too, RSP was leading at first but eventually UML’s Bidhya won. The same thing happened with Binod Chaudhary and Shekhar Koirala in Nawalparasi.  The way RSP was collecting votes and even leading in many places surprised not only me but also many senior politicians. In response to this, Rabi said: *“Now no one can underestimate or undervalue us.”* That statement caught my attention even more, and I started researching the RSP MPs. I found they were well-educated, respected people — not just TikTok/YouTube influencers. Rabi successfully brought talented people into politics by convincing them. Candidates like Sumana and Arnico joined because of his effort, and Swarnim Wagle became their biggest milestone, drawing even more public attention.  # Rise  Then came the by-elections in Chitwan, Tanahun, and Parsa — partly due to Rabi’s citizenship issue. These elections got nationwide attention, probably the first time by-elections had reached that level. Every party took it personally. Even Gagan Thapa, who once had a soft corner for RSP, started opposing them because RSP was taking away his limelight. The move of Swarnim Wagle from Congress to RSP was another big blow for Congress.  Old parties tried everything to defame Rabi, including scandals like NID and Dhaka Kumar. Still, RSP won 2 out of 3 seats, and Rabi himself won with more votes than before. This made the old parties nervous and defensive. Many supporters started leaving their old parties and joining RSP. The trend was different: had there been a national election, RSP might have won a majority.  # “Dhakka” (Setback)  Then came the Ilam by-election, where RSP lost badly. They had grown overconfident from earlier results but couldn’t generate the same hype. Reasons included the strong legacy of Subash Nembang and RSP being part of a government they once criticized, which weakened their agenda. This loss gave them a lesson: they needed more action and stronger grassroots organizations.  # “Recovery”  When Rabi became Home Minister and pushed anti-corruption efforts, cases like Bhutani, Tikapur Jagga, Shiroiya Nagarikta, Bansbari Jutta, and Scout Kanda were reopened. Congress got aggressive because influential leaders like Arzu, Binod Chaudhary, and Deepak Khadka were at risk of being investigated.  As RSP’s popularity grew, the government eventually changed and Rabi was jailed over the cooperative fraud case. But people still supported RSP because they saw what was happening. This was clear from the signature campaign, where over 4 million people signed in support of Rabi.  RSP then shifted its focus to building local-level organizations. More people joined, and everyone started waiting for the 2084 election. But now, with the Gen Z protests, elections are coming in 2082 instead. Meanwhile, RSP is receiving criticism from all sides — media, the three major parties, and even from Balen + Gen Z groups.",

We actually need to co operate to remove old politician. Rsp and gen z group need to team up to at least make government through collation. If we lost this chance we will lost value of matrys. I fear corrupt party can make Nepal authorian regime in Nepal.|||RSP has the flaw of being Rabi’s party.  The problem with the previous political system was that it was “tauke loot-tantra run by 3 taukes”.  the problem wasn’t just that there three parties were engaging in corruption with impunity, but also that there were taukes at the top dictating the party’s direction and candidates. this made the system static, feudalistic and resistant to change. no new members could seek to clean up the institutional rot.  RSP has the tauke problem though it’s not corrupt like the 3-taukes. RSP is Rabi’s party. he’s well liked and has done a lot for the country even before his time in politics.   if RSP can stray away from the tauke model by establishing a party vote to choose the leader as well as primaries for elections, it will be miles better than any other alternative in the market.   what plagues RSP is also that it’s just Rabi’s party. it doesn’t have an ideology—a clear political manifesto that sets them apart form others—they have no parliamentary goals or a unified vision to lead the country in a certain direction. it’s direction almost seems to be what Rabi says or that it’s a disparate group of capable people garnering votes using Rabi’s name.  the best best  for the country is if RSP and Balen/Sumana/New movement party form a pre-election coalition to not contest the same areas as to not split votes. i think they need to be strategic about this as to not set a precedent of running elections as a coalition. some constituencies that are sure wins like KTM valley and cities should have contested elections but the more rural areas with deeply rooted party fealty should be dealt with more tactically.|||I haven't seen anyone following politics for some time criticize Rabi.

Just bcz few thousands of these people (keyboard warriors) hate RSP doesn't mean RSP should step back.

Maybe not dismantle, but change some bits.  Personally, my 3 biggest pain points are  1. (Accountability) The party has become really influential, but it seems like they are using it just to rescue Rabi Lammechane. Instead of focusing on purely defending him, which feels a bit fishy to me. (Almost the same as what's happening in Congress and UML trying to protect their leader instead of leading change) they need to think about the 5 maaghs they put out  which is great imo which should be priortized and be the main agenda.  2. (Integrity) They should at least change their name and remove \"swatantra\" as it is sooo unfair for legit independent candidates. They certenly did jump on the Balen/swatantra bandwagon in the past election, and Rabi did do unnecessary stunts during the sept 9 chaos. I personally think they should absolutely remove \"swatantra\" from their name because it makes no sense now.  3. (Transpirancy) The way they booted mukul dhakal and made such an environment that made sumana leave does not give me good confidence on this party right now they really need to change things to get me to support them back. The media trial they have been doing is similar to how congress mobilised media houses in the past. Mukul and Sumana were in top positions within the party, and their exit from the party shows it is purely rabi-centric and also hints that their \"core team\" is real.   They really need to game up, and they will be big player in the future now, but they need to work on accountability, integrity, and transparency. Otherwise, they will follow the same path like older parties.  TBH the some of the good changes we got today RSP has great contribution to it. However, there is room to improve and should improve.||| I have no grievance with ravi. Just answer me this why is the party logo and name is exactly like American party ?

Parents usually raise their children in their own image, and have a deep rooted psychological ownership towards the child. The child grows up with the ownership rooted in them too. This system of owning human beings is creating half(and im being conservative in asserting this, its probably more), of the mental health problems out there.   Id encourage you to look at what is, and respond to it. You dont own your niece, but you can care for your neice. Caring for someone else is the only way to feel good about yourself on a deeper level. In a way it is an opportunity to exercise your virtue of being a human( morality, responsibility and dignity). Do it not because she is related to you ( this again will be rooted in ownership and will create conflicts in you), not for your sister but Do it because you are a human being that cares about another human being. Do it not to gain something out of it. When you actually care about the living thing infront of you,then and only then you will actually gain enormous insight into what \"life \" and \"living \" is.  Do not do it for anyone else, you are not taking anyone else's burden: you are doing it because deep down you know it is the right thing to do.

They usually face three not so great options:  1. Try to quickly meet people’s expectations which is super hard and expensive.   2. Point fingers and blame someone else for the problems.   3. Shut down anyone who speaks out.    Most leaders end up mixing all three.  The tricky part is, if the gap between what people expect and what they actually get stays too wide, people lose patience and that can lead to protests, coups, or even another revolution. So, to buy time or grab more control, leaders often go for scapegoats. And those scapegoats can be anyone inside the country or outside it.  The real solution is to build trust by showing small but real progress, instead of just blaming or silencing.",

Are you sure you would want to do farming full time as a job/career? If you think you have a vision and can achieve a fulfilling life then sure why not, but you probably should talk to some experts and get an idea of what it entails. Or shadow someone in the business closely first.  Also if you really want to leave tech then you can choose any field I am assuming youre still young - be it farming or some other thing. If you feel you dont have enough experience to pull yourself a job at this point or just the market is saturated, try specializing in something in tech? like AI/ML? Data? then apply for jobs. It could be online certs or a short term degree (esp if you want to do in overseas.) Remember inexperience is much as an opportunity to learn/explore  more.

The best investment I see as of right now is cold storage for fruits and vegetables. There are enough farmers who will work to produce but the hardship for them has been for timely rearing and storage during the season so this can be offloaded into the market during off season. This is how off season fruits are made available even during off season abroad. This concept is relatively new to Nepal, if you move into this market first, you will have competitive edge.

This isn't just about a bad interview, it feels like a deliberate strategy to exploit job seekers for free labor.  I went through **multiple** rounds of interviews over several weeks. Everything seemed promising. The conversations were positive, and they talked about a great fit for their team. Then came the \"final\" task: to design a comprehensive digital marketing campaign.  I spent days on this. I researched their brands, analysed their competitors, and built out a full strategy, complete with campaign ideas, target audiences, content plans, and performance metrics. I treated it like a real, paid project because I genuinely wanted the job and to show my capabilities.  I submitted the work, feeling confident. Then... nothing. Total radio silence. I followed up, but no response. The most infuriating part? The reason given was a flimsy, nonsensical excuse that had nothing to do with the work I submitted.  This isn't an isolated incident. I've heard from others who have gone through the exact same process with them. They get you to design a full campaign, which they can then use or adapt, and then they ghost you or reject you on some silly pretext. It's a blatant exploitation of job seekers' time and skills.  If you're a digital marketer in Nepal and you're considering applying to IMS Group, be warned. This is not a legitimate hiring process. It's a fishing expedition for free campaign ideas. Save your time and your work for a company that respects candidates and values their professional effort.  They were still hiring 2 days ago and I gave the interview 3 months ago.",

            "body": "About fifteen years ago, many of us spent hours enjoying games on our Nokia keypad phones or other classic devices running Symbian OS (though brands like Samsung and Motorola were around, Nokia often ruled the roost!). We either frantically search the web for games or head to an electronics shop and ask, \"Dai Dai yesma(sd card) game haldinuna?\" before loading a ton of them onto our SD cards.  However, a major hassle was finding a game that actually matched our phone's screen resolution. Some games were half screen, some were overly zoomed, and the ones that fit perfectly often turned out to be, well, not so great. Despite the screen struggles, those original Java games were special many were unique, story focused, and almost entirely ad-free (Ads here, Ads there, Ads everywhere. We need nokia legacy back).  Recently, the nostalgia hit me hard, and I desperately wanted to replay them. The irony? I had exchange my old phones years ago (for indestructible chiya khaney glass that can survive metoriod strike and last for eternity). My other devices were either lost or simply not working anymore. I started searching the internet and found a great way to play these classic Symbian/Java games on Android. I am only going to share the first method because the other couple of methods I tried were quite laggy.  Some of you might already know this trick, but for others (like me until recently) who are still wondering how to play these games like back, this is for you. (Since I have an Android, this method might not work for Apple users).  Method I use:  Using J2ME Loader  Install J2ME Loader: This emulator is free and available on the Google Play Store. Download Your Java Games: Use Google to search for your favorite titles or visit dedicated sites. Some popular options are Dertz, Mobiles24, and Phoneky. Phoneky is my personal favorite because it makes browsing for the exact games you want simple and quick. (NOTE: PLEASE DOWNLOAD GAMES WITH 240×320 SCREEN RESOLUTION ONLY. IT WILL PERFECTLY STRETCH TO YOUR SMARTPHONE SCREEN)  Launch Games Using J2ME Loader:  Open the J2ME Loader app. Tap the \"+\" icon or the \"Add Game\" button. Navigate to the location where you downloaded the .jar file (this is the game file). Select the game to add it to your list in the app. Tap on the game's icon to start playing! (Pro-Tip: You can also go into the settings to configure the key mapping to suit your playing style.)",

In Kathmandu I used to \"eat a lot of cabbage\" I love the taste of \"cabbage\" and it was great. But since I am here, it's hard to know people who are part of the cabbage eating community, it's hard to buy cabbage and since almost everyone here lives with family it's hard to \"eat cabbage\".   Idk if it's just me who has felt it but please let me know if I am alone.   Now here is the plan that I had in mind. I am going to make an app where you can keep your status like, Knows a place - yes/no Can host - yes/no Has \"cabbage\" - yes/no  And two people can text each other based on their location, and these status For eg in someone has cabbage but doesn't have any place to eat he/she can talk with someone that can host or knows a place to eat that cabbage together. This is the bare bone idea so If anyone would like to work with me on this you are welcome. Please leave suggestions.   Also I know \"eating cabbage\" isn't exactly legal so the app can just become a vessel for the blue dress men to catch us innocent cabbage eaters so give e suggestions on how I can avoid that.

First of all, my video was very basic. People indeed clicked the amazon affiliate links. But nobody bought anything. Almost 100 clicks and zero sales. The video lacked a proper story to convince people to buy the books.  I asked to myself, \"If I were to base off my purchase decision from this video, would I purchase from the affiliate link?\" The clear cut answer was \"No\". That is when I deleted the video. I think making money with affiliate marketing requires huge trust even more than making money with selling your own digital products.

I don't think any marketing strategy is going to make me want to buy any book from you unless you've actually read the book, found it useful, and it's directly relevant to my needs. One of my hobbies is implementing models from scratch - so if you said you'd implemented VisionTransformer from scratch and this 'book' actually helped you implement OOP best practices and vectorization and you had the competence to explain how exactly it helped you, I'd buy it.  Problem is- assuming you don't have the skills and experience in that, your marketing efforts in programming would be hit or miss. Same when you're targeting US-based crowd.

Yet they still walk around with inflated egos as if endurance equals masculinity. The truth is, most Nepali men were raised to be useless outside of work — and it shows.  And the funniest part? Even when they move abroad, nothing changes. No hygiene, messy unkempt hair, no dressing sense, and half of them stink like rotten meat. It’s not poverty, it’s pure laziness and lack of self-respect. They’ll happily spend on booze, gadgets, or cars but won’t invest in a haircut, deodorant, or decent clothes or in health.   Maybe the real problem isn’t politics, women, or society — maybe it’s men who never learned how to live like adults. Until Nepali men stop being oversized babies waiting for someone else to clean them up, nothing will change.",

It has a lot to do with society and upbringing. Men are told that even carrying an umbrella in sun is girly and many small things. Like women we have a set of do's and don'ts put up by the society. Complements are a rare occasion in a man's life. A man is never treated as a pretty girl in his life, which helps further explain why they don't put extra effort into themselves. Partly them not taking care of themselves further puts them into this vicious cycle.   In the past and still to this day, women are critised for intellect inferiority. We have created cast discrimination where we exclude them from exposure and education and then blame it on themselves.  To look down on others maybe isn't the solution afterall. We all lack in some aspect and we need to accept. But to blame it on others is easy. Afterall every scar has its own story and the way to improve is to help others than to create a divide. We need to teach men to love, we need to help women in education in high paying jobs, and other lagging communites. Comming together to help each other would  maybe be the way forward.|||People often generalize genders and cultures for emotional release. Not all Nepali men are lazy or unhygienic oversize babies; many do cook, clean, work hard, take care of their families, and succeed abroad as well. Some men may fall short due to their upbringing and personal choices rather than being cursed by Nepali men as a blanket. If your definition of maturity is just basic self-care, perhaps you're undervaluing true responsibility.|||K ho. Dhani bau ko xora date gareu ki khana pakauna najanne?

While women take care of most things like basic hygiene, cooking and cleaning skills and a decent choice of fashion, one important thing they all overlook is maintaining a fit and consequently a healthy lifestyle. This includes the choice of food and exercises. Of course, they know how to cook, but they lack the understanding of what kind of food their body needs. Basic things like consequences of too much sodium in their diets, differentiating healthy fats from unhealthy fats, protein:carbs:fat ratio and so on, we, Nepalese, know nothing about. And this pot belly figure that you mentioned is less a result of drinking alcohol but more related to an unhealthy diet.   I'm not here to shit on women, but both genders.

Even when they move abroad, nothing changes. Can’t drive properly, can’t manage a job without crying about “pressure,” can’t handle time, and still expect to be taken care of like teenagers. It’s not culture, it’s laziness and a refusal to take responsibility. They’ll blow money on facials, handbags, and makeup kits, but won’t invest in education, skills, or health.  Maybe the real problem isn’t politics, men, or society, maybe it’s women who never learned how to live like adults.

Print T-shirts carrying their images and messages  3. Publish booklets or pamphlets with their stories and photos to show the brutality, and circulate them to the public beyond social media  4. Create photo frames of the martyrs and make them available so every household can hang them on their walls as a daily reminder of what this is about  This is really important, truly very important.

            "body": "The country is burning, and Shrinkhala uploaded a 34 minute PR reel. I just finished watching 11 minutes of the 34 long video Shrinkhala Khatiwada uploaded to “explain her silence” and I had to stop, not because I was bored, but because it was painful to watch someone so out of touch, so self-absorbed, and so deep into their own victim complex that they’ve become completely blind to reality. I’m making this post and hoping people don’t fall for the carefully packaged sob story. First off is the immediate red flag that there is zero acknowledgment of her privilege. She talks about having a simple life, and claims her parents worked hard for her and her brother. That they had a house with 3 bedrooms, didn’t have to pay rent, had a good upbringing and she still thinks that counts as simple. And that’s the only privilege she’s ever had. That alone shows how detached she is from what “average” really means in Nepal. She never even briefly reflects on the fact that her father is a powerful politician, and instead, she makes it sound like she built her life from scratch. It’s baffling.  She genuinely believes her name shouldn’t have been dragged into any of the national discourse and says that people were using her name just to get content and she literally says something along the lines of, if people got attention that way, “so be it.” That’s her takeaway. The entire nation is in shambles, people are angry, protesting, waking up to decades of injustice and she still can't look beyond her own image. It's almost unbelievable how someone can watch a country crumble and somehow make it all about themselves. She positions herself as the one being targeted “for no reason” and says she wanted to fight back but was too overwhelmed by people turning against her. Again, not a word about why people might be justifiably critical, just a one-sided narrative of being attacked unfairly.  She says TikTok posts were changing the narrative of her entire life. But does she stop for a second to reflect on why people are questioning her? No. Instead, she keeps doubling down on this idea that she’s misunderstood, and that her critics are just trying to take her down for no reason. There is no realization that being the daughter of a well-known and allegedly corrupt politician is a reason why people hold you accountable especially when you’ve benefitted from that influence. That’s not defamation. That’s public scrutiny. Then comes the part where she calls herself “self-made.” And at that point, I had to pause and ask how? You’re born into a powerful and connected family. You have access to platforms, resources, and networks that most Nepalis can’t even dream of. And yet here you are, trying to claim some underdog story? She goes on to brag about her accomplishments, how she’s made so much money, and how people apparently can’t handle the fact that someone as young as her is so successful. As if that’s why people are questioning her. No, Shrinkhala, people aren’t criticizing you because you’re young and successful. They’re angry because you’re trying to rewrite your origin story while skipping over the very privileges that made your success possible.  She even says she never felt the need to justify herself to anyone before because “satya ko saath cha.” That’s when I realized how deep her delusion runs. She genuinely believes she’s standing on moral high ground, and yet her video is filled with nothing but self-praise, image management, and emotional manipulation. She talks about being “satya” while ignoring every contradiction, every unfulfilled promise, and every instance where she stayed silent when it mattered. Then she says if she doesn’t defend herself, then “the rest of the world will write her narrative.” Again, it’s about her. Not the truth, not justice, not accountability, not the people, but her narrative. The country is collapsing under the weight of corruption, and her priority is that her public image might be misunderstood. She even says her future generations will suffer if she doesn’t clear her image like that’s the greatest injustice here. Not the looted resources, not the betrayed citizens, but her family name. She thanks those who “didn’t unfollow her” and those who supported her privately. That’s her criteria for support which is social media metrics. Then she starts talking about her life story, narrates her autobiography, and once again, takes the opportunity to list her accomplishments and how she was a topper, won design competitions, etc. But does she ever stop to think about why she got those platforms? Does she reflect on how being a politician’s daughter might have given her access others don’t have? Of course not. Instead, she paints herself as someone with a “small-town mindset” while talking about winning designer competitions. How many small-town Nepalis get to do that? There’s such a massive contradiction in her story, and she doesn’t even seem to see it.  She even says “ma maa nai kei kami thiyo hola” and tries to sound reflective, but it’s just another way to victimize herself. As if people criticizing her now are just reinforcing her lifelong feeling of being “not enough.” Then she addresses people who accuse her of not following through on the promises and ideals she expressed during Miss Nepal. And honestly, that criticism is completely valid. If you stood on a national stage making tall claims about development and change, then yes, people will hold you accountable. That’s not trolling. That’s responsibility. And finally, the most absurd part that she says she never had any power. How? You were Miss Nepal and are one of the most followed influencers in the country, daughter of a powerful political figure, a Harvard graduate. And you don’t have power? Then who does? If you truly believe you never had any power to make a difference, then what was the point of all the public positioning, speeches, and social impact projects? That’s not humility. That’s denial.  She tries to play down her travel experiences too. Says that before Miss Nepal, she had only been to India, and that’s “not an achievement,” and that her Hong Kong trip immediately after the pageant was the only international travel till then. Then she brings up her UK trip, saying it was funded by youth, and she didn’t really get to enjoy it because she was only there for work, so apparently, that doesn’t count as privilege either. Every step of the way, she undermines and downplays her privilege, refuses to acknowledge her advantages, and continues to position herself as a victim. And all of this? Is just the first 11 minutes. I honestly couldn’t keep watching. It became clear very quickly that this wasn’t a sincere explanation. It was a 34 minute long PR video just to clear her image, filled with narcissistic reflections, gaslighting, and image control disguised as vulnerability. I really hope people don’t fall for victimized narrative. Please don’t.",

We thought she was genuine, we supported her, and that’s the only reason she ever got those PR packages and brand deals. She’s not “self-made”. We handed her those privileges because we thought she’d actually speak for us. Instead, she hides behind her husband and drops a manipulative video like nothing happened.

The lack of self-reflection and the constant logical fallacies, positioning anyone who challenges her as lacking critical thinking, etc, is not lost on us.

It's deeply emotionally manipulative, lacking an understanding of structural power, and shows us that her platform truly didn't stand up for everything it promised.|||https://preview.redd.it/1cqs8f03d0qf1.jpeg?width=1776&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=413cc01da3d5c52183f54558efa0ab80228da8cb|||💯. She forgot everything until she was ruined. Then everything came back to her.|||Ignoring people like that is the *only* hope. Instead, we should focus on average Joes who have done greater good. Like cleaning garbage on the street or starting a free tuition for street children. We should make heroes of those ordinary people. We should also start questioning our perception of beauty. Why is Shrinkhala Khadka considered *anything*? Is she physically appealing or sexually affable or glamorous? Why should she have *any* followers, to begin with? Then we should start questioning the perception of our 'beauty standard'. Why should only fair skinned, better looking people get millions of followers. It's not going to be easy but we should always question. If we play the same pop culture game and dig deep into how propaganda and algo can be manipulated then we can perhaps start asking questions like the way you have did.   It's not easy because it's a biased platform where heritage money and incumbent power are in bed with the forces of propaganda (e.g. Insta algorithm). Its a hard battle to win.

But still there are comments that support her.|||Well in all fairness, she was never going to turn around and go “yep, I’m embezzling taxpayer funds”  I think the best thing we can do is leave her in the past, not let her have a voice and not support any brands that endorse her.|||Somebody finally said it so beautifully!

But I would watch or hear your complete breakdown of the whole video even if its 1 hour longer.   Great breakdown.

From some brief clips, she went to Harvard? How is that simple, humble or average? Internship of her own studies in Spain?? Good for her. Impressive. But addressing all the accomplishments on what is supposed to be her response? I dont get it.|||Why isn’t anyone asking her this? How much taxes did you pay in 3 crore income? Income at this level is taxed at 39% in Nepal. Don't try to fool us - your income taxes are supposed to be paid by you, not by the brands. I want to see your tax returns. You claimed to be honest and talked about building the country and talked about corporations evading taxes several times in your interviews. Can you show us that you paid income taxes on the money you claimed you earned as an influencer?|||I watched the video too and disagree. Whatever she is, she is not a criminal. There are way worse people than her in Nepal. In my view, arson who damaged the private and public properties are way worse than her and legally criminals. Similarly, there are better faces of nepo babies - the OG nepo baby, the ex-king.  I am saddened that there is no empathy. Literally, her house was burned down by an angry mob. Have some empathy.  Nepal has systematic corruption at every level. Everyone has either given or taken bribes.  There are minimal financial opportunities within Nepal. It makes financially more sense for an honest person to seek employment abroad. By destroying businesses and targeting the elites, the country will witness even less investment. It needs money to create investments for more jobs. Ironic thing was people who protested showed their own corruption by looting private companies - which again legally is a crime.   If I can have empathy for arsons and thieves who destroyed and looted public and private properties, have some empathy for another Nepali who was threatened and attacked viciously online just for being more successful than most people.|||If you guys really think she got what she deserved - having her old parents house.

She won many competitions in school , always an A student , won beauty pageant because she deserved it . Not because she was some politicians daughter. The majority of the people didn’t even know who her father is . It’s easy to blame her , easy to hate her now , but that’s the sad part of brainwashed social media freaks who are on their phones 24-7 . Her point was that she never lived a luxurious life until she was Miss Nepal , because that’s the truth . Weren’t people blaming her for living off tax payers money ? That’s why she is defending it with proof . When the whole nation attacks you , questions your integrity it’s natural to be defensive . I’m not against you or her , I am just saying she is not going to say 100% of what you all wanna hear . She is human , she gave her reason as to the reason why didn’t speak up as she was targeted with so much hate and rape threats. And the privilege you’re talking about , would have probably agreed with you if you were talking about Jayvir guy.  But why aren’t people targeting him as well . Most of the nepokids or so called elite people don’t even know a world outside of Kathmandu , can’t speak fluent Nepali . People connected with Shrinkhala from the beginning because she spoke like one of us , was grounded . And this whole point of not acknowledging her privilege . What part of privilege she used to win Miss Nepal ? Anybody can participate in the pageant - regardless of who your parents are . It’s easy to pinpoint others, especially a public figure , especially a woman public figure , and you know it’s so easy to spread negativity. And at this time when the whole comment section is flown with negative comments about her , you expect her to say all the Right words , sentences - who are you all ? Can you all focus on how better you can be as human beings instead of being so wild in this game ? Haven’t you never made a mistake in your life ? What good are you getting in being so critical of another public figure and expecting her to say all the right things that belongs to your narrative. Nobody is perfect . Time will always reveal the truth . Stop spreading negative. If people wanna like her support her , let them . If you don’t , just stop spreading hate - it only drains you man |||I don't quite know what Gen Z's problem is with Shrinkhala.. we ourselves loved her, we voted for her, we spent our money to send her to international platforms, we cheered for her success. And then she did succeed. She made millions as a result through brands, sponsorships, youtube, etc. If anything she is a smart business woman who capitalized her fame into actual money. Then she got married to the son of Kantipur. She goes on expensive foreign trips with him. She is the daughter-in-law of the most influential media company.  What is really our problem with her? What do we want from her? Are we jealous she became rich and famous? Are we mad at her because both her parents are CPN UML politicians? Are we mad at her for marrying with a rich guy? Are we mad at her because she carried around an expensive label bag? Are we mad at her because she did not single handedly end corruption like she said she wanted to 10 years back in a fucking beauty pageant? What do you want Shrinkhala to tell the world? Yes she is privileged? Yes she married into a well-off family? Yes she went to Harvard?   What is it really? We need to be really clear about these conversations first before dragging someone down.|||Enough has been said about this girl. Let's close this chapter, ignore and move on.|||Not a single shred of self-realization and the level of denial of privilege is just whole another level.

She used to go around Harvard telling everyone that she received a prestigious Nepal government scholarship to fund her education. She lied about receiving the scholarship s she can appear smart amongst other students who got there on their own merit. She kept quiet for a long time when Nepali people asked her about her educational expenses. Now, all of a sudden, she is claiming she funded it with her own influencer money. ",

Then, randomly some months ago saw the same name on social media and him selling his book for helping to build industry or research center.  Then, saw his post about how he will work more for young people so he will get more votes from younger generation if another such vote occurs in the future. I was so impressed by such a positive take by this man.  But today, like many others I got to see the video of his graduation speech on Nebraska University. I searched some more on YouTube and this man has been actively saying nothing but 'my home village' and 'my country Nepal'.  His love for this nation is second to none. Even after how he has been treated by everyone including myself. Even I never bother to search online about him.  Everyone in Nepal like me need to apologize to Dr.Mahabir Pun.  His quote,\"There comes a difficult time, unusual situation that people usually don't need to go through. In that situation it is necessary to have uncommon faith and uncommon approaches to face the uncommon odds of human life.\" from the same video of graduation speech. It will never leave my brain. This man said those words on 2007 and lived by it. His uncommon faith and uncommon approaches has definitely made huge impact on me today. And hoping Nepal will follow his will of uncommon faith and uncommon approaches to face the uncommon odds of human life.  This is not a time to be wasting on excel sheets, Facebook status, conspiracy theories and on egocentric people. We won't get any better person than him to lead the change on his sector.   We've hit the jackpot with him. Let him work or cook as they say it on social media.",

They are just normal people who don't want to see more unemployment and rising prices due to an influx of people. The blame, however, should go directly to the bureaucrats and the big businesses of Australia who are exploiting the immigrants and its laws by hiring cheap wages.|||I am Australian and play tennis with some wonderful Nepalis.

Much love to you all Aussies too.|||Appreciate it mate|||Can y'all please recommend your fav momo place? I need to update my list.|||Thanks for your kind appreciation. Let me tell you our Nepalese perspective.  As a Nepalese, it's really tough for us to enter Australia, first you must pass at least high school with good marks, then get a really good English test score, then you must show a significant bank balance, so your immigration policy is already filtering only the best people from other countries.   I am a Engineer myself, it's relatively easy for someone like me to immegrate to Australia, but for students of other field, you're immigration policy already make sure only the best students come in your country, and it should be that way to be honest.   Regarding your immigration issue, well I believe any country should only allow immigration if there is net positive for the country, you don't want a bunch of liabilities to come in your country, right??  So, just look at the data, you can very easily find out what communities are contributing to Australia, and what communities are hampering the country, and simply adjust the policies that way, it's really that simple.   Regarding recent protests against Immigration, well I think that's just the coverup done by the rich and elites to brainwash common Aussies so that the blame is shifted towards immigration when in fact Australia has the best immigration compared to many Western countries.   My cousin recently returned back to Nepal, they lived in Melbourne for almost 10 years, they shared the economy isn't doing great compared to past years, and the blame is being shifted solely towards immigration.|||U will be welcomed here in Nepal.

From my point of view – and from any fair-dinkum Aussie – you’re more than welcome here. Nepalese folks add heaps of value to this country, and I hope that continues.

They will come back and try to do everything possible to regain their power.   Instead of being discouraged by their appearance we can get ourselves involved in more and more constructive dialogue and create a scenario where they will not be back again from the next election. Engage in political debate. Spread words. More intellectual discuss will help create a \"vibe\" when they will find hard to regain power. We can never demand so and so person or party should not participate in election or use their constitutional rights. So them trying to resurface and whitewash their image is normal.

Let's continue this discourse and may be, just may be, we can tip the society as a whole towards a future without the \"musical chair\".

Yet, even after all this time, I still carry deep respect and pride for the land I came from. But watching this horrific video of a mob savagely beating an elderly man and his wife left me utterly speechless. Regardless of what the couple may have been involved in or accused of, nothing justifies such cruelty.  I thought Nepali men were the descendants of the brave Gurkhas—warriors respected and admired worldwide for their courage and honor. Instead, I saw a man sucker punch a woman who wasn’t even facing him. That wasn’t bravery—it was pure cowardice. And the chaos that followed—hundreds of people raiding and looting their home under the excuse of “justice”—wasn’t justice at all. That mob was just as corrupt and criminally responsible as the very people they claimed to oppose. They were not upholding the law; they were exploiting the breakdown of law and order to terrorize and humiliate helpless individuals.  But this rot doesn’t stop with the mob. The government, too, is guilty. Innocent children were killed during the protests, yet there has been no true accountability. Those in power—the Prime Minister, the Home Minister, and the security forces—bear responsibility for those heinous crimes. They were entrusted with protecting the people, but instead, they used their authority to spill the blood of innocents.  So when I look at this situation, I see two sides of the same coin: mobs acting as judge, jury, and executioner in the streets, and leaders hiding behind power while allowing or even enabling violence against their own citizens. Both are forms of terrorism, both have destroyed public trust, and both have crippled the very soul of Nepal.  And if this mob truly represents the next generation—if this is the standard of “justice” that today’s youth believe in—then Nepal’s future is not just uncertain, it is in grave danger. Because a society that celebrates cowardice, looting, and lawlessness, while a government escapes accountability for killing its own children, is a society heading toward doom.|||Maile paila post garya ho, yo bare  https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/s/okOHZ5elMo|||https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/s/okOHZ5elMo|||It's not going to change in one day.

            "body": "In Nepal, there’s a huge trend of young people trying to go abroad. Most of my friends from Class 10 and 12 already left. But when I talk to them, many don’t sound happy they’re working nonstop just to survive and cover tuition fees.  I chose differently. I stayed in Nepal. Since Class 12, I’ve been financially independent. I invested in NEPSE, paid for my own bachelor’s admission, and worked full-time (40 hrs/week) while balancing a day college schedule. It was tough, but manageable. Whenever I felt burned out, I’d take a break and go trekking or visit lakes with friends.  Now I’m in my final year, working remotely for a US company with good pay, and planning to launch my own startup soon. Looking back, I don’t regret my decision at all. Unless I’m forced to leave, I don’t see myself going abroad.  **My question is:** For those of you who did go abroad or decided to stay how do you feel about your decision now? Is going abroad worth all the hype?",

The culture and people are nice but you will always be pigeonholed here. Experiencing new culture, being self independent and the journey could be rewarding.   However, it all depends on your financial background, your skillset and courage to step into the world that is full of surprises. Not easy but you never know.|||Many people go to different parts of the world because they want to explore other countries and wish to be independent from their family and societal norms. It is not just about good pay. Yeah, the struggle may be much greater, but it is their life, and not everyone wants the same perspective in life.|||I'm so proud of you. My parents left Nepal when I was too young to make a decision, and I followed them. But the feeling of being back home is unmatched. I have been to many countries throughout the years, made many successes in my career, but nothing matches the feeling of walking in Boudha in the evening...or racing to see a sunset on Poon Hill.   Congratulations on your successes. I hope your life continues to be very rich in experiences and opportunity.|||This kind of post rubs me the wrong way a bit because it feels like you’re trying to position yourself as “smarter” or “better” than the people who went abroad. The reality is that both paths, either staying in Nepal or going abroad, have their own pros and cons, and people choose based on circumstances that are often very different from yours.  You mention being financially independent, investing early, and balancing work with studies. That’s impressive, but it’s also a privilege many don’t have. Plenty of sons and daughters in Nepal are grinding just to pay off family debts or keep their households afloat. For them, going abroad isn’t about “hype” but it’s about survival, opportunity, or helping their families. Even the ability to invest in NEPSE in the first place points to a cleaner starting slate than what a lot of others face.  And while you thrived staying in Nepal, not everyone has that option. Families who send their kids abroad are often taking huge risks and sacrifices, sometimes from already fragile financial situations. Even if someone goes abroad and struggles at first, starting from zero (or even from debt) can eventually set them up for long-term security that wouldn’t be possible back home.  So yes, it’s great that you’re making it work in Nepal, but framing it in a way that hints at looking down on people who go abroad ignores the complexity of their decisions and struggles.|||Simple answer for you it is not same for every one.|||I knew a guy like you who didn't go abroad when he was 22.

I didn't want to leave too but had a lots of failure and lacking economic support lead ultimately to go out. I miss my country more than anything. I wish you all the best.  Going abroad was definitely worth it for me. Specially during covid, I could atleast support economically. We literally were able to save my FIL by pushing money to the hospital. Few lakhs is not a big problem for me so I always have that assurance that I can take care of my family if needed. I am also less worried about kids, as they will have better opportunity for everything. Government supports health and education, and only fooding and clothing them is what I have to worry about. They also have opportunity to grow in a better society free from caste and religion based nonsense so they can actually focus on things that matter. Its much easier for them to travel anywhere in the world because the passport is much stronger. So overall I can take care of my parents and give a better start to my kids, which makes me content.

Even if it's just about money, I have friends who have amassed more in 5 years working here in US as a software engineer than we'd have in Nepal whole life - more than enough to comfortably retire back home.

I have friends whose primary factor was to lead a life distant from the toxicity of their family.  I have seen people pursue hobbies far beyond what Nepal could offer.   I have seen people move just to give their children better education.  There are a host of reasons. And you could debate each one individually, but it's all subjective anyway. For many including myself, it's a mix of reasons.

I managed my finances, got two degrees, and lived a modest life. I climbed the ladder swiftly, but then hit a peak.   I anticipated rapid economic regression in Nepal, so I decided to leave the country. I am pursuing my third degree, in a subject that I absolutely love in the US.

I left Nepal when I was way past my teenage years. Even though I am not as happy or rather don't have peaceful mind as I would hope for, my decision to leave Nepal was a good call! I should have left Nepal a few years before I eventually did.   Going abroad is definitely good and I suggest everyone to do so once in their life time; however, how long to stay is up for debate. I would rather emphasize on THE purpose. I left Nepal because I couldn't stand to live in Nepal. I am poorer than the most of my old friends who stayed in Nepal. Spiritually and mentally, I am as fucked up as before, which was something I thought I would get over by moving abroad.       However, I have a hope and \"I can do\" mentality. I HIGHLY appreciate the way I think these days mixed with whatever I had learned back in Nepal and the new things in this new environment. I wouldn't give this away for any price! (well a few million dollars might do the trick :D )      Thing is, we tend to have this bias that the things that are familiar to us and we identify with always seem better and superior to others. One should come out of it to see how things actually are. Hence, staying abroad is a must! It provides options and more importantly new perspectives on everything!|||Oh my god, so much hate here. “ not everyone is like you “ , “ you are lucky “  What a bunch of bullshit.

If i could work in nepal and earn half of what i earn now, my life will still be more luxurious in Nepal.   The only challenge is, one has to be highly skilled. I don’t think i am skilled enough to secure the same kinda role back home but when i am , i will definitely return.  Most Nepalese here do degrading stuff for work. 🤢🤮. The only reason people want to go abroad is that they are not skilled enough and are willing to do anything for money.   Nepal doesn’t have a problem with brain drain, cus people with brains are not the ones going abroad to clean toilets, cus they don’t have to.  The smart ones are able to survive in Nepal.

Such changes takes ages and generations. Look at the current US, Europe and other top civilized countries...they are no different either.

She says Rabi needs to step down as RSP leader because she thinks that the best interest of the party and that's what people/youths want. That's where I think she's misunderstood and wrong.  From genZ upto the aged ones, most of them want Rabi in the leadership. That's why he got the highest number of votes among all leaders in the last election.  What I think is that Sumana saw many youth social media activists, who doesn't know politics and are misinformed and those who doesn't represent the overall youths of Nepal at all, they made video saying \"we don't want Rabi\", \"he's same old, corrupt\" which led to Sumana thinking Rabi isn't wanted by current youths and she need to get out of that party to be the voice of the youths.|||Good going on",

Nepali society as a whole is extremely jealous and vindictive. There were so many people who were not holding any political position who got looted and vandalized. And many big business men’s houses were burnt simply for “supporting political parties”. I don’t think Nepali people understand the support you need to do well in business simply because of the rampant corruption done by government employees.

We had kings and their family to look up to and they delivered more or less. We now know dipendra used drugs but he wasn’t outright morally loose. Now pm became the nation’s ideal and we know they won’t follow the words they speak. After a while general people morality and mentality shifted to the hoodlum.  Today’s young generation is more individualized than we are and have no one to look up to.

Feudal legacy: Until very recently, we had a mostly feudal socio-economic system. With modernization, concepts such as meritocracy and individualism and state-guaranteed human rights came to the fore in the public psyche. Being wealthy in this context basically means you're going to be perceived as someone who's undeserving.  2. Limited philanthropy: Wealthy businesses and individuals rarely invest in public works. If they do, it's a token donation. If it's actually a big sum that really makes tangible impact, the media isn't too keen on spreading the word. As an adjacent point, media can also play a pretty decisive role in inspiring people to engage in wealth generating activities. Our media outlets appear to be forever locked into the sphere of politics and immaterial commentary.  3. Corrupt political class: Let's be real. Most rich people in Nepal are rich because they have somehow benefited from being involved in political (read partisan) affairs voluntarily or otherwise (e.g. most big businesses don't have a choice). This is most especially true for full-time politicians whose actual legitimate source of income is insignificant compared to the amount of wealth they are able to accrue out of seemingly nowhere. This breeds resentment in the minds of the general populace who have no political recourse.  4. Crony communism: This is connected to point 3 above. People have been sold the dream of an egalitarian society for as long as democracy has existed in this country. However, the leaders never deliver anything remotely close to it, instead enriching themselves and their cronies any chance they get - all the while pinning the blame on the bourgeoisie.  These are just the major factors I can think of. So, of course people are going to see the rich and the privileged as the enemy regardless of how they made their fortunes.|||This is such a pathetic video if you look at it from a different perspective. Makes me see the worst of what capitalism could create. A middle class, well to do woman is crying because she fears she won't get to be a rich elite because the lower class people are angry over not getting their basic needs fulfilled because of the stark economic disparity, where there are 1/5th of the people below poverty line and many die of starvation. SHE IS CRYING SHE DOESN'T GET TO BE RICH WHILE PEOPLE ARE DYING EVERYDAY DUE TO LACK OF BASIC NEEDS. Imagine the level of ignorance you have to have to not realize this. Those businesses are doing pretty fine. Bhatbhateni is already in operation. It's the economic disparity that needs to be addressed that made those people act like this.|||It happens in every country. USA ma pani riots ma goods haru chori hunxan.

All this looting and burning happended because of bad and corrupt governance, not bad citizens. Of course many of the affected people did not deserve this. But instead of making the government and the people in power accountable, you are blatantly blaming the people. You, like many, are feeling hopeless since the sept 8.  Thousands of people have been feeling hopeless for their entire lives.  I dont condone what happened on sept 9, but whatever happened did not happen because people are \"envious\" of rich people.   Not just in nepal, but people in USA, UK, Australia are also fed up with powerful and rich people with political influence (many are \"jealous\" of the rich too).

And I say this as a GenZer myself stop saying Nepali people are not lazy. They are not. Look at pictures of Dubai and remember Nepali people had a role in building that a brutal unforgiving merciless role. I really hate this self demeaning attitude of the Nepali mindset.

If the PM is elected directly by the people, it creates a clash between the Prime Minister and the parliament. This can lead to deadlock and instability, especially if the PM and the majority of MPs in parliament are from different parties. On the other hand, a directly elected President is a better option because this system clearly separates powers. The President has a fixed term and does not need parliamentary support to govern, which can provide stronger leadership and greater stability.

There is precedent of parliamentary procedures being bypassed after revolution.  There is a concept called doctorine of revolutionary legality. This is not a first time a revolution has happened and main demands of the revolution are contradictory to the provisions as per supreme law/constitution of that nation.  End of apartheid in South Africa, Independence of India, America these directly contradicted the constitution at that time. Panchayat system made parties illegal in Nepal revolution happened against that and Birendra accepted multiparty democracy. Bolsheviks revolution of Russia and french revolution both were against constitutional provisions of that time. Most revolution that overthrow authoritarian government like Philippines and Arab spring went against the provisions of then constitution.   Sovereignty of people ultimately supercedes constitutional provisions. People themselves are the ultimate source of law. Constitutions themselves can be scrapped if it contradicts popular sovereignty.   That being said the person speaking in the video raises good points and he doesn't seem to be spreading misinformation intentionally its just that the door he thinks are closed are not necessarily closed it is entirely possible that next election will choose directly elected PM but for that president has to support it. The provisions mentioned in the constitution can be bypassed because this is an extraordinary circumstance and legality of ignoring constitutional provision comes from revolution itself it's the will of people.   After election the courts can legitimize it after the fact on basis of doctorine of necessity as those procedure/unconstitutional changes although not allowed as per constitution were the needed to protect sovereignty vested in people and was the demand of people. There is precedent and this has been done.   The big problem there is obviously possible foreign interference.   Another strong point this person makes is that an agreement should have been made. even now with interim PM an agreement summarizing demand and demanded changes can be made that agreement will have legality by revolution.

I am not a constitutional expert and while I agree with part of what he said my question is, if the whole directly elected PM/President bill and the dissolution of state governments require a two-thirds majority in both the Upper and Lower House how would that even be possible? Why would the hon ones ever agree to that?  The voice reached there through the protests so can’t the President directly pass an ordinance or bill to amend these rules? Because the honorable members are never going to do that through the House and that has already become clear at this point. Does that mean the voice from the streets has no value?

            "body": "Warning: This post may come off as outrageous and offensive.    Most Nepali parents, except financially secure ones, are human traffickers and they traffic what they love and cherish the most; THEIR CHILDREN.   Nepali parents push their kids to leave Nepal under the banner of a “better future.” Sure, it can lead to a more secure life, but it’s not the whole truth.  This prejudice eludes parents into FOMO , worried that their child—their future cash cow—might miss the golden ticket to success. In trying to break free from poverty, they end up chaining their children to a new kind of slavery. Some kids walk into it willingly. Most don’t even realize what’s happening until they’re already too deep to turn back.  A few break free with raw talent, hard work, or rare skills. But the rest? They’re stuck grinding in the rat race. Meanwhile the parents gets addicted to their children’s income to sustain the newfound luxury, they could never afford on their own.  While Nepali government stays in the background. Complicit. Systematically rotten.    P.S.: This is a skewed angle of observation. Pardon me.  Edit: Dont assume my personal life. Dont let this post hit home. People reading it and being defensive. Just chill, dont take it personally.   Come on man. Atleast be open minded.  Read it with detachment.   Edit II: I didnt consider the fact that people love to be on their moral high horse.   Also parents are humans and they can succumb to law of human nature especially who are living in survival mode. Stop acting like they’re a perfect beacon of virtue. You can love them better accepting the flaws not ignoring them.   And people preaching “bau ama le etro sacrifice garyo ani hurkayo badhayo..”. So, does that mean your love for parents is transactional? and if they were terrible parents would you not love them or take care of them?",

            "comments": "While I understand the emotions and frustrations that may have inspired the original post, I humbly offer a different lens—one rooted in empathy, context, and lived reality.  In Nepal, many parents encourage their children to seek opportunities abroad not out of greed or exploitation, but out of love and hope. For countless families, this is a sacrifice born of necessity. They send their children away with heavy hearts, praying for a future brighter than the one they themselves endured.  To label these parents as \"human traffickers\" is deeply painful and unfair. It disregards the emotional toll, the cultural values, and the economic hardships that shape such decisions. Yes, the system is flawed. Yes, the government must do more. But to reduce this complex reality to accusations of slavery and addiction to income is to ignore the dignity and struggle of ordinary Nepali families.  Let us not confuse desperation with malice. Let us not judge without walking in their shoes. Instead, let’s advocate for better policies, stronger support systems, and a future where no parent feels forced to choose between love and livelihood.|||[deleted]|||This is next level whining. If you think parents are “human traffickers” and you believe it’s all for their interest, why not leave them and stay somewhere else. You always have the choice of being independent or saying goodbye if someone doesn’t value your vision.|||some parents, when asked why they have children, just proudly reply \"budo bhayesi kasley palcha ta?\"   i am just leaving it here. if you got a bit of anti-natalism out of this, do what you will with it.|||i am so tired of watching parents' obsession with their children's success. you brought theminto this world, so do what you can to raise them well. then just dont expect much from them. my parents are so excessively obsessed with my grades etc. that it hurts. we have never had a parents child talk, always about studies and grades and blah blah. i cannot wait to move out and not give them a single penny lol.|||Honestly, this is a very sick post and undermines the true victims of human trafficking. Please go educate yourself on the effects of human trafficking, how prevalent it is even in today's world and the stories from victims that have \"escaped\". Nepal has been, historically, and even today a hot bed for human traffickers. I do not have the context nor the desire to dive into your family trauma, \"newsflash: most families have them\", but your post is very immature and you should be more conscious about how you think and how you perceive the world.|||Hmm, this is actually very true and valid observation, my father, along with many others have fell for this trap. It doesnt happen only with those going abroad, but with those living in Nepal as well. I have seen it happen to teachers mainly. Majority of the secondary school teachers are a clear victim of such traps as majority of them wanted to do something else, be someone better like an engineer, doctor however since their parents forced them to earn money and not leave the sustainable source of income.   And obviously it happens to the lower manpower as well. Welp, whom can we blame for this though. This is a system, a deeply rooted system/mindset, sickening yet integral.|||View so controversial you had to make an AI write it.  If you had an original thought, at least present it to the world yourself.|||They are not human trafficking, those thave have lived in this country longer know the country better, if they want better life for themselves and their families what's wrong?|||I know many parents, who have given up their dreams and survived on bare minimum just to make sure their children get better life. These parents send their kids abroad in hope that their kids don't suffer as they have suffered. Some even take huge loans just to give their kids education and/ send them abroad. While writing this comment, I remember the video of this one mother crying when the social media banned happened saying \"sarkar ma Mero bachha haru sanga bolna payena vaney marchu\". I don't know what background you come from and I don't want to assume but I know for a fact that the parents just want the best for their kids and being poor, they know suffering better than the people who are well off and they don't want their kids to inherit their suffering.|||Kun insta influnecer ko gideo herera aeu LMAO..|||There is surely some truth to it. In my view the whole family structure we have, lack of education in our household and blindly leading the life causes parents to support the slavery you are describing here. Since parents devote all their life for kids to be able to afford a better education they rationalize the kids should be supporting them or their aspirations. While most Nepalese parents are just parents and poor people, they are definitely struggling with basic stuff and it’s humane for a kid to help them. However to kids I suggest them to do it in moderation and make sure they are not doing a lot and making their own life tougher. Please break the chains but with love, patience, kindness and courage|||Ya Sara sansar ko bacha bidesh kamauna garisakyo ta yeta I used to get this a lot when I didn’t get a job, but it continued even after I finally got one with an okay salary.

            "body": "My house was vandalized in the name of \"Gen z protest.\" My dad is a civil servant, and we live in a humble 3 story house (the third story was only recently built). It was a small house when we moved in, which was 17 years ago— few months after I was born.   After working for over 25+ years for the government, this country, and its public, my dad still has a very clear history. No bribery, no corruption, no money laundering— nothing. Rising high in status and the post, he is recognized for his diligent work and highly stable work ethic.  Now, back to the present. The protestors had reached our house. I had once thought, why would anyone target our house? It's a civil servant, not some minister or anything of that sort. My father rose high due to his hard work and competitiveness, not any connection or bribery. We can all see from how my parents lived rental first (he was already a civil servant then). Only after a few months of me being born did they buy a house, not without taking loans.  I don't know why it happened because our house was aba and definitely not supposed to be a part of whatever that was. The protestors were going to burn our house, but because of it being attached to other houses, the neighbours finally calmed them down into not burning our house. Instead, they burned our bikes, went into our house, and threw things out to burn them. What's worse? When the protestors left, all the people living nearby, went in and out for 2 days straight— morning, day and night, pickng whatever things they liked amd taking it home with them as if our house was some kind of thrift store giving away our stuff for free.  We were at our relative's house, and when we saw all the black smoke coming from the direction of our house, we were devastated. \"Our house got burnt.\" That's what we thought. As i was the oldest child in the family, i couldn't let myself break down. I can still hear those devastating gut-wrenching cries and sobs from my mom, haunting me like a ghost every time i close my eyes.   I am a college student. My uniform is gone, and so are my books and copies. My sister is in middle school. Her uniform and books and copies are nowhere to be found as well.   Our money and jewelries, of course, are gone too. The same money my father earned and mind you, a civil servant's earnings isn't much. Only enough to label us as a middle-class family. The same money my sister sent us, her hard-working money(which was in dollars at that).  Our clothes, bags, and even utensils are gone, and so are our food storage(stuff). My mom is someone who saves money. However, she can just like my dad because she knows she has experienced the hardships with my dad. Because they know. Because they have experienced hardships and complications in their life. Because they have faced obstacles.  We have never wore any designers, no luxury fashion brand. All are affordable and comfortable. The only designer my mom and dad ever even had is when my big sister from abroad visited us and surprised us with some designer bags (which she also got scolded for spending so much because she is still studying and working in between only).  Our guests'clothes, laptops, phones, everything is gone. Me and my sisters' savings and my mom's little spending for managing our household— nothing is left. Not even our puja ko thaan(a small place we had to worship and pray gods).   We have tons of debts. I am old enough to learn that by now. Now that our house was totally and utterly robbed and vandalized while my dad kept on working for the same public, we have nowhere to sleep on. No clothes to wear. There is no place to shower or bathe.  We had to hide away from our own house we once called home to keep ourselves alive. My father was lucky enough to be safe because if it was even a few seconds late, it would have all been over. We were fortunate to be alive, even though we had done nothing wrong to people.  Morality? Humanity? Conscience? Guilt? Remorse? None. The same people, the same public, that my dad is working so hard to serve with his whole heart, has done this to him, to his family.  Gen z, huh? Protest against corruption, huh? My dad, having the cleanest history— no corruption, bribery, connection, whatsoever. So why our house? Why? What had we ever done to them? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.   I have no hope left. None for this country, none for the people of this country. This is now a country full of robbers and thieves. Humans are jealous. Humans are greedy. People are full of themselves, full of greediness and selfishness. In my heart, humans are creatures who have ruined any hope for more in me and my family. My father, who once poured his heart for this country and the people in this country, is on the verge of giving up on it.  You people, opportunists, and robbers who call yourselves voice of justice— I'll be watching, watching who you are going to tame to pull this country back together. People like my dad who are so wronged will be out of all this mess soon, Who are you going to pull to patch this broken country? I'll be watching. I'll be happily watching everything crumble and fall apart with your \"justice.\" You have given the opportunists a sense of win. You've let them think anything is possible, and now, everything will fall apart while you watch everything crumble in front of your eyes.  Lastly, I'd like to be a little vulgar and uncensored. If you are uncomfortable, scroll away.  Whoever has participated in vandalizing my house and robbing it empty— You are going to see hell and worse. I hope you feel yourself rotting away. I hope you don't think it's over now because whatever you stole, it will haunt you for the rest of your life and afterwards. I will forever haunt you, even in your dreams, converting it into a disastrous nightmare. You'll see hell. You are going to suffer.",

Gen Z cannot ignore the fact that others died in fires, or that people were looted and harmed during the unrest. It’s easy to say the movement was hijacked by goons, but the videos and reports show some protesters themselves vandalizing property and stealing from people who had nothing to do with the issue. Ironically, those who stood up against corruption ended up damaging the lives and livelihoods of ordinary citizens. They should have taken more responsibility, like that young girl with her younger brother who was blocking the protestors from vandalising the mall.  My heart goes out to you for your loss. Please know you and your family are welcome to stay with us until you find a place to rebuild. Destiny will open new doors for you. Your family will rise again and rebuild everything you’ve lost. Wishing you strength, courage, and healing🙏|||manabta harayeko desh ma yestai ho aaile ko manxe haru sabai kura ko access ma xan everything khae kina ho same time ma kasaile le ke gareko dekhna na sakni vako manxe haru  stay strong ani main kura k vanda never trust anyone family member ( baba mami dai ddi vai baini aama buwa) vanda aru  kina ko sabai opportunist ra daha garne matra xan  feri uthnexau timi ra timro pariwar जलाउने लाई के थाहा जल्ने को पिडा।|||Any CCTV footage?

Aafno garne kei aaukat chhaina, budhi chhaina, tesaile everyone who's more successful than them is automatically corrupt.  No one cares about justice or doing the right thing. Euta le aayera \"yo manchhe corrupt ho\" bhanyo bhane, sab le dhunga hanne, aago lagaune suru gari halchhan. It doesn't matter who that person is, or if they've even done something bad.  Yo sub ma ni I've been reading a lot of posts and \"Gen Z\" is no different. They're celebrating the lack of law and order for different reasons. The people celebrating it won't realize that even though their homes are safe today, there's no guarantee it'll stay safe - all it takes is some random person claiming you're corrupt and start throwing rocks for others to follow suit.

I can tell you, they were criminals. Not GenZ. If I were you I would have  tried to find out who did it, be it with a handheld or surveillance  camera or something, then put each in jail one by one or tell to compensate. Those days were literal anarchy. And even shopkeepers etc were robbed .   That was the sad part of GenZ protest. for a while the country became total anarchy. I feel lucky I survived that day, although I have no relation with politics or civil service.  Criminals took the advantage. May be police or forensic experts, I dont know should do proper investigation, find the criminals, put them in jail.   Bottom line: You and your family were victim of criminals who used the Genz protest as a pretext to loot, theft and vandalism.|||Yo aago lagaune haru were savage mobs with criminal mentality.

I stood against violence, yet these people, boys and girls who enjoy burning houses and spreading chaos, are still among us. The moment I condemn their brutality, they rush to label me as “jholay,” as if that insult could erase their own guilt. Their selective outrage is sickening. And now, when things are finally settling down, looking back in retrospect, it is clear that we failed as a society. We do not deserve good leaders when, at the first sign of crisis, we loot, we vandalize, we burn homes, and then pretend we are pure. I am disgusted and angry at those who glorify violence and betray even the most basic sense of humanity.|||I remember reading a post asking folks to expose corrupt civil servants who are using \"iphone\" and having a home in Kathmandu.  Anyone with any remote success is either corrupt, Bideshi dalal, Raw ko agent, Yasu pracharak, or something like that. Hallai halla ko desh ho yo.

Using mainly just the 17% of the land (Terai) to feed the entire population is a problem in making.   Yes, I know we also farm in hills but it was an expression. Westerners use all that fancy technologies such as combines and auto-harvesters while majority of Nepalese hilly areas still rely on bulls and cows or not even those at all.   Could we make a small compact motor that a farmer dai can sling on his back and carry all the way up to a terrace, unload it and start farming and tilling the soil with it?   Could we make drones that will help spray fertilize the top hard to rich areas so the farmers don't have to go up and down the elevations constantly?   Another technology we desperately need is imo nationalizing 3D printers. I am very inspired by the Big Hero 6 movie where every household has a 3D printer and they can print their own solutions rather than having to go to the store constantly. Make community run 3D printers (like a library, a public property for an entire community) a common sight in Nepal rather than just a strange novelty technology.

            "body": "I need to vent and warn others about IMS Group's incredibly unethical hiring process, specifically for digital marketing roles. This isn't just about a bad interview, it feels like a deliberate strategy to exploit job seekers for free labor.  I went through **multiple** rounds of interviews over several weeks. Everything seemed promising. The conversations were positive, and they talked about a great fit for their team. Then came the \"final\" task: to design a comprehensive digital marketing campaign.  I spent days on this. I researched their brands, analysed their competitors, and built out a full strategy, complete with campaign ideas, target audiences, content plans, and performance metrics. I treated it like a real, paid project because I genuinely wanted the job and to show my capabilities.  I submitted the work, feeling confident. Then... nothing. Total radio silence. I followed up, but no response. The most infuriating part? The reason given was a flimsy, nonsensical excuse that had nothing to do with the work I submitted.  This isn't an isolated incident. I've heard from others who have gone through the exact same process with them. They get you to design a full campaign, which they can then use or adapt, and then they ghost you or reject you on some silly pretext. It's a blatant exploitation of job seekers' time and skills.  If you're a digital marketer in Nepal and you're considering applying to IMS Group, be warned. This is not a legitimate hiring process. It's a fishing expedition for free campaign ideas. Save your time and your work for a company that respects candidates and values their professional effort.  They were still hiring 2 days ago and I gave the interview 3 months ago.",

In the case absent such a request, the festival expense shall be provided at the time of Dashain festival every year.  37(3): A labor who has not completed one year of service period on or before the day of payment of the festival expense shall be entitled to such expense in proportion to the period of service he or she has completed.   दफा ३७: चार्डपर्व खर्च पाउने  ३७(१): आफ्नो धर्म, संस्कृति तथा परम्परा अनुसार मनाइने चाडपर्वको लागि प्रत्येक श्रमिकले खाईपाई आएको एक महिनाको आधारभूत पारिश्रमिक बराबरको रकम प्रत्येक वर्ष चाडपर्व खर्चको रूपमा पाउनेछ ।  ३७(२): उपदफा (१) बमोजिमको चाडपर्व खर्च श्रमिकले एक आर्थिक वर्षमा एकपटक आफ्नो धर्म, संस्कृति, परम्परा अनुसार मनाइने मुख्य चाडपर्वको अवसरमा भुक्तानी लिन रोजगारदाता समक्ष लिखित अनुरोध गर्न सक्नेछ । त्यस्तो अनुरोध नगरेको अवस्थामा प्रत्येक वर्षको बडादशैंमा चाडपर्व खर्च भुक्तानी दिनु पर्नेछ ।  ३७(३): चाडपर्व खर्च भुक्तानी दिइने दिनसम्ममा एक वर्ष सेवा अवधि पूरा नभएको श्रमिकले निजले गरेको सेवा अवधिको अनुपातमा चाडपर्व खर्च पाउनेछ ।|||Yes it should be but muji conpany le regular monthy salary nai deko chaina.

Company/employee performance base ma chai company profit bonus ho dine which is not mandatory and depends on the prodfit.|||Even if you haven’t completed full year, the company should give as per the months you have worked well at least the companies I worked for used to give tesari but Nepal ko companies haru ali chor cha so na dina ni ber chaina|||Hamro ma chai 1 year complete vaye pachi matra paucha 1 month ko basic salary|||Yes it's mandatory as per Nepal Labor Act. All organizations must follow this rule else they will be fined and held liable. If your organization or others are not providing festival bonus, you can file a official complaint. Not sure how to do that but I am sure you can get that info very easily.|||It's not a bonus, it's an allowance. Bonus is dependent on company performance, allowance is not. All employees are entitled to the festival allowance. It's not specific to just Dashain and not even called Dashain allowance. If you are not a Hindu or do not celebrate Dashain you can ask the company to provide you the allowance at other times of the year.|||Practically chai  The rationality of giving Dashain bonus is not on projection of years you will work, rather than its on the duration you have worked, so if you have resigned from company and your last day is after festival disbursement, you are eligible to bonus. But if you have your last day before disbursement, sad but company usually don't provide you bonus, this might be due to legal hassle of disbursing after employee is no longer company's employee but anyways it saves company money so they won't. Whereas performance bonus or company bonus or project bonus is different, mostly they are used in reference to each other for disbursement calculation. eg. your performance can be used for calculating how much company's profit bonus you will get, or even for project bonus.  Yes, company do give festival allowance, but they do manage it in optimal way, instead of calling it bonus, they do 13 months of pay coz bonus will deduct flat tax (maybe 25%). With 13 months of pay, you will get it along your yearly tax bracket.  But things might change when employee worked less than 1 year, some company require you to work at least 6 months for any bonus eligibility, some based on number of months worked, some just gives you bonus despite your working month, or some of you can negotiate in advance to get bonus while joining which will override any rule otherwise. So, before you join, make sure you clear this eligibility as this is more based on company.  And some company does this bonus calculation based on basic salary rather than your regular salary, this also needs to be cleared in advance.  My experience so far has been good, it was either based on number of months or full bonus but never had calculation done based on basic salary rather than on regular salary, which I cleared it prior to joining. Also on one company, I did join 3 months prior to Dashain and asked for full bonus during negotiation which they agreed and received accordingly. The reason I put forward was, as I was eligible to Dashain bonus on company which I was leaving, I would either have joining date after Dashain or join earlier and receive bonus.|||Is this only for Nepali companies or foreign branches Nepali company too?|||Yess, dinai parchha.

            "body": "About fifteen years ago, many of us spent hours enjoying games on our Nokia keypad phones or other classic devices running Symbian OS (though brands like Samsung and Motorola were around, Nokia often ruled the roost!). We either frantically search the web for games or head to an electronics shop and ask, \"Dai Dai yesma(sd card) game haldinuna?\" before loading a ton of them onto our SD cards.  However, a major hassle was finding a game that actually matched our phone's screen resolution. Some games were half screen, some were overly zoomed, and the ones that fit perfectly often turned out to be, well, not so great. Despite the screen struggles, those original Java games were special many were unique, story focused, and almost entirely ad-free (Ads here, Ads there, Ads everywhere. We need nokia legacy back).  Recently, the nostalgia hit me hard, and I desperately wanted to replay them. The irony? I had exchange my old phones years ago (for indestructible chiya khaney glass that can survive metoriod strike and last for eternity). My other devices were either lost or simply not working anymore. I started searching the internet and found a great way to play these classic Symbian/Java games on Android. I am only going to share the first method because the other couple of methods I tried were quite laggy.  Some of you might already know this trick, but for others (like me until recently) who are still wondering how to play these games like back, this is for you. (Since I have an Android, this method might not work for Apple users).  Method I use:  Using J2ME Loader  Install J2ME Loader: This emulator is free and available on the Google Play Store. Download Your Java Games: Use Google to search for your favorite titles or visit dedicated sites. Some popular options are Dertz, Mobiles24, and Phoneky. Phoneky is my personal favorite because it makes browsing for the exact games you want simple and quick. (NOTE: PLEASE DOWNLOAD GAMES WITH 240×320 SCREEN RESOLUTION ONLY. IT WILL PERFECTLY STRETCH TO YOUR SMARTPHONE SCREEN)  Launch Games Using J2ME Loader:  Open the J2ME Loader app. Tap the \"+\" icon or the \"Add Game\" button. Navigate to the location where you downloaded the .jar file (this is the game file). Select the game to add it to your list in the app. Tap on the game's icon to start playing! (Pro-Tip: You can also go into the settings to configure the key mapping to suit your playing style.)",

For example, if you’re unhappy with Ncell’s network but don’t want the hassle of updating your number everywhere, you could port it to NTC.  **Benefits of SIM porting:**   - Keep the same number while moving to a better provider   - Choose based on network quality and cheaper plans   - Push telecoms to give better service through real competition    Right now, we face problems when one network provider fails to give proper service. They don’t listen to us, and we have no option but to stay stuck with them.    Many countries already have this system. Nepal has been talking about it for years, but nothing has happened.    We should **pressure the government and regulators** to make it a reality. Number portability protects users, not companies, and it’s time Nepal moved forward with it.",

Make sure Linux goes on the SSD and set it as the first boot option in BIOS. Use GRUB as the bootloader, and I’d recommend Ubuntu or Linux Mint since they’re very beginner friendly. Don’t stress about Linux, it’s pretty easy to get used to, and honestly, once you do, you might not even go back to Window. You can find multiple tutorials on YouTube for Linux installation. Search for \" How to dual boot Windows and (your preferred linux distro)\". You can remove Windows once you are comfortable with Linux, if you want.  3. If you can spend a bit more, upgrade the RAM. Use two sticks of the same size to take advantage of dual channel.  With this setup, you’ll have a solid dual-boot laptop running both Linux and Windows.

            "body": "Context: Back in 2023, I jumped into this \"SEO\" thing for my startup because I thought, “hey, this can’t be that hard.” I just have to write some good blogs, add a few \"targeted keywords\" in the content, send emails to few prospect for \"link building\" and then BOOM Google will show my site in the first page.  Nope. Not even close.  I spent months publishing content (more than 20+ articles) I thought they were amazing. But when I checked Google? Page 10. Page 12. Basically invisible. And every time I tried to ask “why isn’t this ranking?” most answer I got from SEO gurus was mostly the same two words:  “Your Content is good, but SEO TAKES TIME\"  And then, of course, the golden advice: “Just build quality backlinks.”  Okay… but what does that actually mean?  How many backlinks do I need?  \"SEO TAKES TIME\" okay, but exactly how long specifically for my target \"keyword\" I want to rank for?  And getting backlinks from what kind of sites is good enough to be considered as \"high quality backlinks\" purely for my targeted keyword?  And how the hell do I guest post without spamming “keyword + write for us” into Google and begging random sites for guest posts?  That’s when it hit me: what if there was a tool that didn’t just say “build quality backlinks,” but literally broke it down for you? Like Google saying  “To rank for this keyword, you’ll need around 42 backlinks from DA 28-32 sites, you site MUST LOAD under 2.5 seconds, have 3 supporting articles, and ~4 months of consistency. Oh, and here’s the exact strategy to actually get those backlinks without generic guest posting BS.”  So… I built it.  It’s called Pikera SEO (https://pikeraai.com). It’s a tool where you type in your target keyword (for example: “best AI tools in 2025”), and it tells you:  How many backlinks you’ll realistically need  What domain authority range those backlinks should come from  How long it’ll probably take to rank  What technical fixes you need to make  And most importantly → the strategy to actually hit those requirements  I’m not saying this magically gets you to Page 1 overnight (SEO is still work). But at least now you can start with clarity instead of guesswork with Pikera SEO.  Right now, Pikera SEO is in early access, and we’re running a waitlist here: https://pikeraai.com/waitlist.  If you’re a founder, marketer, or just someone tired of SEO “it depends” answers, I think you’ll find it useful.  But I’d also love your feedback: if you were using a tool like this, what’s the #1 thing you’d want it to tell you about your keyword? Because I’m still improving it, and honestly, hearing from people in communities like this is way more valuable than any \"SEO guru’s\" advice.  That’s it. Just wanted to share my journey, my frustration, and what I built out of necessity.  If anyone’s been through the same SEO pain, I’d love to hear your story too.",

While the country was grieving and people were literally risking their lives for justice, she was sitting back, polishing a script and preparing an Excel sheet to clear her image. That’s not just tone-deaf, it’s calculated. The timing, the fake vulnerability, the “I’m innocent” narrative, it’s all image management. And to drop that while the nation is still mourning? It’s actually disgraceful. Her silence during the peak of the movement spoke volumes, and now this video just confirmed everything people feared about her. Honestly, if this is the “final boss” of playing victim, it’s a pathetic one.|||Tyo excel sheet banauna plan gareko PR team lai fire hannei parxa Shrinkhala le😂😂|||Feels like Nepal ma kei garnu bekar ho.

I got a sudden boost in heart-beat thinking she actually shot herself & unlived her|||Hijo matrai I saw a YouTube video of thesadiapsychology’s scam who provides everything but proof that she is a licensed psychologist with degrees. It’s a different story but that’s exactly how I felt watching Shrinkhala’s videos.  I never idolized her or hated her, but this is too much. It was giving manipulation & narcissism. It’s one thing to defend her reputation, but completely another to do so by playing the victim card, shifting narratives & repeatedly saying things so that they are perceived as truth & dodging accountability by blaming others. Tbh it really bothered me that she (and her PR team) thought that we’re dumb enough to believe those excel sheets. Maybe what she said is true, but she could have showed the actual proof.  In her place, all of us would feel terrible. But to say things like leaving instagram account as it is so that it can be a testament to hate while not acknowledging her silence on a platform with a million followers over deaths of youth is crazy. Becoming an influencer means you are sometimes answerable to questions & accusations, it’s not just about making your feed aesthetic & scoring brand deals. People turned her into an influencer, so ofc she will have to be answerable sometimes. I wonder what she thought? Yea it’s not easy, but it’s part of all that fame & money.  To see that she was so concerned about setting her narrative & defending her image while not even feeling sorry for those who died, were injured & whose families are now forever incomplete is baffling.   Her narrative has been set forever now. Clearly, not to everyone, but to lots of us. Someone said that she’s only sad now because she lost followers, and that pretty much sums up how I see her now.|||Tesko bhanda ta Anmol KC ko acting ramro yarr|||More the explanation more the lie.|||Aafule khaneko khaldo ma aafai parnu vaneko ehi ho :D|||Yeah couldn't agree more.

Honestly asking. Why did the Nepo Kids trend include her? I have read somewhere that people hate her now because she said she will fight against corruption when she is the daughter of Binod Khatiwoda so that made her a hypocrite. Was Binod Khatiwada known to be corrupt? Please dont tell me that every politician is corrupt. I am asking if there has been any concerns raised regarding Binod Khatiwada like he owning multiple buildings, cars etc when he is only a politician.    If no one really knows that her dad is corrupt, her defensiveness makes sense to me. I too would be devastated if my image was destroyed for no apparent reason.   Again.. I am saying this because I honestly don't know about Binod Khatiwada.|||K garos ta garna chai, yeti sab vaisakdaa, yeti sab accusations huda, euta manche le aafno clarification ta dihalxha ni yr.

She really is not as intellectually gifted as she portrays herself to be. She seems to surrounds herself with people who are actually intelligent (and hence pass off their work as her own) and her family is well connected and powerful enough to give her things she could never earn by merit. OR 2. Her family is CORRUPT enough for certain people to have a personal vendetta against her and deliberately tried to ensure her results are tempered with. Eventually her family had to do some private investigations and ensure her career is not impacted by such dirty political games...which just proves her family is corrupt and had immense political influence.   Either way, there is no winning here. She is still a liar, a hypocrite and a narcissist.|||do u mean she inflated her results misusing parent's political power? |||Shrinkhala took \"Fake it till you make it\" way too seriously|||Now i can confirm the earlier reddit post of one of her classmates of Harvard, she exposed how shrinkhala is not as intelligent as she presents to be.|||She was not batch topper usle final project ra thesis ma top gareko ho.my friend was studying architecture in pulchowk at that time and she told me she was not batch topper.

We need to share this and let people know how did this pathetic person misused power while she legitimately failed her exams and so many youth committed suicide because they were not even given this privilege, or even their voice were unheard for retotaling after the exam. Lets share this video and see what does shrinkhala lovers has to say. She is so opportunistic and selfish and its so sad to see people actually believe her.|||This ability to re-total is a privilege. She will never accept that it is  There must be Countless more privileges that led her to have the life that she has. Acknowledge it, drop the I'm self made act. We know you are smart, talented, good at communication. But you are not self made because you had the right connections to get things done way more faster without roadblocks at a young age.  This one came out via a video,  thuprai hola bhitra ka kura which are small injustices done to others, to give her alleged justice|||Not taking Shrinkhala’s side but I’ve actually been through this. Back in my SLC, I was shocked to see an ‘E’ in Health & Population. Even after re-totaling, nothing changed. Then, my mom and I went all the way to Sano Thimi for rechecking and guess what? It turned into an A+. The officials just said, ‘Sometimes technical errors happen.’”|||I didn't get the context|||https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8SXeY35/|||The generation who started the protest for anti corruption is busy focusing on a few single influencers.

If we continue to leg pull , gossip and stop questioning the system we are very much alike the generation you are pointing fingers at. There is a quote that states \" Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people\". I really hope Nepal does not end up being the country full of small minds. Come on guys, we are better than this.  And FYI,  Exam withheld doesnot necessarily mean person has failed the exam.  FYI, corruption stops via a good systemic change. Mere influncers are not the one responsible to end corruption. IT IS THE SYSTEM!|||Kati thulo issue banako dimag navako vede haru.

Many students do this alongside studies. Also, there are free resources online (YouTube, Khan Academy, NMC prep channels) that can help you push your score higher without paying for classes. Even I worked as a part time waiter after my SEE and I was working plus studying +2 to make some extra cash to support my family.. No job is small or big, try to work wherever you can for some extra cash.. start seeking for job, go to nearest restaurants, coffee shops, other businesses, someone would definitely be hiring..  If scholarship doesn’t work out this year, remember MBBS is not the only path, Loksewa and many other options can still give you a secure future. But for now, your priority should be your safety and health. Please reach out to a close friend, a teacher, or even counseling services if you ever feel like giving up. You don’t deserve to carry this pain alone.  You’ve already proved you have the talent and resilience, just keep going step by step. Things can change and will definitely change|||Proof me maximum as you mentioned here , if you do so I will help you atleast NPR 10K|||Not to demotivate you bahini, but I think Loksewa is the best option for you now.

Ani, timile tuition padhayera bhaye ni garchhu ta sochauli, but it’s quite hard to manage time. My parents are providing me money for my expenses, but I am still mentally fked up because of MBBS.  Anyway, it’s your future. Do what feels best for you. Good luck!|||Dear baini, I am a doctor myself and seeing your financial conditions and no support system it will be very hard for you to pursue an MBBS journey even if you get a scholarship. MBBS is a long and tough journey and requires a good support system from your family for at least 6 years if you do well. And trust me it is not as lucrative as it seems from outside. A lot of your youth and family money goes into it even in scholarship. From my perspective, It's better for you to do some income earning work and take your study side by side( which is not possible in MBBS ,kapal njharunjel dedicated vayera padnu parcha to be a doctor). Euta part time job khojihala. Kaam lai thulo sano navana. Right now the main issue you have is economic.

Sometimes we just have to accept the situation, ghati herera had nilnu bhaneko jastai. Right now your focus needs to be on finding a job and probably a roommate that you can share your rent expenses with. And just cut off all the contacts with your mother asap. She has mental issues probably bipolar or something, it's not your job to fix it. She brought you into this mess and it was her responsibility to take care of you, not yours to take care of her. So just cut off all the contacts and find a job.

Since you know your financial situation and your overall situation padhna vanda ni kaam khojna important xa hola ni hai, ani since you are a bright student you can give home tution, and earn some money. 5yr mbbs garera last ma you will get internship ma 15 20k, ani tespaxi MO ma 30 40k 6th year ma. You see time it will take for you to just get started even then?

I know its easier said than done, but apply garna paisa lagdaina ani decision auda samma if you give some tution or start teaching you can collect some money for visa interview.

MBBS is a really hectic field and it’s not like you imagine it to be. Aile timro financial condition herda, it’s better if you try for Loksewa, as you’ll get results and earn money way faster than MBBS. MBBS takes at least 4 and a half years , teti bela samma you won’t even earn a penny. You’ll start to earn a bit of money during internship as a stipend.  Also, the mental pressure in these 4 and a half years is too much. Endless classes, practicals, weekly exams sabai le stress dincha. If you’re thinking of taking tuition classes or doing a side job, then it’s really hard to do so for straight 4 and a half years.  Unless someone else is helping you out financially, it’s really hard. Ki ta timile IOM ma naam nikalnu parcha, natra it’s quite hard without any financial support.  It’s your future, so make the decision wisely. I'm always rooting for you!

CEE, IoM, MoE ra KU ko past qsn euta ni mistake nagara. Physics ra Chemistry le ho decide garne if you will get scholarship or not. Physics ma 45 lyauna sakchau. chem ma 40 is a must. Biology ma it differs acc to which book you are using. First name module sakau if that's what you're using. tespaxi ekchoti bio course sakesi 11-12 ko book sakau while revising. I believe someone will help you with lectures, payenau vane message me I have physics lectures that i had brought during preparation days.   One more thing. MBBS is a commitment for life. Books ko last kharcha lagcha. laptop or ipad navai ekdam garo huncha. thorai rank aayo ani private college padhnu paryo vane jhan dherai laagcha college fees. Like, monthly hostel basekai 17k linchan, ani few lakhs initial payment, last jhyau huncha even in scholarship. Rather, i would suggest bsc or loksewa. But it's your choice. If I were given the choice with knowledge I have now, I'd have gone for loksewa.   Anyways, prepare well, form vorisakeu so give it your best effort. You can do it. Tuition garerai MBBS katauna sakincha. Jhan, 11-12 ko lai bio padhayeu vane it'll be very easy for you. Good Luck.|||Hey, we can share our entrance dose account.

Even if you get a scholarship, there will still be mental and financial challenges.

If I were in your place, I would consider choosing a less demanding course firstsomething that allows me to continue studying while working part-time and then pursue MBBS later when I’m in a stronger state of mind and financial position.

Why are you studying MBBS? Is that really something that interests you, if yes then only go for it… if you chose this field randomly then I’d say reconsider your decision.

Your number 1 priority should be survival. So, find a job. May be in a restaurant or consultancy or in a supermarket or anywhere. Some people here in reddit might help you regarding it. Once you start earning, you would start getting confidence. You would start getting vision of what should you do next.  Remember, we all are gonna die sooner or later.

As someone who gave cee, 130 aairaxa timro bhane that's a really good score and yes you can definitely push to 140 cee samma. Dropper raixau bhane paxi you might be well aware about the scholarship scheme. 140 over score gareu bhane you'll be eligible for open category scholarship (but it depends on cut off and highest score) Tara government school 6 or tyo bhanda aagadi dekhi padheko bhaye 120 or even 100 over matra lyauda ni you'll be eligible for scholarship female, indigenous category Bata. All in all I think you'll get a scholarship seat.  Fyi, I'm a mbbs student currently on 2nd semester. Talking as a med student myself, timle mbbs join garexi job garxu bhanni aas chai narakhda hunxa.. it'll be very hectic. With exams coming up every 2 weeks, the practical files you have to do, the content you have to study, these will keep you occupied enough.

Yetti expenses Ani stress dhanna sakxau bhane (which I think you can) MBBS won't be a big deal Tara side job ko almost no chance.   Lastly, what I genuinely think is you shouldn't aim for mbbs, rather you can try for other streams and do a side job to support your mom. MBBS is not all that. You can achieve a lot through other sectors also. You've gone through all of this Ani on top of that you seem to be very talented so I think you'll thrive on every stream you end up on. At the end of the day, it's your decision. Do what you think is best for you but remember SUICIDE AIN'T YOUR ONLY OPTION!|||More power to you baini.

I thought I had a tough situation but yours shattered me. Please do not let it break you. Please don't let yourself be broken by this. You may cry but don't let it take you any unfortunate action.   I suggest you pursue something else instead of MBBS as MBBS is very draining and as much as I've heard very stressful study and also the job you get from it is believed to be very stressing. I am aware it is a noble job but you have to care about yourself. Know that there is always a very good chance of being loved. Don't lose hope. You would get specific advices from other fellows here but pls don't let it all break you. Loneliness decays a person from inside I understand. Focus on getting independent enough to live a decent enough lifestyle for now. Food, shelter, clothes, walk.  MBBS will take too much from your mental strength.  If you ever feel like it is getting too heavy. Know that you are open to cry but not break. It is not a permanent rut. You will get through this. Have trust in yourself. Never lose that trust. Even if you do, seek it back. Snatch it back. Get it back again. I really wish for your better.  - An anonymous brother|||Please don’t give up on life like that… Tapai kehi din endure garnus ani it’s all going to be alright..

I am not in favor of anyone in particular, but if we look at things rationally, none of them are truly as good as they appear. We need to stop idolizing individuals blindly. We did the same with Shrinkhala, first lifting her up and later trying to bring her down. Similarly, let’s not put Sisan on a pedestal either. At this moment, these individuals are not important enough to deserve so much attention. Instead, we should be focusing on posts and discussions that demand transparency from the current government. Leaders like K.P. Oli and Sher Bahadur Deuba were once elected in a time when people were desperate for hope. Many believed that by collapsing the monarchy and restoring democracy, everything would improve. People trusted them blindly, thinking they would lead like one of us. But history shows us how that trust turned into disappointment, largely because nobody asked for accountability and transparency. Let’s not fall into the same trap again. Rather than getting distracted by opportunistic figures, let’s talk about the government, demand justice for the young martyrs, and focus on the truly important issues.|||Aba dear brother vanney response chahiyo, 😃😀|||He thinks she's the greatest minds!

Most people don't know the perspectives of one event and they believe only what is potrayed.

Honestly speaking they are playing with young people’s emotions and future… they are burning our country and feeling the warmth… and we are happy at the time being because youth are so blinded by this madness they don’t see right from wrong!! Just look at the way they incite violence like it’s nothing!! Talking about burning down houses and people is nothing!! This is not a right foundation. We must make all these Gen-Z representatives accountable. Especially, Sudhan Gurung. He needs to stop acting like some filmy hero and step back for people with capabilities to step in and do their job. He is distracting the revolution in many way by his hot headed attitude.

Also what happens if he wins election he managed? Would everyone trust he won fair election?   I think what did is best for him and country. If people choose him, he will be pm if not he wont. It’s simple.|||Disclaimer: I am not a Balen supporter or cultist.  This post is conflicting for me. But, the post is characterizing the man based on:  1. What the man didn’t do or didn’t say. 2. What people expected him to do.  The man himself has said enough in his posts.   It’s what, he DIDN’T do that impresses me the most about him. Saying “No” is harder than saying “Yes”, when everyone wanted him to say “Yes”.  (Think about this.)  He put out only a couple of posts, which I think served as guide posts during the revolution.   1. He was the first widely known public figure (that I know) who defined who Gen Z was and gave his support to the protest. 2. When the tempo rose, he clarified that Gen Z should lead, he accepted Sushila even when all of his cultists were going crazy about making him the interim PM.  Removing himself from the picture, brought focus back on the revolution and the task ahead, rather than turn the confusion situation, even more confusing with a popularity contest as a side gig.   There is a lot of things to think about and I think in time we can all make sense of it all.   That’s my two paisa about him.|||Leading KTM municipality vs leading the nation are totally different. The followers of Balen urging and rushing him to lead 'right now' and come out by 2PM are the same people who will criticize him within one year if he were to be them PM someday. They don't have patience and want to see changes immediately.  Personally, I would like to see him running in the upcoming election as deputy/vice roles first and not immediate PM role...assuming how parties will be formed and if there are any good lead independent candidate who will run with him. He's one of those few worthy to be PM but this is not his peak yet. He just became a mayor like 3 years ago and he still has a lot to show to the general public. If and when he wins to the election, it will be his peak and he has high chances of being a two term PM...assuming two term limit will be in place hopefully. Time will tell.|||GenZ aren't immune to celeb worship culture.|||Hami Nepal has already stated it was part of a plan and they want balen for 5 years.

Yes it is definitely an opportunistic behaviour by balen. But how is this behaviour wrong and how is taking over PM position now and securing interim govt now and not taking part in politics for next 5 years do any good to the country.    He is practicing patience to achieve the goal he desires and what people actually wants from a young leader like him. Look throughout the history of world politics, paitence has always been the key factor to shape the world politics.|||Having trusted by many even me,In the moment of national threat, he could do nothing. That’s the reason I doubt him.  i think he is not completely responsible for being the Prime Minister. Sure, he is a great person. He’s doing such a great thing in the valley, but being a Prime Minister is very responsible post, his way up talking to seniors, saying I will put fire to SinghaDurbar, I will bury everyone if you’re in tudinkhel, getting carried away by emotions, being Prime Minister means you should not be carried away by any emotions and none of the factors should affect your judgment which you believe to be true and is lawful, Hopefully he will make such changes and we can finally see him in the top, as much as I want him to be the Prime Minister I do think he is inexperienced and immature in this field,|||We are so far behind that criticizing political leader sounds like a hater. We are not even to the point where we could say “This person is bad/clueless , country isn’t safe with them”. For the past decade, the corrupted 3 have been playing nothing but tato aloo with us so its natural to be sticking nail to current situation. Give it some time and our voices will get echoed.|||If there’s one thing old political leaders never learned, it was how to handle criticism. The moment anyone spoke up, they tried to shut it down and let’s not even start on the behavior of their hardcore supporters(jholey as we call them).  Even leaders like Balen need to address this with their own supporters, as do all the new representatives entering the upcoming elections. They must say publicly that they welcome criticism, will reflect on it, and use it as a tool for improvement. Leaders should make it clear to their base: don’t bully or silence people for simply asking questions or raising concerns. Do not perform character assassination against someone just for criticizing. After all, in a democracy, freedom of speech is our right.  At the same time, we the general public also carry responsibility. We need to recognize the difference between constructive criticism and defamation. What we must not do is fall for propaganda, spread rumors, or engage in baseless character assassination.  And if we realize that our criticism or questioning was wrong, we should have the courage to apologize in the same way we raised the question. After all, apologizing will never make you small. It’s just a simple five letter word: “Sorry.” A word that can and should be spoken from both sides.|||Just because you’re against the system, doesn’t make you Balen-Supporters. Balen has no experience. Balen should wait and gain some experience. Criticism is a backbone of democracy and one must welcome it.|||EXACTLY. They lack this ability to critically analyse any action of any leader. Like no one is perfect and no one is a good. Let's be honest. Let's criticize people for their actions. People should be held accountable for their actions. Most importantly, leaders who run our nation. If we don't point out their wrongdoings, will they ever stop? Nepalese have such a bheda mindset, istg. Let's be more aware and let's know how to discern leaders and their actions.   By criticizing these leaders, we aren't hating on them. We're trying to bring awareness so that they won't repeat the same thing again and can do things better for the country.|||They need to be aware party KO jhole become jhole because they were andabhakt of party leader ( just like they are blind follower of balen rn)|||I think holding politicians accountable is crucial. I hope people realize we don’t need  more devotees and followers. We need critical, educated thinkers. Support the good work, appreciate your favorite leader but don’t forget to question often. People change. Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Need to always stay cautious. |||Agreed|||Thanks man, you speaked my words. I see people thanking Balen for this movement and saying he was the reason this movement happened and succeeded and all after Sushila Karki became interim PM, and this made me very sad for actual people who started the movement and also faced the consequences and this was even more big realization for me for how blind youth and supporters these days are and this concerns me even more for future|||This. This is what I’ve been saying for some time. Like the post says, I’ve also been labeled as a party ko jhole and what not. Even here in this sub, people have called me jhole lol just because I questioned him.  I am a Balen supporter. I supported him and did my part by sharing about his campaign on social media and making everyone aware about it. And I was super happy when he won, I still am. But I’ve been criticizing him on various points that I find valid. The top one is communication.  During the election, he constantly criticized Bidya Sundar (the previous mayor) for not communicating publicly. He even said that once he became mayor, he wouldn’t be like that and would stay in constant touch. He proposed starting a ‘Mayor with the Public’ TV program and even set aside a budget for it, but nothing has happened. He hasn’t given a single interview.  And then come his jhole supporters who always argue with the same line: ‘Pailai kei chaieko ho.’ With that logic, we should never question anyone. Just look at how Balen has become now, he just posts one-sided, no-context Facebook statuses and nothing else.|||Balen is a hypocrite in my opinion, like he encouraged the protest and even promised to provide a safe and secure environment for the protest but when things turned south he vanished like horn from a donkeys head|||Finally someone spoke about this, belun has literally become a god complex among some people out there, which is kinda concerning, the only time he speaks is to not let his adhabhatka interfere in every other stuff out there.

I personally don't think he has the temperament (though if there's a choice between any big parties' leader and Balen, I'd choose Balen every time).|||Aru kura thik ho, but can’t say he abandoned. It’s not 100% sure he will be the next PM so can’t call him opportunist.|||Yes ,|||Very well said|||While I am unsure on balen and his move, yes! To select a leader, you do have to question. Even the one you support. That is transparency. That is the trust that has foundation|||You’re right. In Nepal, many people tend to follow leaders without much critical thought, even when those leaders don’t necessarily act in their favor. Unfortunately, this habit seems to persist across generations. If the younger generation continues with the same mindset, there’s a real risk that the country could end up facing the same challenges in the future that we are experiencing today.|||You can make your own assumptions and narratives. If Balen had taken the post of PM, you would have said that he is opportunistic, that he enraged protestors just to get the position. I saw somewhere on Facebook, even before Balen’s official post on sushila karki that balen played dirty game for the sake of pm position. As far as I know, Balen is a farsighted person. He only comes forward when he feels fully prepared.|||That's my whole point, but again..vanepachi manche lai jholey nai lagcha. 😅 Guy's, learn to ask questions yourself too.

But ever since I saw him become mayor, I have always seen him wearing Nepali dress most of the time and consistently working to conserve our heritage and culture.  You know what? He is still better than most of the people there. Whatever he does, he has never done anything wrong. Stop pretending to be so-called critics for useless reasons. What is your academic background, and what makes you think that way? Have you ever felt the difference between past and present Kathmandu? I have a friend from the core area of Kathmandu, do you know what his opinion about Balen Shah is? No!  Even Harka Sampang is a very good person. Moreover, Sagar Dhakal’s brother has been working actively to eradicate the dictatorship of these political parties. Maybe your parents are bootlicking those rotten political parties, so you only see what Balen has never done and will never do. Just because he supported the movement does not mean he said he wants to become prime minister. You must understand that he posts only a few things because his words are weapons. One word from him has many consequences in such a movement. He is very clever and very wise; unlike Harka Sampang, though I like Harka as a person.

If Balen had come out saying he’s ready to lead, a lot of people would’ve jumped in claiming he planned the whole movement and just used Gen Z for his own benefit. That’s probably why in his statements, he keeps stressing that this is Gen Z’s movement and that the government will be formed by them. imo, staying out of it was the smartest move he could have made.  I’m all for questioning and criticizing leaders. I agree that its a problem if you dont want to do it. But when someone has shown that they are dedicated, not corrupt, and actually get things done, you’ve got to give them some benefit of the doubt. Save the tough questions for real concerns. Dont critise just because you think no one can ever be good enough.|||Yes Balen has fallen badly as he didnt seem to care about the youths when they needed him the most. But, when we are talking about selection of interim PM, he did the right thing by not coming out.

But I’m sure even he does not know he’s a small puppet planted/invested long ago. Usually foreign powers will not directly direct its agenda, especially for the country at the bottom of the barrel they do not have the time to do so. You just give them small aid, support for us, for them simple investment, which they just got good return this time, especially now east is rising its economy. You just need to nudge them, give them support they will do their good vs evil thing which any human will do. Think about it, nobody was going forward with stance like him to take on some kind of leader role, because we do not have that power (support) and as human we fear unknown.  You might think I’m thinking too much of this. Well, I can’t argue you, because I do not know for sure, but this is my stance and most probable thing I saw.",

He pushed Nepal towards democracy and republicanism.   He gave poor villagers and lower-caste groups a voice in national politics.   He increased women’s participation in politics and society, with many ex-fighters now active in leadership roles.   In western hills and Madhesh, state institutions were weak or absent. Villagers depended on landlords for loans, justice, and protection, which kept exploitation unchallenged (Kamaiya, Haruwa-Charuwa, Haliya systems). His movement gave villagers confidence to defy landlords for the first time.   Fighters who believed they sacrificed for justice and equality still respect him as the leader who turned their struggle into a new political order.

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not “revolution,” it’s not “justice,” and it sure as hell isn’t “the voice of the people.” It’s mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn’t make you brave—it makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that—surrounded by a wave of so-called “youths” who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let’s not sugarcoat it—the so-called Gen Z “warriors” hiding in the mob weren’t heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country’s social fabric. He still can’t step foot in certain countries because he’s internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he’s propped up as a “leader.”  Let’s be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn’t an accident—it was a setup. While Deuba’s family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don’t get it twisted—those sharpshooters in the crowd weren’t just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres—former insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let’s stop pretending this was “the people rising up.” It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist—the one who drowned this nation in blood—walks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don’t for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn’t that Deuba suffered humiliation—the real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn’t a flower; he’s a weed choking the soil of Nepal’s democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too naïve to realize they’re being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||Prachanda and Baburam are India's puppet.

This has been ongoing for more than two decades. Behind the few visible figures, there are countless others who have either assisted them or benefitted through their association—ranging from major brands in Nepal to traders. For example, Sher Bahadur Deuba’s son and his sanitary pad importing company stand as an illustration.  They have institutionalized corruption by appointing foreign ambassadors based on party loyalty and financial gains, extending even to the transfer of bureaucrats to preferred locations in exchange for bribes and other undue benefits. The problem is not limited to the political system alone; bureaucrats, too, require checks and balances. A mechanism must be established to regulate the power of bureaucrats over politicians. Since bureaucrats are permanent stakeholders, their influence is even greater. One effective way to mitigate this is to appoint domain experts as ministers—for instance, a professional civil engineer as a minister cannot be misled about the cost estimates of a construction project.  There remains much to be done. Moreover, these political parties will attempt to form alliances before elections, bringing forward the same candidates and restoring the same exploitative system. Therefore, the first and most meaningful reform must be a change in the electoral process, with the inclusion of a “NOTA” (None of the Above) option.  Further accountability can be ensured by eliminating political appointments to certain positions. At present, even temporary (karar) appointments are made based on party affiliation rather than merit. As a result, even highly qualified experts are compelled to seek political approval. The recent appointments of Vice-Chancellors at B.P. Koirala Institute in Dharan and Gangalal Hospital are prime examples.  In addition to these issues, several other structural flaws persist.

That’s the text on the other side of the paper. 🤦‍♂️  3. I don’t get why you keep mentioning “apple pencil”. I don’t get why she would overwrite something by hand. Also look up what ink spread is.  4. Look up ink splatter. Fairly common, depending on what printer was used. Doesn’t directly imply “apple pencil use garo hola 🤪”  5. Tyo email ko font haina, that is a screenshot of the PDF. And font spacing and line height can be different for PDFs of different years, depending on template changes or some other internal design decisions.  6. Yo chai I agree. I don’t think Harvard would have such an obvious grammatical error in their official mail.  7. This is a common issue with devnagri fonts and is called a hinting issue.

            "subreddit": "NepalSocial",
            "heading": "The Shrinkhala Khatiwada I knew at Harvard",
            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada’s classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.   We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking–much to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in  Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate - the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala’s approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.   Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn’t mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‘help’. One time, she even said airily, “I wash my own dishes, you know.” She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala–a beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth–lingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don’t intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‘nepo babies’ who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).   Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It’s a troubling idea to think that despite what’s happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

And a few after she became miss nepal... I can somewhat vouch for the \"I'm busy with this and that... Can you help me with this\" part...

I never liked her naak ma singan adke jasto boli.. And always felt she has a cunning personality that clings over you until she can no more use you for her advantage..  Sisan literally dodged a  bullet.. all thanks to her greed though..|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn’t some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was “beneficial” for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake “beauty with brains” narrative. Do you guys remember Niti’s big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let’s not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala’s prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it’s her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let’s be real- Sisan wasn’t perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they’d known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn’t even exist. This just proves it- they weren’t just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can’t just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala’s career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav’s narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What’s the lesson we can learn from here ?  Karma is real af & money can’t give you lifelong happiness, night Redditors|||Wish we had more tea like this on all nepo babies.|||She didn't get any fucking scholarship from the Nepali government.

Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don’t even make sense to begin with. Don’t know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don’t even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It’s so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It’s astounding what the world has come to and it’s deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can’t be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn’t she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It’s better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has.

Every move, every word, every connection seems like part of a bigger calculation. While most people get dragged through the mud on social media, she somehow stays a step ahead. Of all platforms, she was clever enough to pull the LinkedIn card first. That’s not by accident, it’s calculation. She knows the bashing on Tiktok or Instagram doesn’t matter as long as her professional side stays spotless, especially where she might work with people internationally who will never know the side of her life in Nepal that’s been exposed and torn apart ever since the truth came out.  It’s like she’s playing this endless game of Ludo, always climbing the ladder, polishing her image as she goes. But at the same time, you can’t help but feel she’s only ever a roll away from hitting 98 and sliding right back down the snake.|||We wont know if what you claim is true.

Thanks for your insight, OP!!|||Instead of that unfollow trend circling around , it should have been “report account” trend.|||Never knew she belonged from the politician family while moving to Harvard, Now I realize how brainwashed I was and was thinking that the power of education, intelligence and smartness got her but now I realize all that was a hoax. Now I will never look upto someone who is from the rich background, like people who try to flaunt as if they belong to another universe or something that sort. lastly i wan to say f\\*\\*\\*\\* shri\\*\\*hala!|||Color me unsurprised|||I trust every words you said.I felt this to my gut when you shared about the teamwork thing and how she treated her peers more like servant and less like an actual teammate. These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!! And the way she's silent when the country is bleeding says alottt too!!!!!!  And about the Nepal's government scholarship for harvard,this is not true, she is telling an entire different story about harvard scholarsip & how she paid fees there. She said she got 30% scholarship at harvard and the remaining 70% is paid through her brand endorsements money as she is brand ambassador to few company. We didnt buy that story, she tried hardest to sell it though and still fools people with this shitty madeup script about harvard's 30% scholarship & 70% funding through brand endorsement's money lmao. And lately she's being questioned on 50,000USD she got during miss world competition after winning \"beauty with the purpose\" title. Her ex exposed & questioned her in a very shady way and because of him we all knew this new layer of truth and i highly doubt it went on harvard's funding rather than for actual purpose|||One buy Harvard degree with that 50K and another one became a MAKUSE owner . This whole MN itself is a scam and I wonder if MW is aware of it or not , only god knows.|||can someone post thin in r/Nepal   https://preview.redd.it/iw9jr1ltripf1.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=aabb48bd834ff6a72ed266d613fec61229cc72f0  from her post i noticed she tried to post, but r/nepal has mod which wont let post for new accounts|||Guys, for the people that say that Shrinkhala did it on her own and she payed for her own expenses with \"WHITE MONEY”. NO TF SHE DID NOT!!!! Like realistically speaking, a middle class Nepali \"HUMBLE FAMILY” who did not come from money can’t afford even the tuition at Harvard even with loans CYZ it’s so Dyaum expensive let alone living expenses, traveling, food and other necessities we might not know of. I’m saying this as a Nepali because there are so many kids that have the potential to study there and even get into the school but can’t even afford it. So idk why she tries to portray herself as \"POOR” when she’s RICH RICH. And idk where the money comes from and how but I just know that she’s not who she tries to portray herself as……….|||Yesto post haru aauna paryo kya..reddit jasto platform ma sakesamma sablai aware garau..yestai leak type vanam ki aam Janata leh nabujeko, nasuneko kura garepo ,eh hamro Samaj ma yesto ni vairaxa vanne chet aauxa reddit user maa... jaile kt , relationship bahek kei dekhdaina ma..|||I have a similar story like Shrinkhala’s on Nepal’s current president’s granddaughter (he has 4 and i’m talking about the one studying at the University of Texas in Austin). Its not easy to get in there and even if you do its one of the expensive schools there. Talking about her Nepal bachelor’s days, my friends studied with her in KU in nepal in b. arch, and so many said she cheated on exams (A LOT) just to pass. later she worked for the nepal government and came to US for conferences and presentations 🤡. now she has started her master’s at UT austin, funded by corrupted money. she removed her instagram posts about her prior foreign visits and her recent UT Austin orientation day, and even deactivated her linkedin account.  Now she’s posting on instagram and facebook, after the new PM was appointed, congratulating her and thanking the president grand dad for this revolution. it’s crazy how these unethical people still have the audacity to do all this.  (Source: from college friends and family members, and as those of us who are directly impacted by this revolution in nepal, we are not going to stay quiet against corruption and the unethical hypocrisy going on for a long time)|||Also the harvard blog lol|||What was her gpa?|||Most of her followers in isnt are fake and paid tho|||If you guys want social awareness of Nepal's issues, you should write fully in English.  This event has almost zero coverage in the west who are the only regions likely to be supportive.|||But guys, the 50000 dollars which apparently Shrinkhala and Anuska got, why didnt we know about it earlier? Didnt Dabur Miss Nepal know? Was the money given to them in their personal account or was it provided through Dabur Miss Nepal? This needs to be investigated imo.|||Sirohiya family coma ma hola. sabai tira bata Shrinkhala exposed bhaya pachi. ghati ma adkeko haddi jastai bhayo Shrinkhala Sirohiya ko lagi.|||tyasko insta ma followers 899k ma pugi sakyo. Continue on --|||For everyone about the op In short : The writer paints Shrinkhala as a privileged “nepo baby” who uses image, connections, and entitlement rather than merit or substance.|||Thanks for sharing your raw and real experience, thoughts and opinion. This is valuable for those of us who were shocked and skeptical about her success right from the day she got into limelight. I watched her view on Youtube yesterday and couldn't get past a minute of that video, she is clearly playing victim and trying to play the game.  Nope! she doesn't deserve any chance at all.  The students that I know personally who went to Harvard, MIT and many other prestigious institutions had grit, determination, belief in hard-work, may be little bit of luck but most of all they had \"humility\". They NEVER used their \"Harvard degree\" or Ivy league label to show off. It's those who want to fame and fake pride that put up social media posts to show off their diplomas. Honestly, it was very very clear even before she went to Harvard that she was on the wrong side of fame game.  For the longest time I thought it was a generational difference, since there are many other Harvard students who have publicized themselves in several Youtube videos and they are all Gen Z, and as a Gen Y (Millennial) observing this trend seemed justifiable.  However, Shrinkhala was building a house of cards and the fact that she had the audacity to publicize and put Sambhav Sirohiya in the limelight using Harvard freebies was just laughable a few years ago.  Like you pointed out, the fact that she still has 900K followers is troubling for sure but let's hope those are just her fake followers (some % are bought/in-organic followers, some her closest elite allies like \"Other Miss Nepals/ Businessmen/political affiliates etc. and some her enemies) as they say, **keep your friends close and enemies closer.**|||I heard that B.arch is the easiest subject to get at Pulchowk and that too for a girl as they have separate reservations for women. Yes she must be smart because to get that you need to work hard.  But the image she tries to portray being you know the perfect, hardworking,real and independent girl always sounded fishy to me.  Miss World organization saw through her, so didn't let her go to the final round. There is no substance in her words and it  sounds exactly like a politician speech. Idealistic statements with no action. Look at the legacy of previous Miss Nepal winners. Most of them marry rich businessman and secure a rich, lavish life. Miss Nepal itself feels like a joke...|||Am I the only one who cant believe that she got 3 crore just from collaborating with brands. Like I get it that she had 1M followers but she wasn't really like an influencer. How could she claim that she is the most influential person in Nepal. If she actually got 3 crore then maybe I should also be an influencer.|||First of all, there was no government scholarship. She lied to you guys so she could appear smart. She has now publicly claimed that she paid her tuition with her influencer income. But we all know where the money came from.|||Glad you shared this all. Would you mind to share your opinion what Nepal should do now as a graduate from Harvard. You must have some great knowledge isn't it ?|||We have changed the government and now need to focus on progress. Don't be invited.  Especially with account no older than 1 day.   Don't be manipulated by an AstroTurf.|||Honestly, I am tired of reddit Nepal talking about Shrinkhala at this point. Sabb le yei vanthio kyare..... How is she able to be relevant so much. Her being idealistic nice person image gone, perception of her being smart gone, her relationship with memeable Sisan Baniya gone, Nepali boys whose beauty standard is \"goori hunu  paryo\" simping for her as she got married gone... If you actually visit work of her company Gaatha, your impression of her teams there will also be gone.|||Sisan dai dodged a bullet …|||Everyone hates power till you offer some|||So many politicians sold country for MBBS and BDS seats for their children. Example Ram chandra poudel's daughter  Madhav nepal daughter  Sharad singh Bhandari arranging BDS seats for his brother daughter.. These are few examples and seats goes on.

If my mom wasn't educated with a job, I would fear to imagine what my life would look like. I often wondered if my dad took millions of bribes offered, my life would be extravagant! I'd be in Paris shopping every time I had a minor inconvenience in life LMAO! I mean deep inside I know that shiz was gonna hit us back one day, one way or the other because I'm a firm believer of karma and I'm so glad my dad didn't take a rupee of ghoos.   Ik of a relative that resigned a year before their retirement because they had to be a part of huge ass ghotala in govt. Middle class family nai ho. There are few more relatives, all retired civil servants but coming from ancestral wealth and they worked only to kill time sort of.|||keep exposing|||Why isn’t anyone asking her this - how much taxes did you pay in 3 crore income? Income at this level is taxed at 39% in Nepal. Don't try to fool us - the taxes are supposed to be paid by you, not by the brands as you claimed. I want to see your tax returns. You claimed to be honest and talked about corporations evading taxes several times in your interviews. Can you show us that you paid income taxes for the money you claimed you earned as an influencer?|||She cannot stick to one story. She used to go around Harvard telling everyone that she received a prestigious Nepal government scholarship to fund her education. She lied about receiving the scholarship s she can appear smart amongst other students who got there on their own merit. She kept quiet for a long time when Nepali people asked her about her educational expenses. Now, all of a sudden, she is claiming she funded it with her own influencer money. |||My mom generation dont even know the name shrinkhala|||So I assume your story is true. I also studied in the states and I know how expensive it can get.   So how did she funded her education considering Harvard which is an ivy league school is extremely costly and on top of that, her lifestyle itself is on the high end. So..  In that case, even you since you studied in Harvard. How did you fund your education?  Just curious. A reply will be great since there are hundred of replies.|||Remember that education in Nepal is based on how well you do...based on your caste. I have heard that a lot of exams are predetermined by the ruling caste. This corruption is so bad that even well-educated people are falsely given a bad grade. While the latter is given a high passing grade. This type of discrimination is not only evil but can takes one's life. HK student commit suicide because of academic pressure. Shrinkhala might be clever but because of her caste she become popular.|||>Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking  Sounds like a good thing if the justice was carried out right and the accused was found guilty beyond all reasonable doubts.|||TLDR plz|||someone please summarize|||Tdlr?|||Hey, Shrinkhala we all know you lurk around in this sub, so care to defend yourself ?|||[deleted]|||Tl;dr guys ?|||jealous|||Hey there! I think there was a video where she said ki Nepal gov Wala scholarship ho vanera. Now it is not there(of course). Does somebody have that?|||Why it is always about shrinkhala, I am never going to vote her for her being at Harvard! Propoganda,?|||I would have asked for proof instead of baseless allegations, but with the level of vocabulary you chose I guess excludes the question.|||People beware of believing everything you read on Reddit. It's really easy to put dirty on people as it's anonymous|||TBH this all make no sense at all. can you post this on your public account IG or TikTok where people can see your face and account history?? The internet is dangerous and anyone can sit behind a screen make up stories and try to drag someone down just for attention. if you are really who you claim to be and if what you re saying about her is real then u need to show somethin that make sense. we need actual proof that you're a real person and that your story is true. and to be clear i 'am not asking for private or sensitive information i 'am asking for verifiable proof that doesn't expose personal data. post something that proves you are real AND U ACTUALLY KNEW HER not just a vouge words from behind an anonymous screen's.  you could show a public Harvard profile or alumni directory link with your name on it or simple photo of a Harvard ID or an official enrollment or graduation letter. without something like that, this is just baseless gossip. the internet is full of people who spread lies to ruin others, and that's exactly why nobody should take your words seriously without real evidence. if you truly care about the truth you'd stand behind your claims publicly. otherwise, what you're saying is just another reminder of how dangerous and misleading the internet can be when people use it to spread rumors without accountability.|||Give us some proof OP. How can we blindly trust u? And its a burner acc. So biswas ni ksari laus??|||Ai to the rescue|||Srinkhala Creating Burner account to talk about Srinkhala|||Source?|||Could you provide proof that you did in fact study at harvard e.g a pic of your student id (you can cover any info that might lead you to your real identity) with your username written on a paper on the side or something like that just so we can prove you actually studied there in case they wanna call you a liar|||This is quite literally written by AI like word for word.

I think her winning Ms Nepal helped; also her access to many social works would have helped with her application. But still getting into Harvard is not a small feat- so she must have some intellectual capacity to get picked by the best educational institutions in the world.|||All I can say here is that who ever wrote this has poor English and I am doubtful he/she/they attended Harvard.|||Your views on her seem completely emotion-based, lacking any factual concreteness. They exude your bitterness towards her. I think you envy her followers ( which you have mentioned a lot) and her beauty, its common for ugly people to have this jealousy. Her prowess is enough to get admitted into Harvard and she also has a private architecture company. You creating a burner account to throw dirt at her shows your pettiness as well.|||So she was just like an ordinary college student like all of us, so what if she wasn’t a studious/intellectual kid, still she was an opportunist, many of us are & maybe that turned out in her favour. And there is nothing wrong with this. She was a title holder that’s why she could be getting benefited after that. Plus, getting into Harvard is not everyone’s cup of tea no matter how much money one wishes to spend. Frankly speaking, linking her Harvard degree with nepotism& corruption is making ordinary people like us into more likely believing her part of the story. Targeting her is only gonna make her more famous, still 900k+ followers believe her part. She is getting sympathy from people as people are still forgetting about the real agenda and getting jealous about her getting into Harvard.|||i mean knowing she did try to contribute to nepal rest of the thing was from the breakup scandal right , i don't know about the beauty though everyon is beautiful you try to find it !!!the system will surely benefit her , but a lot of people are unaware of transparecy can't connect the dot in larger scale if she can do great things with her face that has been blessed and for the achievement sh won once title ie miss nepal, she should do great things for the nation in upcoming years and time and hope she get equal value from the scandals!! and serve !!!|||[deleted]|||Still Beautiful though",

One for the 165 candidates who are elected directly (first-past-the-post), other for the party. The votes that party gets determine the remaining 110 members via proportional representation.  so aba either we need new political parties to replace the existing ones by Falgun 21, or we have to vote for the same parties again. This is more complicated because Nepal is not just Kathmandu. The political players which we have termed jholey will be active outside Kathmandu.   So if we need the change in constitution, we have to be more careful. The mandates of the movement are more at risk now than before.",

I think we can't really blame them if they are taking information form joley media of Nepal.|||I hope people of Nepal are not falling for the same trap that destroyed Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. What looked like a well organised protest against govt, soon uncovered itself as regime change operations by deep state.|||We Support Nepal 🇮🇳|||He hardly has any reach tbh. He is rather seen as a clown who has been trying to incite youth against the establishment since more than 7 years now but fails terribly at it. Most of his views on youtube are manipulated & paid (bots etc). & a chunk of his viewership is rather from Pakistan & Bangladesh.  Edit: Also he is lying.|||Most well informed Indians are aware that this dissent had been brewing for quite sometime. Wish my Nepali bros and sis the best of luck and kudos for taking back what is rightfully yours . Hopefully the guilty are brought to justice, order is restored and right representatives are assigned to take Nepal forward for all its wonderful people. As for our media, they sell whatever gets views from the masses, tomorrow if Sita maa has comeback to be the Queen of Nepal sells, they'll start posting that, organizing debate sessions with clown for cheap entertainment. 🤡 I pray the martry RIP, their families fairly and properly compensated , justice is fast tracked, and a votes held  new govt formation.  Goodspeed Nepalis. 🇳🇵|||This mf is just an islamist puppet. We don't need him.|||Dhruv Rathee is fucking sellout.  He is scam, biased and no body takes him seriously.  His startup was also a scam.|||Bruh, this guy is a charlatan.|||Broken clock moment for Agent Dhruv Rathee - do not fall for his propaganda. I am not sure which media is being blamed here but what I see is that the media channels are saying the “Anti corruption “ protests.   Low IQ news media doesn’t count as even Indians know that they are sensationalise everything|||I’m Indian! There is no propaganda. KP Oli is hated by India and Indians, so Infact we support it.  Indians think KP Oli has- 1) Ruined ties with India, keeps making claims that Ayodhya is actually in Nepal  2) CCP puppet, keeps insulting India and chooses china  3) Hasn’t visited India in 4 years he’s been PM, even though India and Nepal are very important partners.   Guys the Modi government is NOT a supporter of KP Oli, the news articles are misinformed and have low knowledge & context about the events in Nepal. I hope our Nepali brethren understand this on our behalf. Thank you 🙏|||Don't fall for him Nepali brothers , he has his own personal interests. Indians are with You 🇳🇵🇮🇳|||OP more than india he has more reach in pakistan and bangladesh 🤣|||Indian media is saying that this was a protest against corruption. dhruv rathee always has his agenda. He is the one who is misleading|||Right message, wrong messenger|||Even Indians don't take Dhruv Rathee seriously. We only care about peace and tranquility in Nepal.|||[removed]|||He is late as always trying to prove his clowness , media already started to show the true reasons for the protest|||There seems to be no valid narrative. If it was against corruption then the protest should have stopped after government stepping down. But what happened after that - people are destroying and burning their country’s asset, their parliament, airports and banks etc - this is not the way it should have gone down if this was about corruption only.   Now instead of corruption in the office it’s anarchy on the streets.|||total international media is reporting it as social media but india ==godi  the reason i hate these nepalis|||Western media were reporting the same no?|||His favorite president Trump can't wait to start acting as president of Nepal. Definitely US is definitely behind this.|||Don't believe in this joker.|||Why nepalis are so obsessed with what indian and indian media is saying, why don't they focus on what chinese media is saying as they consider china as their friend so why worry or think about what indian are saying, they don't consider india as their friend so why so much focus on india?|||If you think Dhruv Rathee is telling the truth, then I have an Eiffel Tower to sell you. This person is a grade A propagandist of the anti-BJP front. All his tweets are made on the behest of his masters, and he has been called out multiple times for this.|||FYI—-> Social media isn’t just mirroring conflicts happening in schools and on streets – it’s triggering new ones!|||he is against modi gov only.|||Dhruv Rathee is one of the people who remains a part of opposition forever. That doesn’t mean he is wrong always but sometimes yes! It is not just Indian media it is international media but most of them are correcting themselves now which is good. Although his comments are still wrong in many ways. Social media ban was a ignition for this protest because corruption is going on from a longtime. But people should think what’s next? Youth leaders are going to step up and take positions to govern? Do they have that kind of unity? And do you think don’t they turn into corrupt due to powers? Great initiative by youth but think about what’s next |||All of us Indians know this. What are you saying?|||I don't know what are you talking about. Most coverage of Indian media is overtly positive.   This is because our love towards Nepal is same as our hate towards that Chinese puppet Oli.   If you see any doubt in our media or people, it is because we have a slight doubt if CIA or ISI will start using Nepal as a ground to disturb India.   Nepal can be a smaller country, but they are much more older nation state than us with full of brilliant souls and whatever Nepalis choose for their country, we respect that from core.  But never think this Rathee fellow has any love towards you guys. He's just putting gun over your shoulder to attack India. He is not even an Indian citizen. He is a compromised soul to the highest bidder.|||German shepherd....he only spreads propaganda...beware of him .... Nepal|||This dhruv rati guy is himself an idiot 🤣🤣|||If you consider German/US funded Dhruv Rathee as flag bearer of honest opinion then you have fallen for exactly the narrative that the 'west' wants you to believe.  Mental colonization happens much before the physical one, this has already happened in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Pakistan look where they are at this time  Beware whom you trust and what you believe.|||It's actually USA, they did the same to Bangladesh last year |||Yesterday I saw a nepali post on Instagram where an Indian mentioned in the comment that the same protest should be done in India and everyone was bashing that guy and calling him out for bringing India in the topic. I hope they see this post|||[removed]|||[removed]|||I'm from Bihar India idk about this situation so I'm here for reading what's going on|||India has (rightly) stayed out of this. It's an internal issue of Nepal and we wish them peace and prosperity. Let normalcy be restored soon.|||Why you even taking him seriously.|||It's quite obvious to everyone in India, except the media narrative. I doubt anyone here believes that our Nepali brothers were protesting to assert their right to doomscroll.  People don't go to extremes in protesting against social media.  And govts don't ban all social media apps, just because the companies didn't \"register with them\". they do it, because they see the narrative has gone against them, and they desperately want to gain back the control.|||This guy ain’t even an Indian citizen|||[https://youtu.be/CXEMBDjnoWU?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/CXEMBDjnoWU?feature=shared) watch this|||This guy has some personal beef with modi and his party .

We have civilization connect that exists for thousands of years. Far before countries as a concept existed. Seeing our people in pain hurts us. 2. Indian mainstream media is shit. Even we don't entertain them. Each passing day their credibility is decreasing in India. 3. Dhruv rathi is also shit. Even his credibility is decreasing each passing day. One hypocrisy at a time. 4. From the bottom of our hearts we hope things calm down there and change for the better for the people of Nepal. I am sure if Nepal wants, the govt in India would love to help however possible (No strings attached) not unlike the hand we gave to srilanka in their time of need Because we understand what it is like to go through a state of political unrest.

You don't need any validation from germany ka kukkur.|||Guys, I assume everyone here has someone in their family with some political ties. I too have. But that doesn't mean I have direct ties with them. JHOLEY and BHEDA is a noun that defines people who blindly believe in a person or a political party.      Talking about myself, I am already 36, a father and I am thinking of raising my family here in Nepal. I was totally against going abroad as a student when there was trend to do so. But the political system was never stable here. However, This current GenZ revolution happened against corruption. We indeed got a good progress against these corrupt leaders. But things turned out to be different and here is my roller coaster of emotions. Please let me know if you can relate to this.  Day 0: Social Media Ban - Mixed feelings. Hopeful that social medias will proceed further with registration.  Day 1: GenZ revolution and killing - Lots of anger. Disappointment and discontent.  Day 2: Revolution, excited and happy till 4 PM, until we destroyed the party system. Once the public started destroying Singha Durbar, I came to realize what I had done. I started a fire that I can't extinguish.  Day 3: Realization of the revolution being hijacked. We were just against corruption, regime change was not our motto. The revolution gradually turned into a COLOR REVOLUTION.  Day 4: Worried about who will lead the country. Started mentally supporting Balen/Rabi or any young leader. Furious, since the army asked GenZ to come up with a leader. Finally Hami Nepal, some guys funded by Deep state along with Sanduk Ruit and Swarnim Wagle came into light. They started talking about regime change and Constitution change. They said they directly want to select Zelensky as their prime minister.   Day 5: Much more disappointed as some kids who are aiming to go abroad for future study is electing prime minister through Discord. Sushila Karki elected as PM. Which is some sort of relief. I feared a autocrat.  Day 6 - Day 7: China is yet to acknowledge PM Sushila Karki. China is suspecting foul play as KP Oli had been to SCO and all of this happened just after that.      Now I am very much in distress. I feel that, Nepal is Ukraine. Balen is the new Zelensky and China is the new Russia. I dont want to think negatively but the situation ahead seems to be very dark and we will have to take steps cautiously. There are a lot of hatred here and Social medias are fueling it. None of the GenZ were born during the writing of the constitution. There were lots of revolution that was endured by current revolution Maoist Revolution, Madesh Revolution etc. But now it seems everything has gone to waste and there is no constitution here in the country. Is this PTSD?|||Its not true narrative this is all funded by cia|||Ye Media bik chuka hai|||[removed]|||Nepal, you are dealing with dangerous, insecure, violent crybullies who don't care about reasons and motives because they'll just come up with fake news and use that is their motive.

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not “revolution,” it’s not “justice,” and it sure as hell isn’t “the voice of the people.” It’s mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn’t make you brave—it makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that—surrounded by a wave of so-called “youths” who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let’s not sugarcoat it—the so-called Gen Z “warriors” hiding in the mob weren’t heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country’s social fabric. He still can’t step foot in certain countries because he’s internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he’s propped up as a “leader.”  Let’s be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn’t an accident—it was a setup. While Deuba’s family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don’t get it twisted—those sharpshooters in the crowd weren’t just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres—former insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let’s stop pretending this was “the people rising up.” It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist—the one who drowned this nation in blood—walks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don’t for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn’t that Deuba suffered humiliation—the real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn’t a flower; he’s a weed choking the soil of Nepal’s democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too naïve to realize they’re being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||CIA & India Agents involved in chaos!

We have 2 ways to do it,    1. Create your own political party   2. Partner with other party (I don't know which on is it)    We clearly need some reforms, here are some of the things that we have realized in past few days,      1. Freedom of speech: This whole social media saga was caused due to the government wanting to squash people's right to express their opinions. We need to have stronger freedom of speech rights enshrined in the constitution.  We cannot have our rights taken away at the whim of a politician.    2. Police use of force: We need a clear law that strictly forbids any use of lethal force against the demonstrations. If there are individuals acting against the law they should be arrested and dealt with lawfully while fully adhering to human rights.    3. Accountability in public services: Public Service is clearly the engine of Nepal and our public services are run in not so great manner. This is a much harder problem to solve as it is so deeply engrained in our society. However, we need a change here, this is where all our budget ends up and this is the engine that is responsible for sustainable development. We need to hold the people accountable, however we cannot hold anyone accountable if we do not have any transparent data. This is why we need to have a digitization drive, we need to digitize everything from documents to processes, digitization has one huge upside, the data processing can be automated and made very visible. There is no running away once you have 10 digital signatures in your name. This is the only way we can create more accountability. This is how we can track how every rupee of our budget gets used, who gets the government contract, how much work gets done etc.     4. Retirement age and term limits: This is a must, we need a clear retirement age for the public positions just like other jobs.     These sort of things are fundamental of any country, without getting the fundamentals right we cannot expect our country to do better. We have a chance to make things better, lets take this chance.|||also i think! what lessons can be learned from Bangladesh last year?|||Garni nai ho vani presidency system lyauni.

So far, governments have been perceived as an means to an end. An \"all purpose\" solution to everything. But, the truth as we see is, if we run a country like a company or an organization; the heads are going to skim off the profit. We should be thinking as governments as a tool to enable each individual to govern themselves.   We are all human beings, we have it in us to know right from wrong; but the way society is built corrupts each of our minds. The role of the government should be to tackle the corruption of the society, and vice versa and then only we might hope for a government that is not corrupt.   Why is it a mandate to live under a rule? Why do human beings need to be ruled in the first place? Isnt it because we have become too ignorant to want to learn for ourselves what right living is and live our life based on mandated statements?.   So, instead of a permanent static structure to rule(mandates that everyone agrees we follow); i purpose a dynamic government structure that reiterates itself organically with each change demanded by society. And the society has to give an extreme importance to \"self learning\" of human values. It is extremely essential that the young are taught by actions and observations and not texts. A child who grows up in solidarity; understands the value of it.  We are lost;we have seen too much division among ourselves to now deeply believe in the goodness in everyone. We can still try to change, try to be a human being with human values.and maybe the next generation will have a chance to see a better world , a world without division. A world where the value of life is \"superseded by nothing\".|||Start by advocating for cryptocurrency reform. BTC= freedom. Freedom from control. Freedom from remittance fees.

I know that indian media is misreporting the revolution as silly protests to reinstate scrapy social media and belittle the ambition of GenZ. Media wants the status quo in India forever. They belittled the Bangladesh protests similarly and painted it as Muslims vs Hindus in Bangladesh. They paint a high opinion of the fugitive Shaik Hasina but curse Nobel laureate Mohammed Yunus. Indian media is the judge, jury and executioner of all the happenings in Nepal, Bangladesh, Srilanka and Pakistan. According to them, India is Ramarajya but others were Raavan rajya. India has become a dead democracy in the past decade. We have no jobs, extremely costly education and no health. We are just scrapping by but nothing to show as the media paints cooked up Indian GDP. Baba's have become politicians, industrialists and millionaires. Politicians just encourage the industry of religion. Their children reap the benefits and others' children subsist on rationed rice.

It’s tragic, because they also have families back home and face the same struggles as the rest of us. They should be victims of this system too, yet they show little compassion or critical thought about what’s happening around them. Why are there protests in the first place? I refuse to believe they're blind to people's frustration and the direction the country is heading.  I still remember when we joined a protest 14–15 years ago. The police confronted us aggressively, and as kids we were too confused to react. Fortunately, we just stood there processing and visibly confused, and they left — but I still shudder to think, *what if our reaction had been different?* Today’s young protestors are in the same position, pure in their intentions, simply voicing frustration without wanting harm.  And honestly, credit must go to these protestors. They know exactly what they are standing for, unlike us back then who needed adults to organise us. I don’t see how demonstrations could be any more peaceful than they already are — especially when the very leaders being protested against have blood on their hands from before this generation was even born.|||Yo bhatey haru kahi gayera sitcha holani|||randi baan machikne haru|||I mean this tracks, they only like when you're corrupt|||Its not andolan anymore its war|||We want death or at lease exile of KP Oli and other taukes.|||Randi haruko photo, name, address patta lagau.|||shamelss dogs of government|||Machikne radi harlai lakhetdai marnaparne|||Thuiyaa police vanauda haruuu|||you radiko ban harulai agolauno man xa|||ma sanga pani ganhune bhaye, kassam mardinthe radieekko ban|||Mathi bata aako order re ????

Just look at the way they incite violence like it’s nothing!! Talking about burning down houses and people is nothing!! This is not a right foundation.

What people expected him to do.  The man himself has said enough in his posts.   It’s what, he DIDN’T do that impresses me the most about him. Saying “No” is harder than saying “Yes”, when everyone wanted him to say “Yes”.  (Think about this.)  He put out only a couple of posts, which I think served as guide posts during the revolution.   1. He was the first widely known public figure (that I know) who defined who Gen Z was and gave his support to the protest. 2. When the tempo rose, he clarified that Gen Z should lead, he accepted Sushila even when all of his cultists were going crazy about making him the interim PM.  Removing himself from the picture, brought focus back on the revolution and the task ahead, rather than turn the confusion situation, even more confusing with a popularity contest as a side gig.   There is a lot of things to think about and I think in time we can all make sense of it all.   That’s my two paisa about him.|||Leading KTM municipality vs leading the nation are totally different. The followers of Balen urging and rushing him to lead 'right now' and come out by 2PM are the same people who will criticize him within one year if he were to be them PM someday. They don't have patience and want to see changes immediately.  Personally, I would like to see him running in the upcoming election as deputy/vice roles first and not immediate PM role...assuming how parties will be formed and if there are any good lead independent candidate who will run with him. He's one of those few worthy to be PM but this is not his peak yet. He just became a mayor like 3 years ago and he still has a lot to show to the general public. If and when he wins to the election, it will be his peak and he has high chances of being a two term PM...assuming two term limit will be in place hopefully. Time will tell.|||GenZ aren't immune to celeb worship culture.|||Hami Nepal has already stated it was part of a plan and they want balen for 5 years. So did they fight for the nation or for the balen is the real question? Why are they biased for balen only and not for other groups of good people?|||About your 2nd picture.  Yes it is definitely an opportunistic behaviour by balen. But how is this behaviour wrong and how is taking over PM position now and securing interim govt now and not taking part in politics for next 5 years do any good to the country.    He is practicing patience to achieve the goal he desires and what people actually wants from a young leader like him. Look throughout the history of world politics, paitence has always been the key factor to shape the world politics.|||Having trusted by many even me,In the moment of national threat, he could do nothing. That’s the reason I doubt him.  i think he is not completely responsible for being the Prime Minister. Sure, he is a great person. He’s doing such a great thing in the valley, but being a Prime Minister is very responsible post, his way up talking to seniors, saying I will put fire to SinghaDurbar, I will bury everyone if you’re in tudinkhel, getting carried away by emotions, being Prime Minister means you should not be carried away by any emotions and none of the factors should affect your judgment which you believe to be true and is lawful, Hopefully he will make such changes and we can finally see him in the top, as much as I want him to be the Prime Minister I do think he is inexperienced and immature in this field,|||We are so far behind that criticizing political leader sounds like a hater. We are not even to the point where we could say “This person is bad/clueless , country isn’t safe with them”. For the past decade, the corrupted 3 have been playing nothing but tato aloo with us so its natural to be sticking nail to current situation. Give it some time and our voices will get echoed.|||If there’s one thing old political leaders never learned, it was how to handle criticism. The moment anyone spoke up, they tried to shut it down and let’s not even start on the behavior of their hardcore supporters(jholey as we call them).  Even leaders like Balen need to address this with their own supporters, as do all the new representatives entering the upcoming elections. They must say publicly that they welcome criticism, will reflect on it, and use it as a tool for improvement. Leaders should make it clear to their base: don’t bully or silence people for simply asking questions or raising concerns. Do not perform character assassination against someone just for criticizing. After all, in a democracy, freedom of speech is our right.  At the same time, we the general public also carry responsibility. We need to recognize the difference between constructive criticism and defamation. What we must not do is fall for propaganda, spread rumors, or engage in baseless character assassination.  And if we realize that our criticism or questioning was wrong, we should have the courage to apologize in the same way we raised the question. After all, apologizing will never make you small. It’s just a simple five letter word: “Sorry.” A word that can and should be spoken from both sides.|||Just because you’re against the system, doesn’t make you Balen-Supporters. Balen has no experience. Balen should wait and gain some experience. Criticism is a backbone of democracy and one must welcome it.|||EXACTLY. They lack this ability to critically analyse any action of any leader. Like no one is perfect and no one is a good. Let's be honest. Let's criticize people for their actions. People should be held accountable for their actions. Most importantly, leaders who run our nation. If we don't point out their wrongdoings, will they ever stop? Nepalese have such a bheda mindset, istg. Let's be more aware and let's know how to discern leaders and their actions.   By criticizing these leaders, we aren't hating on them. We're trying to bring awareness so that they won't repeat the same thing again and can do things better for the country.|||They need to be aware party KO jhole become jhole because they were andabhakt of party leader ( just like they are blind follower of balen rn)|||I think holding politicians accountable is crucial. I hope people realize we don’t need  more devotees and followers. We need critical, educated thinkers. Support the good work, appreciate your favorite leader but don’t forget to question often. People change. Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Need to always stay cautious. |||Agreed|||Thanks man, you speaked my words. I see people thanking Balen for this movement and saying he was the reason this movement happened and succeeded and all after Sushila Karki became interim PM, and this made me very sad for actual people who started the movement and also faced the consequences and this was even more big realization for me for how blind youth and supporters these days are and this concerns me even more for future|||This. This is what I’ve been saying for some time. Like the post says, I’ve also been labeled as a party ko jhole and what not. Even here in this sub, people have called me jhole lol just because I questioned him.  I am a Balen supporter. I supported him and did my part by sharing about his campaign on social media and making everyone aware about it. And I was super happy when he won, I still am. But I’ve been criticizing him on various points that I find valid. The top one is communication.  During the election, he constantly criticized Bidya Sundar (the previous mayor) for not communicating publicly. He even said that once he became mayor, he wouldn’t be like that and would stay in constant touch. He proposed starting a ‘Mayor with the Public’ TV program and even set aside a budget for it, but nothing has happened. He hasn’t given a single interview.  And then come his jhole supporters who always argue with the same line: ‘Pailai kei chaieko ho.’ With that logic, we should never question anyone. Just look at how Balen has become now, he just posts one-sided, no-context Facebook statuses and nothing else.|||Balen is a hypocrite in my opinion, like he encouraged the protest and even promised to provide a safe and secure environment for the protest but when things turned south he vanished like horn from a donkeys head|||Finally someone spoke about this, belun has literally become a god complex among some people out there, which is kinda concerning, the only time he speaks is to not let his adhabhatka interfere in every other stuff out there. If he just sits in his office chair waiting mindlessly while everybody is reaching him out to take a step then its alarming, is he really a possible prime minister candidate?? doubt huna thalchha, veda harlai feri yo bhanda pachdaina, he has some done good things too as a mayor but idk has he not abandon us when we needed him most? Aba desh ko yo awasta ma he is not a good leader anyways, pachhi aba j hunchha dekha jayega. Hope we rise again from the ashes.|||Balen is just a hype, he has never been a mayor of citizens; he is mayor of RONB; if there was no RONB, he would never have existed!|||Ony the strong system maketh the county!

If he choose to be interim PM then people would have said he planned this all to come to power and be dictator.   Also he got death threats during that time.|||it depends on his role during these 2 days. back support thiyo bhane that is good.

His support ismuch needed in this time as he is the face of gen z, even though he wants it or not.|||Wait, you think Balen should have stepped up to be the PM? I personally don't think he has the temperament (though if there's a choice between any big parties' leader and Balen, I'd choose Balen every time).|||Aru kura thik ho, but can’t say he abandoned. It’s not 100% sure he will be the next PM so can’t call him opportunist.|||Yes ,|||Very well said|||While I am unsure on balen and his move, yes! To select a leader, you do have to question. Even the one you support. That is transparency. That is the trust that has foundation|||You’re right. In Nepal, many people tend to follow leaders without much critical thought, even when those leaders don’t necessarily act in their favor. Unfortunately, this habit seems to persist across generations. If the younger generation continues with the same mindset, there’s a real risk that the country could end up facing the same challenges in the future that we are experiencing today.|||You can make your own assumptions and narratives. If Balen had taken the post of PM, you would have said that he is opportunistic, that he enraged protestors just to get the position. I saw somewhere on Facebook, even before Balen’s official post on sushila karki that balen played dirty game for the sake of pm position. As far as I know, Balen is a farsighted person. He only comes forward when he feels fully prepared.|||That's my whole point, but again..vanepachi manche lai jholey nai lagcha. 😅 Guy's, learn to ask questions yourself too.

But ever since I saw him become mayor, I have always seen him wearing Nepali dress most of the time and consistently working to conserve our heritage and culture.  You know what? He is still better than most of the people there. Whatever he does, he has never done anything wrong. Stop pretending to be so-called critics for useless reasons. What is your academic background, and what makes you think that way? Have you ever felt the difference between past and present Kathmandu? I have a friend from the core area of Kathmandu, do you know what his opinion about Balen Shah is? No!  Even Harka Sampang is a very good person. Moreover, Sagar Dhakal’s brother has been working actively to eradicate the dictatorship of these political parties. Maybe your parents are bootlicking those rotten political parties, so you only see what Balen has never done and will never do. Just because he supported the movement does not mean he said he wants to become prime minister. You must understand that he posts only a few things because his words are weapons. One word from him has many consequences in such a movement. He is very clever and very wise; unlike Harka Sampang, though I like Harka as a person. But you need to give Balen full power to unlock his full potential. He wants change, he wants revolution, and he wants to remove corrupt politicians.

If Balen had come out saying he’s ready to lead, a lot of people would’ve jumped in claiming he planned the whole movement and just used Gen Z for his own benefit. That’s probably why in his statements, he keeps stressing that this is Gen Z’s movement and that the government will be formed by them. imo, staying out of it was the smartest move he could have made.  I’m all for questioning and criticizing leaders. I agree that its a problem if you dont want to do it. But when someone has shown that they are dedicated, not corrupt, and actually get things done, you’ve got to give them some benefit of the doubt. Save the tough questions for real concerns. Dont critise just because you think no one can ever be good enough.|||Yes Balen has fallen badly as he didnt seem to care about the youths when they needed him the most. But, when we are talking about selection of interim PM, he did the right thing by not coming out. If he had come out, more number of the youngsters would have gone to Army Headquarters causing a ruckus. Thankfully, that didnt happen. It could have been worse than Harka dai case. It still remains a fact that he could have interacted with us when he we needed him the most.|||such simple world if it did exist why would so many intellects be in the world of politics.

But I’m sure even he does not know he’s a small puppet planted/invested long ago. Usually foreign powers will not directly direct its agenda, especially for the country at the bottom of the barrel they do not have the time to do so. You just give them small aid, support for us, for them simple investment, which they just got good return this time, especially now east is rising its economy. You just need to nudge them, give them support they will do their good vs evil thing which any human will do. Think about it, nobody was going forward with stance like him to take on some kind of leader role, because we do not have that power (support) and as human we fear unknown.  You might think I’m thinking too much of this. Well, I can’t argue you, because I do not know for sure, but this is my stance and most probable thing I saw.",

Okay, let's say we save the Constitution. This means Deuba will become Prime Minister. How?  Let me explain.  After PM Oli resigned, the process of forming a new government according to the constitution is:  The steps for government formation, according to Article 76, are as follows:  * **76(1):** The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority of seats in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(2):** If no party has a clear majority, the President appoints a Member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with the support of two or more parties. * **76(3):** If a government cannot be formed under the above clauses, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister. * **76(5):** If the Prime Minister appointed under clause (3) fails to obtain a vote of confidence, the President can appoint any member of the House who provides a basis for securing confidence in the House.  If this constitution remains, Anyone will take the decision of appointing Sulisha Karki ( or Balen or Harka or anyone) to the court, and the Court will overthrow the government. Even Political Parties ( Congress, UML Maobadi ) have started to say Save the constitution and save the parliament.  76 (3) = Deuba PM. Though he may not get a vote of confidence, and eventually parliament will dissolve via 76(5). Deuba will act as interim PM and will conduct Elections.  So all these Protests and destruction for nothing?  Please research, talk to ChatGPT yourself and learn the current constitution. Anything we do if the current constitution remains will be challenged in court, and the court will just explain it to us the hard way. Either way, you guys are fucked. Deal with Either OLI, DEUBA or Prachanda.  SO the only Solution.  Scrape this Constitution.  The only suitable Solution is to bring back the Older Constitution ( 2047 ) or enter into another endless loop of writing a new constitution again, with all sorts of political groups starting their own riots and protests all over Nepal. Which will again take 10-15 years, and Nepal can't afford that.|||Bhai k bolay of course they do not represent all but it's hard to represent all of 30m and listen to all their voices I think due to India and China we tend to forget we also do have a huge population   They were talking about the same topic because a clear majority was not identified and one of our demands was no government on coalition but saying that I know it's our mistake for not reaching a conclusion fast    BUT,BUT,BUT improving your tone in your voice I see frustration that should not be the case this is a battle of narrative which is hardest to win we need every voice of reason Instead give advice Please do not argue with me on this one|||Guys what's the name of the discord server again?

He pushed Nepal towards democracy and republicanism.   He gave poor villagers and lower-caste groups a voice in national politics.   He increased women’s participation in politics and society, with many ex-fighters now active in leadership roles.   In western hills and Madhesh, state institutions were weak or absent. Villagers depended on landlords for loans, justice, and protection, which kept exploitation unchallenged (Kamaiya, Haruwa-Charuwa, Haliya systems). His movement gave villagers confidence to defy landlords for the first time.   Fighters who believed they sacrificed for justice and equality still respect him as the leader who turned their struggle into a new political order.

Hundreds of people ganging up on one family is not “revolution,” it’s not “justice,” and it sure as hell isn’t “the voice of the people.” It’s mob violence at its ugliest. Beating an elderly leader and his wife in front of the world doesn’t make you brave—it makes you the lowest kind of coward.  Sher Bahadur Deuba, whatever criticisms people may have of his politics, did not deserve to be cornered like that—surrounded by a wave of so-called “youths” who were nothing more than pawns of the Maoist machinery. These were not independent citizens acting out of anger; these were people mobilized, trained, and emboldened by the Maoist playbook. Let’s not sugarcoat it—the so-called Gen Z “warriors” hiding in the mob weren’t heroes, they were cowards who hid behind the shadow of Maoist cadres to do their dirty work.  And while Nepalese people clap and cheer as if humiliating an elderly statesman is some kind of moral victory, they conveniently ignore the elephant in the room: the Maoist party and its leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda. This man is directly responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 Nepalis during the civil war. He commanded militias that slaughtered civilians, extorted villages, and tore apart the country’s social fabric. He still can’t step foot in certain countries because he’s internationally recognized as a terrorist. And yet, somehow, instead of accountability, he’s propped up as a “leader.”  Let’s be brutally honest: this entire circus was engineered by Prachanda to sideline Congress leaders like Deuba. The intelligence gap on the day of the attack wasn’t an accident—it was a setup. While Deuba’s family suffered public humiliation and beatings at the hands of the mob, Prachanda and his own family conveniently vanished, untouched and unseen. That timing? Too perfect. That silence? Too loud. It reeks of a plan designed to cripple Deuba, humiliate Arzu Rana, and destabilize Oli, all in one sweep.  And don’t get it twisted—those sharpshooters in the crowd weren’t just random protestors. They were Maoist-trained YCL cadres—former insurgents with military discipline, battlefield experience, and access to military-grade weapons. No other party in Nepal has those kinds of resources at hand. So let’s stop pretending this was “the people rising up.” It was Maoists unleashing their private army while hiding behind the faces of frustrated youth.  Nepalis today need to ask themselves a hard question: are you really celebrating justice, or are you celebrating the cowardly act of humiliating an old man and his wife while the real terrorist—the one who drowned this nation in blood—walks free and pulls the strings from behind the curtain? If the government truly ordered the deaths of innocent youths, then let the bullets recovered from the incident speak and let Oli face trial. But don’t for a second confuse mob violence against the Deubas with bravery. That was weakness, insecurity, and political theater at its worst.  The real crime isn’t that Deuba suffered humiliation—the real crime is that the man who should be rotting in prison for crimes against humanity is still calling the shots in Nepal. Prachanda isn’t a flower; he’s a weed choking the soil of Nepal’s democracy. And the so-called Gen Z, blinded by slogans and manipulated by Maoist propaganda, are too naïve to realize they’re being used as pawns in his endless lust for power.|||Prachanda and Baburam are India's puppet.

This has been ongoing for more than two decades. Behind the few visible figures, there are countless others who have either assisted them or benefitted through their association—ranging from major brands in Nepal to traders. For example, Sher Bahadur Deuba’s son and his sanitary pad importing company stand as an illustration.  They have institutionalized corruption by appointing foreign ambassadors based on party loyalty and financial gains, extending even to the transfer of bureaucrats to preferred locations in exchange for bribes and other undue benefits. The problem is not limited to the political system alone; bureaucrats, too, require checks and balances. A mechanism must be established to regulate the power of bureaucrats over politicians. Since bureaucrats are permanent stakeholders, their influence is even greater. One effective way to mitigate this is to appoint domain experts as ministers—for instance, a professional civil engineer as a minister cannot be misled about the cost estimates of a construction project.  There remains much to be done. Moreover, these political parties will attempt to form alliances before elections, bringing forward the same candidates and restoring the same exploitative system. Therefore, the first and most meaningful reform must be a change in the electoral process, with the inclusion of a “NOTA” (None of the Above) option.  Further accountability can be ensured by eliminating political appointments to certain positions. At present, even temporary (karar) appointments are made based on party affiliation rather than merit. As a result, even highly qualified experts are compelled to seek political approval. The recent appointments of Vice-Chancellors at B.P. Koirala Institute in Dharan and Gangalal Hospital are prime examples.  In addition to these issues, several other structural flaws persist.

We burned our own rights.  4. Supreme Court, Bar Council, Attorney Office: They were our chance, flawed but still a place for justice. We turned them into ashes with our own hands.  5. Singha Durbar : Not just offices, but history and architecture. A royal palace that carried Nepal’s story, gone in flames. Our history, our pride, our royal palace. We didn’t just burn walls, we burned our own heritage.  6. Hilton Hotel : A private property and why? A symbol of tourism and foreign trust.

The violence, the firings, the destruction of government offices, freeing of prisoners, and burning of data is a tragedy that will haunt us. But we can’t let this be the end. If we stop now, we’ll only sink deeper into crisis and foreign powers like India, China, or the US will interfere. We can’t afford to become another failed state.    Yes, yesterday we made mistakes destroying Singha Durbar, burning private property(But in my opinion it wasn't gen z who started that, many political people or people with other intention must have led them to do that.) We have to investigate that, if we find anything, it will be so important for further, for choosing the leaders) But instead of drowning in sadness, we need to channel this pain into solutions.  This is the time to seek the truth, like who let Rabi out, and who is really behind the chaos. And this is also the time to seriously research those stepping forward to lead, people like Sushila Karki and others. We must check their education, experience, and their capacity to take responsibility, there background on corruption and role and everything.   One wrong choice now will cost Nepal for decades.

This corrupt behavior has been determined to be unacceptable by the people being exploited, as can also be seen in this image.|||What clowns they are burning there own country down and also burning alive the ex pms wife hahahahahahhaha i mean you people have become what you wanted to remove|||Dilbhusan Pathak will refund it, don't worry.|||[ Removed by Reddit ]|||I think the main reason is Arzu Deuba. People watched her speech where she said stuff like, “What’s my son supposed to do for a living now? We come from a poor family. If I have to buy timber from Malaysia, how am I going to build a house?”  But then, on the other side, her son had this super lavish wedding. And when ordinary people see that, it hits differently. Like, kids from poor families study for years, their parents work in the fields just to send them to school, but even after all that, people like me still don’t have jobs. We apply everywhere, but nobody takes us because we don’t have the right connections.  We don’t get any benefits from big hotels or malls either. The only way families like ours have survived is through farming or the money sent from abroad. What have we actually gained from all these businesses? Where are the jobs? At the end of the day, it’s still just remittance keeping everything running. So what are we supposed to do? That’s probably why people like me start having these thoughts.  We’re out here with no jobs, no respect, stuck in uncertainty, struggling just to cover our basic needs. Even then, we try to keep ourselves mentally stable somehow. But when Mrs. Deuba makes speeches like that, how can the blood of poor people’s kids not boil?  On top of that, there’s already so much frustration bottled up inside youth. Every one is  becoming insane, negative  youths are unemployed and mentally unstable .And when things like this trigger it, of course it turns violent. Because this have  been suppressed for so long, and now the mindset is like — “If we can’t reach anywhere through the system, then we might as well destroy it.”  And even if some third party tries to trigger people, the truth is, it was already there deep down in their subconscious. This is just it coming out. Right now it feels new, but honestly, it was bound to happen sooner or later.|||No Shit Sherlock (You guys got  manipulated into doing the wrong thing) 😔|||Sherey ko choro lai dhulai diye ki nai ?|||Each Hilton hotel employees 400+ Nepalese nationals 😂 what about the people that lost their jobs?|||https://preview.redd.it/muoumzxh6eof1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63da78ae8b2a74c1f669dc95f01e062ff9e299b0|||https://preview.redd.it/rjynwvrk6eof1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04a5f8cbe1243c2dfca73c29dea57aa5425243bf|||We could’ve turned this into Hospital but Nope|||This is an absolutely great work revolution.|||Aur Karo money money wali gand masti|||if you make a good system and government now that‘s important!

His rough almost mobster-like style may be off-putting to some but in a city like Dharan which is home to hotheaded Kirati / Hill Janajati majority that kind of toughness isn’t just useful, it’s necessary.  That said, he is neither qualified nor capable enough to be considered an ‘ideal’ Prime Minister.

If a person has done good work, both of them will be appreciated hands down. You have to look at the picture from both sides. Secondly, please ask your senior citizens or elders from a different generation. They have seen history and faced the consequences. The real issue is bringing change in the constitution, i.e., a representative should not be above a certain age and should be allowed to seek votes only for one term. Take that in writing from the concerned representative, live, and show it to the world clearly. Also, please do not discriminate by saying someone is from the “Stone Age,” as such remarks can hurt the sentiments of people who are not from cities.|||Yes, I don't know what to.

Even he ignored and disagree with the Loan to be used from ADB ( Asian Development Bank ) . 6) He speaks and protest on his own way BUT still he has some flaws unlike us even the moon has flaws then he is still human . ra usko flaws we can ignore .

            "body": "What comes next? The only reason Nepal isn't going through a complete currency de-valuation and a bank run is because of the rupee peg. We need to tread water carefully. (**Bank run** is a situation where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits from a bank simultaneously, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or financial stability. This can lead to liquidity problems for the bank, as it may not have enough cash on hand to meet the withdrawal demands. Bank runs can create a cycle of panic, potentially leading to the bank's failure.)  The real pain starts after the protests have calmed. Economic crash is certain. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh both went through it. Stock market/real estate crash, inflation and what not.  Whoever takes charge next, likely Balen, will need to address the pointless 'Greater Nepal' rhetoric and become a moderate on this issue. Thanks to Trump, India-China relationship is stable for the first time in ages. The only way Nepal has a future is pledge allegiance to both neighbour's.  Bangladesh under Yunus has been a pain in the ass for India. Nepal cannot make the same mistake. Any wrong steps and a free floating Nepali rupee against the dollar would go from 140 now to 25,000 like similar countries in our GDP range. Probably worse since our economy is in much worse shape. ($1 = Lao Kip 21,631.66 LAK)  Nepal needs one stable leader for the next 40 yrs. No interim gov paving way for elections bullshit. Forget the democracy experiment.

Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.   Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.   Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||How credible is this info?|||Use bitchat for conversation.

            "comments": "We are living in a moment where anger is boiling over. People are tired of corruption, censorship, and being silenced. Many of us are ready to take to the streets on Sept 8. But before we move forward, we must stop and think carefully.  History has shown us what happens when we rush in without preparation. In Bangladesh last year, in Sri Lanka not long ago, ordinary people gave their lives while corrupt leaders fled the country with protection and comfort. Their deaths were forgotten within weeks, while the guilty walked free. If we are not careful, Nepal risks becoming the next chapter in that same tragic story.  That is why this movement must be different. We cannot afford to be reckless. We must protect our people, keep our voices peaceful, and make sure the world is watching every step so that accountability cannot be erased.  Here is what we need to do before Sept 8:  * Get international human rights groups, UN observers, and peace monitors involved beforehand so there are eyes on the ground. * Publish clear and peaceful agendas so nobody can label us as rioters or mobs. * Document everything with photos, videos, and testimonies. Every arrest and every injury must be recorded and shared. * Avoid following local leaders who are affiliated with political parties. Big parties will try to infiltrate, hijack, and twist this movement for their own gain. * Know who is truly standing beside you. Trust matters because infiltrators can turn peaceful protests into chaos.  This movement is about dignity, rights, and accountability. It is not about violence. It is not about revenge. If we lose focus, if we let anger replace strategy, then we risk repeating the same cycle where the powerful walk free and ordinary people pay with their lives.  Nepal deserves better. The world must see us not as mobs, but as citizens united for freedom and justice. If we do this right, our voices will be impossible to silence. If we do this wrong, we risk being forgotten like so many before us.  Stay safe. Stay peaceful. Stay smart.",

She is the daughter of Chabi Rijal, a communist leader and Chief District Officer in Nepal, who recently ordered a shoot-on-sight against youth peacefully protesting corruption in Nepal. His orders have killed over 18 innocent people, injured more than 100 students, and more deaths are expected. This is pure fascism and a gross misuse of power. Young people in a peaceful protest were shot dead, which is totally unacceptable. While our brothers and sisters die in Nepal, Sweta Rijal has no right to study in the US with money from corruption. Her entire funding is from the money from corruption. The US, as a democratic country and a voice for the UN, stands for freedom and justice. Allowing her to stay contradicts everything the US represents. We are struggling to fight this battle in Nepal, and she must be held accountable. I urge you to investigate her visa and take necessary action to send her back to Nepal. Regards, Concerned Citizen from Nepal",

Many of us here are also frustrated by the opportunist media and some jerks. We do have misunderstandings and conflicts between but they should have been side lined at this critical moment. Even the people who are getting inspired and speaking in favour of your protest are getting back lash (and recently a person has been charged under the law by the police)because this protest turned violent but ik that wasn't intended. We can argue about the pros and cons but the fact that you stood up against the system is a big achievement and inspiration. I wish you great luck guys and hope you find a better system than the one you fought against and draw a milestone for us. Although I would say you have had a great loss of infrastructure which could have been avoided if the protest was properly managed.|||Abiskar Raut for POTUS  #RAUT2028|||Good speaker, I hope we learn a lot from him.|||Aja samma malai ni yo manchey(sudan gurung) ley miraj dhungana ley start gareko protest  lai hijack garera, sabai cerdit liyo vanney socheko thiye. Tara now when i am beginning to think,  Miraj dhungana was not brave enough to continue this revoltion so he gave up. Without  thinking about the lives lost, with what he have had started on tiktok. Sakidaina vaney kurai nanikaleko vaye hunthyo. Atleast daily life ta chali raheko thiyo sabai jana ko. Ahiley herda sabai damadol vaisakyo.   But since miraj dhungana didn't had courage to continue this revolution. He is not thankful enough, ki usley vaneko var ma yetro manchey sadak ma utriye ani kati ley jyan gumaye vanera. Ani when the gen z group, euta lost cause ma pugna lageko thiyo.  I feel sad to say, because i was against sudan gurung too. But i think, usley himmat nikalera yo cause lai continuity dina प्रयास garyo. Ho uslai ali bolney dhanga chaina. Tara ahiley yesto bela kaslai chahi dhanga huncha. When we all are frustrated??? And now when i think he may be acting up this way is because of all the backlash from the gen z and everyone while he is trying his best to keep the revolution alive. ra yestai bela aru patry ka jhikey haru ko pani sabai milera nana thari kura nikalera usailai gaali galoch garna thaley and even the zenz started to backlash him.

Why can't we try to support eachother instead of blaming each other??   And No body knows. Since those politicians where chased. They have little chance to establish again.  And the hotel was belonging of politicians son. So, they could have made fake protestor's to do it, to claim insurance?  Why are indian and nepalese are fighting here about this matter?? This isn't time for fighting.   And about destroying properties, there are theories that the protest were hijacked by other political parties. Like wise, about governments offices, they wanted to destroy the proofs of corruptions. And public building and properties was collateral damages for those fake protesters to look it real.   So stop blaming and fighting with each other. Please please please 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏.  And sudin gurung, if you are reading this in anyway, now i hope you have  understood how harka sampang had felt when he was coming forward to save the country and you didn't supported him because of your personal vendetta.

I am just a sincere, hardworking youth who remained silent because too many opinions create a ruckus. That's what I believed till September 8. When I went to the protest, it was all fine until they started firing. When you're in the battleground, all moralities go out the window. Yet, I did not throw a single stone at anyone and I am proud of that.

In retaliation, my protests became more louder. I came home late at night, tried my best to repost as many information I could. At one point, I felt like people should burn down the entire ministry down, all these nepo-babies should be brought to the streets to teach their parents how it feels to kill someone's child. I was furious, the word being an understatement. But seeing this people getting mob justice was what I never wanted. They don't deserve the least of anyone's sympathies, but we still have humanity in our hearts.

            "subreddit": "NepalSocial",
            "heading": "The Shrinkhala Khatiwada I knew at Harvard",
            "body": "Created a burner reddit account just for this.  I was Shrinkhala Khatiwada’s classmate from 2021-2023 at Harvard GSD and at some point, we were friends, hung out in the same circles and even went on a short trip together during the school holidays.   We were part of this international group of friends who hailed from Russia, India, Singapore, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina. Some were rich, some were politically connected, some were ordinary people. There were some controversial moments: the Russian defending Russia for invading Ukraine, the Singaporean championing the death penalty for drug trafficking–much to the horror of the Americans. A group of idealistic people who had ambitions to change the world, visions to make the world a better place.  The news about her being a nepo baby and how she is complicit in the corruption swirling in  Nepal is not surprising. The person I came to know was starkly different from the picture perfect image Shrinkhala aimed to curate - the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect, the elegant Miss Nepal, a symbol of what young Nepalis aspire to achieve. Yet within the intense, merit-based environment of Harvard, your name and followers mean little compared to the quality of your ideas and your willingness to work. Her brand quickly fell apart with every academic submission.  Shrinkhala broadcasted to us that she took a scholarship from the Nepalese government to study. It meant to show that she was smart, and it was a meritocratic process but looking back - was the process *that* meritocratic? The quality of her thoughts and willingness to collaborate was, in all honesty, shit. We once had to do a graded project, and initially, people were eager to work with her. That eagerness faded quickly. Shrinkhala’s approach was not one of collaboration, but that of delegation. She treated her peers less like teammates and more like workers/servants, delegating them tasks and dictating a number of ideas that she had no intention of executing. It got to the point that she had to do some work herself because no one wanted to listen to her, much less help her. With deadlines approaching, she kept pushing back and giving excuses on her work, saying that she had sponsorship events, advertisements to film and could someone please help her.   Ultimately the group made the executive decision to move forward without her input and yet jarringly, during the final presentation, she presented our collective work as if she had contributed significantly to its success. It was funny how she seemed more concerned about the photo of her presenting and how she needed the best angle for her photo (another politician in our class also exhibited similar behaviour - to look good on camera in order to post on their socials, which was ironic given how we were students trying to learn from the best at Harvard).  Shrinkhala understood power well and she used that to her advantage to manipulate circumstances for her own benefit. In the friend group, she cosied up to the smartest girl who didn’t mind feeding her ideas and sharing homework, she was besties with the prettiest gal pal who knew how to take the best photo angle shots and contribute to her perfectly curated Instagram feed.  She spoke fondly of her father and how generous he was to her; she told us of how, in Nepal, the family lived humbly and only had a few ‘help’. One time, she even said airily, “I wash my own dishes, you know.” She insisted her father was a clean politician, but the recent allegations of corruption with the hospitals and the vaccines tell otherwise. Looking back, her life was funded by the set of privilege and entitlement that corruption and nepotism brings about. Her entitlement to use her classmates and her lifestyle now feels like a microcosm of the very privilege she felt entitled to, back in her own country.  The friend group rarely speaks now - everyone is dispersed everywhere. But the legacy of Shrinkhala–a beauty queen with no substance, a nepo baby with a deep sense of entitlement and family wealth–lingers on.  At Harvard, Shrinkhala was just another student. The sheen of being a celebrity eventually wore off when faced with her very human, entitled side. I don’t intend to gossip, but the recent developments in Nepal made me want to say something about nepotism and entitlement. This is especially so when such systems produce these ‘nepo babies’ who shamelessly flaunt their status, privilege and wealth (unethically sourced, perhaps?).   Last I checked, Shrinkhala continues to retain her 900k+ following on Instagram. It’s a troubling idea to think that despite what’s happened in the real world, in the realm of the virtual, it seems as if the system of nepotism and unearned privilege (that Shrinkhala has come to represent, in my mind) bears little consequence. I hope that Nepalese people take note of the system they are under where other young Nepalese who enjoy nepotism and unearned privilege live well while the millions of young Nepalese have to struggle everyday without this set of privilege.",

And a few after she became miss nepal... I can somewhat vouch for the \"I'm busy with this and that... Can you help me with this\" part...  People around her always had the same feedback.. and I quote as I recall \"Euta kaam pani garna parexaina yo kt lai.. jahile ni help help vanxa...  help magne pro vikhari..\"  😂 (she barely does a thing on her own, always keeps asking for help , she like pro-beggar ..)   I never liked her naak ma singan adke jasto boli.. And always felt she has a cunning personality that clings over you until she can no more use you for her advantage..  Sisan literally dodged a  bullet.. all thanks to her greed though..|||This is literally how karma came back for Shrinkhala. Back in her teenage days, she dated a guy named Something Puri. It wasn’t some random fling, they were together for 6 years, smoked up weed together every weekends, went for a trekking together, the families knew and he even went to France after meeting her parents, promising her a good life. Meanwhile, while he was working hard for their future, she cheated on him with Prasanga Pant, the guy with all the celeb connections. That broke Sanuel completely. He actually was so heartbroken that he was into some sort of addiction.   Fast forward- Prasanga stood by her, they were together for couple of years, she won miss nepal but then she went behind his back with Sisan again & cheated him as well. Some even say she was the one who initiated those night hotel meetups because Sisan was “beneficial” for her career & public were loving em together. But the twist? Around 2019-2020, not sure about the exact timeline ,she was already seeing Sambhav. And not just casually- word is they were way close while she was still with Sisan, and Sambhav was still with Niti. Some ppl saw em coming out of cozy apartments & resorts ( people I know ). Maybe Sisan knew this but ignored.   Now, Sambhav was a horrible partner . He treated Niti really bad- emotionally abusive, physically abused her several times in public, cheated with multiple women, compared her to other girls maybe with shrinkhala as well  who was at her peak with that fake “beauty with brains” narrative. Do you guys remember Niti’s big incident- the speech in Japan? After that, he started getting way too aggressive with her. So S & S were both silently cheating on their partners, probably waiting for the right time to ditch them. Niti even opened up about her pain after her Vipassana retreat with one of my friend. This was around 2nd covid ig. And let’s not forget the rumors during Shrinkhala’s prime about her rumors of being with certain Indian embassy officials- nobody knows how far that went, but it raised eyebrows. Like how many ppl she has used so far to climb the ladder but it’s her personal life unless you give hopes to ppl and betray them terribly like she has done in every stage of her life.   Sambhav was basically a narcissist who wanted to marry Shrinkhala because of the fake image and narrative she had built. It almost feels like the two of them planned to betray their partners all along. Even though Niti and Sambhav were still together until 2022, he must have gotten hints from Shrinkhala that there was a long-term future for them. The same goes for her-while still with Sisan, she hooked up with Sambhav when he visited her in the US. Not long after, news broke that she and Sisan unfollowed each other on Instagram. In the end, both Sambhav and Shrinkhala seemed to benefit from using their relationships and eventually chose each other through lies and betrayal. But let’s be real- Sisan wasn’t perfect, maybe he fell into her trap, but Niti definitely took the heaviest toll mentally. She was so young when she got with Sambhav, and he drained the life out of her like she stated in her recent story as well. Once they got together, they became super clingy, acting like they’d known each other in a past life, completely ignoring their exes as if they didn’t even exist. This just proves it- they weren’t just together for that one year, they were spending nights together long before that.  So yeah- karma is real. You can’t just keep breaking people and expect life to be smooth. Nepalese people forgave everything she did and loved her way more than she probably deserved. Maybe this will be the biggest lesson of her life- to finally be true to herself. Maybe the tears of Sisan, Niti & all those people she has used throughout her journey & betrayed them like she betrayed her own nation, are the reason Shrinkhala’s career is in ruins today. And with Sambhav’s narcissistic traits, not sure how long he actually sticks by her- because narcissists never change unless you keep feeding their ego. And the main reason sambhav chose shrinkhala is because of her public persona ! What’s the lesson we can learn from here ?  Karma is real af & money can’t give you lifelong happiness, night Redditors|||Wish we had more tea like this on all nepo babies.|||She didn't get any fucking scholarship from the Nepali government.

Actually not surprised at all. Her interviews and podcasts scream self obsession. So many things she says don’t even make sense to begin with. Don’t know why and how people get so brainwashed into worshipping these vain people. At least stop and think, what have they ever done for anyone except for promoting themselves. With the strong platform they have, they don’t even use it for simple charity. Even if anyone does, they would go on endlessly advertising it in social media. There are so many smart Nepali kids who have been accepted to Harvard and Columbia but were unable to study just because of the high tuitions at these reputed institutions.   It’s so obvious yet people fail to see through these opportunists. Just look at the people who are still following these influencers, celebrities and good for nothing loaded people. People like Shrinkhala, Oshin, Priyanka Karki, Swastima, Zenisha, Rachna Gurung, Anna Sharma, all the Miss Nepals, Sandhya, Kantipur Media, Golchas, Choudharys, shivuplay, glam behavior, Supriya, Niti Shah, Vidushi Rana and the list goes on, along with Nepo kids and these business owners, contractors, politicians, army and police officials, etc. It’s astounding what the world has come to and it’s deeply concerning. If people are flaunting reprehensible riches and never ending list of vacations on social media, they can’t be doing that without ill gotten money.  People still comment like why didn’t she speak up when Nepal needed her. Nepal never needed her or the likes of superfluous Shrinkhala. They needed Nepal and they used and abused our country. It’s better for Nepal if these people who are nothing but parasites- stay away from our beautiful country.  Hope this country stops wasting their time following these people blindly and putting them on a pedestal. This is how we give power to them and they get entitled. Hope this country wakes up and can see through what is right and what is wrong. Look at the pathetic number of followers living legends like Dr. Sanduk Ruit or Mr. Kulman Ghising has. It’s disheartening!|||[deleted]|||Correct my if I’m wrong guys, but shrinkhala father was health minister covid time, I heard tyo time ma vaccine ma ra health sector ma eka dum corruption bhaykeo thiyo.

Every move, every word, every connection seems like part of a bigger calculation. While most people get dragged through the mud on social media, she somehow stays a step ahead. Of all platforms, she was clever enough to pull the LinkedIn card first. That’s not by accident, it’s calculation. She knows the bashing on Tiktok or Instagram doesn’t matter as long as her professional side stays spotless, especially where she might work with people internationally who will never know the side of her life in Nepal that’s been exposed and torn apart ever since the truth came out.  It’s like she’s playing this endless game of Ludo, always climbing the ladder, polishing her image as she goes. But at the same time, you can’t help but feel she’s only ever a roll away from hitting 98 and sliding right back down the snake.|||We wont know if what you claim is true. But I wouldn't be surprised if its true either or even worse. I would assume that she was in her best behavior since she was not in Nepal and probably wanted to portray the best of her image.

The beinfit is probably meant for the MPs who had to move temprorarily to the capital or who didn't have their own residence. Iirc, they had to manually opt in to get that added housing allowance. When the news published, her father's reaction was something along the line of \"I didn't know, I was getting it.

It highlights how Shrinkhala, despite her public image and privileges, was not as collaborative or hardworking in academic settings as she appeared to be. It also touches on the contrast between her image and reality, as well as some concerns about nepotism and entitlement.|||there was a podcast recently, shrinkhala & 3 other women sittng down to talk with, his name may be anil shah.

These shitty traits are so much common in Nepal especially in Architecture field, they start to develop god's complex after getting praised few times for their work, which is wrong and is depressing especially to the new comers, new architects. And how they collaborate in the team work says alot about a person, in her case, not surprised at all as she is thesis topper, won many design competitions and she's put on pedestal here in Architecture field as well!!! But that doesnot mean she can treat people like that. I see so many architects here in Nepal, they're good professionally but failed as human. And in her case i thought she was at least good at work but as you said, \"with every academic presentation, her brand failed\" i am surprised. Honestly i had bought her story about \"the ambitious girl boss, the brilliant architect\" shit. And now i can see through her, loud & clear, connecting every dots, every gossip i heard about her, being in the same field. Many of us who thought she was a good person, have already unfollowed her on social media, the way she was completely silent when accused of corruption says a lot!!! And the way she's silent when the country is bleeding says alottt too!!!!!!  And about the Nepal's government scholarship for harvard,this is not true, she is telling an entire different story about harvard scholarsip & how she paid fees there. She said she got 30% scholarship at harvard and the remaining 70% is paid through her brand endorsements money as she is brand ambassador to few company. We didnt buy that story, she tried hardest to sell it though and still fools people with this shitty madeup script about harvard's 30% scholarship & 70% funding through brand endorsement's money lmao. And lately she's being questioned on 50,000USD she got during miss world competition after winning \"beauty with the purpose\" title. Her ex exposed & questioned her in a very shady way and because of him we all knew this new layer of truth and i highly doubt it went on harvard's funding rather than for actual purpose|||One buy Harvard degree with that 50K and another one became a MAKUSE owner .

NO TF SHE DID NOT!!!! Like realistically speaking, a middle class Nepali \"HUMBLE FAMILY” who did not come from money can’t afford even the tuition at Harvard even with loans CYZ it’s so Dyaum expensive let alone living expenses, traveling, food and other necessities we might not know of. I’m saying this as a Nepali because there are so many kids that have the potential to study there and even get into the school but can’t even afford it. So idk why she tries to portray herself as \"POOR” when she’s RICH RICH. And idk where the money comes from and how but I just know that she’s not who she tries to portray herself as……….|||Yesto post haru aauna paryo kya..reddit jasto platform ma sakesamma sablai aware garau..yestai leak type vanam ki aam Janata leh nabujeko, nasuneko kura garepo ,eh hamro Samaj ma yesto ni vairaxa vanne chet aauxa reddit user maa... jaile kt , relationship bahek kei dekhdaina ma..|||I have a similar story like Shrinkhala’s on Nepal’s current president’s granddaughter (he has 4 and i’m talking about the one studying at the University of Texas in Austin). Its not easy to get in there and even if you do its one of the expensive schools there. Talking about her Nepal bachelor’s days, my friends studied with her in KU in nepal in b. arch, and so many said she cheated on exams (A LOT) just to pass. later she worked for the nepal government and came to US for conferences and presentations 🤡. now she has started her master’s at UT austin, funded by corrupted money. she removed her instagram posts about her prior foreign visits and her recent UT Austin orientation day, and even deactivated her linkedin account.  Now she’s posting on instagram and facebook, after the new PM was appointed, congratulating her and thanking the president grand dad for this revolution. it’s crazy how these unethical people still have the audacity to do all this.  (Source: from college friends and family members, and as those of us who are directly impacted by this revolution in nepal, we are not going to stay quiet against corruption and the unethical hypocrisy going on for a long time)|||Also the harvard blog lol|||What was her gpa?|||Most of her followers in isnt are fake and paid tho|||If you guys want social awareness of Nepal's issues, you should write fully in English.

Continue on --|||For everyone about the op In short : The writer paints Shrinkhala as a privileged “nepo baby” who uses image, connections, and entitlement rather than merit or substance.|||Thanks for sharing your raw and real experience, thoughts and opinion. This is valuable for those of us who were shocked and skeptical about her success right from the day she got into limelight. I watched her view on Youtube yesterday and couldn't get past a minute of that video, she is clearly playing victim and trying to play the game.  Nope! she doesn't deserve any chance at all.  The students that I know personally who went to Harvard, MIT and many other prestigious institutions had grit, determination, belief in hard-work, may be little bit of luck but most of all they had \"humility\". They NEVER used their \"Harvard degree\" or Ivy league label to show off. It's those who want to fame and fake pride that put up social media posts to show off their diplomas. Honestly, it was very very clear even before she went to Harvard that she was on the wrong side of fame game.  For the longest time I thought it was a generational difference, since there are many other Harvard students who have publicized themselves in several Youtube videos and they are all Gen Z, and as a Gen Y (Millennial) observing this trend seemed justifiable.  However, Shrinkhala was building a house of cards and the fact that she had the audacity to publicize and put Sambhav Sirohiya in the limelight using Harvard freebies was just laughable a few years ago.  Like you pointed out, the fact that she still has 900K followers is troubling for sure but let's hope those are just her fake followers (some % are bought/in-organic followers, some her closest elite allies like \"Other Miss Nepals/ Businessmen/political affiliates etc. and some her enemies) as they say, **keep your friends close and enemies closer.**|||I heard that B.arch is the easiest subject to get at Pulchowk and that too for a girl as they have separate reservations for women. Yes she must be smart because to get that you need to work hard.  But the image she tries to portray being you know the perfect, hardworking,real and independent girl always sounded fishy to me.  Miss World organization saw through her, so didn't let her go to the final round. There is no substance in her words and it  sounds exactly like a politician speech. Idealistic statements with no action. Look at the legacy of previous Miss Nepal winners. Most of them marry rich businessman and secure a rich, lavish life. Miss Nepal itself feels like a joke...|||Am I the only one who cant believe that she got 3 crore just from collaborating with brands.

She has now publicly claimed that she paid her tuition with her influencer income. But we all know where the money came from.|||Glad you shared this all.

You claimed to be honest and talked about corporations evading taxes several times in your interviews. Can you show us that you paid income taxes for the money you claimed you earned as an influencer?|||She cannot stick to one story. She used to go around Harvard telling everyone that she received a prestigious Nepal government scholarship to fund her education. She lied about receiving the scholarship s she can appear smart amongst other students who got there on their own merit. She kept quiet for a long time when Nepali people asked her about her educational expenses. Now, all of a sudden, she is claiming she funded it with her own influencer money. |||My mom generation dont even know the name shrinkhala|||So I assume your story is true. I also studied in the states and I know how expensive it can get.   So how did she funded her education considering Harvard which is an ivy league school is extremely costly and on top of that, her lifestyle itself is on the high end. So..  In that case, even you since you studied in Harvard. How did you fund your education?  Just curious. A reply will be great since there are hundred of replies.|||Remember that education in Nepal is based on how well you do...based on your caste. I have heard that a lot of exams are predetermined by the ruling caste. This corruption is so bad that even well-educated people are falsely given a bad grade. While the latter is given a high passing grade. This type of discrimination is not only evil but can takes one's life. HK student commit suicide because of academic pressure.

They exude your bitterness towards her. I think you envy her followers ( which you have mentioned a lot) and her beauty, its common for ugly people to have this jealousy.

You creating a burner account to throw dirt at her shows your pettiness as well.|||So she was just like an ordinary college student like all of us, so what if she wasn’t a studious/intellectual kid, still she was an opportunist, many of us are & maybe that turned out in her favour. And there is nothing wrong with this. She was a title holder that’s why she could be getting benefited after that. Plus, getting into Harvard is not everyone’s cup of tea no matter how much money one wishes to spend. Frankly speaking, linking her Harvard degree with nepotism& corruption is making ordinary people like us into more likely believing her part of the story. Targeting her is only gonna make her more famous, still 900k+ followers believe her part. She is getting sympathy from people as people are still forgetting about the real agenda and getting jealous about her getting into Harvard.|||i mean knowing she did try to contribute to nepal rest of the thing was from the breakup scandal right , i don't know about the beauty though everyon is beautiful you try to find it !!!the system will surely benefit her , but a lot of people are unaware of transparecy can't connect the dot in larger scale if she can do great things with her face that has been blessed and for the achievement sh won once title ie miss nepal, she should do great things for the nation in upcoming years and time and hope she get equal value from the scandals!! and serve !!!|||[deleted]|||Still Beautiful though",

You say their work has benefited generations “like me” but what about the millions still without quality education, clean water, jobs, or justice? If that legacy was truly built for the people, then why does inequality keep growing? Why is access to opportunity still limited to a select few families like yours?  No one is attacking your elders for their hard work but using that work to claim political or social superiority today is exactly the kind of dynastic thinking that holds progress back. Legacies don’t entitle children to power. Competence, accountability, and public trust do.  You’re not being attacked, you’re being questioned. And if your only answer is to call others “small-minded” and “ungrateful,” then maybe you’re not as prepared to face criticism as you think. Respect is earned in every generation, not inherited like land or a business.  The days of hiding behind the achievements of the past are over. If you want respect for your family, prove it through your own actions, not by silencing criticism or demanding loyalty based on history.|||French revolution Bata sikna paryo kei|||I fwwww it.

I mean gross national happiness instead of gross national product. I believe every single country on this planet should take Bhutan as a role model a little bit more. Where else in the world are citizens asked what their main problems are and what they want from the government? And later, citizens are asked how satisfied they were with the government's performance. I know it's a bit naive of me to make such a suggestion from afar, as a sheltered European who is not really familiar with the form of government in Nepal. But it seems to be similar in many, many countries. Those in power often hold office and positions of honor for decades through their family ties. And they are similar in their decadence. The most expensive clothes, the biggest cars, houses, and palaces. Flying to New York for dinner in a private jet, or to Monaco for F1, or around the globe in a yacht as long as a soccer field. And in the media, they try to appear close to the people, to be there for them, to advance the country by investing in infrastructure or new hospitals, etc. But no, a large part of your taxes ends up with the rulers themselves. The rich and powerful acquire more wealth and more power. Money rules the world!

Experience isn’t a flaw, it’s literally the one thing that tells you someone can handle the chaos. You want to hand the country over to a rookie who has no clue how the system works, how politics works, or how to deal with the mess we’re already in? That’s not bravery, that’s stupidity.  We keep repeating the same mistakes because people get blinded by shiny new faces and ignore anyone who actually knows what they’re doing. Experience doesn’t mean someone is corrupt it means they’ve been in the trenches and survived. Throwing it away just to see if a “fresh face” can magically save everything is how you crash a country.  Nepal isn’t a playground. Leadership isn’t about hype, popularity, or being young and “green.” It’s about surviving the chaos, making tough decisions, and knowing where the landmines are. If you think a rookie can do that better than someone experienced, you’re dreaming and the whole nation will pay the price for it.",

Balen cannot do that, Harka is very very incapable of that. Etibela we should look for someone who's least politically inclined and has very little tainted personality.

Even if they have the intention and will to do so (like many of us want), they do not know how to run a country.

Now the rising youth leaders do not have experience because these corrupt politicians did not allow that.

He looked at me for a moment, and then his eyes filled with tears.

When I left, my hands were empty, but my heart was heavy. That day I realized poverty is not only about money. The biggest poverty is being unseen, unloved, and forgotten.  Ratnapark overbridge will never look the same to me again. Today, that beggar gave me more than I gave him.

Jalaide|||Yes thus is TRUE LOOK AT MY MOST RECENT POST|||please do this email to UN and OHCHR   To: registry@ohchr.org        info@ihrcworld.org        petitions@ohchr.org   Subject: Urgent Appeal: Violation of Human Rights in Nepal – Police Shooting School Studentsj   Dear United Nations Human Rights Council, I am writing to raise an urgent appeal regarding the grave human rights violations currently occurring in Nepal. Recent incidents reveal that police forces have opened fire on students wearing school uniforms, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least 16 Gen Z so far.   These actions constitute serious breaches of international human rights law, specifically under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political   Rights (ICCPR, 1966): Relevant UNCRC Articles Violated Article 6: Every child has the inherent right to life, and states must ensure maximum survival and development.   Article 19: Children must be protected from all forms of violence, including excessive force by authorities.   Article 37(a): No child shall be subjected to torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.   Relevant ICCPR Articles Violated Article 6(1): Everyone has the inherent right to life, and this right must be protected by law.   Article 24(1): Children are entitled to special protection as minors under international law.   The unjustified killing of students particularly those in school uniforms and unarmed represents a direct violation of the right to life and could trigger international accountability under both conventions.   I respectfully request the United Nations Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies to: 1.   Launch an urgent investigation into the unlawful killing of students. 2.   Hold accountable those responsible for ordering and executing the use of lethal force.   The situation in Nepal requires immediate global attention. The lives and rights of Nepalese children are in imminent danger, and intervention from the international community is crucial to uphold the principles of human dignity, justice, and protection of minors.   Thank you for your urgent attention and support in addressing this humanitarian crisis.   Sincerely, <Your Name>|||Jaha Bhetyo tehi thok saley madarchod lai...|||Aaos na india ma ni nepali xan birsyo kya|||Bro timro yo pic use garey haii Tiktok ma vid halchu|||kun desh jala teta bebasta garnu parxa|||yo machikne lai samatna paryo jasari bhaye ni yellai bachne kunai adhikar xaina|||Bhagey ra canada nai ja la, canada ma nee xodnu hudaina.

Lets first make sure state security, tax, bureaucracy and banking system be under central government. Then every other remaining ministry which needs localization be under province government.    Let there be 1 president directly elected by everyone to handle state security and 7 governor to handle province security, and 1 premier and 7 Magistrate to handle state & province tax, banking and bureaucracy. This way we will have clean central government in which no one can capture state function and minimize corruption.    Since we don't have any functioning people in power, either let lower house to vote for temporary governor and magistrate. No minister, let bureaucracy handle them under strict scrutiny of Governor and Magistrate.    Then start a fresh election, 1 President, 7 Governors, 1 Premier, 7 Magistrates, Lower House or Province Parliament member, then from each Province send 10 representative in Upper House/Federal Parliament 3 voted by Lower House/Province Parliament, 5 directly elected in Upper House and 2 votes each from Province Governor and Province Magistrate. Let the bill for Upper House be registered by directly elected member of Upper House. Upper house will vote for foreign minister, ambassadors and diplomats.   For now, either make Mayor and Deputy Mayor of each capital of Province to be interim Governor and Magistrate to bring law and order in state-province security and function. After election they will go back to be Mayor and Deputy Mayor.     Why all this?

Sumana didi is a good person but certainly not the one whom we can chose to lead. I know very well of the core team and they have done a good job as a MP but she has to either quit her association with RSP if she has to become the genz representative or should be part of a guiding figure and more like a sallahakar kind of role to the genz representative. Because she has to come as Sumana as an individual , if she comes as a cadre of RSP, RSP le aaune election ma tesko rajnitik byaj khancha(RSP is going to take away a significant portion of credit, which is not at all fair. Because we didnt trust RSP in any way but we just supported a person)And everyone please be clear, RSP ko political roti sekna gareko haina yo revolution.  And Balen dai got serious dictatorial tendancies like someone here rightly mentioned. Leader got to be calm. Bhid lai unite garne leader chaiyeko cha hamlai uttejit banaune haina.

But both of them are good leaders and massive respect to both of them for their relentless effort so far and we need their active contribution in rebuilding the new Nepal.

Personally I have next to no clue who Sumana is, and normally I'd think that makes her a good candidate because there's nothing but positive vibes so far. I'd take no issue but Balen's fanbase which is large may have an issue.  But Balen has voice, his actions reached people even when they didn't care or know who he was (same case for me). He has a loud crowd of fans already. Lately people have distaste for him too, but the thing with him is that he is known to make moves with maximum impact and reach. He will likely focus hard on catching the missing politicians too (from what we've seen him do). He'll boost up everyone's morale faster, many of the haters could be converted fast due to his existing voice. His records have been good enough, I really think he really can upturn his current image pretty fast.  Maybe we can select both.

Additionally, We don’t have practice of PM contesting for other smaller roles later in life. Maybe thats the reason he is not taking it.

She is the one who has been abroad for so long and has so many foreign connections and relations that even if she  doesn't want interference, there will be far more foreign interference with her as a leader.  We can not deny that .   3. Sumana did absolutely nothing as a health minister apart from stunts. Ministers are supposed to amend laws and execute them. could have done so much more .   4. He is RSP . Haven't issued anything about Ravi being released from prison by their goons.   5.

BTW, Gen Z doesn’t just belong to the Kathmandu Valley. I have analyzed comments from all social media platforms, from youth belonging to every part of the country. Sushila Karki literally didn’t exist in this conversation before the protest and suddenly she was everywhere. Many have pointed out that nobody knew the movement would result in this many changes for the country. We had to make a decision quickly to prevent the country from being doomed further. A common demand has been if you had to bring in Sushila Karki, why not consider Bipin Adhikari or Bhimarjun Acharya? I also learned that the people I posted are thinking tactically and playing a long term game. Many self proclaimed Gen Z leaders went to the Army Headquarters. The majority of youth I see credit Hami Nepal with being through everything in this movement. Meanwhile, the folks on Discord which by the way consists of speakers living abroad who weren’t even present for the protests claim we don’t know Hami Nepal and that they are the ones leading. Yet, they couldn’t even decide who to send as representatives. They later claimed, ‘We have other private Discord groups. The real representatives from those groups have already gone to the Army headquarters. This server you’re all listening to is just for public discussion’. Not to forget, a big fuck you to shameless opportunists like Durga Prasai and Rabi Kiran Hamal. Now that it’s been confirmed everywhere and with Balen posting that the Gen Z’s choice former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Sushila Karki is the right choice for interim prime minister of Nepal, we look forward to what comes next.|||https://new-nepal-voting.vercel.app/  Vote here or suggest names I can add|||For interim formation CJ Sushila Karki would be the perfect choice.

I get his appeal but I still think he should remain mayor for another term. He couldn't accomplish a lot of things because of the previous government. He might be able to achieve more with a sensible government.  Sumana is smart and I feel like she has a level head on her. Head of state requires someone to be diplomatic as well as bold.

Not exactly the way we wanted things to go but seems clear from the comments that we all knew, in the back of our minds, it was never going to be a straight road to Rome.  So I believe it’s high time we look ahead and bring the same energy we did to the protests to ensure that we see the change we want to see happen and bring in leaders we believe in. Easier said than done but accountability starts from us now. Let’s not settle for less than what we envision Nepal to be.|||Who are you telling this? To the same people who contributed in yesterday's mess and encouraged people to carry stones with them and to those same people who soft banned or removed posts when people showed concern over this idea when they realised how bad of an idea it is? Even the mods here are equally responsible for removing and deleting content where people like me were against this protest because we knew for a fact this was going to turn very violent and people are not going to protest peacefully because it did not look like they would especially here on reddit.

They are hot blooded. They can do anything with teen minds.  Look at your genZ, destroying their own land...  GenZ is a popular word on the internet.  Now whenever you talk about GenZ people will remember this amount of brutalism and rage against their own land own assets.|||**What next? thoughts from a fellow Gen Z**    The motherland burns, my heart aches, my mind ponders, is all hope lost? My soul hurts to see violence, arson, anarchy, and the loot and burning of our national properties. We, Gen-Z, seem to have won, yet feel lost. Hope feels lost. Hope for our future, our nation, and ourselves. In the face of this utter hopelessness, what do we do? How do we move on? I’ve been pondering for a long while. Surely, **we can’t let our nation fail.** We can’t let our nation burn. We can’t let opportunistic individuals and groups use this moment of confusion to seize power. **So, what do we do?**     **1) We lay down our weapons.**   We came in peace, we protested in peace, and we’ve always wanted peace. We shall end this in peace. Be it known that anybody inciting violence isn’t part of our movement.     **2) We extend love.**   Love towards our brothers and sisters, love towards our nation, love towards our neighbours, our society, and the opposing side. The journey ahead is a long and arduous one. But even the journey of a 1000 steps starts with a small step. Hatred will take us nowhere. Hatred is not, and cannot be, the defining characteristic of Gen-Z. We have to be different. Let us start this journey of loving our nation by cleaning up after our protests and cleaning up after the hooligans.     **3) We wear white.**   White to mourn those who died, to mourn the loss of our national treasures, to show solidarity among us throughout the nation and abroad, to show that we’ve come in peace, and to show respect to our motherland. White is a pure color. We are neither associated with any party nor will we be. Let white be a testament to our neutrality, a symbol of opposing corruption and injustice, and our embrace of love.     **4) We have hope.**   Hope for the future of Nepal, hope for our generation, hope in rebuilding from the ashes, hope in developing our nation, hope for a prosperous country, and hope in ourselves to overcome this state of chaos.     Over the coming days, many will try to change the narrative and use this moment as an opportunity to seize power and use the state of chaos to further incite violence. But, they are not us. They cannot be. We cannot succumb to their plots, nor let them use this opportunity.     Let us lay down our weapons, extend love to our fellow citizens, wear white in solidarity, and have high hopes for a future that is ours to build.     Sincerely,   Pantji, a Gen-Z |||unfortunately, the ones fight the hardest and the most were the one suffered the most, and likely to have the most hatred and anger.

When the rich don't know the limits of expoliting the poor these are the consequences. Every freaking nepali politician only gave a fancy speech but never worked towards development of the country. The crowd going crazy is the result of fustration building towards government and the younger generations seeing nothing for them in nepal.

Aba dherai lang lang vo. She is the best we have now.|||My humble suggestions to all youths of Nepal: 1. Being the head of a state is different than being a leader of a protest movement. We need experienced and wise and STABLE leader to steer the country through this mess. We are too young to represent our country in world stage and save it from vulture like foreigners looking to exploit our current weakness.  2. The leader of government should be respected and acceptable by the vast majority of the nation. No one will be a perfect candidate. Ghanti and other major political party members all have their fierce opponents. My personal choice would be a former bureaucrat or justice never touched by allegations of misconduct or impropriety. Someone like former Chief Justice SUSHILA KARKI could be palatable to the whole nation as a caretaker leader.  3. An immediate national election across all government levels and parliaments is necessary. The people have rejected the status quo. Although infrastructure and economy has been badly damaged, we can hold an election even at the cost of billions of Rupees. As soon as we can. Preferably within 6 months at most. Organizing and managing a large scale election takes time. We should understand that. In the meantime, the caretaker can take care of infrastructure rebuilding and restoration. The nation needs to heal and get back on its feet.  4. Directly elected head of state with maximum 2 terms is a must. No more opportunists who became PM for 3 months a time repeatedly. Parliament members must be directly elected. No more commission based samanupatik representatives. And we should demand certain minimum qualifications from candidates. And there should be a hard age limit of 75 years for all politicians or appointments to government services. Immediate rejection of candidates who will exceed that limit before their term is up.  5. A strong investigation committee headed by respected and independent people. There are many of them in our country. This committee should investigate all government officers, politicians, elected members of government, ambassadors, justice, etc. and their families. Harsh punishments for bribery and corruption.  6. No more politically motivated appointments to constitutional bodies and in important fields like education, medical, construction, law and justice, diplomats and ambassadors, consumer right protection, etc.  Many reforms are urgently needed in the country. But we can discuss them later. The priority should be to have a head of state immediately. The more we leave Nepal leaderless, the more opportunists can thrive in power vacuum. We need to make decisions fast!! Isn't that what we scolded old politicians for??? For being slow to change and slow to adapt?? How can we youth be this slow and lethargic??  Youth has energy. But wisdom is not guaranteed. We should know our limitations and strengths both. It's on our shoulders to rebuild the country in the image we want. But we should actually start doing something about it.   It has taken us this long to even choose a representative. REPRESENTATIVE FOR WHAT??? WHAT'S THE AGENDA?? Concrete agenda. Not school level development factor points. When will we settle on agenda? When will we select person to negotiate the agenda? When will we elect a head of government to enforce those agendas???  The longer this takes, the longer our country will suffer.  Please don't dillydally this process. The country is looking up to us. Get this message to all youth. Change is slow but we have to work for it. No single belovent person is coming to save us. It's up to save our country and make it better than how we got it from our elders.  #boost #decidenow #peace|||Why not sagar Dhakal?|||Yesss|||Just promote it in your social media handle|||K bhairacha yarr discord ma pm choose bhairacha|||Ahile non political manxe thik huncha...her or Dr सन्दुक Ruit.

Unconstitutional action will hurt Nepal on the long run. Thus, to make it constitutional;  1. Make some MP elected from Proportionate Representation System resign, 2. Make the president declare her lawful member of parliament through Proportionate Representation System, 3. Declare her the interim prime minister, 4. The president on her cabinet's recommendation dissolves the house of Representatives, 5. Her cabinet carries forward the corruption investigation and reconstruction. 6. The elections will be declared immediately. 7. The new parliament decides the constitutional amendments. (directly elected prime minister etc. and others ) 8. Then, the prime ministerial election happens. 9. She resigns as the interim prime minister. 10. New prime minister and the cabinet are sworn in. 11. The current president resigns. 12.

Prachanda isn't trying to get into power with these protests. However, he was kind of left behind by UML and NC and he's taking some revenge.  I am shocked at how a nation's government can be obliterated in a day, its something near impossible. There were some external powers, but I very much doubt the involvement of any foreign power, the US government is composed of isolationists and libertarians at the moment. I don't think they'd appreciate this.  The deep state could act, but again they have no benefit.   I felt something was weird the time KP met Putin, I've never in my life seen a leader of a very big country even acknowledge these tyrants like KP. The last time Prachanda went to the United States, not even the cops protected him.   Regarding China, oli was already a pro-China guy, I don't see China having any benefit in overturning the government.  India, india could be involved, but again, it would not risk destroying the party system which kind of favored india every time NC got in power.   So, the involvement of foreign actors seems unlikely.    At the end, the best shot? Domestic actors and rebels. They likely had some form of involvement.   Cops and the Army were already supporting the citizens, that may be one of the reasons these tyrants fled.   __Foreign powers may play shadows, but this collapse looks like something only Nepalis could make happen. When the police and the army refused to shoot, the old order was already finished.__  **I am not a political scientist, just a hobbyist, I may be wrong.**|||High possibility OF THISSS|||Maybe but not entirely garnu bela tod fod garyeu parliament jalayeu manxe jalayo ani accountability line bela ma aru lai dosh,Kati economical crisis hunxa aba|||Prachanda and men who are into dopamine shits|||No|||Him or Gyanendra.

Rather than looking outwards to pin 📌 the chaos, it's important that we self reflect. This movement was started to hold those who've wronged our nation accountable but if we ourselves don't hold us accountable for yesterday's actions then we've lost the cause.  I beg that we don't dilute the blood spent in the last 48 years to any conspiracy.  जे भयो, गलत भयो । हामीले हिजोको घटनाक्रबाट आम नेपाली नागरिकको मनस्थिति भुज्यौं, हामीमा अझै पनि सुझबुझ छैन भनेर प्रमाणित गर्यौ।  तर अब के गर्ने भन्ने प्रश्न महत्पूर्ण छ - अब को छलफल त्यसमा हुनु पर्छ जस्तो लाग्छ।  We need law and order to end this chaos otherwise opportunists will prevail.

Its grand architecture and historical importance make it a true pride of Nepal.The news of Singha Durbar burning yesterday is more than just the loss of a structure it feels like the loss of a piece of our soul. This tragedy is a blow to our heritage, to our economy, and to our sense of unity as a nation. The damage cannot be measured only in money, but also in the irreplaceable cultural and historical value that has been destroyed.  I feel deeply saddened by this loss. Singha Durbar was more than walls and pillars it was a living monument of Nepal’s journey, struggles, and achievements. Watching it go up in flames is heartbreaking for every Nepali who loves their country.",

One for the 165 candidates who are elected directly (first-past-the-post), other for the party. The votes that party gets determine the remaining 110 members via proportional representation.  so aba either we need new political parties to replace the existing ones by Falgun 21, or we have to vote for the same parties again. This is more complicated because Nepal is not just Kathmandu. The political players which we have termed jholey will be active outside Kathmandu.   So if we need the change in constitution, we have to be more careful. The mandates of the movement are more at risk now than before.",
