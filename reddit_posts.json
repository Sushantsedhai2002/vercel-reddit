            "body": "Contrary to most of the things I have read in this sub, I don't really care or make a big deal about his past/present religion, his ethnicity or what his views are on certain group of people. I wouldn't have mind all that, if he just got things delivered, you know 'a cat has to kill the rat doesn't matter if it's black or white' type stuff.  Cause some people think his ethnicity is the reason, 'they don't support him cause he is a janjati.' If that was the case then people wouldn't support Kulman. I wouldn't mind if Kulman was the PM, I kinda want him to be the next PM.  Unlike Harka, Kulman is actually a chill guy. He doesn't act like a manchild, and is very professional about his demeanour. At least, usle vaney jasto bhayena vane pani gati chhaada para dekhaudaina.

There's a saying 'In politics there are no permanent friends or enemies.' Even if you are not satisfied with what the other person is doing, times change/situation changes, you have to keep the door open for future alliance. Kulman ko ni khedo garya chha, RSP lai ni testai. He has basically alienated himself from all his potential allies. Because of all these things, he himself has lowered his class and his trustworthiness.",

He does not understand basic economics, legal structures, beaurocracy (he hates beaurocracy but there is no alternative to beaurocracy rather than effective beaurocracy). I remember one reporter asked about his political spectrum (right wing/left wing), he literally said \"Hami daya baya lagera ta esto bhako ni aba sidha jane ho\" and this sentence does not indicate he is a centre wing nor his actions.    He stands with his own made ideology of shram sanksriti just how prachanda made his prachanda path. we all know where prachanda path went. Infact, truly speaking prachanda path makes more sense to me than his shram sanskriti.    All he wants is control. He might be a person with integrity but he is not the competent one.|||All politicians have huge ego. Some people prefer the aesthetic of  'professional' others like man of the people, someone with whom they can strike a chia guff in a bhatti. It's all subjective.  The bigger question is does Harkae need the alliance? As the 'alliance' is still trying to figure out what it even is. Harkae is in full campaign mode and pulling huge crowds in eastern Nepal.

            "body": "I’m just an observer who has watched this unfold from the sidelines for some time now, neither a supporter nor a hater, but the pattern is now crystal clear. There is a reason every 40-page fact-check thread on Twitter or an elaborate news article gets 38 comments while a 12-second TikTok of Rabi walking out of custody gets 4M views and rivers of tears.It’s because the RSP narrative is one of the cleanest, most lethal political myths ever built in this country. Strip it down, and it’s three sentences:  1. A man from outside the club started winning. 2. The club panicked. 3. The club weaponised the courts to stop him.  That’s the entire gospel. Nothing else is required. And it is unstoppable for five structural reasons that have almost nothing to do with evidence.  1. It reuses villains that 90% of the population already despises. The story doesn’t have to invent enemies. It just points at the same three parties and the same dozen surnames that have been on the evening news since people were born. Defending “the judicial process” in 2025 automatically casts you as a foot-soldier for those exact villains, even if you spent the last ten years cursing them yourself. 2. It turns Rabi into a human mood ring. He is no longer a politician with files and cases. He is the physical container for every private rage Nepalis are not allowed to voice in polite company: rage at having to beg for a Malaysian visa, rage at seeing ministers’ kids studying in London. At the same time, your own degree gathers dust, rage at the simple fact that nothing ever works here. When you attack him, people don’t hear “this man might have broken laws.” They hear “you are dismissing my pain.” 3. It replaces a 400-page legal maze with a single sentence anyone can remember. Try explaining the difference between “investigation,” “remand,” “chargesheet,” and “final verdict” to a vegetable vendor in Kalimati or a mother in Jumla. You will lose them in thirty seconds. “They jailed him because he was becoming too big” is shorter than a WhatsApp forward and feels 100 % true the moment it lands. Cognitive ease beats cognitive accuracy every single time. 4. It is an infinitely customisable therapy. Every frustrated Nepali gets to insert himself as the protagonist: • The youth who prepared for lok sewa for six years and still failed? Same story. • The entrepreneur strangled by red tape and bribes? Same story. • The family that lost everything when the cooperative collapsed? Same story. The narrative is a blank template that lets millions of people scream “this is about ME” without changing a single word. 5. It is the perfect drug for a nation addicted to learned helplessness. Nepal’s modern identity is built on a thousand small and large humiliations: the blockade, the passport ranking, the airports, the brain drain, the daily proof that ordinary effort is never enough. When your entire lived experience is “the system crushes anyone who stands out,” then the sentence “they jailed him because he stood out” doesn’t sound like a conspiracy theory. It sounds like the most honest thing any politician has ever said.  This is not a media-literacy problem. This is not even mainly a class or education problem. This is a story that was reverse-engineered to fit the exact emotional wounds of an entire country . Until someone builds a counter-story that is equally simple, equally personal, and similarly cathartic, something that gives people dignity instead of just documents, the current myth will keep winning. And right now, no one is even trying. That’s the part that should worry everyone who still believes that facts alone will eventually prevail. They won’t.   Not against a myth this well-crafted.",

There are still crapload of murderers and rapists roaming the country due to him. Gen Z weren't storming the prisons to release the criminals, he lit the fire with his opportunism.|||No need for your philosophical yapping about Nepalese people. Don't make things too complicated, it's as simple as following: 1. Either he is discharged innocent. 2. Or he is proven in all of the charges that are currently on going 3. Or, he is only ordered to be found guilty over minor stuffs within his entire case, which looks most likely for now for anyone who has closely read his case.   It's not that complicated, if Rabi is truly involved in fraud, the court is free to punish him, else Rabi would be so immense of a figure that no one would be able to stop, in that situation this entire prison time would be seen as an investment of fighting the unjust system all by himself.   And, personally after careful reading all the hearings of courts regarding him, it's safe to say that he won't be charged with fraud, although he won't come out as innocent either, his only mistake would be to remain in an important position and not being aware of certain clauses and regulations, that's all I think would happen to him, rest of the stuffs aren't even close to truly charge him.   and, I don't even like him, as for me, I think as a politician he is too soft, weak and sometimes naive, I don't like weak people as new faces in politics, that's my personal thoughts about his political career.   No matter whether people like him or not, they better work super hard to charge him, else he is becoming so big that these old bastards could never hope to beat him.|||It's the establishment that has tactics to destroy the reputation of anyone who stands against them by using party funded medias.  He isn't proven guilty but still has to go to prison. What happened to innocent until proven guilty??

Trust in judicial system? Total BS. NOBODY has trust in your legislative, judiciary or parliament, except ofc formality.  I am not hater or a supporter of the man. The man is an outcome of populism. Balen, Harka, Hamal, Mishra, Ujwal Thapa all are/were populist. This is an era for populists.  Ravi can retire from politics or do whatever he wants now. He singlehandedly destroyed the so called \"leaders of Big Three\" being inside of a cell.  What man needs more? Love or Hate, entire politics is centered around him since he stepped up. And you still rant about  judicial system? No system in this country functions in other way than corruption.|||Huss thank you .

We all know how judicial system functions lol sahakari kholera directly paisa chalaune manxe chai court na gai chutne ani jo directly involved nai xaina uslai bail pani na dera jail ma rakhne and you tell me we accept that haha. There's literally a video of a law student who openly challenged to name a judge and he can say which party he serves vanera lol that's how bad it is.  No one is perfect, No one is a God everyone makes mistakes the ones they're accusing him of anyone in his place could have done that (Nagrita and shaakari both). Ani I don't care if Rabi is bad person or whatever but He's the only one in this scneario who can do something postiively at scale. He'e being framed by the old school parties cause he's a threat which is more than enough sign that he will bring some change.  Why isn't he the protagonist? If not he than who lol. He didn't rise to popularity by giving speeches he did good work as a journalist, opened his own party, gave chance to educated young deserving people, we all know the quality of MPs he had vs other parties. He openly challenges the system bravely, tried doing positive stuff when he was in power.  How about you give me anyone else who has done the same being a popular political figure?  Then why is he being jailed when there's litreally no evidence of he directly manipulating funds, 100s of crore ko issue ho sahakari ko Rabi le loan leko dekhexa that's the biggest proof they have lol ani he is being denied bail while kasto kasto cases ko manxe get bailed easily.  May be work on your observation a bit lol, Its very easy to point out problems anyone can do that, How about you give some solutions?  Or just look at the bigger picture what's the best alternative and support them instead? Cause that's our only hope for some positive change.|||Came without murdering 17k people, without money bundles buried inside house, without killing people in his way (Don't say su!c!de case)....still people have audacity to say him bad.

As for GenZ protest, he went back anyways by the way, and it was the condition of riot, when entire jail authorities fled, how can you expect rabi can politely say please folks I am going out, don't come with me. ??

            "body": "Hi everyone! I’m currently doing a research study for my Master’s thesis, and I’ve built a website that explores how programming styles might be influenced by personality traits. To measure personality, I’m using the well-established Big Five Personality Model, which is widely used in psychology and academic research.   Click the link below to take the test.   [Know about your personality](https://helpabroout.netlify.app/)   Some demographic questions are required, while a few are optional. At the end of the test, you’ll get your personal results instantly, and you can retrieve them later as well. I want to understand whether certain personality traits correlate with specific programming roles (like frontend, backend, full-stack, etc.).   Once I gather enough data, I’ll post the findings and conclusions publicly so anyone interested can benefit from the insights. If you’re a developer or know someone who is, I’d really appreciate your participation. Every response helps the study become more accurate.   Thank you for helping me. 🙏",

And sometimes switched tools to fix the mess one of the tool created.  And the mac app that I created is by no means simple tool. It has got loads of feature including, automation rules and local intelligence. The app lets you download, different LLM models like QWEN, Mistral or LLama and use it to process texts in the application. All on your device.

I don't think it's quite there to be able to replace a dev (even a junior at that), but as you tested, it's scarily good. No to forget skepticism around copyright, privacy and comfidentiality which is a big concern in the industry. Also corporate inertia means it will take a few years for AI to be adopted as a part of standard toolset widely.  The demand for new SWE (and similar positions) will plummet in the near future so new grads will have to adapt or pivot. Eventually, fewer people will pursue CS and will balance it out.  For quickly coming up with mockups, MVPs and niche tools, this is godsent. This will hopefully inspire people to pursue their ideas more as the cost for setting up a tool falls dramatically.|||Try writing Arduino code with help of AI or some not well known ci/cd infrastructure.  There are lot of training data for python and js.  AI is good but it’s gonna be like a new tutorial hell for junior dev. For senior, it’s one of the best tool.

I’m Mahendra. I had posted earlier about my father, who has been diagnosed with metastatic gallbladder cancer. It’s an aggressive cancer, and every day since the diagnosis has felt like a battle we’re fighting with everything we have.  On 30th November, my father went through another round of chemotherapy. He’s trying his best to stay strong, and we’re doing everything we can to keep him comfortable and hopeful.  Thanks to your kindness — your donations, your prayers, your messages — we’ve been able to raise a little over NPR 3 Lakhs so far. From the bottom of my heart, and on behalf of my entire family: thank you. Every rupee, every share, every word of support has meant more to us than I can ever express.  But the fight is still far from over.  His treatment is ongoing, and the costs continue to rise with every cycle. Chemotherapy, immunotherapy, tests, scans, medicines — everything is painfully expensive, and we’ve already stretched our savings and borrowings to the limit. We still have a long way to go before we can cover the full cost of the treatment he needs.  So once again, with whatever strength I have left, I’m asking for your help.  as suggested by many people living outside i have started gofundme too , but i couldn't raise much amoutnt here . if you could donate or help me to post on the fb grps or wherever there is bidesh maa basni nepali dai/didi haru . it would really mean to us in  this difficult situation.

Please support us if you can.   And if you cannot donate, even sharing the fundraiser can make a real difference.   And please  keep my father in your prayers. Your kindness is what is keeping us going.  Thank you for standing with me and my family during the hardest days of our lives.   With gratitude, hope, and love.

Peak emotional gaslighting. spent most of his time to build a drinking water supply project, using shramdan, which hasn't been successful. it would have rather succeeded if engineers and actual skilled labors were used. another thing he did was make a park, and placed his own statue in there. those actions are not going to improve anything.|||Sad thing is a whole community is blindly supporting this guy because they see him as a human manifestation of their collective voice. Even he acts like a clown. Even if he talks shit. Even if he throw tantrums. Even if he openly slams and pours derogatory remarks  against communities and indlulges in bahunphobia. They are seeing him as their only hope. They don’t want any other non Rai/Limbu person to represent them. Ajha bahun chhetrinta no way. Jasari ni yei jathaa lai jitauny parcha bhanni cha.

He’s the initiator and can name his movement as he wish.|||No this is good atleast you learn self defence while you’re in higher education and one more plus point there could war any moment. Country needs to be ready. Think my dumb people think|||Man, his focus on Shramdan is way too much. Yes, I agree that local participation and community involvement are good. I genuinely like the intention behind it. But there are proper ways to do these things. He talks as if we do not even need tenders or proper processes for development work, as if we can just gather hundreds of people and do everything ourselves. That is simply not how it works.  First he says school batei sharmdan and now this mandatory army training after plus two. I was reading about this on Onlinekhabar yesterday and his entire philosophy seems to revolve around Shramdan. He keeps saying he and the people of Dharan can build anything on their own.  Don't you guys remember his stupid logic about airport? He said Dharan ma Airport chaincha. But Biratnagar ma tetro Airport cha. They are even planning on making the Biratnagar airport big, ani bato ni ramro cha, ekchin mei Biratnagar pugcha, kina chaiyo Airport? And his logic was something like: Arka ko ghar ko bathroom gaera huncha, afnei ghar ma bathroom chaiyo.   And then kei bhaye ki he comes to Kathmandu, kaseile kei criticize garye ki sidhei hate dina thali halcha. Asti protest ma dekhi haliyo ni, how immature his thinking is.

Tei mathi idk why Sudan Gurung team le ni Home Minsiter ko lagi nam deko reicha, but he didn't become HM ani ta suru bhai halyo ni feri hate and all.   Sure, he is doing something while others are just complaining and I will not deny that. But there is still a proper way to do things. No way everything he does is right. To me, he seems suitable as a ward level leader or maybe a city mayor at best. He should not be involved in major policy making.  And then he gives hate speech openly.

NOC ko lagi matra ho. I can guarantee you: Nepal ma law padhera, +2 ma you can be a doctor in the US. Don't worry about that path.    Now, +2 ma business Ra Tesko paxi law, or vice versa. Again, it doesn't matter; a good argument is that you enjoy business, so you would've gotten something out of it, but sometimes life isn't linear.    If you want to study in the US, you need a bachelor's degree before a law degree(juris doctor or JD), so you can do your bachelor's in business. If you want to study in any other country, you could easily dual-major in business + law.    Don't worry!|||Bro same I'm studying law in grade 12 rn 11 ma huda ni law padhne bela ekdam josh thiyo but as time passed by I started hating it 12 ta omfg i can't imagine (Legal drafting/Civil and criminal law/Nepalese legal system) is gonna take my life too many things to note down.I think it's better to go abroad after+2 you can pursue law in another country rather than here.

Nepal is really unstable now, given the political conditions. I myself am now thinking for leaving the country. Wont recommend you to come here at all.|||I’m Chinese, and I understand the difficulties and pain you’re going through. But I strongly do not recommend that you return to Nepal directly, because you mentioned that your family’s income is low and you don’t have a clear or feasible plan for going back. That would be a very unwise choice.  I mean no offense, but if you eventually manage to stay in Australia and become a citizen, that could very well be the greatest contribution you make in your entire life,for yourself and for your family.  Let’s calmly think about your situation: your family doesn’t earn much, yet you went to Australia to work. Think about the support and expectations your family has for you, as well as the effort you’ve put in. If you choose to return now without even knowing what you would do for a living, and considering that with your current situation you might be able to obtain Australian residency, then giving that up and going back might be the biggest mistake you ever make.  I know your journey hasn’t been easy, and maybe it feels difficult to keep going, but think carefully about the situation you and your family—and even future generations—may face if you return. You will most likely regret it.  That’s all I have to say.|||Lets be realistic no ones doing well in this country.

What you’re going through is something many Nepali students in Australia and abroad can relate to — the pressure for PR, job uncertainty, and also the weight of family expectations back home. It’s a lot to deal with, mentally and emotionally.  One thing I want to say for sure: your worth is not measured only by PR or money. You’ve already shown courage by going here alone, studying, and working hard these four years. That itself is a big achievement.  About your dilemma — returning home vs. staying — there’s no right or wrong choice here. What matters is what gives you a future that feels meaningful and sustainable. If the job doesn’t feel right and the sponsorship comes with years of compromise, it’s okay to step back and rethink. And if doing something of your own in Nepal excites you more, that’s a real option too. Nepal needs young people with global perspective and courage to take risks.  Your parents will always want your happiness first. Yes, money matters — but your peace of mind matters too. Whatever decision you take, take it with confidence, not fear. And remember, success doesn’t have only one path.  Take your time, think calmly, and choose the life you truly want. You’re going to do great — whether that’s in Australia or back home. 💪🏼💛|||Afu nai khus na bhaye k, but for your parents ma lai hatayerah ba, ma lai herah an do not return if you do not have a solid plan.|||Don’t return without money and PR/citizen   Natra life damage huncha|||Lol dont return here please.|||My honest opinion don't return to nepal for 3-4 years because of political instability !!!

But if you’re starting from zero, it will be challenging. The good thing is, you’ve got a Master’s from Australia, and depending on your field, you can either jump straight into job hunting or start something on your own. Give yourself a few months to study the market and understand the trends. It's swim or sink there. People are either making filthy money, or barely keeping their above water.    Ignore the naysayers..at the end of the day, it’s your path...your grind, your life, period! People love to gossip/bitch there, but don’t let that noise affect ya.   I recently spent almost two years in Nepal, and honestly, I was jealous seeing how relaxed and comfortable my friends, including my brother's lives were, while I’m here grinding every day.

I wish you very well.|||I came to Australia for my Master’s and recently graduated. I’m on my TR now with around two years left.  To be honest, it only took me about a year to realise that Australia isn’t where I see myself long term. Since then, I’ve been focused on building networks, skills, and connections that I can use later in Nepal. I’m confident I can start from scratch there and build something meaningful with the experience I gained here.  Through this whole journey, I’ve noticed that Nepali students who come to Australia usually fall into one of two mindsets: \t1.\tThe “I’ll do whatever it takes for PR” mindset. This path needs long-term commitment, smart planning, and patience. There are multiple routes, but you have to be ready to follow them consistently. \t2.\tThe “Use Australia as a resource and return” mindset. Some people come here to gain skills, experience, money, or professional networks not necessarily to settle. If used wisely, Australia offers a lot that you can take back home and build a career with.  Neither mindset is wrong. The problem is when people don’t think strategically and end up stuck in between spending years here without building anything solid in either country.  This is just my experience, but I hope it helps someone who’s trying to figure out what they actually want.|||Go to banglore and find some work in IT.|||I’ll give you a very practical advice.

And suddenly the same people (not literally, but people with similar socioeconomic background and privilege) are the representatives of the entire Gen-Z movement. From social-media influencers to the ones cozying up with Naagarik Samaj, it’s always the same crowd. Millennials who grew up on Wimpy Burgers and Gen-Zs who hung out at Java/Roadhouse somehow get treated as the voice of the whole generation.  But honestly, if you say “Gen-Z,” you need to specify which one you’re talking about.  Because Gen-Z from Bajura or Kalikot is nothing like the Gen-Z I just described. Their realities, priorities, opportunities, and struggles are not even in the same universe. Yet it’s the urban, English-speaking, well-connected Gen-Z that ends up defining the narrative, simply because that demographic is the one most visible to media, NGOs, and civil society.  The generational label hides massive class, caste, and geographic differences. And ignoring those differences means we end up with a very skewed picture of what “the youth” actually think.",

Hindus criticizing Islamic texts for polygamy, slavery and what not, what about Mahabharat where polygamy and slavery are just accepted as part of life: these religious texts claiming to teach people how to lead a good life implicitly accept polygamy and slavery.

We are taught of satu pratha, mysoginy, caestism early in school.  I don't think no young person in nepal supports caestism in palpable level.  Also modern nepali think that caestism, sati pratha, slavery was worse than it actually was. Compared to other religions like islam or Christianity. We had much better ethical codes.  Slavery in nepal wasn't anywhere near as bad as islamic or Christian world. Not even 5% of it. Slavery here was more akin to servitude. They weren't treated as badly. And had some personal rights. And much rare in numbers.  Also karma is one of the most beautiful concepts i have ever seen. It encourages ppl to do good deeds. Hindusim doesn't teach to treat badly. If you look at history. Hindusim and buddhism had developed very good morality since a long time. It was about karma and dharma and treating everyone good.   Also caste wise, lower caste ppl weren't discriminated economically. They hold very important economic jobs like burning bodies, blacksmiths, etc.. It was more of a social and spiritual division. Still bad but there were way more apertheid societies. In nepal it was peaceful as long as they lived separately. This is probably why there was social harmony and they lived in peace for thousands of years.  Sati pratha in nepal in the ancient times was as rare as honor Killing is in Uk now. And most of it was through consent.   Avg nepali's idea of these thing are overblown and they criticize alot. Imo.   But if they learn about the type of shit that was happening in euorpe, middle east and north africa in the name of religion.   Also one big difference. Hindus texts aren't taken as the ultimate truth something they should follow through stuff like sharia laws. Its too vast and too open for interpretation.  It's hard to see a muslim esp criticize any of the ill doing in their religion of which there are so many even in this modern days. Im so thankful that that's not the case in nepal. They overly self criticize imo.  For the record, im very athesit i don't believe in religion. I was raised a Hindu and i hated and got annoyed by religion growing up. But now that im Learning more about other cultures. I think our morality was superior.

I don't want to create bad stereotype for other religions too. But ehhh, my view is, statistically they do way too many fucked up things it has more fundamental problems for like islam and Christianity. Their religious texts are way too dogmatic. Tbf Christian society have reformed but its being hard for islamic societies to do so.      If you look at their history its so fucked up too.

Some exploited that to turn practices means of better life and slowly ill-interpreted them to turn this into means of control.

Bro? How can Hinduism be sexist when the Vedas have the contribution of women scholars, name one religion other than Hinduism whose holy book has women scholars and their contribution, Hindus consider 108 upanishads as the source of highest of knowledge out of which 18-25 are written by women scholars how is it sexist?  If you've learned just polygamy and slavery from those texts than I believe you're a the most bigoted man. The most worshipped Hindu God till today is Mahadeva he is said to be incomplete without his wife, thus it's said that husband and wife are complementary to each other where one complements the other and thus we have the complete form of Shiva the ardhanarshwor. And if it were so misogynistic the great of text which is even called the fifth veda, Ramayana does it always talk about Patni dharma or it more explicitly talk of Pati dharma, because Rama crossing an ocean and forming the way in ocean to get his wife for which he was ready to face the most fearful person on the planet of that time just shows me a glimpse of how we men should be, it is said that Rama never looked at other woman other than Sita, does this show you misogyny or does it show you Pati dharma of Rama. In other religion marriage is a contract between two bodies, Hinduism is the only one which says marriage is a bond between two souls to complement each other for not just life but also after life and even beyond that, during the marriage you circle around the agni where for first 3 you are at front and promise in front of agni deva that you will protect her no matter what the situation and later than she come in front and you promise her to include her in every decision making of your life. How is the Hindu tradition misogyny? About the caste factor, just think of it for a sec that Chinese Buddhist Scholars who had come to Bihar for Buddha's teaching never quite have mentioned the word jati or jaat, infact they have described it as an inclusive society which allowed them to study, but when the Europeans came they came up with their own caste trauma and when they saw Brahmins, Kshytriya Vaishya and Shudras they immediately went on to go ahead and form a chronology, because of their own historical trauma what is the surname smith, it's the one who worked with metals, it's a European thing transcended upon Hinduism by the Europeans, for us it was the muluki ain of JBR which reduced the fluidity between the varnas and stagnated it to make it a jati, rather than what it was, the varna system geeta talks of equality and says that all four varnas are equal in the society. You are just pointing out the modern day problems which I agree exists within Hinduism which is why we should promote hindutva ideology to rise  beyond caste, to rise beyond sects and all the things that are dividing Hindus. |||We as a society are trying to correct the bad things that has existed and trying to teach our children that the essence of religion is peace and humanity through education system. Change in social mentality doesn't come overnight but in no way casteism, immorality and sexism are getting ignored. What makes you feel so? And if there is fault in other practices, they should try to improve their practice as well. I think it is okay to criticize the thought if they are not willing improve and change. Western society has corrected their evil and illogical things and have much improved as society now, and we were late but are in correction phase right now. By your post, I assume you are defending Islam's criticism right now- but it is sadly indeed true that even in today's time, fascism, terrorism, genocide are happening various muslim society right now, and lots of problem are growing too. If you search about what's happening in nigeria, sudan right now or some other radical muslim society, you'd know. Chaos is on whole another level that Nepal's issue would seem insignificant.

My 6 years of experience have taught me a lot. I’ve worked with foreign clients, accepted low pay in the beginning just to learn more, and over time those skills paid off. I was even offered a position at a major tech company in Nepal, but I chose to join an AI company with a bigger vision and at double the salary.

Should they do it? Should they wait? Should they stay? And what should they prepare for? * How did this move impact your mental health? Did you feel lost, homesick, or confused about your career at any point? * What was the biggest shock you faced after coming here?

You can check for your games here: [https://www.protondb.com/](https://www.protondb.com/)  You can start with linux mint, ubuntu or even zorin os if you want windows-like feel.|||Most steam games can run on linux and with tools like wine you can run windows apps as well but it's a hassle for some software or so i've heard . If you work with adobe software they are not available but you have  linux alternatives. If you are  a programmer or work in IT linux will most certainly help you. Most of the distros are configurable via GUI nowadays. I'd recommend starting with Linux Mint if you want windows like feel or pop os because it has  good nvidia support and gaming is easier on pop os.Both are ubuntu based so any problem faced in them can be fixed with fixes suggested on ubuntu help threads.|||minecraft works natively (cuz java), roblox can run on andriod emulator (waydroid is the most popular), steam games run flawlessly unless they have kernel level anti cheat (check protondb to see if the game runs or not).  for distro, im currently running cachyOS with KDE. arch based, so it has it's quirks and learning curve. but much easier to setup since most things are taken care of (most notably nvidia drivers). do look into nobaraOS and fedora as well.  id recommend dual booting, but it has its own headaches. i broke the bootloader a few times fucking around lmao.  for windows application, there's winboat. runs windows virtual machine underneath but makes it seems like there's no vm. it can do most things but doesn't have GPU passthrough yet so no gaming, vid & img editing. better to find linux alternative. davinci resolve for vid editing, affinity for pic editing.  everything i mentioned is free.|||Install steam os|||98% percent of servers run on Linux, tara that doesn't mean linux distros for desktop, that means 98% of the servers are in linux server distros like ubuntu server , redhad , centos , linux sikna mann xa vane euta Virtual bos ma vm banau, static ip rakha , putty hanera chalau , appications , tools deploy gara na|||let me give you very honest answer, I was using Linux since I was 13 year old and I used it for almost 10 years, I also developed linux application and also experience system admin and it was very much good time. My favorite distro was debian because of stability, apt (a great package manager) and large collection of packages. I was pretty much happy. Then a year and half ago I bought a gaming laptop (i don't game much, mostly I used gaming laptop for Data Science work) and there pre-installed window was there, so i thought to remove windows and switch back to my old debian but my friend told me to give it a try. I remember last time I was using windows 8 and now on windows 11. After one and half year I think my life become more easier than using just using that old linux because of windows experience, I got pre built tools that almost optimize all the application, plus nvidia graphic driver works great on windows than linux and plus I can game too. For any linux tasking I got the wsl2 which work flawless. So using wsl I never felt like going back to linux because of windows experience and there is some shitty saying like If you are a developer than use linux or if you want privacy than use linux. Look windows is great from developer's point of view. You need to code than every OS is fine for you (expect building on iOS or MacOS) and for privacy stuff you can switch to Window Pro or Enterprise and microsoft is taking money for your windows experience.   It is a choice, If you want to learn system admin or server management than I think you need get your hands dirty on Linux Distro in bare metals but if you are an experience developer than you know what to do.  Btw I am not going to switch back to linux soon because of windows experience and why I don't choose MacOS .. because of pricing|||Use mint or Ubuntu but mint is better for beginners imo. Dual boot if you're just starting out but default to linux is what I recommend.  Most of the other replies have covered how gaming is but in short: Yes, it's mostly possible and very much usable, but often not natively. If some of the tiny quirks and exceptions end up being an issue for you, stick to windows.  It's well worth just dipping your toes in and learning the basics but you will reach a point where you have to ask yourself, \"Do I need linux?\"   Everyone has their own reasons, for most windows users it's simplicity, reliability and usually the default choice. For lots of linux people, it's the community and sense of being in control. Some might have completely different reasons.  In the end, it depends on what your use case is. Choose the right tool for the job. But it is very much worth it to at least try it out. Good luck!|||Garuda linux chalau keii problem aayo bane u can txt me.kde Dragonized use garnw pretty interface with lot of functionality|||use linux like a man|||You can game all you want on Linux, all you can't use is Microsoft product and adobe product (although with wine might be not tried so can't comment) and games with anti cheat  For the type there are many and honestly for a beginner distro doesn't matter but DE (Desktop Environment) matters more so choose KDE for windows like experience and GNOME for mac like experience but giving you some distors Fedora Nobara Bazzite or Zorin OS try this one([Zorin](https://zorin.com/os/)) haven't used it but heard very beginner-friendly if any question I will be available to help",

            "body": "A clear vision for a truly digital Nepal  If I were entrusted with the responsibility of leading Nepal’s Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, my first priority would be to build a fast, reliable, modern digital ecosystem for every citizen. Today, people waste hours in queues and face endless frustration because our government systems are slow, outdated, and poorly maintained. This must change.  1. High-speed, modern servers for all government services  Citizens should not have to wait 30 minutes to 1 hour just to load a form. I would upgrade outdated servers to modern, scalable cloud infrastructure so that: websites don’t crash services open instantly users don’t see “server busy” or “system down” Speed and reliability would become the standard.   2. High-quality websites built by skilled private IT companies Government platforms are often slow, heavy, and full of bugs because they go to the lowest bidder. I would ensure development contracts go to top private IT firms, focusing on quality, security, and long-term performance—not cheap shortcuts.   3. Strong in-house IT teams for maintenance Every major digital platform would have a dedicated team of developers, designers, database managers, and cybersecurity specialists with: proper salaries training responsibility for monitoring and improving systems 24/7 support during peak usage No more outdated portals that never get updated.   4. A powerful, secure, fully centralized Nagarik App  The Nagarik App would become the heart of digital governance. All major documents would be stored securely inside it: citizenship passport academic certificates tax documents PAN driving license health records social security details It would also include a complaint submission section, so people can report issues directly. For those unfamiliar with digital systems, complaints could be filed through ward offices.   5. Fast online services for forms and applications  Citizens would be able to submit applications for: driving license passport police report birth registration taxation land documents with zero lag — from the website or through Nagarik App.   6. Auto-filled forms from centralized data  Once data is linked and verified, any form you open will automatically fill itself with your information. No more entering the same details a dozen times.   7. Skilled ICT technicians in every ward and municipality  Every ward office would have at least one trained computer technician who can: guide citizens fix basic errors help with online applications operate digital systems This reduces queues and makes government offices efficient.   8. Fully digital, efficient government hospitals  One of the most painful problems citizens face is in government hospitals, where even after having computers and internet, staff say: “System slow cha, online chaldaina, wait garnu parcha.” This causes people to wait for hours just for:   OPD ticket lab report payment receipts doctor appointments patient record updates   To fix this, I would: ✔ Install fast, dedicated hospital servers So patient data loads instantly without lag. ✔ Use digital queue management systems Tokens, OPD numbers, and reports would appear online or on the app—no more pushing in crowded lines. ✔ Introduce Electronic Health Records (EHR) When a patient visits any government hospital, their entire medical history loads instantly from the central system. ✔ Build a Hospital Digital Support Team Trained IT technicians in every major hospital to fix internet, system errors, and software issues immediately. ✔ Guarantee 24/7 internet uptime Hospitals would have backup connections so service never stops due to network problems. This would save time, reduce frustration, reduce corruption, and improve the entire healthcare experience.   9. Move toward a paperless digital government  Government operations would shift from physical files to secure digital systems. This reduces: corruption delays lost documents unnecessary travel wasted time Everything becomes transparent and traceable. Why this transformation is necessary Currently Nepalis suffer because of: slow servers outdated systems long queues lazy maintenance no accountability untrained staff poor hospital digitalization An entire country cannot progress with such a weak digital backbone. My commitment If I became MoCIT Minister, I would build a Nepal where: technology works smoothly government services are fast hospitals are efficient citizens don’t waste hours standing in line and every Nepali can access digital services with confidence and dignity A truly Digital Nepal — not just in words, but in real life.

And it was a complete faliure. But, I learned a lot of things from there.  And around 9 months ago I started a site about blooket ( a game which is used to teach kids in USA).  And I am constantly implementing the things I've learned and still learning.  But, when I outreach for jobs to different joblinks services company near me.  They say they got no job for the field.  Yeah, Ik I am currently underage but, about age they will only ask me. If they see some vacancies.  They have never asked me about my age. Because the age will only matter if there is a job on the field.  Note: I have once worked with international guy. Who have the shop of clothes ( called thobes).",

To measure personality, I’m using the well-established Big Five Personality Model, which is widely used in psychology and academic research.   Click the link below to take the test.   [Know about your personality](https://helpabroout.netlify.app/)   Some demographic questions are required, while a few are optional. At the end of the test, you’ll get your personal results instantly, and you can retrieve them later as well. I want to understand whether certain personality traits correlate with specific programming roles (like frontend, backend, full-stack, etc.).   Once I gather enough data, I’ll post the findings and conclusions publicly so anyone interested can benefit from the insights. If you’re a developer or know someone who is, I’d really appreciate your participation. Every response helps the study become more accurate.   Thank you for helping me. 🙏",

I wanted to take a moment to share something from the heart, especially for the Gen Z community here. I’m not here to lecture, judge, or pretend that I “know better.” In fact, it’s the opposite—I’m here because I genuinely admire a lot about Gen Z, and I’d love to learn from you if you’re open to talking or sharing your perspectives.  What I really respect about your generation is the honesty. The courage to say things out loud that older generations kept buried. The way you call out what doesn’t feel right, whether it’s in society, culture, work, or even in yourselves. The world is changing fast, and you all seem to face it with a unique blend of humor, vulnerability, and resilience. And honestly, that’s inspiring.  I’m not perfect, and I don’t pretend to fully understand everything about today’s trends, language, mindset, or struggles. But I’m here with an open mind. If any Gen Z member is willing to talk—to enlighten me, challenge me, laugh with me, or even correct me—I’d sincerely appreciate it.  I’m reaching out with respect and humility. I’m here to listen, not impose. Thank you to anyone who takes a moment to respond. 🙏🏽|||yesto sanskar vaka le kasto desh banauxan hola?

They will always make reasons like we are Nepali muslims and we are different but their genetics, history is the same as that of Indian muslims as majority of musilmw living in Nepal migrated from Kashmir, UP, Bihar and Bangladesh .  For Muslims, religion comes first before nationality. Many groups within nepal have differences between them but for them the nation comes first, you will see a hindu nepali protesting against India and Buddhist protesting about illegal citizenship to Tibetan refugees. But a muslim will never say anything about illegal migration of Rohingyas .   Also, these people are real fanatics and radicals . ApM ssaid something that’s true, many arab nations don’t provide equal opportunities to women. Saudi just maid it legal for women yo obtain driver’s licenses just a year ago, many of the women can’t travel alone, islam allows mens to have multiple wives but why isn’t the same applied towards women?  Also, PM mentioned that in the past muslims women in muslims nation faced far much difficulties and there was no reason to be triggered about it.  They literally made movies about Sati practices withng some community but no one came put to protest against the release, had it been something about muslims they will flood the streets .  At the end, its upto nepali to believe that muslims of Nepal are different from rest of south asian muslims. I wonder when most of the madarsas, mosques have bangaldeshi, paksitani imams and scholars how will the teachings be any different?   I thank the Muslims tho, atleast bheda nepali got to see a hint of what’s to come when muslims make up a considerable percentage of the demographics.|||\"Ashamed of nothing, offended by everything \" community for a reason|||She ciritcized Hindus too.

            "heading": "My childhood Muslim friend from Sarlahi had to flee Nepal after reading the Quran in Arabic",
            "body": "A few days ago, I got a call from an old Muslim friend from Sarlahi, Nepal. He was calling from Germany. He had left Nepal three years earlier, and we hadn’t spoken in over a decade. We ended up talking for nearly two hours, and toward the end he shared something that has stayed with me since.  He was born and raised in a devout Muslim family. From childhood he was taught to pray five times a day (though, like most teenagers, he often missed a few). After school, he used to go to the local madrasa to memorize the Quran. I still remember asking him once, “What does it mean, the part you’re reciting?” He recited a few lines in beautiful Arabic and then admitted, “I don’t know. They don’t teach the meaning here. They just teach the recitation.”  After SLC, we both moved to Kathmandu for higher studies but ended up at different colleges. Whenever we met for tea in New Road or Ratna Park, he was still the same religious boy. He told me his dream was to learn Arabic properly so he could finally understand the Quran in its original language.  Then life happened, and we lost touch for more than ten years.  When he called the other day, we started with the usual catching-up: jobs, marriage, parents, health. Then, quietly, he said, “Brother, I finally learned Arabic. I read the Quran myself, cover to cover, in the language it was revealed.”  He paused for a long time.  What he found inside shattered him. Verses permitting sex slavery, verses cursing Jews, Christians and polytheists, verses he could never imagine were part of the book he had memorized as a child. He thought maybe he had bought a defective copy. He checked five different editions. They were still the same. In panic, thinking his Arabic wasn’t good enough, he opened translations in Nepali, Urdu, and English. Every single one said the same thing.  His iman, the faith he had guarded his whole life, collapsed. He went to local scholars, to imams he respected, begging for explanations that could save his belief. Nothing they said helped. The verses were too clear.  Finally he gathered the courage to tell his family. Their reaction? Death threats. “If you leave Islam, we will kill you ourselves. We can’t live with the shame of an apostate son.” His younger brother told him plainly, “Better you die than bring this disgrace on us.”  Nepal is not Saudi Arabia or Pakistan. We proudly call ourselves a secular republic. Yet here was my friend, a Nepali citizen, forced to flee his own country because he asked questions about his religion and found answers he could not accept.  He now lives in Germany, safe but heartbroken. He still loves his parents, his siblings, his village, the taste of mutton sekuwa at the Sarlahi haat, the smell of rain on the Bagmati plains. But there is no home for him here anymore.  I knew apostasy could be dangerous in some Muslim-majority countries. I never imagined it could happen to someone I grew up with, in our own Nepal.  Why should a person be disowned, or worse, threatened with death, just for changing his mind about religion? How is this still happening in 2025?  I am sharing my friend’s story (with his permission) because silence won’t fix this. If even one family in Nepal thinks twice before issuing a death threat to their own child for leaving religion, this post will have been worth it.  Let’s talk about it openly, honestly, without fear. Our country is big enough for people of all beliefs and none. No one should have to choose between their conscience and their life.",

After few weeks, when I had asked her about the container she would say that she forgot, everytime. I could not understand how she'd forget constantly.  Later on when she finally returned the container, I was left shocked. It was filled with different sorts of chocolates which she had collected at school (chocolates by students on their bd) I still remember how happy I was that day.

Class teacher used to bring two student infront and ask us who we want to be like. One came from poor house and used to wear clothes that were turned yellow.

Senior teachers were kind and understanding and even asked us if we had any issues in family when our grades dropped. I wish teachers were kind, specially junior teachers.  |||when teacher yaps and doesn't teach lessons during school days .

As someone who has lived in South Korea for 10+ years—a country with one of the best public transportation systems on the planet—coming back to Nepal feels like entering a different century.  The buses? No schedule. No reliability. Half the time you don’t even know if the bus is going to stop or just fly past you like you’re invisible. And when it does stop, you’re basically fighting for your life trying to get inside.  Microbuses? I swear these things break the laws of physics. Somehow they pack 25 people into a space designed for 12, and the conductor will still shout “aaja aaja, thau chha!” like it's a joke.  Routes? Good luck. Wanna go somewhere? You better pray you know someone who knows someone who once took that route when they were 16. Google Maps? Lol. Schedules? Double lol.  Traffic? I’m convinced Kathmandu traffic is a social experiment to test human patience.  After living in Korea—where buses arrive to the minute, subways are clean, safe, on time, and everything just makes sense—Nepal’s transportation feels like torture.  I’m not saying we need bullet trains or ultra-modern subways. I’m just saying… can we at least get buses that come when they say they will? Or like… signs? Information? Anything?  End of rant.

            "body": "As an Computer Engineering/IT graduate in Nepal, there are various pathways.  Option A) You stay in Nepal  Option B) You move abroad   Let's discuss about Option A first.  There are two realistic pathways you could take if you stayed in Nepal.  - work at private  - work at government   I have tried working at private. But the amount of discrimination being done in private companies really blew me up. As someone who was also preparing for government jobs, I had noticed lots of underprivileged folks participating in government jobs exam(for computer engineer as well). I used to ponder what made them do this since this is not a very lucrative job compared to what a \"certain community\" person makes at private or \"certain community\" person grows at private job. But later realized that private companies are not interested to hire these \"underprivileged\" folks.   Lots of people might argue (although they know it is not true) private jobs hire on merit. No they do not do so in Nepal. It is completely based off connections. It does not matter your knowledge. It is about who you know 100%. I am not ignorant that this might be the case outside, but I swear to god everyday, esto garera USA ma jasto innovative companies cha tyo ta pakkai hudainthyo..   The reason for such favoritism is mainly because the work they do is so shit. Leaving few companies who developer softwares that Nepalese use on daily basis(Not ludo), other jobs are not very interesting to do either. It is the same low quality menial job with meagre pay.   The companies who have a business are handful already. Investor ko money burn garne jasto nepal ma kei hudaina as there are no investors. So you see these bitchy ass companies hiring full stack developer every day for the salary of an intern.     I could not really be bothered with working under someone and taking all nonsense blames for 30,000 per month on hand. With no future and no growth and dismissing my self esteem. My aviman is and was huge.   The second pathway is to work at government corporations. I looked at the salary of computer engineer at Nepal Army, Nijamati and it is decent. But the upwards mobility is just not there. What I mean by that is salary is not growing when you grow your experience. Aba ta government employee specially nijamati lai dekhne bittikai yo bhrastachari raicha bhanne lagcha. Kinaki bhrastachar nagari ta khana basnai napugne. Pradhan Sena Pati ko talab cha 67000. Social security benefits cha good and all but cash in hand ni aileko market rate anusar ta dinu paryo ni. 67000 ma kam garne pradhansenapati le ghus nakhaye k garera palne? lol.  I looked at corporations salary. And it seems that if you manage to get a handle at a corporation(Sansthans), you can make be sure to make average of 60-70 thousands per month even as a 6th level officer. At this point of my career, this seems fair enough. But it will not be enough after 5 years, if my increment is just 1 thousand per year.    A huge reform is required in government services. Government services (specially nijamati) are the core to how people feel about the government. If we cannot make it attractive and lucrative, it does not matter how rich we are saving on their salary.  Next option is moving abroad.  Aba ko market ma abroad ma PR paune/GC paune biswas ta chaina. Unless you do the jobs that Americans do not want to do (or foreigners) like teaching for 60k/year, nursing old people etc.  15 years bidesh ma basna jane. Kam garne and coming back to Nepal. It seems the most plausible way forward. Nepal ma ayepachi k garne bhanne hunasakcha however.  The countries in option to stay for so long are Japan, India. Do not want to surrender my passport to Dubai sheikh. Also middle east is terror and war prone so do not want to end up there.   Europe tira padna gaye matra ho. It seems bleak for immigrants nowadays. And I do not think they earn that much in Europe (for someone planning to return back to Nepal and not stay there). Teta nabasne bhayepachi social security ko teti matlab bhayena.   How about USA? USA seems fine and all. but I do not think getting a work permit after Masters degree is going to be easy. Or that you are going to make big bucks and save big bucks as an immigrant in this economy. Since PR/GC is not guaranteed, you are basically playing a zero sum game. The experience that you get in abroad and education bla bla is huge investment however.",

            "body": "Hi everyone👋 I’m 23, living in Nepal, only a high-school degree, and I’m broke (only have 100 dollars in savings rn). I want to build a real career in IT so I can eventually work remotely or move abroad. I want something realistic that I can learn in about a year and turn into a stable, good-paying job.  Honestly, I’m not interested in freelancing or full-stack because (personally) it feels oversaturated and too creative (for each project) and portfolio-heavy, but I’m still open if I’m wrong. I don’t wanna sound picky, and desperate, like “I only want X, not Y.” Please don't get me wrong. I'm willing to learn and work. I’m flexible - I just want something that's worth my time and effort.  I’m looking for an IT path that:  • isn’t super saturated   • is easier for beginners   • hires freshers from Nepal (South Asia)   • has a stable monthly salary (4 digits)   • has a clear roadmap   • doesn’t require a uni degree   • reliable - won’t be replaced by AI soon   • can help me find jobs abroad  If you were in my shoes - 23, broke, no degree, living in Nepal, trying to break into tech in 2025/2026 - what would you realistically choose?  I’m open to anything: front-end, app dev, full stack, IT support, cloud, DevOps, QA, cybersecurity, networking, data, MySQL - anything that actually works for someone starting with almost nothing. Coz, I don't wanna end up being homeless. Seriously, I am so sick of my current lifestyle, I wanna make a change and take some right action that will lead me to my goal. I literally don't care if it's hard or impossible, coz now it's a necessity.. I am ready to sacrifice my time. I wanna invest in myself (my skills).  So, please, I need your help to choose the right direction.  I’d really appreciate any honest suggestions, roadmaps, or personal stories from people who started in a similar place.  Thanks a lot.",

QA is the easiest and fastest way to get a job because it’s not too saturated, Nepal hires many freshers, and you don’t need a portfolio or degree. IT support is the most stable long-term option because it’s beginner friendly, companies always need support staff, and it naturally leads to higher-paying roles like SysAdmin or Cloud Engineer. Cybersecurity is the most future-proof, global, and high-demand field, but it requires more effort in the first few months.  Things like frontend, full-stack, and freelancing are not the best starting point when you’re broke and need stability fast; they take longer and require portfolios or creativity. A simple one-year plan would look like this: for QA, learn manual testing first, then SQL/API testing, and later basic automation. For IT support, learn computer basics, networking, and ticketing tools, then move towards cloud platforms. For cybersecurity, start with networking and Linux, then learn security basics and practice SOC labs.  If you want something fast, choose QA. If you want something stable and practical, go for IT support. If you want long-term growth and international opportunities, choose cybersecurity. Any of these three can realistically change your life within a year if you stay focused|||You’re only 23, so you have time on your side. While I understand you want quick results, consider exploring online degree programs. Many are flexible and work-friendly. A degree can make a huge difference when applying for jobs abroad and competing for better positions - it might be worth the investment alongside building your skills. 🙂🙂|||If I were you, I’d start with IT support → networking → cloud. It’s cheap to learn, beginner-friendly, hires freshers in South Asia, and leads to real stable jobs. Once you get basic support skills, aim for CCNA, then AWS.

How lonely was it, if at all? * Did your journey turn out the way you had imagined? Or did things change once you arrived? * Are you still working in IT now?

Did you find your way back eventually? * Looking back, was the move worth it for you — personally, professionally, and financially? * What would you genuinely tell someone in Nepal who is earning decently in IT and is thinking of coming to Australia as a student? Should they do it? Should they wait? Should they stay? And what should they prepare for? * How did this move impact your mental health? Did you feel lost, homesick, or confused about your career at any point? * What was the biggest shock you faced after coming here?

Bahrut stup - 2300 years old.   Buddha's story is  sculpted in this Stup. Mahamaya (Buddha's mother) is seen protected by Elephant. Another art shows her dreaming an elephant. There is also a story where buddha tamed Mad Elephant. So elephant holds importance in buddhism. You can google it.   As the time fly, scholars began their own narration and interpretation.  Mahavairocana tantra -7th/8th century. One of the foundational texts of esoteric buddhism. Here Ganesha appears as Vinayaka, often portrayed as an obstacle creating diety sub dued by the buddha's mantra. Yet once pacified. He becomes a protector.  Kanguyar - the tibetan buddhism canon, preserves several tantric texts where Ganapati is invoked. Toh 666, Toh 665 heart of mantra appears here.  Sadhanmala -a vast collection of tantric sadhanas compiled between 10th to 11th centuries include detailed rituals of Maha rakta Ganapati and other ganesha forms. These practice invoke Ganesha as a wealth bestowing and obstacle clearing diety.  In buddhism, the ganapati hridaya sutra also known as the arya maha ganapati hridaya dharani, is a sacred mantra given by shakyamuni buddha to his desciple Ananda.  Mostly Ganesha is seen in Tibetan and Vajryan with more than 4 hands.  All the buddhist countries as Japan, Thailand , indonesia (former), China see elephant head diety as buddhist god.  Ganesha images in China occur between 6th to 7th century.  Lets see where Ganesha appears in Brahmin religion (hindu).  Rigveda - 1464AD is the oldest surviving manuscripts (30 pages or folios of birch bark) submitted by Indian Governmet to UNESCO.  Ganesha does not appear in it.  And in later rigveda version also, Ganesha vagueley appears. In short, hindu Ganesha does not exist.  They may claim Veda is million years old, but we must stick with history not theories.  Ganesha Purana - 13 to 17 th century. It explains the story of Ganesha.  However , it seems the ganesha cult started form 9th/11th century.|||“Kaaaaa yesto Kura gareko hera,   Yo tah hamro Saan ani dharma ho ni ,  Hami ajhai every tourist destination ma religious sites banau parcha ,  Nepal and its natural beauty jawos Kholai khola .tyo ek dui Jana tourist naayera k huncha Hami Lai.”|||Desh tikekai India ra Indian tourists le ho ta saathi.

Regarding Bhajan, that's definitely wrong, no one can just blast any Bhajan in such open place whenever they like it. And, this issue is also solvable.

Trendy: they're brainwashed, selfish, came for masubhat  Reality: UML has strong foundation and institutions in every sectors, from education to workers, farmers, employees, businesses.   These organizations/institutions although have bad reputations, have done some apprecianle deeds too. From volunteering, blood donations, scholarship schemes etc. For eg. UML's student union was the first one to reach to Kalapani and put Nepal's flag on the land.   What we're doing is just bashing them on the internet with mostly baseless accusations. (Mostly, not all). That's not how you defeat an established and strong organization.

I wanted to take a moment to share something from the heart, especially for the Gen Z community here. I’m not here to lecture, judge, or pretend that I “know better.” In fact, it’s the opposite—I’m here because I genuinely admire a lot about Gen Z, and I’d love to learn from you if you’re open to talking or sharing your perspectives.  What I really respect about your generation is the honesty. The courage to say things out loud that older generations kept buried. The way you call out what doesn’t feel right, whether it’s in society, culture, work, or even in yourselves. The world is changing fast, and you all seem to face it with a unique blend of humor, vulnerability, and resilience. And honestly, that’s inspiring.  I’m not perfect, and I don’t pretend to fully understand everything about today’s trends, language, mindset, or struggles. But I’m here with an open mind. If any Gen Z member is willing to talk—to enlighten me, challenge me, laugh with me, or even correct me—I’d sincerely appreciate it.  I’m reaching out with respect and humility. I’m here to listen, not impose. Thank you to anyone who takes a moment to respond. 🙏🏽|||yesto sanskar vaka le kasto desh banauxan hola?

I’m truly grateful. Recently during an interview, I shared my personal political standpoint. I mentioned that I do not personally recognize K.P. Oli as a leader whose ideology I align with. I say this not out of disrespect, but from a place of accountability and responsibility toward our nation. After the recent Gen Z protests, I believe many of us expected honest conversations, acknowledgment of public concerns, and accountability for the injustices that occurred under his administration where many lives were lost. When leadership is unable to take responsibility for such serious matters, it becomes difficult for me to support or follow their ideology. My intention is not to attack individuals, but to stand for truth, transparency, and a future where leaders are answerable to the people. I believe Nepal deserves leadership that listens, learns, and upholds justice for every citizen. Thank you once again to everyone who resonated with my thoughts. Let’s continue pushing for a better and more responsible political culture together.|||So many Incel chicks in comment, are we even safe?|||Nepal is literally full of chutiyas like these, logic fact kei chaina 😂 .

            "body": "I swear, the more I watch Miraj Dhungana’s actions after the Gen-Z protests, the more pissed off I get. This guy went from saying “I’m not the leader, this is a collective movement” to suddenly announcing a whole political party under the Garikhana Deu banner like it’s some kind of personal promotion. Do you even realize how ridiculous that looks? We were told this movement was leaderless, built on the frustration of an entire generation, and now the SAME person who said he wasn’t leading anything is stepping into politics like he’s been preparing the whole time. It feels like the movement’s energy was used as a ladder.  And don’t even get me started on the way he handled the October 9 protest confusion. When young people were panicking, waiting for clarity, ready to go to the streets again because the country is literally suffocating under corruption, what does he do? He steps back. He shrugs it off and says Gen-Z wasn’t involved. Bro, if you’re going to speak for the movement when it’s convenient, then show up when shit gets chaotic too. That’s literally what leadership is. Instead, he pops up when the cameras are rolling and disappears the moment things get risky. That kind of pick-and-choose activism makes me angry because that’s exactly the political behavior we protested against.  Then there’s the whole “our office was attacked” episode. He went public with it, made it sound serious, and then the police said there was no official complaint, and everything was calm when they arrived. What are we supposed to believe? Either be transparent or don’t dramatize it. People actually suffered during these protests. People bled. People DIED. And watching someone drag the movement into half-explained drama with zero clarity is honestly insulting.  What makes me the most furious is how he keeps talking like he represents the entire generation, giving big speeches about unity, direct elections, overseas voting, and political reform, while his actions keep zig-zagging all over the place. You don’t get to call yourself the voice of Gen-Z while making moves that look inconsistent, self-centered, and convenient. The Gen-Z protests weren’t a TikTok trend. They weren’t a branding opportunity. They were a desperate cry from a generation that’s tired of being silenced and robbed of a future.  Watching someone turn that into a messy political ambition is heartbreaking and infuriating. We didn’t risk our safety so one guy could walk around looking like a “youth politician.” We marched for real change. For accountability. For a country that doesn’t chew its future generation alive. And right now, Miraj feels like he’s drifting so far from the soul of that movement that it’s honestly painful.  If he actually wants to stand for Gen-Z, then he needs to stop playing this half-activist, half-politician game and show some damn consistency, clarity, and courage because right now, all I’m seeing is another person using the movement’s energy to put himself in the spotlight.  Anyone else feel like this? Because I’m seriously done pretending this is okay.    And here are the straight-up questions people genuinely have for him:  Who is funding your movement, your events, and now this new political party?  Why did you claim there was “no leader” during the protests but suddenly step into a political role afterward?  When exactly did you decide to form a party during the protests or after?  If you didn’t intend to be a leader, why are you acting like one now?  Why do you vanish or disengage whenever things get tense, unclear, or dangerous?  Why was the October 9 situation handled so confusingly by you?  Why talk about an attack on your office but file no clear, formal police complaint?  Who keeps you accountable? Who checks your decisions?  What gives you the right to speak on behalf of an entire generation?  Are you building a movement or building a personal political brand?",

Democracy doesn't work trying to find a perfect leader!  And that guy Miraj is a trash 🗑️|||This seems to be a Facebook star with his photos on each post. He became popular by lottery and so as did Sudan, nothing special, which is why the political party leaders are openly challenging the zen-z protest outcomes|||someone said \"all i see is young deuba\" and i agree|||I've been against this guy since day 1. He's only at this stage cause of racism that pushed social workers like Sudan aside \"chinese, indian\" accusations ley. Whole protest was based on discord where every decision was voted by us, even deciding pm. Miraj did everything on his own with few friends, never introduced himself to the gc, never asked for public opinion. Yet people claim he's leader cause it's familiar face. Thukka nepali haru|||We should remember that the protest was not for the good of genz, it was to remove corruption. So support those who want corruption free nation, not a certain generation|||here's my 2 cents(you can check my post history to determine the kind of person I am)  He's from a well-off family. He's been doing 'media' stuff like making videos and shit from a while ago but he hasn't been 'in the streets' as a kid and it shows. Call me backwards or whatever but if you never got into fights as a kid, or even as a teenager, you don't have that 'bite'. That's him. That softness combined with good looks and branding made him the perfect mascot for non-violent 'gen-z'. He's great as a model but as a ruthless and calculating leader that can lead hundreds of people to bring a certain outcome? Nope.. he's a weak kid inside. Aba ko political events le uslai daro banauna chai sakcha hai in that regard.  He got scared after the sep 8/9 incidents, fearing that his good life could get stripped away from him. He's someone with a lot to lose. His family and relatives probably held him back. Tespachi he probably came back to the front ali pachi with some kind of a plan. Aile chai I just think he's trying to do what he thinks and knows is right - play by the political system's rules. And since we all have severe trauma related to anything 'political party' related, we hate to see it.  Sudan is the opposite of miraj - he's been in the field, has scolded corrupt officials to their face since 2015, has had literal dirt and blood on him. But he's not an eloquent speaker like miraj, he's got 'a look' but the kind of person he has become, branding himself online is not sth he cares about. Whatever he is, is his brand.  In any case, we gotta be careful and discerning and support where needed and criticize where appropriate. Let's get it 💪|||.|||Clips ki video xaina yo post KO?|||Sabai opportunistic cha kasai lai wastai chaina euta main leader nai chaina euta ley aafno party kholya cha arko yo vaye na tyo vayeh na arko paila ko party haru ley movement start garya cha genz yeta euta kei garna sakya chaina.|||movement was leaderless but quite not. but even then the aftermath can't go on like that leaderless, shapeless, formless, faceless. why don't u go take his job?|||He doesn’t know How politics works.|||so its oli/prachande/deuba jhole vs sudan jhole vs durga jhole vs miraj jhole vs ck raut jhole now   hahahahaha  mathi ko main madaari hasi ra hola goti haru ko activity dekhera|||k ho reason chai hate garnu ko? k kura garyo genZ movement represent nagarne?|||Kaam garne kaalu|||No doubt young generation is powerful and should be in politics too.

Intentions sahi hola but yinarle anarchy matra badauxan.|||Not a Zenzee and while I appreciate the revolution and all, they have slowly becoming Oli gang. What it demonstrates is the blood we have - thirsty for oneself, power, money, opportunity. I am particularly upset with Sudan Gurung who is hell bent at removing Home Minister and this guy called Miraj Dhungana. I will dismiss Miraj right off the bat because I don't see anything in his eyes and his face. He is a selfish person and anyone who is following him and all should think many times. Sudan Gurung - the guy is hell bent on removing home minister on such a stupid demand that he wants to arrest Oli and Lekhak. What the hell guys ? are you looking for rawanraj? we have laws and we want to enforce it fairly and strictly. Om Prakash is a lawyer and he is not trying to protect Oli or Lekhak - anyone thinks that is such a stupid Zenzee. Do you guys want to arrest someone just on a whim? without gathering sufficient proof? In western countries law enforcement officials spend years if not decades monitoring and gathering evidences against someone they think is culprit - they just don't  arrest someone and investigate - that wouldn't be rule of law. Om Prakash has that schooling. I don't care who Om Prakash is and all but he is definitely a capable guy and has proved it time and again - after all, he is chosen by PM.  Now, are you guys looking to change ministers and government leadership when we only have 4 months to go ? Its such a shame when every so called Zenzee goes to Singhadarbar and disturbs our government's actions. Just think if all the time they spend is meeting you guys.     Now listen to what Mahabir Pun said - please go to your constituencies and help new  political parties that align to your views win - why are you spending so much energies trying to meet the PM ? The Miraj Dhungana is such a scam guy - He is driven by his own ambition, I feel. I did like Sudan but he is also active childish and not a thing in near future.  Whatever everyone says and does listen and watch what Rachha Bam says and does. She is the one who walked out with Army Chief when he seemed to infer democracy was in danger. She is acting with passion and patience. I would recommend everyone to support behind Raswapa, Sagar Dhakal, Baburam, Kulman,  Sumana Shrestha. Sumana is the real deal.     Now if you believe in democracy and free and fair election, support Rabi. How can a person so beloved by people can be in jail without having an opportunity to go to people? is democracy is for the people and by the people?     I recommend please read. Watch what Swarmin Wagle said few days that Deuba was Zenzee, Oli was Zenzee and every popular leader was zenzee when they started politics. There has been tremendous progress but it was not enough. Just because you feel young and under 25 doesn't mean its your government and can do anything. Nope - no way until we have rule of law.     Now this government gotta focus on election and it has to happen. When I hear Miraj and Sudan that say it can't happen in current condition are not only naïve but foolish. They gotta go read what democracy is. Nothing happens without people's mandate which is vote.     And don't forget its not you guys who brought this change - it was a coincidence.  Someone else did on 24th so you really shouldn't overwhelmingly take any credit, especially Miraj who didn't even take part in the protest ! Hope it helps.|||Ani aaja bholi singa durbar bhitra baseka haru protocol follow garera aako hun ta ??|||miraj and party >>>>> yemale and other similar parties|||Yea the protest was headless/leaderless but we need people to lead you can't complain he gained from this protest of course he did and we want a capable leader to run office not military the argument that he was not in the protest is stupid this is exactly why we failed as national because we put fighters as leaders they can be leaders while fighting but in office we need people who lead office not mobs and arms   Not taking his side but this was a common argument against him and I disagree so this ... Btw I don't know why they want directly elected pm within 6 months like bring 2/3 majority and do what you want their ego will delay the election effectively pushing the country years backwards focus on NOTA and NRN voting rights and different policy and development plan for future|||All this shit is happening coz there was no leader during gen z protests. They did not achieve anything despite such massive movement except toppling Government.   Miraj Dhungana came into realization. An organised group is must to move forward. The most important thing a leader should have is a clean image and clear vision. The maturity he has shown not being political figure is admirable.   One of the good thing coming out of Gen Z movement is the youth having interest on politics and stepping forward to be incharge.  We should not discourage them, in the same time help them by giving healthy and constructive criticisms.|||आज उनीहरूले गरेको माग केपी र लेखक लाई सजाए को दायरा मा ल्याउनुपर्छ भन्ने विषयमा थियो। सायद त्यो माग राख्नु गलत भयो होला है।|||Yo sub pani flip bhaira hunxa harek bela.

The number of calls those nggas made during 2 whole weeks, fk. We kept on declining and blocking their numbers but everytime it was a new number lmao.

And when you say indo gangetic plain , it includes bangladesh and parts of pakistan too. Its a regional problem. And being north of these countries, well , you get plenty of emissions carried by the wind which dissipates in our mountain ranges.   So i think instead we need regional cooperation for air pollution management.

            "body": "Hello! Myself (20M), along with two of my friends and our families, visited Nepal during the Diwali holidays. We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8. Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)

            "comments": "First of all, commendations for such well written and structured post, that too with all the additional info at the end. (For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".  During off season, it's easily manageable & fun because less people & no need to queue to get a selfie with some peculiar rock or a waterfall, butttttt, it's called off season for a reason, the majestic views might be compromised or not, it's a gamble.|||Dhulikhel rock view point, man why would they take you there! 🤦  Are you speaking 'Bangla'?|||Bhaktapur is the jewel 🙏|||kudos to camera work- given the health condition of your mum- i recommend you sepnd more time in chitwan- janakpur and lumbini-- may be 3 days each city- it covers pilgrimage and cultural aspect-|||Others have already suggested you some places to visit, so I just want to give you one important piece of advice. I have a relative who works as a travel agent, and he told me that many agents and shopkeepers tend to focus more on foreign tourists than on Indians, because they believe they can overcharge them easily. So, bro, be careful  there are many thugs and dishonest agents who might try to charge you extra. **Bargaining is the key.**  In almost every corner, if a hotel recommends you a place or a service, remember that the hotel usually gets a commission from it. The entire system in tourist areas like Thamel often runs on commission-based deals. So it’s always better to ask genuine locals for suggestions rather than agents pretending to be locals. In Thamel, you’ll find many such people who act friendly but are just trying to make money off tourists.  If you have Nepali friends, you can travel cheaply and safely otherwise, just be a bit cautious and smart while dealing with people. To be honest, a few uneducated people here may dislike Indian tourists, and that’s an unfortunate reality. But overall, we Nepalese are known to be **very hospitable, kind, and friendly**, and most people will treat you with respect and warmth. Just stay alert, bargain wisely, and you’ll have a wonderful time in Nepal.|||Bro, timi Darjeeling bata vayae taa, yo sabai Normal hola ni taa timro laagi taa?? 🤔|||where did u take that video bro? was it in pokhara?|||You skipped Bandipur en route Pokhara from Kathmandu.

Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||Have a great time here, enjoy it and after you go back to your home just think is it fair to take land of the country who provided you with such great hospitality?|||[deleted]",

Awareness 2. Bans, stronger rules 3. Traffic police checks  What has worked and what will work is pricing. Get rid of rules that promote cartelling and let capitalism solve the issue.   If you had the choice to pay 20 rupees more but travel with slightly more comfort, and with a nice seat, maybe 30-40% of people would be willing to pay, which in result means more businesses willing to invest in public transport as they seek profit, more competition, better services. Those who offer neither good service nor good pricing then deserve go out of business.  This weird government backed cartelling with fixed artifical prices will never work.|||We should implement a metro-style system for local transport in Kathmandu. Currently many buses operate within the ring road but cannot travel beyond it due to narrow and congested lanes. Even when they do it only results in traffic jams.  What if we introduced autos in the valley that follow the same routes as local transport and carry 3–4 passengers per ride? Buses and vans could be restricted to the ring road and every bus stop along the ring road could have designated autos and rickshaws to drop passengers to their destinations at the same fare.  If implemented all the microbuses and hiaces could be replaced with standard buses which would likely cause less congestion than the current smaller vehicles.|||The metropolitan and the yatayat syndicate are the problems. There should be a limit on the number of passengers each vehicle can carry. For large buses, it should not be more than 110% of the number of seats. And for microbuses, it should not be more than 100% of the seating capacity. The limit rule should be enforced by the traffic police.   It's a systemic problem and requires a systemic solution.|||Nepal yatayat ma gundruk khade vanda namajale khadiyeko yaad ayo|||nonchalant khalasi dai|||Ajhai 3 Jana atne thau cha.|||Khalasi be like pachadi sarnus na tetro khali cha|||aghii pakhai ho ni..khalashi haru huncha micro ra yatayaat ko bhadaa karcha.

The land already belongs to a government body, in this case, TU, it made things easy.  But elsewhere in larger projects, main reason this is difficult is because of people. For example, the nagdhunga project was stalled for 6 months because of local demands of alternative water supply, compensation money, jobs for the locals, etc. Without this, it would have already been completed last year.  Now, significant amount of taxpayer money in infrastructure projects are spent in land acquisition. The only way for Nepal to develop fast is i. stop people needlessly stopping projects and either ii. significant land reform, or complete land price collapse and people to stop seeing land as investment.|||This was a dream for cricket fan like me!!

I'm no expert but I  do come with a few facts . The actual knowledge I feel like I know it better than anyone here. Not bragging .  So take it as a means of education. I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it.

            "heading": "A Night in Kathmandu — The Unexpected Bar Scam Experience",
            "body": "After completing our last destination in Kathmandu, our Nepal trip was almost coming to an end. We had planned to spend the evening shopping around local markets before heading back home.  But as luck would have it, the weather had other plans. It started raining heavily, and most of us decided to cancel the shopping plan and stay inside the bus, waiting for the rain to stop.  While we were sitting there, a Nepali guy — sort of an agent — climbed onto the bus. He started chatting with my friend, talking about dance bars, attractive girls, and fun nightlife in Kathmandu. My friends, curious and excited to explore something different, agreed to check it out. So, we went along with him from Gaushala Chowk.  ⸻  The Arrival  We reached around 7 PM. The place looked more like a small pub or lounge — dim lights, loud music, and barely anyone inside. There were just two Indian guys with a few Nepali girls, sitting at a corner table, smoking hukka and drinking.  We were a group of 12 people, so we took two tables (6 on each). I sat on the other table, while two Nepali girls from the bar joined my friends’ table. They were friendly, laughing, and talking in Hindi — chit chat, masti, jokes — sab Hindi mein.  After a few minutes, the girls said they wanted to have a drink. The same agent who brought us there told my friend, “Sir, bas 400 Rs ka juice hai.” They wrote the order on a small paper chit, took my friend’s signature, and soon two juices were served.  That’s how their system worked — write on paper, take a sign, and serve the order.  We also ordered 4 beers for ourselves. Out of 12, only 4 were drinking — the rest were just watching the dance show.  ⸻  The Show Begins  Soon, Nepali girls started dancing on Hindi songs, followed by a couple of male dancers and another girl joining the floor. The vibe felt okay at first — typical dance bar scene, music, lights, drinks.  But after the girls finished their drinks, a waiter brought a hukka pot to our table without even asking. We immediately told him to take it away. The girls got off from our table soon after that.  ⸻  Something Felt Off  After finishing the beer, me and my friend went to the washroom. There we saw those same two Indian guys who were sitting earlier — looked like North Indians (maybe Delhi or Haryana). They seemed tense, arguing with the bar staff.  Out of curiosity, I asked one of them, “Bhai kya hua?” He said, “Dekho na bhai, kuch khaya nahi, thoda piya sirf — aur bill 32,000 Nepali bana diya!”  That one line was enough to send chills down my spine.  I quickly went back to my table and told my friend what had happened. We immediately asked for our bill — but the damage was already done.  ⸻  The Shocking Bill  The bill came in Nepali currency: \t•\t4 Beers = 4000 \t•\t2 Drinks for girls = 8000 \t•\t23% Service charge = 2760 Total = 14,760 NRS (≈ 9,840 INR)  My friend was shocked. He said, “Ladies drink price to 400 bola tha,” but by then, the agent who brought us there had vanished.  There was no point arguing — the staff was large in number, and the situation didn’t look safe. Finally, we settled the bill for 9,500 INR and left the place quietly.  ⸻  What Happened Next  As we were leaving, I noticed those two Indian guys being locked in a small office, surrounded by bar staff demanding they hand over their mobiles or belongings to pay off the bill.  I felt genuinely bad for them — and guilty for not sitting at my friend’s table earlier, or checking the price list before signing that paper chit.  But at the same time, I was thankful that we escaped early — with just a 4-beer loss instead of a full-blown scam.  ⸻  The Reality Behind the Glamour  While we were stepping out, a few more Nepali guys entered, and immediately all the bar girls — including those who had been at our table — went to join them, smoking hukka and ordering drinks.  Just watching that, I could only think: “Isko to aaj 40,000–50,000 ka chuna lagne wala hai.”  ⸻  Final Thoughts  Our Nepal trip overall was beautiful — from Pokhara’s serenity to the spiritual vibe of Pashupatinath. But this one Kathmandu nightlife experience was a reminder that not everything that glitters is gold.  If you ever plan to explore nightlife in Kathmandu, be cautious: \t•\tNever sign anything you don’t understand. \t•\tAlways ask for the price upfront. \t•\tAnd if something feels shady — walk away.  This experience became a story to remember — not for the fun, but for the lesson it taught us.",

We cooked together, washed the dishes, gossiped a lot, and I came home with a full heart.  Then at the dinner table, my parents asked what caste she is. I told them… and they immediately started talking about caste differences and how I shouldn’t visit her house for meals, and how she shouldn’t come to ours. Hearing them talk about her caste that way absolutely broke my heart. I couldn’t control my tears, and my mom said, “kina yesto chitta dukhako. Pitri farak farak hunxa, manxe yeutai matra vayerw hunna. Hamlai ni aaru le yesto garxan, hamle ni garnu parxa. Paxi tha pauxau, etc etc.”  We never had serious caste conversations before. In fact, I remember them teaching us that these things shouldn’t exist, that we’re all equal. And they’ve never shown this kind of behavior toward others who visit our home or toward our tenants who are the same caste as my friend? I'm confused and upset with this interaction with my parents.",

Our parents grew up in a time where extreme casteism was normal. They didn’t create it, but they were raised inside that system, taught to follow it, and warned about the consequences of not doing so. Education shapes the mind, and the education they received reinforced these beliefs regardless of religion, culture, or society. So they’re not entirely wrong, and we’re not entirely right either.  The real problem is that we often fail to understand the environment they grew up in and the fears they carried. Instead of trying to see their side, we sometimes blame them or play the victim because it’s the easier option. But change takes understanding from both generations—not just criticism. 🙏|||This will just go with this generation or maybe next or next but you just forget what they said and forget about the cast system as well and just focus on people's behavior and if nobody talks about it next generation is not even going to know such a thing and it will just go away. But if we keep saying we're all equal frequently children are going to think they are saying this because  we're all not equal. Indirectly they'll learn that cast is a big deal. that's my point of view. And forget my English as well ☺|||This is really heartbreaking. It’s painful when people who taught us about equality show a different side. Caste ideas came through shared history and influence from India, but we don’t have to carry them forward. Gen Z has a real chance to change this for our friendships, love, and human connection matter more than labels. What you shared with your friend is so real and nothing can take that away.|||Reasons like this is why I have decided to stop living in this country at all, caste difference bhanxan,  ximeki le naramro najar le herxan bhanxan, I'm tired of this.|||Depends on society, hami baun bhayeni, hamro gau ko aguwa haru chai singh (bishwokarma) ho, so they frequently come to our home khana khana, hamro aunty ko shraddhama pani aru lower cast ko manche haru bolayera involve garunu bhayeko thiyo.

His work is visible, but he is corrupt.  Balen is the only person whom I can say with confidence is not corrupt, yet. But he is no politician, and I don't think he will ever be. It is also very hard for him to open party with individual who is not involved in any scandal, and keep his non-corrupt image intact.  Rabi has his own problems. However, he is the only person at the moment who is a politician, and not involved with old goons. Only his party could have defeated the old goons, but since he is in jail, RSP will not get majority seats this time.  So, the new alternative forces combined will still not have majority in present scenario. Only way the alternative forces can have majority is if Balen and Kulman would have join RSP with Rabi still as head of RSP. But this scenario was simply not possible from start. Balen cannot associate himself with people with scandals, and Kulman is not really an alternative force, but rather the produce of the old goons who is not as bad as the old goons.|||Chup machikney tyo purano vanda yei thiq , reddit ma aayera na vuk|||One thing I will suggest if new party is contesting In some constituency just don't contest in that area. The same tactic Congress did with maobadi during election. After winning form an alliance which is the best thing to do. For that rpp rsp and new parties should agree on this.

After plugging in the charger, the laptop didn’t respond at all for hours.  Assuming the charger was faulty, I took it to the Mudita service center. Later, they informed me that the **motherboard was damaged (“shot”)** and needed to be replaced, costing **about 60% of the laptop’s original price**. To make things worse, the laptop had just exceeded its 12 month warranty by around one month, so they refused to cover the repair under warranty.  It feels extremely strange and concerning that a motherboard or CPU would get damaged simply while charging normally. If there had been a high-voltage surge, then **all devices connected at the same time should have been affected**, including my colleagues’ laptops and chargers — but none of them faced any issue.  For a device to fail like this right after warranty expiry raises doubts about **product durability and quality assurance**. Very disappointed with this experience.",

After that, you might consider upgrading the RAM. However, some older laptops have limits on how much RAM they support. For example, my old Sony Vaio can handle up to 8GB, while an older Dell model only supports a maximum of 4GB. You can easily check online by searching your laptop model to find out if it supports SSD upgrades and the maximum RAM capacity.  Also note that in Nepal the shop are asking upward of 2-3,000 NPR for each 4gb RAM module, claiming a 6-month warranty.

            "body": "As an Computer Engineering/IT graduate in Nepal, there are various pathways.  Option A) You stay in Nepal  Option B) You move abroad   Let's discuss about Option A first.  There are two realistic pathways you could take if you stayed in Nepal.  - work at private  - work at government   I have tried working at private. But the amount of discrimination being done in private companies really blew me up. As someone who was also preparing for government jobs, I had noticed lots of underprivileged folks participating in government jobs exam(for computer engineer as well). I used to ponder what made them do this since this is not a very lucrative job compared to what a \"certain community\" person makes at private or \"certain community\" person grows at private job. But later realized that private companies are not interested to hire these \"underprivileged\" folks.   Lots of people might argue (although they know it is not true) private jobs hire on merit. No they do not do so in Nepal. It is completely based off connections. It does not matter your knowledge. It is about who you know 100%. I am not ignorant that this might be the case outside, but I swear to god everyday, esto garera USA ma jasto innovative companies cha tyo ta pakkai hudainthyo..   The reason for such favoritism is mainly because the work they do is so shit. Leaving few companies who developer softwares that Nepalese use on daily basis(Not ludo), other jobs are not very interesting to do either. It is the same low quality menial job with meagre pay.   The companies who have a business are handful already. Investor ko money burn garne jasto nepal ma kei hudaina as there are no investors. So you see these bitchy ass companies hiring full stack developer every day for the salary of an intern.     I could not really be bothered with working under someone and taking all nonsense blames for 30,000 per month on hand. With no future and no growth and dismissing my self esteem. My aviman is and was huge.   The second pathway is to work at government corporations. I looked at the salary of computer engineer at Nepal Army, Nijamati and it is decent. But the upwards mobility is just not there. What I mean by that is salary is not growing when you grow your experience. Aba ta government employee specially nijamati lai dekhne bittikai yo bhrastachari raicha bhanne lagcha. Kinaki bhrastachar nagari ta khana basnai napugne. Pradhan Sena Pati ko talab cha 67000. Social security benefits cha good and all but cash in hand ni aileko market rate anusar ta dinu paryo ni. 67000 ma kam garne pradhansenapati le ghus nakhaye k garera palne? lol.  I looked at corporations salary. And it seems that if you manage to get a handle at a corporation(Sansthans), you can make be sure to make average of 60-70 thousands per month even as a 6th level officer. At this point of my career, this seems fair enough. But it will not be enough after 5 years, if my increment is just 1 thousand per year.    A huge reform is required in government services. Government services (specially nijamati) are the core to how people feel about the government. If we cannot make it attractive and lucrative, it does not matter how rich we are saving on their salary.  Next option is moving abroad.  Aba ko market ma abroad ma PR paune/GC paune biswas ta chaina. Unless you do the jobs that Americans do not want to do (or foreigners) like teaching for 60k/year, nursing old people etc.  15 years bidesh ma basna jane. Kam garne and coming back to Nepal. It seems the most plausible way forward. Nepal ma ayepachi k garne bhanne hunasakcha however.  The countries in option to stay for so long are Japan, India. Do not want to surrender my passport to Dubai sheikh. Also middle east is terror and war prone so do not want to end up there.   Europe tira padna gaye matra ho. It seems bleak for immigrants nowadays. And I do not think they earn that much in Europe (for someone planning to return back to Nepal and not stay there). Teta nabasne bhayepachi social security ko teti matlab bhayena.   How about USA? USA seems fine and all. but I do not think getting a work permit after Masters degree is going to be easy. Or that you are going to make big bucks and save big bucks as an immigrant in this economy. Since PR/GC is not guaranteed, you are basically playing a zero sum game. The experience that you get in abroad and education bla bla is huge investment however.",

            "body": "Hi everyone👋 I’m 23, living in Nepal, only a high-school degree, and I’m broke (only have 100 dollars in savings rn). I want to build a real career in IT so I can eventually work remotely or move abroad. I want something realistic that I can learn in about a year and turn into a stable, good-paying job.  Honestly, I’m not interested in freelancing or full-stack because (personally) it feels oversaturated and too creative (for each project) and portfolio-heavy, but I’m still open if I’m wrong. I don’t wanna sound picky, and desperate, like “I only want X, not Y.” Please don't get me wrong. I'm willing to learn and work. I’m flexible - I just want something that's worth my time and effort.  I’m looking for an IT path that:  • isn’t super saturated   • is easier for beginners   • hires freshers from Nepal (South Asia)   • has a stable monthly salary (4 digits)   • has a clear roadmap   • doesn’t require a uni degree   • reliable - won’t be replaced by AI soon   • can help me find jobs abroad  If you were in my shoes - 23, broke, no degree, living in Nepal, trying to break into tech in 2025/2026 - what would you realistically choose?  I’m open to anything: front-end, app dev, full stack, IT support, cloud, DevOps, QA, cybersecurity, networking, data, MySQL - anything that actually works for someone starting with almost nothing. Coz, I don't wanna end up being homeless. Seriously, I am so sick of my current lifestyle, I wanna make a change and take some right action that will lead me to my goal. I literally don't care if it's hard or impossible, coz now it's a necessity.. I am ready to sacrifice my time. I wanna invest in myself (my skills).  So, please, I need your help to choose the right direction.  I’d really appreciate any honest suggestions, roadmaps, or personal stories from people who started in a similar place.  Thanks a lot.",

QA is the easiest and fastest way to get a job because it’s not too saturated, Nepal hires many freshers, and you don’t need a portfolio or degree. IT support is the most stable long-term option because it’s beginner friendly, companies always need support staff, and it naturally leads to higher-paying roles like SysAdmin or Cloud Engineer. Cybersecurity is the most future-proof, global, and high-demand field, but it requires more effort in the first few months.  Things like frontend, full-stack, and freelancing are not the best starting point when you’re broke and need stability fast; they take longer and require portfolios or creativity. A simple one-year plan would look like this: for QA, learn manual testing first, then SQL/API testing, and later basic automation. For IT support, learn computer basics, networking, and ticketing tools, then move towards cloud platforms. For cybersecurity, start with networking and Linux, then learn security basics and practice SOC labs.  If you want something fast, choose QA. If you want something stable and practical, go for IT support. If you want long-term growth and international opportunities, choose cybersecurity. Any of these three can realistically change your life within a year if you stay focused|||You’re only 23, so you have time on your side. While I understand you want quick results, consider exploring online degree programs. Many are flexible and work-friendly. A degree can make a huge difference when applying for jobs abroad and competing for better positions - it might be worth the investment alongside building your skills. 🙂🙂|||If I were you, I’d start with IT support → networking → cloud. It’s cheap to learn, beginner-friendly, hires freshers in South Asia, and leads to real stable jobs. Once you get basic support skills, aim for CCNA, then AWS. It’s the most realistic path to a solid career without a degree.|||look for QA, devrel, dev advocate, project manager, sre/devops etc. what's the tech skill that u already know? |||Garo nai cha aile ko situation ma ta.

How lonely was it, if at all? * Did your journey turn out the way you had imagined? Or did things change once you arrived? * Are you still working in IT now?

Did you find your way back eventually? * Looking back, was the move worth it for you — personally, professionally, and financially? * What would you genuinely tell someone in Nepal who is earning decently in IT and is thinking of coming to Australia as a student? Should they do it? Should they wait? Should they stay? And what should they prepare for? * How did this move impact your mental health? Did you feel lost, homesick, or confused about your career at any point? * What was the biggest shock you faced after coming here?

            "body": "Hello everyone,  I never thought I’d be writing this again. I wish our situation had gotten better since my last post… but reality has been harsher than I ever imagined.  My father is battling Stage 3 Gall Bladder Cancer, and his treatment at RGCI, Delhi is ongoing. We somehow managed to complete 5 chemo cycles , by selling whatever little we had, taking loans, borrowing from friends and relatives, and emptying every bit of savings. But now, we are completely drained .. emotionally, mentally, and financially.  The doctors say the next few chemo cycles are critical . If we stop now, everything we’ve fought for so far might go in vain. But the treatment cost has now gone beyond ₹20 lakhs, and we have nothing left to continue.  My father is a simple, hardworking man a small farmer and shopkeeper from a middle-class family. He spent his entire life making sure we never felt our struggles,have some good education. Only now do I truly see how much he silently sacrificed for us. I’m still in college, trying to study, trying to stay strong, but watching him in pain and feeling helpless is tearing me apart. i feel cancer is the worst thing you can ever deal with .  I’ve seen my mother cry silently in the corner every night, and my sisters trying to smile despite knowing how close we are to losing everything. I keep telling them we’ll make it that I’ll find a way but right now, I don’t know how much longer we can hold on without help.  In my last post, so many kind souls came forward. I’m truly, deeply grateful — we managed to raise about ₹1.5 lakh, which helped us cover chemotherapy and hospital bills. Every rupee meant the world to us. 🙏  But the journey is far from over. We still need around ₹20 lakhs more to continue his treatment and give him a real chance at life.  If you’re reading this please, help us if you can. Even a small amount, even a share, even a prayer it all counts.   I’m not asking for sympathy; I’m asking for humanity.

Good thing was that there were other staff member who knew the rule and helped us out.

The problem ia that these people aren’t deceplined for their actions and continue to melign the name of their own country.|||As an Indian, I'm very sorry that Nepalis have to go through this in India. I have great respect for Nepal and its culture. If it were upto me, I'd support strengthening ties between India and Nepal.|||I am really sorry to hear that but the way they treat first-time visitors from Nepal in India is even more disgusting than how they treat frequent visitors. Even those who visit India often are treated as if we’re some kind of threat to the country. Sometimes, I feel it’s because of our weak passport and the way they perceive our country. I’ve heard many disrespectful remarks directed at fellow Nepali travelers, even for the smallest mistakes like something as simple as pressing a thumb incorrectly.|||Mad because they were colonised and we didn't|||Man this is infuriating.

Every time, he was singled out, even though he traveled two to three times a year. They would ask about his visa, his job on the cruise, and why he was carrying money, if any. It seemed like they had never seen a Nepalese carrying dollars for travel expenses. After working on cruises for nearly 35 years and traveling extensively across the USA and Europe, he only faced this treatment at Indian airports. As a result, he now completely avoids traveling to or through India.|||Bangladesh airports are worse and their service is shit, but the it is still better.|||Very unfortunate and sorry this happened to you, traveling through India is definitely a terrible experience and I myself have experienced the worst experience of traveling through India for a NRN but just to play devils advocate, Indian government is probably trying to stop any underground routes to US and lot of people travel through South America to US, either way they should be clear on communicating to you why they stopped you and what their process are because they can’t stop someone without proper documentation of why they are stopping someone at the airport.|||Doesn't matter the whole world hates India. I live in Aus and these days the hate sentiments against Indian is too much. Sometimes even I feel bad for them. |||I heard this from my relative; they went to India. It wasn't first time. They knew a hotel used to stay there because it was known. But few weeks ago when they went there, they were told that government has said don't allow any Nepali to stay at any government hotel or lodge! Maybe the reason is recent protest and many criminals were out of jail. But The hotel manager knew that they weren't bad people, but didn't allow them.

Bahrut stup - 2300 years old.   Buddha's story is  sculpted in this Stup. Mahamaya (Buddha's mother) is seen protected by Elephant. Another art shows her dreaming an elephant. There is also a story where buddha tamed Mad Elephant. So elephant holds importance in buddhism. You can google it.   As the time fly, scholars began their own narration and interpretation.  Mahavairocana tantra -7th/8th century. One of the foundational texts of esoteric buddhism. Here Ganesha appears as Vinayaka, often portrayed as an obstacle creating diety sub dued by the buddha's mantra. Yet once pacified. He becomes a protector.  Kanguyar - the tibetan buddhism canon, preserves several tantric texts where Ganapati is invoked. Toh 666, Toh 665 heart of mantra appears here.  Sadhanmala -a vast collection of tantric sadhanas compiled between 10th to 11th centuries include detailed rituals of Maha rakta Ganapati and other ganesha forms. These practice invoke Ganesha as a wealth bestowing and obstacle clearing diety.  In buddhism, the ganapati hridaya sutra also known as the arya maha ganapati hridaya dharani, is a sacred mantra given by shakyamuni buddha to his desciple Ananda.  Mostly Ganesha is seen in Tibetan and Vajryan with more than 4 hands.  All the buddhist countries as Japan, Thailand , indonesia (former), China see elephant head diety as buddhist god.  Ganesha images in China occur between 6th to 7th century.  Lets see where Ganesha appears in Brahmin religion (hindu).  Rigveda - 1464AD is the oldest surviving manuscripts (30 pages or folios of birch bark) submitted by Indian Governmet to UNESCO.  Ganesha does not appear in it.  And in later rigveda version also, Ganesha vagueley appears. In short, hindu Ganesha does not exist.  They may claim Veda is million years old, but we must stick with history not theories.  Ganesha Purana - 13 to 17 th century. It explains the story of Ganesha.  However , it seems the ganesha cult started form 9th/11th century.|||“Kaaaaa yesto Kura gareko hera,   Yo tah hamro Saan ani dharma ho ni ,  Hami ajhai every tourist destination ma religious sites banau parcha ,  Nepal and its natural beauty jawos Kholai khola .tyo ek dui Jana tourist naayera k huncha Hami Lai.”|||Desh tikekai India ra Indian tourists le ho ta saathi.

Most of the tourists that these places receive are mostly internal tourist, which is Nepalese, and majority of Indians, and buddhist. These places aren't attracting any secular tourists as such, plus just because they suddenly declared Nepal is a secular country, doesn't erase it's civilizational history, any western tourist when he thinks of Nepal, the things that comes in his mind are mountains, buddha, temples, monastries and stuffs, that's what they expect.  So, when there is already enough reason, Temples are automatically going to be built.  Plus, we have more and enough evidences that after building temples or statues in such places, the tourism has actually gone up.  So, it makes no sense why you are mad here.  Regarding the shoes, except the main area of Temple, it's wrong to just dictate to open shoes, that's something we all can raise voice.  Regarding Bhajan, that's definitely wrong, no one can just blast any Bhajan in such open place whenever they like it. And, this issue is also solvable.  It's sad that just because of these two issue of shoes and Bhajan, you went on to attack the existence of Mandir and statues themselves without actually understanding the overall context.|||I was there this summer, they never said to take off my shoes and there wasn't any bhajan and stuff.|||What’s the meaning behind this is Pokhara not Janakpur?|||keta keti haru jun thau pani romanticize garne lul.

Chorra chorri lai instagram delete garna chai layo dhanna teti chai buddhi raicha.  >The corrupt ruling elites of the Third World, who used to steal everything, destroy economies, and create hell for their own populations, have now added one more thing: they openly allow their children to flaunt the spoils of corruption on Instagram, right in front of their starving people. Something previous generations never witnessed.  >The new rich have never gone through a revolution so they don't understand not to flaunt their wealth like the old bourgeoisie who have witnessed multiple revolutions throughout history. It's ironic that the Maoists instigated a revolution yet the children of said Maoists are now living the luxurious lives posting everything not knowing whats simmering in society. It looks like at least the kids have understood not to flaunt their stolen wealth to avoid angering the masses.  >In any ways what happened in Nepal highlights a trend I’ve discussed on here before, which is how Instagram utterly radicalizes youth heavy developing societies.  >Suddenly you as a poor but striving young man or woman have full visibility to how the elite/upper class of your country + diaspora live, but you have little access or hope of ever living the same for the most part. The impact of this on mental health, societal stability, and also fertility rates cannot be underestimated.  >Imagine going from a society with five state channels and a few cable options in the 2000s to Instagram in just five years. That’s what happened to all of South Asia + Africa + a lot of Latin America.  These guys were being exposed to the lifestyles of the baddie daughters and Chad sons of the fucktards ruling their country,  >You see their trip to Japan and London for the summer. See their parties at their elite mansions in the most posh suburbs and neighborhoods and you realize you’re just fucked and not getting there ever, your country simply does not have the mechanism to enable that for you, you’re unemployed even despite a college degree.  >**Upward mobility is like a pressure valve. Nepal never had that. The elites taxed people, slapped tariffs on imports & ignored building institutions that foster upward mobility. Instead, they assumed that sending their populace to the Middle East would be sufficient.**  >What’s surprising is how the corrupt politicians allow their kids to flaunt stolen wealth so brazenly. Kids of politicians in developing countries flaunting their extravagant lifestyles on public Instagram accounts is so foolhardy. Exposure to social media and bragging about your luxurious lifestyle risks fuelling resentment and envy.  >It's how uprisings have always been. Old bourgeoisie don't show off their wealth like those Nepali elites did. This behavior is what got both the iranian and russian noble families killed. This also happened in Mongolia earlier this year, although less dramatically. The Prime Minister had to step down due to protests that kicked off because his son was showing off his luxury holidays and clothes too much on Instagram.",

Trendy: they're brainwashed, selfish, came for masubhat  Reality: UML has strong foundation and institutions in every sectors, from education to workers, farmers, employees, businesses.   These organizations/institutions although have bad reputations, have done some apprecianle deeds too. From volunteering, blood donations, scholarship schemes etc. For eg. UML's student union was the first one to reach to Kalapani and put Nepal's flag on the land.   What we're doing is just bashing them on the internet with mostly baseless accusations. (Mostly, not all). That's not how you defeat an established and strong organization.

I wanted to take a moment to share something from the heart, especially for the Gen Z community here. I’m not here to lecture, judge, or pretend that I “know better.” In fact, it’s the opposite—I’m here because I genuinely admire a lot about Gen Z, and I’d love to learn from you if you’re open to talking or sharing your perspectives.  What I really respect about your generation is the honesty. The courage to say things out loud that older generations kept buried. The way you call out what doesn’t feel right, whether it’s in society, culture, work, or even in yourselves. The world is changing fast, and you all seem to face it with a unique blend of humor, vulnerability, and resilience. And honestly, that’s inspiring.  I’m not perfect, and I don’t pretend to fully understand everything about today’s trends, language, mindset, or struggles. But I’m here with an open mind. If any Gen Z member is willing to talk—to enlighten me, challenge me, laugh with me, or even correct me—I’d sincerely appreciate it.  I’m reaching out with respect and humility. I’m here to listen, not impose. Thank you to anyone who takes a moment to respond. 🙏🏽|||yesto sanskar vaka le kasto desh banauxan hola?

I’m truly grateful. Recently during an interview, I shared my personal political standpoint. I mentioned that I do not personally recognize K.P. Oli as a leader whose ideology I align with. I say this not out of disrespect, but from a place of accountability and responsibility toward our nation. After the recent Gen Z protests, I believe many of us expected honest conversations, acknowledgment of public concerns, and accountability for the injustices that occurred under his administration where many lives were lost. When leadership is unable to take responsibility for such serious matters, it becomes difficult for me to support or follow their ideology. My intention is not to attack individuals, but to stand for truth, transparency, and a future where leaders are answerable to the people. I believe Nepal deserves leadership that listens, learns, and upholds justice for every citizen. Thank you once again to everyone who resonated with my thoughts. Let’s continue pushing for a better and more responsible political culture together.|||So many Incel chicks in comment, are we even safe?|||Nepal is literally full of chutiyas like these, logic fact kei chaina 😂 .

            "body": "I swear, the more I watch Miraj Dhungana’s actions after the Gen-Z protests, the more pissed off I get. This guy went from saying “I’m not the leader, this is a collective movement” to suddenly announcing a whole political party under the Garikhana Deu banner like it’s some kind of personal promotion. Do you even realize how ridiculous that looks? We were told this movement was leaderless, built on the frustration of an entire generation, and now the SAME person who said he wasn’t leading anything is stepping into politics like he’s been preparing the whole time. It feels like the movement’s energy was used as a ladder.  And don’t even get me started on the way he handled the October 9 protest confusion. When young people were panicking, waiting for clarity, ready to go to the streets again because the country is literally suffocating under corruption, what does he do? He steps back. He shrugs it off and says Gen-Z wasn’t involved. Bro, if you’re going to speak for the movement when it’s convenient, then show up when shit gets chaotic too. That’s literally what leadership is. Instead, he pops up when the cameras are rolling and disappears the moment things get risky. That kind of pick-and-choose activism makes me angry because that’s exactly the political behavior we protested against.  Then there’s the whole “our office was attacked” episode. He went public with it, made it sound serious, and then the police said there was no official complaint, and everything was calm when they arrived. What are we supposed to believe? Either be transparent or don’t dramatize it. People actually suffered during these protests. People bled. People DIED. And watching someone drag the movement into half-explained drama with zero clarity is honestly insulting.  What makes me the most furious is how he keeps talking like he represents the entire generation, giving big speeches about unity, direct elections, overseas voting, and political reform, while his actions keep zig-zagging all over the place. You don’t get to call yourself the voice of Gen-Z while making moves that look inconsistent, self-centered, and convenient. The Gen-Z protests weren’t a TikTok trend. They weren’t a branding opportunity. They were a desperate cry from a generation that’s tired of being silenced and robbed of a future.  Watching someone turn that into a messy political ambition is heartbreaking and infuriating. We didn’t risk our safety so one guy could walk around looking like a “youth politician.” We marched for real change. For accountability. For a country that doesn’t chew its future generation alive. And right now, Miraj feels like he’s drifting so far from the soul of that movement that it’s honestly painful.  If he actually wants to stand for Gen-Z, then he needs to stop playing this half-activist, half-politician game and show some damn consistency, clarity, and courage because right now, all I’m seeing is another person using the movement’s energy to put himself in the spotlight.  Anyone else feel like this? Because I’m seriously done pretending this is okay.    And here are the straight-up questions people genuinely have for him:  Who is funding your movement, your events, and now this new political party?  Why did you claim there was “no leader” during the protests but suddenly step into a political role afterward?  When exactly did you decide to form a party during the protests or after?  If you didn’t intend to be a leader, why are you acting like one now?  Why do you vanish or disengage whenever things get tense, unclear, or dangerous?  Why was the October 9 situation handled so confusingly by you?  Why talk about an attack on your office but file no clear, formal police complaint?  Who keeps you accountable? Who checks your decisions?  What gives you the right to speak on behalf of an entire generation?  Are you building a movement or building a personal political brand?",

He became popular by lottery and so as did Sudan, nothing special, which is why the political party leaders are openly challenging the zen-z protest outcomes|||someone said \"all i see is young deuba\" and i agree|||I've been against this guy since day 1. He's only at this stage cause of racism that pushed social workers like Sudan aside \"chinese, indian\" accusations ley. Whole protest was based on discord where every decision was voted by us, even deciding pm. Miraj did everything on his own with few friends, never introduced himself to the gc, never asked for public opinion. Yet people claim he's leader cause it's familiar face. Thukka nepali haru|||We should remember that the protest was not for the good of genz, it was to remove corruption. So support those who want corruption free nation, not a certain generation|||here's my 2 cents(you can check my post history to determine the kind of person I am)  He's from a well-off family. He's been doing 'media' stuff like making videos and shit from a while ago but he hasn't been 'in the streets' as a kid and it shows. Call me backwards or whatever but if you never got into fights as a kid, or even as a teenager, you don't have that 'bite'. That's him. That softness combined with good looks and branding made him the perfect mascot for non-violent 'gen-z'. He's great as a model but as a ruthless and calculating leader that can lead hundreds of people to bring a certain outcome? Nope.. he's a weak kid inside. Aba ko political events le uslai daro banauna chai sakcha hai in that regard.  He got scared after the sep 8/9 incidents, fearing that his good life could get stripped away from him. He's someone with a lot to lose. His family and relatives probably held him back. Tespachi he probably came back to the front ali pachi with some kind of a plan. Aile chai I just think he's trying to do what he thinks and knows is right - play by the political system's rules. And since we all have severe trauma related to anything 'political party' related, we hate to see it.  Sudan is the opposite of miraj - he's been in the field, has scolded corrupt officials to their face since 2015, has had literal dirt and blood on him. But he's not an eloquent speaker like miraj, he's got 'a look' but the kind of person he has become, branding himself online is not sth he cares about. Whatever he is, is his brand.  In any case, we gotta be careful and discerning and support where needed and criticize where appropriate.

Intentions sahi hola but yinarle anarchy matra badauxan.|||Not a Zenzee and while I appreciate the revolution and all, they have slowly becoming Oli gang. What it demonstrates is the blood we have - thirsty for oneself, power, money, opportunity. I am particularly upset with Sudan Gurung who is hell bent at removing Home Minister and this guy called Miraj Dhungana. I will dismiss Miraj right off the bat because I don't see anything in his eyes and his face. He is a selfish person and anyone who is following him and all should think many times. Sudan Gurung - the guy is hell bent on removing home minister on such a stupid demand that he wants to arrest Oli and Lekhak. What the hell guys ? are you looking for rawanraj? we have laws and we want to enforce it fairly and strictly. Om Prakash is a lawyer and he is not trying to protect Oli or Lekhak - anyone thinks that is such a stupid Zenzee. Do you guys want to arrest someone just on a whim? without gathering sufficient proof? In western countries law enforcement officials spend years if not decades monitoring and gathering evidences against someone they think is culprit - they just don't  arrest someone and investigate - that wouldn't be rule of law. Om Prakash has that schooling. I don't care who Om Prakash is and all but he is definitely a capable guy and has proved it time and again - after all, he is chosen by PM.  Now, are you guys looking to change ministers and government leadership when we only have 4 months to go ? Its such a shame when every so called Zenzee goes to Singhadarbar and disturbs our government's actions. Just think if all the time they spend is meeting you guys.     Now listen to what Mahabir Pun said - please go to your constituencies and help new  political parties that align to your views win - why are you spending so much energies trying to meet the PM ? The Miraj Dhungana is such a scam guy - He is driven by his own ambition, I feel. I did like Sudan but he is also active childish and not a thing in near future.  Whatever everyone says and does listen and watch what Rachha Bam says and does. She is the one who walked out with Army Chief when he seemed to infer democracy was in danger. She is acting with passion and patience. I would recommend everyone to support behind Raswapa, Sagar Dhakal, Baburam, Kulman,  Sumana Shrestha. Sumana is the real deal.     Now if you believe in democracy and free and fair election, support Rabi. How can a person so beloved by people can be in jail without having an opportunity to go to people? is democracy is for the people and by the people?     I recommend please read. Watch what Swarmin Wagle said few days that Deuba was Zenzee, Oli was Zenzee and every popular leader was zenzee when they started politics. There has been tremendous progress but it was not enough. Just because you feel young and under 25 doesn't mean its your government and can do anything. Nope - no way until we have rule of law.     Now this government gotta focus on election and it has to happen. When I hear Miraj and Sudan that say it can't happen in current condition are not only naïve but foolish. They gotta go read what democracy is. Nothing happens without people's mandate which is vote.     And don't forget its not you guys who brought this change - it was a coincidence.  Someone else did on 24th so you really shouldn't overwhelmingly take any credit, especially Miraj who didn't even take part in the protest ! Hope it helps.|||Ani aaja bholi singa durbar bhitra baseka haru protocol follow garera aako hun ta ??|||miraj and party >>>>> yemale and other similar parties|||Yea the protest was headless/leaderless but we need people to lead you can't complain he gained from this protest of course he did and we want a capable leader to run office not military the argument that he was not in the protest is stupid this is exactly why we failed as national because we put fighters as leaders they can be leaders while fighting but in office we need people who lead office not mobs and arms   Not taking his side but this was a common argument against him and I disagree so this ... Btw I don't know why they want directly elected pm within 6 months like bring 2/3 majority and do what you want their ego will delay the election effectively pushing the country years backwards focus on NOTA and NRN voting rights and different policy and development plan for future|||All this shit is happening coz there was no leader during gen z protests. They did not achieve anything despite such massive movement except toppling Government.   Miraj Dhungana came into realization. An organised group is must to move forward. The most important thing a leader should have is a clean image and clear vision. The maturity he has shown not being political figure is admirable.   One of the good thing coming out of Gen Z movement is the youth having interest on politics and stepping forward to be incharge.  We should not discourage them, in the same time help them by giving healthy and constructive criticisms.|||आज उनीहरूले गरेको माग केपी र लेखक लाई सजाए को दायरा मा ल्याउनुपर्छ भन्ने विषयमा थियो। सायद त्यो माग राख्नु गलत भयो होला है।|||Yo sub pani flip bhaira hunxa harek bela.

I barely made it onto the second nomination list and ended up in a college that’s just “okay.” But honestly, I don’t blame the college I blame myself. There were others who got into better colleges than me, even though they had lower grades. So, I can’t say grades don’t matter, but the first term really showed me how tough things can get. I know I need to improve, and I’m determined to do so. I got an A+ in Computer Science, even though I didn’t study as much as I should have. I love Computer Science and building a lot of skills in the field. Right now, though, I’ve decided to take a break from everything every extracurricular activity, including learning JavaScript, React, and other things. I know I probably shouldn’t, but I feel like it’s necessary for now. Starting today, I’ll be locking my phone and using my laptop strictly for studying. I need to focus on my second terminal exams, and it’s time to set boundaries.If I’ve said anything wrong, I apologize. I don’t blame anyone or anything but myself, even though I studied harder than I ever have. My lack of proper note-taking has cost me.

But it turned out none of it actually mattered.   Last year I gave CEE exams for MBBS ug , I couldn't get a scholarship and it felt like the end of the world especially because people expected a lot from me. I used to avoid talking to anyone. But I am ok now. Ek barsa drop liye and gave entrance exams again, BHOLI results aaudai chha and I feel positive about the results.  I honestly believe 11 ko results le kei matter gardaina.

I understand it looks a lot worse to you (and maybe your guardians) coming from 3.97 to 3.10 and your feelings are very valid. I have seen toppers with dead end jobs and barely first class pass having a stellar careers. I'm somewhat middle of the lot myself.  You've got a lot going for you, you got a 4.0 in the subject you love and sounds like you're pretty proactive with it and fairly competent too. All the B's and B+'s  could have been A's with a little discipline and bit of a good luck, and most of all hopefully this has given you a wake up call.  You got a great career and life ahead of you, so take a long breath and carry on!|||mero 3.07 aako 2 baarsa vayo, I'm still alive so this might not be the end. 😅|||From experience, just be happy you didn't fail.

So all I'd like to say is you can improve and reach greater heights much easily than me. Took me lots of hardwork to get back on track.

The number of calls those nggas made during 2 whole weeks, fk. We kept on declining and blocking their numbers but everytime it was a new number lmao.

Watch khan academy for general concepts. Use Perplexity AI or something like that for personal guidance. I got away with a 3.8+ GPA with only these resources. Perplexity really helped me understand the topics I was really struggling with. Also take full advantage of your school library. I used different books to get my concepts clear. For example: Use Fundamental Physics by Resnick and Halliday to understand the concepts in Physics, Thomas calculus for calculus, also most of the math is covered in BC Bajracharya's Basic of Mathematics. Even if you study an hour a day using these resources, that would be enough (Considering you pay attention in class).|||How much is the fee|||Too bad youtube ma free ma xa 😢|||Don't take online tuition class myannn|||fee?? |||You can easily access any topics from any elite professors for FREE .

And 12th is alll about organic ,yup almost all.The same teacher will teach u organic chem till the last day of 12th ,yup u heard it right.However, its not the matter to be intimidated .Personally i practiced organic each day,some day i took a break obviously .So, ya u should revise it from the first chapter. My organic chap teacher was amazing ,calm and gave notes and also provided ideas to make it easier to study while i was in KMC . If u dont have those ,study from youtube.  Ya and i got an overall 3.8  and ya forgot to mention, If u dont understand a topic than u have youtube .To be frankly honest,i used to watch a lecture from youtube everytime a topic or concept or terms even if its subtle. Without the teachers from youtube, well i wouldnt have scored even a 3.6. Only a handful number of teachers teaches the best while others simply recite what is shown on the slides.|||Chem is all about consistency daily class na oadhako concept bujni ho ani al din aagadi mop up garera ni sakkincha|||Ma ta cheat chorera pass vako ho yaar :)|||Well 11 is not like 10, you have to study, hunatw ma ni ekdin agadi padera +2 katako ho, but chemistry ko lagi chai you need to revise reaction haru. Hamlai chem padaune sir le sadhai, reaction chai varu theory xodera vayeni lekhairakhnu hunthyo, ani exam agadi theory ghokera gayera pugthyo, cause reaction haru handy hunthyo.|||Sajilo xa, first of all understand the properties of the metal/atoms you are reading about and based on headings, try to write what it may result in, and then see the answer and tally. this way, you will make a deeper bond with the subject you are reading about  for example, SO2 and H2S both act as reducing agent in materials like potassium permanganate or halogens, by either making H2SO4 or SO2, based on that, try to make those reactions on your own and tally it with the actual reaction  pro tip- BALANCING WALA PART CHAI RATI NAI DEU! MAA KASSAM YESAI MA BIGRINE HO!  tried and tested, got like 68 in chemistry first term|||bro same chem ruined my streak too. what helped me was making reaction charts by topic and revising them daily for 10 mins. patterns started clicking after a while, especially when i wrote them not just read.|||same mann also i got hit by karma didnt study shi and now im gonna choke in re exams cuz i dont understand anything|||I think and I felt as well that chemistry is kinda easy if you know how the chemical reactions work rather than just memorizing it. Focus on breaking compound molecules and try to react with another compound like naturally. You will be able to do every reactions|||school level shit is still easy. You just gotta study consistently|||Go to a shop and buy a lot of sticky notes. Write a reaction on one side and and information on other aide. Carry it wherever you go and memorize the hell out of it even when you are shititng on the toilet . There are no other reasons. (There is one impossible technique, its called memory palace or method of loci which i used to pass my masters)|||Lekhera padhne bani basala ahile dekhi nai 12 ma Kam lagxa Inorganic ko reactions haru sab rough copy ma lekhera padhne gara + organic haru ni lekherai gara ani catalyst haru ,name of the compound pani yad garne gara lekherai Tespaxi hera kasari audaina chemistry|||11 grade garo nai huncha bro Mero pani 11 ma kaile 3.4 gpa katena  12 ma Halka mehnat herya 3.87 gpa aayo So,chinta garnu pardaina|||ma ni testai thiye tara chem ko chai you need to start organic first j bhaye ni    din ko jabarjasti bhaye ni 10 oota reaction garirakha ani it gets easier.    scored chem ma A+ cause hamro organic chemistry ko sir le daily bihana ko class ma reaction lekhna dinthyo",
