But that will never happen.sadly.|||Nepal ma yesai nu dherai tourist aaxan hola haina? Braindead take. Besides that 15k fees is for 1 years targeting world cup because people might overstay.|||Yeah and let's cancel the tourism industry 🤦‍♂️|||This is not a visa fee but a bond. It does not guarantee visa approval, and if you fully comply with the terms and conditions of the bond, the amount is refunded. Nepal was not randomly selected; the countries on this list have higher visa overstay rates, which is why the U.S. requires an additional form of assurance that visitors will return after their stay. To be clear, this is not a visa fee. The United States charges USD 185 to Nepali citizens for a B-1/B-2 visa, which is valid for five years, whereas Nepal charges 125$ for 3 month so technically Nepali Visa is already expensive compared to the US visitor visa and the irony is that this USD 185 fee is non-refundable even if the visa application is denied.|||I think the vast majority of US tourists coming to Nepal did not vote for the child rapist Trump.|||There should be a system where tourists could select places which they'll be visiting and charge them accordingly rather than charging from them everywhere they go in the name of entrance fee and such.|||Haha Trump targeted those passport buyers as well: Antigua, Vanuatu. He ain’t an idiot! Smart move. For Nepal, stop illegally crossing the US borders and overstaying your visas. Hopefully the upcoming election will bring in a new blood and things will get better for Nepal. Fingers crossed!🤞🏻|||Stop comparing and competing with every single thing, your eyes are binded|||With tourist visa, someone can enter US multiple times during its validity (5 years) and can stay in US for upto 6 months once they enter. Let's say we post a bond and then come back, I am assuming they will return this bond. But what happens if we go back again?",

Aren’t all universities in Nepal considered similar?

They essentially said that unless I have a certificate specifically stating that my course is equivalent to Computer Engineering, there’s no point in continuing. (They suggested I should show up for the bearing and physical tests, but couldn’t confirm whether I’d even get the opportunity. So, I decided to drop out of that path.)

            "heading": "HELP! (Laptop recommendations under 60k INR)",
            "body": "Hello! I'm 16 and I wanna get a laptop before my 11th grade finals (PCM victim), which is starting in about 30-40 days. Here are my requirements and i think this is gonna be a long yapping sesh of me explaining and asking things so I would really appreciate if all the tech experts or geeks can help me with it.  • Requirements:  1. CPU + iGPU: Now, I need a Ryzen 7 cpu + iGPU combo and the reason behind it is simple, Ryzen 7 series cpu and especially ITS IGPU is much much much more powerful than any Intel alternative (except intel ultra series which is expensive as it has arc igpu). I'm not aiming for dedicated gpu as I don't do very heavy gaming but at the same time I do play some casual games now and then and radeon 680m is more than enough to run those. This is my primary requirement so any bad cpu + igpu is a deal breaker for me instantly. 2. Display: this is like my second preference as I watch and consume a lot of media. 60hz display works for me but if it's 100% sRGB that would be a treat for my eyes. About the size of the display I think 13.3\" ones are too small so 15.3 and above is much more preferable. 3. Battery: I don't care much about the battery life as I'm gonna plug it into power anyways when gaming but I think when I'm using it casually or just browsing the web, I think 4-5 hours should be enough, type c is must. 4. Ram and Storage: 16gb ram DDR5 and 512 GB Gen 4 NvMe is my requirement. Here I need to specify something: dual channel memory is better than single channel, for example (2x8)gb is better than (16x1) gb so keep in mind that or if it's not dual channel it should be expandabale and about the storage it should BE EXPANDABALE to 1 TB atleast. 5. Reliability: Now, I'm not one of those who wanna get like 10 years from a laptop cause ik that's not realistic and practical but for reliability it should atleast work 3-4 years. A few occasional trips to the service centre or their stores is acceptable for me but I really value after sales service which is bad in almost every big brand right now.  Now I have stated all my requirements and I'm open to all recommendations inside my budget , I can push a lil but not a lot so don't enlighten me with sayings like add 10k into this or wait some time cause I can't wait for more than a month at max.  My 2 picks:  Lenovo Thinkbook 16 Ryzen 7 7735Hs  Pros: 1. CHEAP 2. good cpu + igpu 3. expandable ram + ssd 4. Good build quality  Cons: 1. 45% ntsc display 2. Battery is 45 wh 3 cell  Deal breaker: 45% ntsc (64% sRGB)  2. Lenovo IdeaPad slim 5 Ryzen 7 7735Hs (the 15.3 inch version)  Pros: 1. 100% sRGB display 2. Better display 3. Good cpu + igpu  Cons: 1. Ram is not expandabale 2. Not so great build quality  Deal breaker: it has almost the same specs as thinkbook 16 and even has a soldered ram but just for the 100% sRGB display, they are charging like 12k rupees more.  Some questions i have for you (YES EVERYONE OF YOU):  Should I wait for the republic day sale and buy the laptop cause the price hike has made me sad already or is there a better sale coming in the next 30-45 days ????  Is there a very significant difference between 64% sRGB and 100% sRGB ???? (mind you this is coming from someone whose last laptop had a 16 inch Tn panel)  Why is everyone obsessed with the ThinkPad, it has almost the same specs as Thinkbook and is significantly more expensive.  Now the big question:  Which laptop do you recommend after reading everything I just yapped, also attach or include tips to buy and should I buy the 3 year extra warranty and PLEASE FOR GOD SAKE give me some coupons or discounts so I can save some money on this.",

Renu has made a name for herself in Bharatpur but this will be an election for parliament and not mayor. Last election chitwan had a rabi effect where people in other constituencies voted for him because he was contesting from chitwan and his influence was so immense even the constituency in the neighbouring district were effected. Nawalpur which was considered a stronghold of NC nearly lost to RSP in 2079. Also, chitwan - 3 was won by RPP and previously by prachanda. Even though renu had influence in the constituency, they did not risk prachanda.

I saw a small and modest RSP office. It was simple, but what stayed with me was not the office. It was the people. Every person I met was deeply aware. I am a young person, and I expected that I might need to explain my thoughts or encourage change. Instead, a man in his early forties from the village spoke to me first. Without hesitation, he said that I should support new leaders and that my generation must contribute to changing Nepal. I had gone there thinking I would say this to him, but he said it clearly on his own. Later, I met a woman around fifty years old who was living alone and running a small shop. When we mentioned that the election was coming, she calmly said that she would not vote for the old parties again. There was no anger in her voice, only clarity. What moved me most was that I did not need to persuade anyone. I did not need to explain or argue. The awareness was already there, rooted in real experience. This is happening far from cities, high in the mountains, where people have paid the highest price for migration, neglect, and broken governance. Rural Nepal is not behind. It is watching, learning, and choosing for itself.|||Yes. Now gen-z's and all thinking only social media exists here as a source of news. Bruhh just don't teach your father how to f\"ck.

The root of corruption begins with the distribution of tickets.  >The Gen Z Rebellion and public outrage were against this. When those who sat around the power center and paid money won the election, neither laws were passed nor administrative reforms were carried out. This anger, which has been pent up in the minds of Nepalis for a long time, was expressed on Bhadra 23 and 24.  >Leaders shaken by this rebellion are preparing to change the leadership of their party through a general convention and go to the elections. However, the Nepali Congress, a party that considers itself a supporter of democracy, has not made any move to change its leadership.  >This means that Deuba's wife, Dr. Arju Deuba, is dominating the ticket distribution. In order to get tickets in the Congress, money and greed are used more than the people. The result of this is defeat.  >The same thing happened in the 2074 elections. The Congress won only 23 seats directly. Deuba, who won 40 seats through proportional representation to finally make it 63, did not take responsibility for the defeat.  >Instead, Deuba would reply to those who went to buy tickets claiming to win that he could not be trusted.  >\"What should I do if I lose the election if I get a ticket? They come to Kathmandu not just once or twice, but up to 15 times, exerting pressure. How can I know whether the candidates who come saying they will win will win or not? How can I distrust my own party friends?\" Deuba would have replied.  >The biggest tug-of-war, even more than winning, is in ticket transactions. Leaders say that getting a ticket is like winning a battle in the Mahabharata.  >**In informal conversations, leaders say that for a ticket to the House of Representatives, at least 20 million rupees must be paid to the proportional representation side. In reality, one faction has to be directly organized and paid over a million rupees to one faction. Doing this makes it difficult to raise cash. Those who can afford it collect donations. Those who cannot afford it, mortgage or sell their homes and cars to raise cash.**  >Candidates approach industrialists and businessmen for money management. For which middlemen facilitate. Due to this 'nexus', after being elected to the House of Representatives or becoming a minister, they have to work in favor of 'interest groups'. When interest groups dominate in the process of lawmaking, whether in a parliamentary committee or in a meeting of the House of Representatives, the people's issues are not given priority. Because of this, sometimes Parliament even becomes hostage.  >In every political change, the Congress has been presenting itself as a party that can resolve the crisis. But the need of the day is to institutionalize change by breaking the nexus of transparency, accountability, and vested interests. But the Congress has not shown any intention to cure the deep-rooted chronic disease.

They fear that the contractors could skew laws and policies in their favour.  >At least half a dozen contractors have been elected to the House of Representatives under the first-past-the-post (FPTP) electoral system, according to the Federation of Contractors’ Association of Nepal (FCAN), the umbrella organisation of contractors. Likewise, another dozen have been elected to various provincial assemblies, the umbrella body said.  >Some of the big names elected to the federal parliament include Bikram Pandey, owner of Kalika Construction Private Limited and a former minister; Mohan Acharya, owner of Rasuwa Construction and former lawmakwer; and Purna Bahadur Tamang, owner of Kanchharam Construction Company Ltd.  >During the 2017 elections, average spending by a first-past-the-post candidate for the House of Representatives was Rs10.1 million and it was Rs8.1 million for provincial assembly candidates, according to a study by the Election Observation Committee, Nepal (EOC-Nepal), a poll observer body.  >What happened in Rasuwa in 2017 is a reflection of Nepal’s current electoral system — competent candidates have no chance against powerful tycoons who have bought election tickets from party bosses. Even as they spend extraordinary money to woo voters, Nepal’s political parties have failed to be transparent about their funding in official reports. Donations from businesses are the primary source of funding for all political parties, and that is where the rot sets in. However, the amount of financial support received from well-wishers, supporters and businesses are not broken down in the accounts of any of the parties. In fact, they are not mentioned at all.",

Don’t treat us with respect we leave and find someone better. That’s just the way it is.   If she had treated him better, he would not have gotten close to her sister. It just shows that she is a toxic person that doesn’t care for that man. Not talking for 1-2 months over a small argument is just not it. Especially after pregnancy (meaning he’s not getting laid). A man has needs. Intimacy and Respect.  Good on him for finding someone better when he didn’t get what he want from his partner. It’s good to leave people who don’t talk to you for 1-2 months after a spat and can’t find it within themselves to apologize.",

So I asked about this to a pakistani muslim girl. I asked is this right or not and why is it allowed.  Here what she said completely shocked me.  It was idk if it's her own opinion or she was taught that by someone. She said this.  \" A man would work whole day and he feels immense pressure and sadness or like tiredness after he reach home. And sex is a way from which men can feel better, also if he marries only 1 wife and what if she got periods? He won't be able to have sex with her so if he marry more wives he can have sex and feel better. \"  Honestly, this was literally what she told me.  Then I asked, what will you do? Will you let your husband marry another girl? Can you see your husband with someone else?  She replied, \" Yes, I would let him marry another wife because he is my husband, I won't want to do anything except what islam tells to do.\"  That was like the end of the conversation and I was speechless since this was very uncomfortable to even hear. But at the same time, maybe she isn't educated or she is from rural area of pakistan. So if any of nepali muslim are here. Can you explain this? Also what do other people think about it?",

Promiscuity embedded in religion ig.|||Brainwashing.   The Muslim people I know told me it was a way to protect girls from other predatory men because under Islamic law, you are not allowed to touch a girl who is already married. So men would marry multiple women and take them under their \"protection\". This was prevalent during wars.   Of course, it's outdated and many people don't follow it anymore. Religious fanatics are just blinded by religion and will use any excuse to keep following them.   However, one of my friends from Iran told me that his friends would go to Afghanistan, marry 4 girls, and then bring them to Iran. This was done to free the girls from the Taliban. In Iran they would do talaq and the girls were free to live their own lives. It's messed up that such a thing had to be done.|||Nahhh her answer is vague. I have muslim friends. And there is a rule or reason for allowing multiple marriages. First, if a woman is alone with no support system financially or emotionally or even handicapped , then a married man can marry her with the agreement of both herself and the first wife. Second, if the previous husband of the woman meets an untimely death then another man can marry her despite having first wife, the reason being same as the first. Thirdly, the man must distribute his attention, wealth and love to all of his wives equally. Then ma must be wealthy and capable of loving all this wives. He cannot pick one and favour her only.  So the conclusion is A man can marry multiple wives only for supporting the woman. Anything else, lust or greed is haram My thoughts is, muslim is still rooted in patriarchy. Generations deemed men as superior And women served them. Women were wholly dependent on their husbands, so when their husbands met untimely death, they have no resort.

Interestingly, when his son-in-law, Ali, considered taking a second wife, Mohammed intervened. He declared that because his daughter Fatima was \"a part of him,\" any distress caused to her by a co-wife would distress him as well, effectively preventing Ali from marrying another woman during Fatima’s lifetime (Sahih Bukhari 5230, Sahih Muslim 2449).  *\"Sadda kutta kutta, twada kutta Tommy\"*  Muhammad's life and actions are viewed by Muslims as a model of moral excellence, guided by divine revelation.

There is a free program called Flavortown run by Hack Club in collaboration with GitHub for high school students ages 13–18. Students build and ship open source projects on GitHub and earn points for the time they spend.  Those points can be exchanged for real prizes like a MacBook Air, iPad Air, Quest 3, Nothing headphones, and more. It is not a competition and there is no cost to join.  Seems like a good way to encourage younger students to actually build projects instead of just following tutorials. Worth sharing with younger siblings or any high schoolers interested in coding.

We skipped the formal lectures and kept things simple—just hands-on demos and honest conversations. The goal wasn’t to teach a full curriculum in an afternoon; it was to show these kids that technology isn't out of reach.  As a student-led initiative, we don't have a big corporate engine behind us. We’re just a group of peers showing up and leading where we can. This reel captures some of the curiosity we saw that day—it’s a small start, but a meaningful one.  If you want to build, learn, or contribute to what we're doing, we’d love to have you.  👉 Join the movement: https://codeyatranp.com/join",

Stood for political, social and economic justice throughout his life and didn't compromise for anything.    He took most of the responsibility and he did make mistakes (and he has accepted them gracefully in is biography).      You see, the problem with our generation is we read too less to judge a person and almost fail to account the then social and political scenario of the country. So, my suggestion would be you read yourself and don't judge him based on my opinion or other few incidents or stories mentioned in the comments.   Personally, He gave me the definition of democracy. Here is one story of his conversation with his nephew Naresh Koirala.   *Naresh himself had been puzzled by his uncle’s decision to accept the result. On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP. Mahendra and Birendra believed themselves to be the savior of common \"*naive\"* Nepali.    While BP simply believed that Nepali people irrespective of their education, culture, caste, religion, sex or whatsoever are capable to choose their leaders themselves and make them responsible.|||One of the greatest writers, Nepal has ever produced.|||This guy high moral values unlike present  Congress.

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.  I (21M) and my sibling (15F) are taking care of our parents during the day and our cousins help at night. Because of this, we’ve missed months of classes but we don’t really have a choice right now.  If anyone is able to help even a small amount, it would mean a lot to us.  I’ve verified the case with two of the mods and I’ll be posting medical reports in the comments as well.  Please DM or comment if you can help in any way. Even sharing this post would really help.",

            "heading": "AMA : I have been using menstrual cups for ~8 years. Ask me anything.",
            "body": "**Disclaimer** : this is not an Ad. I have been using menstrual cups for around 8 years and have recommended it to many women in my life. All have loved it and have made the switch from pads/tampons. So i decided to spread the word here.   **Tldr**: Menstrual cups will change your life. it will give you much more freedom and flexibility than period products like pads or tampons.   First of all, what is a Menstrual cup?   A menstrual cup is a reusable, flexible silicone cup inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual fluid. It can be worn up to 12 hours and can be used for several years with proper care.   I have made a list of pro and cons that i have faced in these years. You are welcome to ask more questions. I will answer as many as i can. Serious questions only please!   **PRO**:   1. To start with the basics, menstrual flow is more than just liquid blood. it has many semi-solid/solid things like mucus and blood vessels. So a pad or tampons just cannot ‘absorb’ them. these things just lay there on the surface making you feel slimy and uncomfortable. Instead the cup ‘collects’ it so it doesn’t have this issue.  2. You dont have to worry about a pad shifting from its place. you know the feeling, when the pad is too far back or too far on one side. Also, you dont feel the blood flow ‘out’ like when you laugh or sneeze or stand up. Menstrual cup catches the blood before it gets out.  3. Its an upfront investment but one that will be much cheaper in the long run. You wont have to cash out hundreds of rupees each month on period products.  4. Its better for the environment as it creates little to no waste.  5. Its better when you are out, for example, at other people’s place. you dont have to worry about where to dump your used period products.  6. You dont feel it at all once its inside. you can just live your normal day and forget about it. then only at the end of the day you empty, clean and put it back on. (if its a heavy flow day then i empty it once in the middle of the day too)  7. No issues with friction / rashes on the inner thighs.   **CON** :   1. It has a slightly steep learning curve. I know a lot of people have anxiety of putting it in and getting it out. i did too. but once you have done it a couple of times, you will get a hang of it. There are many tutorials available online for this. I personally fold the cup in a C shape and put it in and then to be sure its secure, I check for suction by pulling/rotating it a bit. Getting it out can feel a bit scary at first. When getting it out, i hold the cup on its body and not just the tip to be sure that the tip doesn’t break. But like i said, once you have done it a few times, it will feel normal.  2. I find it most comfortable to empty the cup in a toilet that has a basin inside it. so I can empty it in the basin, clean the cup and put it in again. it can be done in a toilet stall (without basin) too but you have to be a bit more careful and you will need some tissues to clean the blood off your hands before coming out of the stall.  3. it requires a bit of investment in the beginning even to try (but it will pay off long term if it works out)  4. It can leak, very rarely but sometimes. The leakage is usually minimal so for this, you can use something light like panty liners or period panties. You can try out your options here.   **Recommendations**:   1. When first trying it out, you can try it for a couple of hours at a time when you are not having heavy flow and when you are staying home. This way you will also have an idea of how much blood comes out (spoiler alert: its much less than what you would expect) and how frequently you need to empty the cup.  2. always clean your hands with soap before and after putting/removing the cup.  3. hold the cup by its body (base of the cup) and not just its tip when pulling it out.  4. There are a lot of tutorials, feedback, helpful materials available online. Please be brave and give it a try. you will thank me later :)  —————————————————————————-  **Edit 1**: some people are asking about which brands to use. If someone is a new user of Menstrual cups, could you please let us know about your experience with it and which brand you are using?",

So I have two questions;  1. How do I make the insertion easy? Are there any tips, tricks whatsoever?   2.

You can rent a really nice house in Lalitpur and hire 2 maids for help around the house. That'll cost you like 100-200k per month   But there are other things you need to consider if you decide to permanently move to Nepal.  How will you keep yourself busy? You barely have a social network if you've been living away for so long. You'll come across many people and groups who are after your money. They'll befriend you until you keep giving them what they want. And you'll actually need some of them for networking, helping you with govt bureaucracy/corruption things.  Air quality is one of the worst in the world especially in cities like Kathmandu and Pokhara. Your medical costs may increase and insurance is a scam. But I guess you probably know more about it since you've lived in the US.  Driving is hectic and stressful so get a driver for Rs 25-40k a month who can also help around.  For all these services, try to use a trusted source and not just agencies.|||i think 620,000 Npr per month  is way more than enough.|||Public transportation may overwhelm you, so maybe you could have a ride of your own or even a small car if it goes with your budget. Having own vehicle helps a lot.|||If you’re planning a retired life, I wouldn’t really recommend settling in Kathmandu itself. The city is busy, noisy, and getting more congested every year. A better option would be to live slightly outside the city in a quieter area that’s still easily accessible for hospitals, markets, and the airport.  If you enjoy nature and scenery, areas around Pokhara are great. Beautiful views, a slower pace of life, and a good expat and tourist-friendly environment. Another option is the Terai region, especially if you like the idea of growing your own vegetables and fruits. Renting a house with some land for small-scale farming can be very rewarding, and you could even keep a few chickens or goats.  That said, if you still want to be close to Kathmandu, places on the outskirts like Budhanilkantha, Godavari, Bhaktapur or Kirtipur can offer a good balance between city access and a calmer lifestyle. Wherever you choose, just make sure healthcare access, road connectivity, and daily essentials are within reasonable distance.  Honestly, I think I just described my own retirement plan too haha|||Lalitpur is an accessible elite place.|||It's more than enough..Bhaktapur is starting to get polluted..but Lalitpur and Kirtipur are livable rn..there are bars and pubs in jhamshikhel if you wanna avoid crowded Thamel|||Wear a mask.|||What you have is more than enough for a extremely good life here. Cost breakdown could look something like this  Rent - Rs. 40,000 for a flat. (2BHK) in city area  Food - Depends but if you plan to cook yourself for most meals I would say Rs. 30,000 is enough  Utility - Electricity/internet water etc - Rs. 12,000   Education? - Do you have kids? If so, a high class Nepali standard school would probably be around 30,000 per kid  Misc (transport, eat out etc) - 20,000  Total - 162k say 170k per month (assuming 2 kids education). And this is extremely generous level of spending.   Lalitpur area is good. If you want night life may be stay close to Jhamshikhel area or area close to thamel.|||How We Left Australia to Start a Farm in Nepal with No Experience - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evJX2RekWvI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evJX2RekWvI)|||see , money is a different thing ,you will have learn to adjust things like narrow and unsafe roads , broken and insufficient services etc, but  but !  once you learn the ways here and kinda slow paced life over her I strong believe you will enjoy.|||600000k per month? bruh you can live like a king here with that kind of money|||She moved to her new world at 19 bro, so chill you guys will find ease here.|||620k is more than enough for really good lifestyle. No amount of inflation in coming years will make this insufficient, otherwise 95% Nepalese are doomed.

When buying house, check if the land has enough spaces for road, near river, previously land was swamp and u should be good. Use google map historical data for this and you should be good.

The biggest thing you need to realize is 1. Your access to everything drops significantly. If youre my size (5’11 205) you will have a hard time finding clothes and shoes. 2. The pollution here is beyond rough. Most days are in the hazardous levels. 3.  No beef (there are some places but its not very good) 4. Lalitpur is amazing, we live in thecho and there is no crime in our area. We have AC in the bedroom and a solar water heater for the full house.   Good luck and i hope you enjoy living here!|||At 620000 NRS per month, you should be able to leave a pretty luxurious life. You can but will struggle to spend that much unless you are going after all the highest of high end stuff.   Lalitpur is relatively calmer, quieter than some Ktm city centres and should be as good as anywhere else. I've seen a lot of high rises with apartments very similar to American / European ones in Sanepa area but not been there in a couple years.  I suggest one or both of you to learn to drive in Nepal. Assuming you both have a US driving license, it may take a few months to get used to the Nepali driving style, but it's totally worth it. Then you can get vehicles of your own because public transport sucks.  AC and hot water should be easy enough to get installed. If you are not bound to Ktm, I suggest you get a farm house in the outskirts / small hilly towns (dhulikhel, dhading, etc.) to escape ktm heat and pollution.  Keep your finances private, DO NOT fall into guilt trap and lend money. Do not tell how much money you have, not even those you consider close. Make sure your wife is able to handle the bureaucratic stuff because you may get taken advantage of (you'll learn as you go along). Make sure you know what the local rates for stuff are. No tipping in general, round up to next 100/500 if you're feeling generous but not as much as in the US. Do not trust the water, even the bottled ones outside, especially at first. Life is relatively slow and everything takes a lot of time and patience, especially paperwork, and bureaucracy. Invest your money in US as much as possible. Only keep a comfortable amount in Nepal. NRS deflation against dollars is crazy. Be careful during night time, crimes are not that high but still vigilance is warranted. Beware of the street dogs.  Hope you have a pleasant life in Nepal. Good luck and keep us posted.|||That’s awesome man. I think $4k/mo is plenty to live off.

No taxes if you rent and don’t work (foreign income). So if I were in your shoes I’d save an outright 50% in a bank account giving like 6% interest and splurge the rest.   Nepal, and especially Kathmandu, is like anywhere else on the planet. You could live frugally and save a load of money or be high flying in elite circles that will have you broke just supporting your lifestyle.    Cheers man. You living the dream a lot of us dream of lol. Good stable income awesome Nepali life.|||Join some expat groups when you come (WhatsApp/FaceBook) so you can ask where to find things you miss from home. If you have any questions from an American living in Nepal perspective feel free to DM me. Good luck. 👍|||Your monthly retirement pay might be enough for sufficient lifestyle in lalitpur  , night life in lalitpur is not big as in thamel and is mostly surrounded by temples , buying house in lalitpur might be expensive but living in rent there might be frugal , i dont know much about house prices here and about transport , it is easily accessible|||this is decent for a good life here!|||I advise you to stay outside the valley, where there is good road access to Kathmandu, and it is quicker.

Expensive and tight the money is good and should last you life time if spent properly.  You should consider staying in Raniban Kathmandu its safe and has a good expat community its clean fresh air and relatively cheap.  Rent for first 3 month and consider buying a house. Realestae in kathmandu is the safest investment. You could sell it with ease if needed.|||Money wise you are good. That is surplus money for living a decent life in Nepal. You might need to consider reinvesting surplus back in the US or invest here in Nepal to multiply further.  But major thing is what will you be doing here in Nepal? You can try to utilize your US skill here to engage and help Nepal and Nepali people.|||From a financial perspective,  you are quite well settled.  Lalitapur, good choice. For your budget I would prefer somewhere around the sanepa, jhamsikhel area, there are many embassy and other high profile residents so you won't get bad company, and live a lifestyle you want  From a social point of view. Since you mentioned retirement era, you could learn Nepali if you want which is optional btw   To make a retirement life. There are plenty of groups organizing hikes, trek and events, you along with your wife would join and enjoy the retirement life. Until you feel comfortable on your own.  Mostly, we Nepalese are kind towards foreigners, so you mostly should receive good hospitality. (Few exceptions could be anywhere )  Lastly, Welcome to Nepal. Hope you enjoy it here !!|||Its better to stay there|||If anyone around Balkumari/Lalitpur wants to play badminton casually, I’m looking to form a small group. DM me",

That is a natural progression to what you’re feeling. You did not grow in a social environment, of course it won’t feel natural to socialise.   On one hand you will begin to improve in socialising if you keep doing it and also realise that socialising is a two way street. On the other hand, what you learned in your childhood will stick with you for a long time. You will always be hyperaware of your surroundings. Specially the people.   Don’t forget to realise a few facts every once a while. This is the loneliest generation there’s ever been. Everybody is afraid to make the first move. We didn’t deserve to be burdened with the pile of shit they received from someone else but such is life. Let’s get on with it.

I had the exact same environment and I'm just starting to see how it's so deeply rooted in me now in my early twenties. I can't voice my feelings out or express what I want without feeling like my throat is tied with barbed wires bro.  Everytime I try and speak my emotions or feelings, even basic ones that don't seem like much to other people, I start getting tears in my eyes and I automatically shut down. Can't get a word of my opinion out. Don't even get me started on fights, misunderstandings and disagreements. They feel like hell to me even though I know it's nothing big.  It might feel like there's nothing you can do about it but trust me, it will go away even if it takes a lot of sacrificing your comfort zones. Don't cancel plans when your friends ask to hangout, start letting them in your heart, relationships require sacrifices too, you gotta do things that you don't really wanna do and instead just sit in your room alone. Get out of this loop, go for a short hangout with people that you feel comfortable with, start investing in friendships and I'm sure it's gonna start feeling better.  There's times where I feel like I'd be better off alone in this world, I don't need people at all, and that friends are just intervening my life. That happens so often. You don't need to push these feelings away, let it come but then let it go. Humans do need people after all. So please get out and make changes, even if you have to fake it. It will get you going.  Also the most important part, let your parents be disappointed, as controversial as this may sound, that's the only way you can brace your heart and start doing what you want.

As someone who geeks out over linguistics, I realized I was seeing something I’d never personally witnessed before: the involvement of local, non-mainstream languages in election campaigning.  ​Usually, everything is in the \"official\" or dominant language, but this time I saw posters featuring Newar (Nepal Bhasa), Urdu, and Tibetan.  ​I’ll admit my ignorance—as a non-Newar, I had never actually seen the Newar language in written form used to promote an election before. Seeing it alongside Urdu and Tibetan makes me so curious about the selection process.  ​Is this a sign of campaigns moving toward hyper-local inclusivity? Or is it a tactical move to reach specific \"pockets\" of voters that have been traditionally overlooked? I’m particularly interested in:  ​The Newar script: It’s such a powerful cultural statement to see it in a public, political space.  ​The Urdu/Tibetan choice: These feel like very specific demographic \"nods.\" Is this happening more frequently in certain districts?  ​I’d love to hear from anyone who lives in these areas or knows more about the political strategy behind this.

            "body": "After spending the last three years moving between digital marketing, software projects, and teaching, I thought I was building the “right” life. Good income, modern work, flexibility on paper but something felt missing.   So during breaks and holidays, I started asking myself a serious question:  What kind of work actually leads to a happy life?  I began researching different sectors and talking to people. Eventually, I kept coming back to agriculture.  I started visiting farms and speaking with farmers. I asked almost every one of them a simple question: \"Are you happy with your life?”  Almost all of them said yes  without hesitation.  And that surprised me.  These weren’t people living in luxury. Some of them had loans. Some worked long hours. Some didn’t own fancy things. But they had something that felt rare:  * They controlled their time * They worked with their hands and the land * They lived close to their families * They saw the direct result of their effort every day  Meanwhile, I noticed something else. In places like the USA and Australia, many people spend 30 years paying off homes and farmland. On paper, they are “successful.” But many of them barely see their families, live under stress, and don’t feel free.  So what actually makes someone happy?  It doesn’t seem to be money, or job title, or how modern your work is. It seems to be perception, freedom, purpose, and family.  Farmers may not be rich in the way society defines it but many of them are rich in time, peace, and connection. And those are things money can’t easily buy.  This made me rethink everything I was chasing.  Maybe happiness isn’t about climbing higher.   Maybe it’s about standing somewhere that feels right.  I ask everyone what happiness define you ?",

Will he be happy when his children blame him for not being able to give them good schooling and a stable income source?   Your analysis of happiness is valid if the farmer earns well enough for basic needs+emergencies. Even if we forget other luxuries.  I understand money does not equate happiness but I am sure no none can still be happy if they are too poor to afford basic health and education.|||Then what are all the farmer suicides about?

Not to mention, fertilizers are never on time nor are quality seeds.   Stop romanticizing the labor and hard work of other .  Anyway, if you know that, why are you not being happy by starting farming ? Are you going to start farming? Or it’s just let them be happy why you suffer in screen and then post like you had epiphanies 😏🤣  But again, who is farmer? The one who owns land but don’t farm? Or the one who does the farming but is paid as labor? Since, they all claim it as agricultural income. Define farmer for me too.

            "body": "I was going through some debates about Islam and their worldview, but I could not shake off how radical the religion is. Mind you, I am not inferring all Muslims are inherently radical, but the religion shows tenets of extremism and oppression against women throughout its religious text.   i. Quran is supposed to be the word of god, divine and infallible. It is actually Allah speaking to us through the written texts by Muhammad. So there can not (or at least is very little room for) ambiguous interpretation of controversial things in it.   ii. Discrimination and violence against women is inexorably intertwined throughout the text. Here are some examples,   a. Surah An-Nisa 4:34: This verse states that men are guardians over women because Allah has made some excel others and because men spend their wealth on them. It advises men to admonish disobedient wives, separate from them in bed, and, as a last resort, ***strike them*** lightly if they persist in rebellion. (But, wives striking back at husbands is not permissible)     b. Surah Al-Baqarah 2:282: In financial transactions requiring witnesses, it specifies calling two men or one man and two women, so if one woman makes an error, the other can remind her (implying women's intellectual worth is exactly half as that of men).     c. Surah An-Nisa 4:3: Men are permitted to marry up to four wives if they can treat them justly, but women have no such polygamous rights.     iii. Discrimination and violence against 'non-believers' is called for multiple times. Here are some examples,   a. Surah At-Tawbah 9:29: Commands fighting those who do not believe in Allah or the Last Day until they pay the jizya tax in submission (tax acts as a deterrent, if you have to pay tax to believe in or worship god of your choice, you would just say fuck it in most cases).  b. Surah Al-Bayyinah 98:6: Describes disbelievers (those who reject Islam) as \"the worst of creatures,\" destined for Hell.     c. Surah At-Tawbah 9:5: Instructs killing polytheists wherever found after sacred months, unless they repent and convert.     These are only few examples that is readily available everywhere. Yet, we cannot even have open conversations about it due to 'political correctness'. The pillar of Islam is radical and is based on discrimination, violence and rejection of things non-islam. Tolerance is not part of the religion (just look at all the muslim nations and how they treat their women).   The percentage of Muslim population as the share of the country has been steadily growing. They are notorious for rejecting family planning and birth control measures and consistently have the highest fertility rates. Is there not a conversation to be had?      Disclaimer - This is not a 'hate-speech' or anything. Other religious scriptures have plenty of amoral or downright immoral tenets. This is just to understand more and create positive discussion. I believe Nepal should he secular with the right to religious freedom.",

Boycott them. Boycott religion. They are anti-freedom.|||Pashupati nath le Allah ko rakshya garun|||Oh boy!! Discussion about religion never goes the right way my brother. But anyways!!  1. If interpretation was minimal or not allowed, there would not be multiple schools. (Hanafi, maliki, hanbali). Islam in itself has been changing historically to fit context(famine), culture(india), geo-politics (iraq, egypt).   2. Islamic ethics is not derived from isolated verses alone, but from the Quran and the Prophet’s lived example. And it is mostly societal prejudice, lack of education, more than cultural. Have you seen rural india or even inner terai of nepal?   3. Mostly for written debt. And mostly as women were not heavily involved in economy. But the women always could inherit property, initiative divorce, and were considered independent moral agents accountable to God directly.  4. The other part matters maybe?  ``` If you fear you cannot be just, then marry only one.```   ``` You will never be able to be just between wives, even if you strive. ```  Again it is all about interpretation and was mostly for post war context (men died more women). Still better than sati that we had maybe?  5. Christianity flourished in Jerusalem. Hinduism strived under muslim empire in india. It is easier to find a church (egypt) or temple (Bangladesh) in islamic nation than to find a mosque in deep rooted hindu or christian area/nation (china?).   6. Every religion does this? Christianity - eternal damnation (wahtched vikings?), hinduism - karmic punishment, buddhism - rebirth in hell.  7. If state behaviour = religion then, Christianity- colonial genocide, Hinduism- caste oppression, Buddhism- Rohingya persecution.  Political power corrupts religious ideals. See turkey vs afghanistan, Indonesia vs Iran, saudi vs Bangladesh.  8.  Fertility drop sharply with education, urbanization, and women’s employment. Iran’s fertility collapsed after female education expanded. Bangladesh’s fertility fell dramatically without abandoning Islam.  Basically religion no good or bad, power corrupts people and corrupted people very bad. When this continues for long, the bad becomes the norm.   Basically,  वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्  सर्वे भवन्तु सुखिनः सर्वे सन्तु निरामयाः  विद्या विनयसम्पन्ने ब्राह्मणे गवि हस्तिनि शुनि चैव श्वपाके च पण्डिताः समदर्शिनः|||Their prophet was a pedo warlord. I ain't taking them seriously.|||Not a Muslim but every Muslim country to a certain extent has been destabilized by the west. One of the main things they did was kill all left leaning political movements hence making it easier for far right movements to take power. For eg Turkey 🇹🇷 has not had the type of western interference that other Muslim countries have and is a secular country. It gave women the right to vote in 1934. This question is like asking Bahuns hey do you secretly hate everyone because your religion has told you that you are genetically and spiritually superior to everyone else. And also Indonesia and Malaysia are both Muslim countries as well. And are more stable than the oil rich Middle East even though they both have faced CIA interference. Especially Indonesia. The Jakarta method is a terrifying documentary if you want to check it out.|||Why waste time? Better learn about world political history.|||I am a hindu but i will correct you or tell you  what i know 1. Mohammad was illiterate. He didnt write quran according to muslims it is just word go god sent by allah through jibrail. Conspiracy is it is mohammads jew friend who wrote  it.  Others are all correct|||Most religions, unfortunately, are based on discrimination, violence and patriarchy. Equality is not part of many religions (just look at the non-muslim nations like Nepal or India for example and how they treat/have treated their women, i.e. child marriage, dowry, kidnapping women for marriage, chhaupadi, domestic violence, sati pratha, etc.). Like quran, even bible or garud puran and swasthani include lots of sexist content. It sounds like you do hold a stereotypical and generalised perception about muslims but it's good that you are open for conversation.  Every religion and culture has its good and bad side. It's important that we see both, choose to follow the good, and continue challenging the bad from our end. - A non-muslim|||There is no understanding religion. Everyone will say their interpretation is right and other bad things are not what their religion preaches.   But it’s just weak people clinging to something. All religions.|||I also started learning about islam from debates with atheists, christians and ex-muslims. Ex-muslims are the most unhinged ones (understandably so). I might be biased against Islam but I don't know where the unbiased line is. Here's my two cents:  I think your intuitions are largely correct. I think the issue with islam is not of good or bad but of how to assimilate incompatible belief systems.  Your point (i) is the main issue 'good' muslims face with. Two statements \"Quran is truth\" and \"Mohammed is perfect\" are not conclusions but the premise of their belief system. Its a monumental challenge to defend the problematic parts you mentioned for them compared to christians and hindus; too less wiggle room for alternative interpretation.  I would also appreciate more muslims come forward and discuss these issues. I don't see this happening and I think I know why. I see only two outcomes of such discussions: get exposed being intolerant or change the belief.  There are couple of examples: \"Muslim guy admitting he would happily watch an apostate executed if he was in islamic country\" and \"Another guy saying is okay to marry and have sex with 5 yo\". Mind you both of them are youtube celebrities with large followings. Which is why good muslims are mostly silent or resort to disingenuous arguments nowadays. I vaguely remember seeing Jakir Naik in TV when I was kid.  Islam is filled with anti jewish sentiments and even necessitates muslim to kill them before end of time. Which explains why israel-palestine war gets a lot of attention and why all the muslims sides with palestine.  I know there are many muslims who coexist and don't believe the verses you mentioned or choose not to act upon but this will not change the fact that those verses exist and they claim to follow the book that contains them. I will always be skeptic unless islam and quran goes through radical reformation which I don't see happening given their premise.  I also find this \"alternative interpretation\" argument hard to digest. If your book clearly says kill the non-believers and you have to perform a mental gymnastics to get non-violent interpretation then maybe the peaceful muslims are the radical ones.  Now to address your points. Don't let the label of political correctness or hate speech stop talking about things you are concerned about. I should be able to criticize and absolutely shit on any ideas. Thats the fundamental of scientific process. If anyone gets offended that their problem. I don't agree with right to religious freedom because religion has vague definition and it can contradict with other rights.|||If u take it seriously, u r a problem.|||I guess, you just read few verses without interpretation. You have to read ups and downs on what circumstances surah of Quran was revealed. Also, don’t seem like you are interested in learning about Islam. I am Muslim women and I have all the right, I don’t feel oppressed. It’s just that people of other religions think we are oppressed.  If I have to be honest about oppression, people around all religions try to oppress women which go against the teaching of all religions. It’s patriarchy that took over religious leaders and they mislead people.  If you really wanna learn about Islam, purchase these three books; the sealed Nectar, Quran and then, a book called, ‘ A Commentary on Ash-shamail al-Muhammadiyyah’. If you read these books, Inshallah you gonna cry and gonna fall in love with Prophet Mohommad and Allah.  Your curiosity makes sense, as people called themselves slave of Allah and follower of prophet Mohommad and goes on doing exact opposite of what Prophet mohommad taught us.|||I have the same questions   And as i got more into the rabbit hole   I found out every religion is extremist with islam being extreme on this.  How to hide this :  Below is just my personal opinion :   I like to be called (a)thiest.  I mean i follow hinduism but .... Idk i am not that frustrated when someone says hindu this hindu that , cause i immediately assume someone was extreme.|||OP:  'I want to understand more.'  Also OP: Proceeds to explain exactly why the religion is evil, radical, and intolerant while citing specific verses to support your pre-existing bias.  Let’s be real, OP. You didn't write this to learn. You wrote this to lecture. You have clearly already made up your mind, so why pretend otherwise?  If you actually wanted to understand, you would ask, 'How do you interpret Surah An-Nisa 4:34 in a modern context?' or 'How does the community view these specific verses?' Instead, you dumped a list of grievances and demographic fear-mongering about fertility rates. You haven't come here for a conversation; you’ve come here to validate a conclusion you’ve already reached.|||If you want to learn about islam in general, I would start with some of these.   [Crash course islam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpcbfxtdoI8)  [Crash course islam and politics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka8csjsmX6I)  Also generally when the scriptures are around a thousand years old, think how much conservative our society was just until 20 years ago.  Now how much worse it is for the people in the past.|||If you really wanna learn better talk to grok than redditors.  Islam does have tons of problems. But there are also many schools and many interpretations. Islam was designed to incorporate every aspect from day to day life to government. There is islamic jurisprudence, quran, haddith, fiqh.  From my observation, what i found out was that. There is main text quran. Its their most important one. Then later compiled ones haddith, which are sahil (Authentic), hasan (good), daif(weak) regarding its authenticity. Then there are jurisprudence books. Which they use to run a society or use for the basis of sharia law.  You seem to be cautious or bothered by all the fucked up things on islam. Its true. There are many. It's better to know the history. Islam was spread mostly through conquest and they developed highly apartheid society when of you weren't a Muslim. Or a non Muslim who didn't pay jizya, you had little rights and slavable. Religion is a big part for them, and worshipping an idol was the biggest crime in their religion (shirk). They punish apostasy and blasphemy with death. And these aren't fringe practices. If you look at history. This has been the norm for most of Islamic states. This is why there is so much radical aspects to islam. This is just the tip of the iceberg. You can read the book of Islamic jurisprudence, like tahir al washilah, which was a book used for Islamic state in iran. To get an inking of how Islamic states ran. You will likely find 100 problematic stuff like pedophilia, apartheid status, barbaric punishments or capital punishment, treatment of women.  However there is many interpretations in islam. Sects like shia ans sunnis. Traditions like suffisim, druze. Each country has a different flavor of islam. However they are the most consistent and dogmatic religion. Btw, suffism is mostly a spiritual traditional stuff so less of that poltical and jihad stuff which is radical.  It's also important to notice that there are plenty of non radical mulsims. Who view islam as a peaceful religion. Who believe in tolerance of other religions. Its mostly getting prominency in modern days. Where people usually only believe in the Quran and reject all the haddiths and fiqh. And quran can be interpreted in a peaceful way. It's not bad compared to books like bible. Could even be relavent to today's world.  Also important to notice that. Most people who suffer due to radical islam are muslims. Before anyone stereotypes all muslims.|||I think religions are basically cultures sugar-coated with some god's stamp of approval. But nobody knows that god.",

I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized.

I left my job after a year because of a toxic culture. I swear, I couldn't find a position (I was even applying for internships) at any tech company in Kathmandu. I thought it wouldn't be that difficult since I have decent projects and a year of experience, but I remain jobless for next three months. It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

Essentially doing a drill over and over until you're fairly confident to take on almost any curve ball interview question.  Whilst you wouldn't be asked to invert a binary tree on your interview, it'd help you understand in a broader sense how to break down a problem and solve it.  Not to mention NPath, Cyclomatic, Coupling, and time complexity.

Shitty code, more bugs and more opportunities for IT devs. Not every company can afford AI that is going to cost fortune in long run. Mid-level devs would collapse, there would be junior then senior. Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||[https://sip-club-webier.vercel.app/](https://sip-club-webier.vercel.app/)  Bro yettiko website with cms, bina problem kaam garney AI le banau ani manum la bro ko kura.|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||Skill issue.

Don't get me wrong - vibe coding and low code/no code methods are getting popular with some LLM coders (Claude, Gemini) becoming absolute beasts, but, the real need of a human is in problem solving and building scalable systems. My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.  The problem is people jumping on the bandwagon which is creating a terrible environment for business owners, recruiters and stakeholders.  I hope you do well in your career my friend.

Then there was a brief rise in ethical hacking and backend. now  everyone has suddenly moved to AI and ML. Dipping your feet into too many things usually takes you nowhere.  Any subject you choose to study should be something you actually care about. not to mention if you are good at youll get hired and get paid. The reason so many people are not being hired right now is because the bar is too high. Every field is either boom or bust, or at best cyclical. There are honestly so many interesting areas a CS student could go deep into, but instead, if you look at the codebases of many grads, their GitHub is full of AI slop, useless backend projects, and frontend work that is completely vibecoded. The UI and UX are usually a mess too, with tacky color choices, (obv gradients because it's completely vibecoded) random fonts, and no sense of design fundamentals.  Instead of chasing trends like this, please  study things that genuinely excite you. You could focus on  networking, embedded systems, RTOS, post-quantum cryptography, homomorphic encryption, geospatial systems and GIS, quantum computing, computational hardness like P vs NP, cloud systems, or even proper HCI. These are fields that actually reward understanding, not just copying tutorials. Not only that evey AI companies will hire these people.   Companies that depend heavily on hardware will always need strong backend, systems, and network engineers. That demand does not disappear just because a new framework or buzzword shows up.

Instead, focus on building real solutions. Strengthen your fundamentals, especially problem-solving, data structures, and a solid core understanding of OOP (ratta matrai parne haina ni definitions). Leverage that knowledge to build something from scratch, making a game is a great example.  Imo, even the kind of tech stacks someone uses and the kind of projects they do says a lot about their personality. Most importantly, adapt to different tech stacks.

            "comments": "Hop|||After reading a few of the replies here, my suggestion is simple: secure yourself first.  Hand in your one-week notice only after you’ve signed an agreement with the new company. Get everything confirmed before you mention anything to your current employer.  Once that’s done, approach HR or management and let them know you’ve received a better opportunity elsewhere.. ideally one offering around 4× your current pay and that you’ve decided to move forward with it. If you feel it’s appropriate, apologize for the short notice. You can also give them a chance to match the offer (though realistically, they probably won’t).  Most likely, they’ll accept the resignation.  If they’re the difficult type, they may threaten to hold your pay. In that case, try to get paid before resigning or be mentally prepared to walk away from the remaining amount. Legally, there isn’t much they can do anyway, especially if they were paying below minimum wage.  If you don’t want to go down that route, there’s another option:  You can simply inform them that a personal issue has come up and you need to return to your village for a few months (say, at least five). Explain that this is why you’re giving a week’s notice instead of disappearing. They can’t take action against you in this situation either… at most, they’ll process your exit.  Things to keep in mind:  - Try to ensure you don’t have many unpaid days before handing in your notice. - Don’t share any details about your new employer.. no names or any hints. If they’re toxic, they can try to sabotage it. - Give at least a week’s notice. Two weeks is better if you can manage it. - Don’t get manipulated into staying for a minor raise. If they can’t offer at least 3× what you’re earning now, the new role is clearly the better move. Be firm about leaving.   I’m saying this as someone who’s been on the employer side and dealt with situations like this regularly. We expected high performance and strong work ethics, and while we paid slightly above the market average, the pressure wasn’t for everyone. Many people left as soon as they got paid and that’s understandable. What we did appreciate was honesty and advance notice.  A proper 14-day resignation helps the employer transition work, hand over projects, or train replacements. Disappearing without notice only creates problems for everyone, and I wouldn’t recommend that approach despite what some comments suggest.  You don’t owe the company anything beyond basic professionalism. Just as they can terminate you immediately for violating terms, you also have the right to leave at any time. If you want to stay ethical and professional, give a 14-day notice. If not, at least give a week so the transition is smoother for you and them.  All the best with whatever route you choose and good luck with what’s next. Cheers!|||Just leave, they will find an replacement. Estai ho corporate ma, if you don't hop, you don't progress|||That's why always be sure and do proper research before signing up the contract.

In the project review, they mentioned my projects don’t follow their **professional workflow, clean architecture, and Repository Pattern**, so they suggested I do an internship first.  **Here’s the catch:**  * It’s **unpaid for 2 months** * Counting my previous internship experience, this would be my **5th month of work**  **About me:**  * **Final-year IT student** * Built Laravel projects like CRUD apps, auth systems, task managers, e-commerce, and blog platforms * Comfortable with **MVC, validation, relationships** * Haven’t used **Repository Pattern / clean architecture / professional workflow** in real projects yet  **My dilemma:**  * Is it worth doing another unpaid internship to learn **professional Laravel practices, architecture, DB design, and workflow**? * Should I try learning these on my own and directly apply for **paid junior roles**? * Or is this kind of unpaid learning normal for Laravel/backend devs fresh out of college?

            "body": "I’m an Android developer and a couple of years ago I built an app called **TelecomPacks**. The idea was to make mobile pack activation less painful for Nepali users.  Play Store link:   👉 [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.thegbguy.telecompacks](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.thegbguy.telecompacks)  **What the app actually does:**  * Makes **USSD calls on the user’s behalf** * **Parses the USSD responses** * Converts those text-based menus into **clear buttons** for data/voice/SMS packs * So users don’t have to remember codes or go through confusing `*141# → 1 → 3 → 2` type flows  From a dev perspective, I thought this would be genuinely useful. But in reality, it hasn’t gained the traction I expected.  So I wanted honest feedback from this community:  1. Do you think an app like this is actually useful for Nepali telecom users? 2. If yes, **what features would make it worth keeping installed?**    * Pack comparison between NTC/Ncell    * Smart recommendations based on usage    * Recharge/expiry reminders    * Better UI/UX    * Something else entirely? 3. If no, would you say this problem is already “good enough” with existing carrier/e-payment apps, and I should stop investing time into it?  I’m trying to decide whether to improve this app meaningfully or abandon it and move on.

Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark.

            "heading": "The Sisan Baniya I knew",
            "body": "I've been tempted to write this for a long time.       I was in a relationship with a popular male influencer for a long time. We broke up 2 years ago. During our 3+ year-long relationship, I got to be in his inner circle and hung out with Sisan and gang (and Shrinkhala too, before she went to Harvard). We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective. Just like Shrinkhala shamelessly posted those yellow highlighted Excel Sheets as her proof of innocence which had no third party audit or any verification.|||I have never watched Sisan Baniya, but I didn't feel that he ever portrayed himself as self made or coming from a humble background. He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Yeah, Sisan isn't 'dudh ka dhula' as he shows himself to be, he might be even worse.

And look at this babal store, restaurants and so on within a year or so and that too in very prime area.  That guy is fully loaded.|||Well..

Before he was viral. Even mod a subreddit for his work. And I do understand separating between the art and the artists. This all sounds very true and feels consistent with his person out of his art (videos)  It’s funny to see Sisan’s Simp Boys here, not even ready to listen to a different perspective. And they give such an Incel vibe, hating up on a woman.  I really hope they are all kids who will grow out of this someday and realize how lame they were.

And the way he spoke up about the Miss Nepal funds k k when the hate for her was at an all time high. Personally I have no sympathy or love for Shrinkhala so I am not saying this to defend her.

He seems the most capable guy among all the fkin leaders, including balen and rabi. When he speaks , he always seems calm even when he is provoked, unlike balen. He does not have an ongoing corruption case like that of rabi. He is an engineer who studied at the most prestigious university of our country and also studied at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. he went as a Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar to study water science, policy, and management. This is different from most engineering degrees  because he isn't just an engineer who can build a hydropower or dam. He has knowledge of policies and understands the economics and geopolitics of water—Nepal's most valuable resource. Has worked in developing countries in Africa. Seems like he has some political knowledge. Also, rabi and balen were celebrity figures, but he wasn't and dared to challenge one of the biggest political figures in a less urban or even rural city(dadeldhura). In a time where every nepalese wants to leave the country, a guy from oxford who could have easily left the country, not only staying but wants change in his country, shows bravery and patriotism. He hasn't been in power, so we can't gauge him, but we can gauge him based on what we have seen so far - a calm, educated, brave and exceptionally brilliant young guy, and i would definitely prefer him over any politican i have witnessed so far.|||\"Oxford padheko bhandai ma should be a leader\"  Can see the mindset of OP here.

At first I genuinely thought he was asking for a lift, so I stopped without thinking much. Then he started talking about money. He asked if I had esewa or not. I was confused because in my head I was thinking, why would I charge someone for a lift?  He told me his bike had crashed badly and he urgently needed cash right there on the road. He said he had money in his e-wallet and would send it to me immediately.I believed him. I gave him 1500 in cash. After that he said he’d return it in an hour instead. To make me trust him, he even showed me cash in his hand, maybe around 10k, and said something like, “Why would I scam you just for 1500?” I even told him how important that money was for me college, rent, living alone and all that. He kept saying no worries, reassuring me, talking nicely, making it sound genuine. Now it’s been hours. He’s blocked my number.  I honestly don’t know what I was thinking at that moment. I just thought a fellow Nepali rider was asking for help and I didn’t want to turn my back. For someone living alone, 1500 is a big hit. It’s not just the money, it’s the feeling of being fooled so easily.  Posting this mainly as a warning. If someone asks for urgent cash on the road and promises to pay later, please think twice.

Every now and then,we get a crashing news:(|||Not an expert, but with whatever knowledge I have for following aviation industry, I have some conclusions   1) The plane has almost gone 300m off the runway, if it was a late touchdown and if the Pilots knew it wouldn't stop why didn't they go for a go around, not blaming the pilots but I also think they didn't attempt a go around cause the other side has Indian border and they would have to take a steep left turn and might even enter Indian border, and file new IFR.   2) If the plane had touchdown normally then, as shown in the photos, no flaps extended is seen, either they retracted the flaps early or the flaps weren't extended at all, this suspects for a hydraulic failure.   Adding to the 1st point, it was a layover flight, maybe the intensions of pilot was a quick landing, I am not at all shifting the blame at anyone but it's just my take.

            "body": "Nepal Electricity Authority needed to buy electricity from India to avoid load shedding during winter. When bids were invited, an Indian government company called PTC offered electricity at 6.74 Indian rupees per unit. Hitendra Dev Shakya was a director at that time. He believed the price could be reduced further and asked the company to lower it. Before any final decision was made, there was a political change. Kulman Ghising returned to power and Hitendra was removed from his position. The very next day, the same Indian company suddenly sent a new proposal at a higher rate of 6.95 rupees per unit. This proposal was not even requested by NEA. NEA quickly signed a contract at this higher price to buy 180 megawatts of electricity. Because of the higher rate and extra charges like leakage and wheeling fees, this deal would have cost Nepal more than 40 crores extra. The deal was also signed without proper approval from the Electricity Regulatory Commission. Kulman Ghising later defended the deal in public. He said the old offer had expired and prices were rising fast. He even claimed that waiting longer would push prices up to 10 rupees per unit. However, data from the Indian market showed that electricity prices were actually falling during that period. Later, the court reinstated Hitendra Dev Shakya. After returning, he questioned why NEA was paying more than the original offer. He stopped the expensive agreement and asked for new bids. As a result, another Indian government company offered electricity at 6.60 rupees per unit in December. This was cheaper than both the earlier offers and directly proved that prices were not rising as claimed. By cancelling the costly deal and pushing for a fair price, Hitendra helped prevent a loss of over 40 crores to the country. Whether corruption was involved or not is for investigators to decide, but the financial difference is clear.  (Translated and Simplified version of Narayan Gaule Post)",

            "body": "Last Saturday, a few of us from CodeyatraNP visited Anmol Children Development Home to pull back the curtain on tech and AI.  We skipped the formal lectures and kept things simple—just hands-on demos and honest conversations. The goal wasn’t to teach a full curriculum in an afternoon; it was to show these kids that technology isn't out of reach.  As a student-led initiative, we don't have a big corporate engine behind us. We’re just a group of peers showing up and leading where we can. This reel captures some of the curiosity we saw that day—it’s a small start, but a meaningful one.  If you want to build, learn, or contribute to what we're doing, we’d love to have you.  👉 Join the movement: https://codeyatranp.com/join",

Those points can be exchanged for real prizes like a MacBook Air, iPad Air, Quest 3, Nothing headphones, and more. It is not a competition and there is no cost to join.

He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

Government killed 1000+ youths and they burned down so many buildings. Even media houses for spreading false narrative.   And every time I see this kinda post they always undermine people’s life.   What would you do if your brother or sister were killed in that protest ?  Did you forget those videos of kids being shot??   And I hate this logic of that much destruction and all.  Do not ever compare human life against any short of building.   Building can be recreated or rebuilt. Can you recreate those innocent lives ?? Precedent has to be set that if you ever kill innocent people, consequences are inevitable.   And hate to see people preaching about businesses and job like they care.  Why the fuck import based economy who is fully dependent on remittances talking about job ?  Job in kantipur ? Job in bhatbhateni ?  These are blood sucking insects , Have you checked bhatbhateni business model ? Whole atmadaha in front of BICC was bcuz of bhatbhateni not paying money.

These businesses have been involved in tax evasion, quid pro quo, illegal construction, land grab scams, corruption, and lord knows what else. I actually feel really sad that our public properties and institutions got torched along with millions of documents. Whatever happened shouldn't have happened. It was very unfortunate. But let's not sympathize with these cronies and corrupt politicians. For decades, the real victims have been the everyday citizens of our country. Our Parliament, the Supreme Court, and Singha Durbar getting burned down is a bigger tragedy than some 5-star hotel or supermarket chain. We have been screwed over by these politicians and their business counterparts for so long that on that day, the entire country became a rage room. Extreme events were a result of us getting pushed to the extremes after decades of built-up anger, frustration, and fatally shooting our fellow school and college-going citizens by our own government.|||I think OP forgets the fact that on September 8th ...

And these were live ammunitions... videos of cops giving the middle finger after shooting and terrorising the shops till 9-10 o'clock at night  were circulating .. What happened on September 9th was a reaction to that. Yes heavy damages were done and many anarchists got the chance to create chaos on September 9th.. but only an idiot would compare this event which was completely reactionary .. to the on going protests and acts of violence going on in Bangladesh in the name of religion without any proof .. these acts of violence in Bangladesh is not reactionary .

Most south asian countries are poor and underdeveloped, that shouldnt be where we set the standard for ourselves.|||I think i can perhaps contribute a slightly different perspective here. I don’t think Nepali youth burning down this hotel or Bangladeshi youth burning down/breaking during the uprising in both countries have anything to do with extremism or religion for that matter. When you are going to protest against a bad government, practically I don’t think anyone have religion, race, color or anything of that sort in the back of their mind, the adrenaline is so high you are only focused on one thing.   During protests, when you see protesters burning down or breaking down anything, it is usually because that structure represent something significant. I know a lot of structures were burned, broken because they represented the tyranny under fascism. A significant driver behind Nepali uprising was corruption from what I understand, and I’m pretty sure this hotel was owned/majority stakeholder by some Nepali politicians, if so, then I see them burning a symbol of rampant corruption rather than a hotel.  That’s their perspective I suppose, nonetheless, I think it’s foolish to do things like this, and I’m sure some of them will look back and realize maybe it was foolish.|||You witnessed a freaking big-ass revolution, not some child-play games.

Even from those people who are asking about those incidents now, some were resigning from their political parties, some were posting their dissatisfaction in social media.   And this is a society if you have civic sense doesn't mean everyone has. Some people will always try to find a way to vandalize and that day it was a great opportunity for them because the state was without a government and no chain of commands.

            "body": "It’s 2026 now, and we’re still having to deal with this.  A few days ago, early in the morning, I was on the street and saw a public bus with people literally hanging from the door. It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this. This issue really needs more attention and more noise.|||KTM has enough budget with 40 percent going unused. these transportation comes under metropolitan ko authority. ask Mayor balen.

Here is one story of his conversation with his nephew Naresh Koirala.   *Naresh himself had been puzzled by his uncle’s decision to accept the result. On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP.

Economy should be of utmost priority. Unrealistic speeches for public attention should be stopped from very beginning. Private sector should be let to invest and create jobs, while government regulates effectively.  Also, they should be very wise while speaking about international relations. Oli had smothered our relation with India and that needs fixing too. We've seen with Ukraine what happens when populist politics and bad relation with neighbor does to a country.   Good luck, our last hope ; lets go and win the elections.",

He can't be silent now.|||I'll start questioning myself : Is Balen above RSP's party constitution? no primary needed for PM candidate while there's primary for MP candidates?|||If I wanted to worship my leaders I would support a king, not vote in election.    I will vote for them, but also question on their actions.|||So does that mean RSP now has two leaders, or what?|||I really hope for the sake of our nation that this partnership is not fragile and doesn't change to the \"2.5 years PM for each model\" that Prachanda and Oli had.|||I have really liked how Balen has handled himself after the Gen Z protests. Rabi was obviously playing the long game, but Balen is also in it for the long run. If the RSP wins the election and Balen becomes PM, it could be a fresh start for the country. This is arguably the best outcome among all possible scenarios. The old political leaders will do everything in their power to silence RSP, but the main goal should be ensuring a fair election and the highest voter turnout possible. The youth need to go out and vote. It’s now or never.|||[removed]|||[removed]|||kulman lai dhoka bho|||My biggest disappointment is they all preach as anti establishment. But they can't still come together to show an alternative path. Untill now, we should see me news like this. Shows how most of them are driven primarily by personal ambitions.

When partners don’t witness the birth of their child or see the physical and emotional pain a mother goes through, it’s hard for them to truly understand how difficult motherhood really is. Seeing it firsthand creates empathy, respect, and a deeper appreciation for what women endure to bring a life into this world.  Maybe this is one way men can finally begin to understand a woman’s journey to motherhood. Unlike our parents’ and grandparents’ generation, societal change has to start somewhere and this feels like an important step forward.",

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.  I (21M) and my sibling (15F) are taking care of our parents during the day and our cousins help at night. Because of this, we’ve missed months of classes but we don’t really have a choice right now.  If anyone is able to help even a small amount, it would mean a lot to us.  I’ve verified the case with two of the mods and I’ll be posting medical reports in the comments as well.  Please DM or comment if you can help in any way. Even sharing this post would really help.",

            "body": "**Disclaimer** : this is not an Ad. I have been using menstrual cups for around 8 years and have recommended it to many women in my life. All have loved it and have made the switch from pads/tampons. So i decided to spread the word here.   **Tldr**: Menstrual cups will change your life. it will give you much more freedom and flexibility than period products like pads or tampons.   First of all, what is a Menstrual cup?   A menstrual cup is a reusable, flexible silicone cup inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual fluid. It can be worn up to 12 hours and can be used for several years with proper care.   I have made a list of pro and cons that i have faced in these years. You are welcome to ask more questions. I will answer as many as i can. Serious questions only please!   **PRO**:   1. To start with the basics, menstrual flow is more than just liquid blood. it has many semi-solid/solid things like mucus and blood vessels. So a pad or tampons just cannot ‘absorb’ them. these things just lay there on the surface making you feel slimy and uncomfortable. Instead the cup ‘collects’ it so it doesn’t have this issue.  2. You dont have to worry about a pad shifting from its place. you know the feeling, when the pad is too far back or too far on one side. Also, you dont feel the blood flow ‘out’ like when you laugh or sneeze or stand up. Menstrual cup catches the blood before it gets out.  3. Its an upfront investment but one that will be much cheaper in the long run. You wont have to cash out hundreds of rupees each month on period products.  4. Its better for the environment as it creates little to no waste.  5. Its better when you are out, for example, at other people’s place. you dont have to worry about where to dump your used period products.  6. You dont feel it at all once its inside. you can just live your normal day and forget about it. then only at the end of the day you empty, clean and put it back on. (if its a heavy flow day then i empty it once in the middle of the day too)  7. No issues with friction / rashes on the inner thighs.   **CON** :   1. It has a slightly steep learning curve. I know a lot of people have anxiety of putting it in and getting it out. i did too. but once you have done it a couple of times, you will get a hang of it. There are many tutorials available online for this. I personally fold the cup in a C shape and put it in and then to be sure its secure, I check for suction by pulling/rotating it a bit. Getting it out can feel a bit scary at first. When getting it out, i hold the cup on its body and not just the tip to be sure that the tip doesn’t break. But like i said, once you have done it a few times, it will feel normal.  2. I find it most comfortable to empty the cup in a toilet that has a basin inside it. so I can empty it in the basin, clean the cup and put it in again. it can be done in a toilet stall (without basin) too but you have to be a bit more careful and you will need some tissues to clean the blood off your hands before coming out of the stall.  3. it requires a bit of investment in the beginning even to try (but it will pay off long term if it works out)  4. It can leak, very rarely but sometimes. The leakage is usually minimal so for this, you can use something light like panty liners or period panties. You can try out your options here.   **Recommendations**:   1. When first trying it out, you can try it for a couple of hours at a time when you are not having heavy flow and when you are staying home. This way you will also have an idea of how much blood comes out (spoiler alert: its much less than what you would expect) and how frequently you need to empty the cup.  2. always clean your hands with soap before and after putting/removing the cup.  3. hold the cup by its body (base of the cup) and not just its tip when pulling it out.  4. There are a lot of tutorials, feedback, helpful materials available online. Please be brave and give it a try. you will thank me later :)  —————————————————————————-  **Edit 1**: some people are asking about which brands to use. If someone is a new user of Menstrual cups, could you please let us know about your experience with it and which brand you are using?",

Kulman was getting a lot of hate even here, let's not even talk about Balen. I wake up, and there's half a million likes on this simple photo without any details . Now everyone is fully behind Balen as the PM while Rabi will be the party man .. it's a great thing , probably the best news to come out for our contry in a while but I fear people will turn on them sooner than later. Single man, single constituency Ra executive elections and legislative elections are very different things, to run an organisation of over half a million supporters is a HUGE HUGE task . People didn't even look at what terms they agreed on .. no policies no vision just the news that they came together was enough and it will more than likely be enough to win the elections but the real problems will come after that. People who are with them are also Nepali people , the same people who were once close to the old parties , not all but most of them. And they will have their flaws , there will be problems related to distribution of power but all this comes in the later phases when there will be many winners and many leaders . I just hope Rabi becomes more grounded in terms of his promises and Balen starts interacting with the public and media .. sadhai Facebook ma status matra halera ta hudaina these people will make fake news and assumptions because He doesn't ever talk to the media and provide regular press releases . Citizens of Nepal, please support whoever you want to support but support them for thier vision and policies not for their fiery speeches and just because they are against Congress UMl and Maoists . Hold them accountable, do not start worshipping them and start hating anyone who questions them .. questions keep democracy alive. Anyone who can't answer the questions will turn into a dictator sooner or later. Craze will be enough to win the elections, not run the country.",

He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

Most of the teachers in school and college all of the are pedophiles.|||I'm not aware of the definition - is it like somebody who's grooming girls under 18? Are you using the term loosely?  It's an individual-thing and not a profession-thing. Girls sending DMs to get referred (when they have no skills) is also more common than you think. I get many DMs asking for free help (refactors)/ referrals (barely know them/ barely seen their code) and I just ignore them. I help many people (m/f) on a daily basis, and I've never met most of them. I know many of my 'male' senior friends (no female senior dev friends) do the same.  You should clear your exams first. Last bullet point sounds like a good plan.  Most people here will be happy to review 1-2 projects for free. I'll jump in if it's Python/ Next.js/ ML. Just post your github repo on some relevant community and they'll do free reviews.   Edit: I dont do free mentorships, happy to review repos/ coding practices.|||In my experience, Girls seem to help girl only when they are on some “female tech organization” and it’s rarely a technical mentorship. They should be helpful without such aids too. I am sorry that you had to deal with these. that’s extremely disgusting.

It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||[https://sip-club-webier.vercel.app/](https://sip-club-webier.vercel.app/)  Bro yettiko website with cms, bina problem kaam garney AI le banau ani manum la bro ko kura.|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||Skill issue.

Don't get me wrong - vibe coding and low code/no code methods are getting popular with some LLM coders (Claude, Gemini) becoming absolute beasts, but, the real need of a human is in problem solving and building scalable systems. My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.  The problem is people jumping on the bandwagon which is creating a terrible environment for business owners, recruiters and stakeholders.  I hope you do well in your career my friend. Let's all stay hopeful about the future. We have a long way to go before judgement day arrives and they finally take over.",

She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

            "body": "I've been tempted to write this for a long time.       I was in a relationship with a popular male influencer for a long time. We broke up 2 years ago. During our 3+ year-long relationship, I got to be in his inner circle and hung out with Sisan and gang (and Shrinkhala too, before she went to Harvard). We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective. Just like Shrinkhala shamelessly posted those yellow highlighted Excel Sheets as her proof of innocence which had no third party audit or any verification.|||I have never watched Sisan Baniya, but I didn't feel that he ever portrayed himself as self made or coming from a humble background. He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Yeah, Sisan isn't 'dudh ka dhula' as he shows himself to be, he might be even worse.

This all sounds very true and feels consistent with his person out of his art (videos)  It’s funny to see Sisan’s Simp Boys here, not even ready to listen to a different perspective. And they give such an Incel vibe, hating up on a woman.  I really hope they are all kids who will grow out of this someday and realize how lame they were.

I also worked and hung out with and around Sisan Shrinkhala a lot.

And the way he spoke up about the Miss Nepal funds k k when the hate for her was at an all time high. Personally I have no sympathy or love for Shrinkhala so I am not saying this to defend her.

He seems the most capable guy among all the fkin leaders, including balen and rabi. When he speaks , he always seems calm even when he is provoked, unlike balen. He does not have an ongoing corruption case like that of rabi. He is an engineer who studied at the most prestigious university of our country and also studied at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. he went as a Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar to study water science, policy, and management. This is different from most engineering degrees  because he isn't just an engineer who can build a hydropower or dam. He has knowledge of policies and understands the economics and geopolitics of water—Nepal's most valuable resource. Has worked in developing countries in Africa. Seems like he has some political knowledge. Also, rabi and balen were celebrity figures, but he wasn't and dared to challenge one of the biggest political figures in a less urban or even rural city(dadeldhura). In a time where every nepalese wants to leave the country, a guy from oxford who could have easily left the country, not only staying but wants change in his country, shows bravery and patriotism. He hasn't been in power, so we can't gauge him, but we can gauge him based on what we have seen so far - a calm, educated, brave and exceptionally brilliant young guy, and i would definitely prefer him over any politican i have witnessed so far.|||\"Oxford padheko bhandai ma should be a leader\"  Can see the mindset of OP here.

We skipped the formal lectures and kept things simple—just hands-on demos and honest conversations. The goal wasn’t to teach a full curriculum in an afternoon; it was to show these kids that technology isn't out of reach.  As a student-led initiative, we don't have a big corporate engine behind us. We’re just a group of peers showing up and leading where we can. This reel captures some of the curiosity we saw that day—it’s a small start, but a meaningful one.

I struggle to fit in with my friends, put forward my opinion in mass with fear of idk what prolly judgement. This wouldnt be problem to me if i were like this in the past.

            "body": "This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

I don’t think Nepali youth burning down this hotel or Bangladeshi youth burning down/breaking during the uprising in both countries have anything to do with extremism or religion for that matter. When you are going to protest against a bad government, practically I don’t think anyone have religion, race, color or anything of that sort in the back of their mind, the adrenaline is so high you are only focused on one thing.   During protests, when you see protesters burning down or breaking down anything, it is usually because that structure represent something significant. I know a lot of structures were burned, broken because they represented the tyranny under fascism. A significant driver behind Nepali uprising was corruption from what I understand, and I’m pretty sure this hotel was owned/majority stakeholder by some Nepali politicians, if so, then I see them burning a symbol of rampant corruption rather than a hotel.  That’s their perspective I suppose, nonetheless, I think it’s foolish to do things like this, and I’m sure some of them will look back and realize maybe it was foolish.|||You witnessed a freaking big-ass revolution, not some child-play games.

It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

This problem needs to be adressed and public transportation should be well organized and planned.|||Finally, someone spoke about this. This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this. This issue really needs more attention and more noise.|||KTM has enough budget with 40 percent going unused. these transportation comes under metropolitan ko authority. ask Mayor balen.

At the moment, i would suggest you to keep doing your jobs and garnering your skills so you land up one job with a handsome pay. Good luck.|||dude you're just like me, but 10 years ago. i've been exactly where you are and it sucks ass. i had to maintain multiple jobs because none would pay on time, and i had to support my parents and two siblings. so when i say i know what you're going through, i mean it. and as much i appreciate people being nice here, no one (except for one) is trying to help you navigate this shituation.  the one thing that you need more of isn't money or opportunities, its time. **you need more time**. more time for proper sleep, more time to gather your thoughts, more time to pause and evaluate your current situation, more time to plan out the next few months. you're like a engine that's constantly running 24/7, and you haven't had the chance to rest for a single moment, and it sucks soooo much because as much as you want to stop, you just can't. its all on you, everything depends on you, and you have to keep moving, or else everything will fall apart. and this will only end one way, and its not good dude.  thats why you have to take your time back. you need at least 2 more hours of sleep (sleeping an hour early and waking up 30 minutes late). at least 1 hour of free time to plan your next steps. you weekends need to be for yourself, and yourself alone. whatever precious time you have, you keep it and don't let anyone or anything take it from you.   if you have college every morning, talk with the administration and ask them to let you check-in an hour late - explain your situation, tell them that you have no other option; this worked for me, and will work for you.  if you have small spare time where its not too long to start working but not too short to just sit around (like 25-40 minutes of downtime), just get to the next task/next job. baru duita day shifts ko bich ma kei downtime hunai nadeu. inform your office you'll arrive early and leave early. explain that you have a tight schedule and you don't want to waste your time. companies will try to make up some nonsense about proper timing and all that bullshit but don't let them bully you to submission. ask them to understand your situation, and make up shit like you also study and go to college everyday and do your assignments daily because you're a weak student, and normally don't get enough sleep because of that, so instead of just wasting time after college, you just come to work early - you know, make it sappy if that helps. but whatever you say, make sure that they let you leave early. take back your time.  if this helps you gather even 1-2 hours extra everyday, thats the time you can invest on yourself now. if you can get home by 5pm instead of 6:30pm, thats around 3 hours before your night shift starts. you can use that time to either plan your next move. work on your portfolio. add things to your showreels that you wish you could but weren't allowed to. talk with your parents about what you're going through and ask them to help you with planning for the future. like the other user said, actually start tracking all your expenses and see where all your money is going. excel is free in the browser, and you can search for \"excel free budget templates\". categorize all your expenses and see where the money is being wasted. do you smoke regularly? are your lunches expensive? is your electricity bill too high? not a single rupee goes untracked. you need every penny to be accounted for. if there's an unnecessary expense, cut it out completely. the more you can save, the easier it will be for you.  you can also request your night shift company to let you start early, and end early. sounds like it's a remote job, so your reasoning could be that you're already free by 6pm, and instead of waiting around, you'd like to start early when you're still feeling energized and not drained of energy by 3 in the morning. you can give your work report by 12 midnight and go to sleep 30 minutes early, even.  if you travel by bus or micros, take that time to complete errands that can be done via your phone. create a checklist for what you need to do before you can apply for better jobs. look for potential companies that have a good company culture (normally has better pay too). connect with past colleagues online just to say hi (this one might feel weird at first but its better to say hi how are you rather than hi do you have a job in your company). update your expense tracking sheet. look for templates and plugins that can help your portfolio be better than the rest.  spend every single free minute to get yourself on a better situation.  you're drowning every hour every day, but you're taking the first step towards pulling yourself out. it's going to be difficult the next few months and you may feel more drained than ever, but if you do all these for yourself, you'll be in a much better mental state in the next couple of months. here's to hoping that you update us in a few months that you got a job that pays as much as all three jobs combined 🤞  all the best. do yourself proud.|||On person told me, rather focusing making money from 2-3 small jobs.

Everything will be same but you will be different  Try meditating, clearing your mind. Once you have a clear mind you can think.  The more you panic, the more it gets worse. Thinking about the future and trying to make life better is good but when you over think the same thing over and over, that thought is what making you demotivated not the situation. If you can’t change the situation, don’t over think it.  I know its hard, but don’t loose the hope.  Stay calm, plan and proceed and will be a matter of time you see the changes.  It is a process not an immediate action. At the end its you and I know someone who is handling everything as you said can do lot better in life. Don’t forget, Some people dream to be in your place. Be positive. You got this.|||I hear you can make more with pathao or similar ride services as a rider.|||Keep the hustle going.

If you have any debts, create a small, steady repayment plan so they don’t keep snowballing.      Separate essential and non-essential expenses, even small adjustments can make a difference. And try to save at least a tiny amount each month. Even a symbolic sum gives a bit of control and stability.      Look at how much free time you have outside of work and try to set aside a small, consistent window to learn skills that are in demand. Little steps add up and can help you increase your income over time.      I’ve been in a similar situation myself, and I know how heavy it can feel. But it is possible to climb out of it slowly, with small steady actions. You’re already doing an incredible amount, don’t be too hard on yourself.

If an attack occurs, our country’s stability can derail overnight and Western media and racists in west love to make fun of \"third world countries\" to feel superior regardless of fact that they have been through worse.

I also like his idea of democratic socialism in the Nepali context, although I don't think it would work as intended.|||I have been reading his autobiography recently and what a great man he was. The clarity of thoughts he had was simply incredible.   I have read and heard a lot about India's freedom fighters, leaders and their ideologies and life but as a nepali, I feel ashamed that I didn't know much about this great man.    Just ask any Indian and they  literally celebrate Nehru, ghandi, Ambedkar as national heroes for their contributions to their freedom but it kinda feels like BP koirala has been sidelined by our own history.I could be wrong here as this is just me assuming anecdotally but we gotta give this man much more credit for his contributions to our country.|||One of the greatest political / social heroes of the world...

The problem of course for Mahendra was that Nepali Congress had two thirds majority in Parliament and he always believed with that much majority the monarchy itself was threatened.   I have also read some articles where it is said that Mahendra actually borrowed some of BP's policies like land reform policies among others. Mahendra died too soon as well.|||I love him cause Mero khandan ko hoo|||This man literally had ability to explain anything in writing so well that the reader can visualise the exact scene.|||Dude has great aura, must have caused a great deal of insecurity in the kings heart|||A great leader.

Ironic that when he came into power it would be that King’s son who would oust him. Nepal would be far better country if his prime ministership wasnt stripped from him. Congress failed him and to that extent the people as well.|||Prolific writer.|||i don't know never met him|||Quakey budo|||Every country when it goes through a transformation needs an iron willed leader who has a vision not for development but for understanding structures of power and realizing institutions which uphold the political interests of the party and the government.

Even though his contribution in politics is enough biased among people. You can't debate on his literature work.  He was among the best not only of Nepal but of world.  If you haven't read any of his books yet, do it otherwise you are missing out something.|||I really like him as a writer..|||Indian agent|||He was hope of Nepal Destroyed By King Mahendra on 2017 BS Poush 1 Official Black Day On Nepali History|||S tier leader.    Stood for political, social and economic justice throughout his life and didn't compromise for anything.    He took most of the responsibility and he did make mistakes (and he has accepted them gracefully in is biography).      You see, the problem with our generation is we read too less to judge a person and almost fail to account the then social and political scenario of the country. So, my suggestion would be you read yourself and don't judge him based on my opinion or other few incidents or stories mentioned in the comments.   Personally, He gave me the definition of democracy. Here is one story of his conversation with his nephew Naresh Koirala.   *Naresh himself had been puzzled by his uncle’s decision to accept the result. On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP. Mahendra and Birendra believed themselves to be the savior of common \"*naive\"* Nepali.    While BP simply believed that Nepali people irrespective of their education, culture, caste, religion, sex or whatsoever are capable to choose their leaders themselves and make them responsible.|||One of the greatest writers, Nepal has ever produced.|||This guy high moral values unlike present  Congress. I hate how Congress take BPs name and have not learned shit from him.

Economy should be of utmost priority. Unrealistic speeches for public attention should be stopped from very beginning. Private sector should be let to invest and create jobs, while government regulates effectively.  Also, they should be very wise while speaking about international relations. Oli had smothered our relation with India and that needs fixing too. We've seen with Ukraine what happens when populist politics and bad relation with neighbor does to a country.

            "body": "As it says, I recently got this and was hoping for some help, especially on the markings. There isn’t a ton of info on these in English so I figured I’d do to the source. My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6. This is probably the longest shot of them all, but any ideas what species of critter might have eaten up the stock at one point? I put a picture of it on picture 2, I was thinking some type of termite or wood worm.",

During the Rana regime (1846–1951), gun manufacturing in Nepal was driven largely by the innovative efforts of Gehendra Shumsher, the eldest son of Prime Minister Bir Shumsher, who is widely regarded as Nepal's first scientist and modernizer of the military.   Key Manufacturing Factories  The Ranas established several sites for arms and ammunition production, primarily centered in the Kathmandu Valley and some regional hubs:   Nakkhu (Lalitpur): Notable for producing copies of the Martini-Henry rifle, specifically the \"De-Rifle\" in the late 1880s.  Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.  Jangi Megjin: Originally founded in 1793, it continued to function during the Rana period as a government foundry for manufacturing cannons and military equipment.|||You need someone from the Hanuman Dhoka Museum in Kathmandu.

It just means that rather than keeping a person in prison while waiting for their trial (so they don't escape), they are set free for the time being.

If they run away, the court keeps the cash and sends the police to find them.

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.

            "body": "**Disclaimer** : this is not an Ad. I have been using menstrual cups for around 8 years and have recommended it to many women in my life. All have loved it and have made the switch from pads/tampons. So i decided to spread the word here.   **Tldr**: Menstrual cups will change your life. it will give you much more freedom and flexibility than period products like pads or tampons.   First of all, what is a Menstrual cup?   A menstrual cup is a reusable, flexible silicone cup inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual fluid. It can be worn up to 12 hours and can be used for several years with proper care.   I have made a list of pro and cons that i have faced in these years. You are welcome to ask more questions. I will answer as many as i can. Serious questions only please!   **PRO**:   1. To start with the basics, menstrual flow is more than just liquid blood. it has many semi-solid/solid things like mucus and blood vessels. So a pad or tampons just cannot ‘absorb’ them. these things just lay there on the surface making you feel slimy and uncomfortable. Instead the cup ‘collects’ it so it doesn’t have this issue.  2. You dont have to worry about a pad shifting from its place. you know the feeling, when the pad is too far back or too far on one side. Also, you dont feel the blood flow ‘out’ like when you laugh or sneeze or stand up. Menstrual cup catches the blood before it gets out.  3. Its an upfront investment but one that will be much cheaper in the long run. You wont have to cash out hundreds of rupees each month on period products.  4. Its better for the environment as it creates little to no waste.  5. Its better when you are out, for example, at other people’s place. you dont have to worry about where to dump your used period products.  6. You dont feel it at all once its inside. you can just live your normal day and forget about it. then only at the end of the day you empty, clean and put it back on. (if its a heavy flow day then i empty it once in the middle of the day too)  7. No issues with friction / rashes on the inner thighs.   **CON** :   1. It has a slightly steep learning curve. I know a lot of people have anxiety of putting it in and getting it out. i did too. but once you have done it a couple of times, you will get a hang of it. There are many tutorials available online for this. I personally fold the cup in a C shape and put it in and then to be sure its secure, I check for suction by pulling/rotating it a bit. Getting it out can feel a bit scary at first. When getting it out, i hold the cup on its body and not just the tip to be sure that the tip doesn’t break. But like i said, once you have done it a few times, it will feel normal.  2. I find it most comfortable to empty the cup in a toilet that has a basin inside it. so I can empty it in the basin, clean the cup and put it in again. it can be done in a toilet stall (without basin) too but you have to be a bit more careful and you will need some tissues to clean the blood off your hands before coming out of the stall.  3. it requires a bit of investment in the beginning even to try (but it will pay off long term if it works out)  4. It can leak, very rarely but sometimes. The leakage is usually minimal so for this, you can use something light like panty liners or period panties. You can try out your options here.   **Recommendations**:   1. When first trying it out, you can try it for a couple of hours at a time when you are not having heavy flow and when you are staying home. This way you will also have an idea of how much blood comes out (spoiler alert: its much less than what you would expect) and how frequently you need to empty the cup.  2. always clean your hands with soap before and after putting/removing the cup.  3. hold the cup by its body (base of the cup) and not just its tip when pulling it out.  4. There are a lot of tutorials, feedback, helpful materials available online. Please be brave and give it a try. you will thank me later :)  —————————————————————————-  **Edit 1**: some people are asking about which brands to use. If someone is a new user of Menstrual cups, could you please let us know about your experience with it and which brand you are using?",

Not Rabi , nor Balen ever said anything negative about working together but the public basically was going crazy why they weren't coming to agreements. Kulman was getting a lot of hate even here, let's not even talk about Balen. I wake up, and there's half a million likes on this simple photo without any details . Now everyone is fully behind Balen as the PM while Rabi will be the party man .. it's a great thing , probably the best news to come out for our contry in a while but I fear people will turn on them sooner than later. Single man, single constituency Ra executive elections and legislative elections are very different things, to run an organisation of over half a million supporters is a HUGE HUGE task . People didn't even look at what terms they agreed on .. no policies no vision just the news that they came together was enough and it will more than likely be enough to win the elections but the real problems will come after that. People who are with them are also Nepali people , the same people who were once close to the old parties , not all but most of them. And they will have their flaws , there will be problems related to distribution of power but all this comes in the later phases when there will be many winners and many leaders . I just hope Rabi becomes more grounded in terms of his promises and Balen starts interacting with the public and media .. sadhai Facebook ma status matra halera ta hudaina these people will make fake news and assumptions because He doesn't ever talk to the media and provide regular press releases . Citizens of Nepal, please support whoever you want to support but support them for thier vision and policies not for their fiery speeches and just because they are against Congress UMl and Maoists . Hold them accountable, do not start worshipping them and start hating anyone who questions them .. questions keep democracy alive. Anyone who can't answer the questions will turn into a dictator sooner or later. Craze will be enough to win the elections, not run the country.",

Not only that, it would be great if we became able to create tram lines and bring trams starting from ktm, then based on this - internal, closed and nearby routes can use that line and longer travel utilize bus line.|||Someone doing government's job btw|||Salute to the creator Subham Subedhi. Esto kaam ekdum kam huncha hamro desh ma|||Kudos to subham vai. I remember when he talked about doing this in his free time.|||This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

Most of the teachers in school and college all of the are pedophiles.|||I'm not aware of the definition - is it like somebody who's grooming girls under 18? Are you using the term loosely?  It's an individual-thing and not a profession-thing. Girls sending DMs to get referred (when they have no skills) is also more common than you think. I get many DMs asking for free help (refactors)/ referrals (barely know them/ barely seen their code) and I just ignore them. I help many people (m/f) on a daily basis, and I've never met most of them. I know many of my 'male' senior friends (no female senior dev friends) do the same.  You should clear your exams first. Last bullet point sounds like a good plan.  Most people here will be happy to review 1-2 projects for free. I'll jump in if it's Python/ Next.js/ ML. Just post your github repo on some relevant community and they'll do free reviews.   Edit: I dont do free mentorships, happy to review repos/ coding practices.|||In my experience, Girls seem to help girl only when they are on some “female tech organization” and it’s rarely a technical mentorship. They should be helpful without such aids too. I am sorry that you had to deal with these. that’s extremely disgusting.  Still there are bunch of female led tech groups - they have ties with it company - approach them.|||I get what you r saying but the term pedo applies to people who r way older and trying to groom n trap minors (under 18). The person u r referring r called blackmailers or gooners (in current terms i think)|||Other side - back in Nepal I used to work for a compant that paid well and had better reputation. A young girl in her early 20s reached out to me for a referall for associate engineer. I hesitated a bit seeing her technical knowledge. She offered sex plus 1 months of her salary if I referred and she got hired. Was a weird encounter. I am still not sure if she qas serious or not. But I immediately got off connection.|||Dark side is on both side ! If male posted this not a single person would have asked i have connection i can refer vanera !! Sorry you had to go through that.

I left my job after a year because of a toxic culture. I swear, I couldn't find a position (I was even applying for internships) at any tech company in Kathmandu. I thought it wouldn't be that difficult since I have decent projects and a year of experience, but I remain jobless for next three months. It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

            "body": "I’ve been holding this inside for a long time, and I just want to let it out.  I wasn’t a “smart kid” in school. I never understood things as fast as my friends did. I struggled even to read a paragraph and find the right answer, even in class 10. I used to feel dumb every single day. Some of my friends got things so quickly, but I didn’t. I still feel cringe thinking about it.  I also had tics. I don’t know if it was Tourette’s or something else, because I never checked. When I get excited or angry, my eyes blink hard and my back twists. It was embarrassing, and it distracted me so much in school. I used to wish I could just be “normal.”  But after my S.E.E., something changed. That 3-month break gave me a new life. I had my “aha” moment. Somehow, I finally started understanding things. Maybe it was the silence, maybe it was being away from all the noise, maybe it was just loneliness giving me space to think. But everything shifted.  I taught myself how to code. I got a job as a software developer. I didn’t finish my degree because my college wouldn’t let me work while studying, so I said “forget it” and focused on work. It was well paid, and nobody asked for a degree anyway. So yeah, I’m a dropout who made it this far.  I’m still not “super smart,” but I’m definitely smarter than the version of me back then. I still have tics, they still distract me sometimes, but I’m living with it.  I just needed to get this off my chest. I’ve kept it inside for too long.  **And to anyone reading this who feels like they’re slow, or not smart, or different:**   I hope you find your moment too. I hope you realize that you’re not broken. Sometimes loneliness or silence gives you a new life. You grow in ways you don’t even notice at first. You don’t have to be a genius to make it. You just have to keep going. If I can do it, anyone can.  Stay strong. You’ll get your moment too.      ***Note: Yes, I did use ChatGPT to improve this text, mainly to fix grammar mistakes. I hope that’s alright.***",

We normally don’t jump into public threads, but after reading this post and the comments, we felt it was important to share our side honestly and respectfully.  First, we want to say this clearly: we’re not here to fight anyone or deny their feelings. If someone feels disappointed, that matters. At the same time, one side of the story doesn’t always show the full picture.  1. Not all students are the same Every batch has students with very different abilities, discipline levels, and learning speeds. Some push themselves hard and grow fast. Some struggle, skip practice, or expect results without consistent effort. That difference affects outcomes, and it’s something no institute can fully control.  2. Many students come from very weak foundations A lot of students who join us come from backgrounds where code is still taught by writing it on the board, not by actually building things. No real tools, no projects, no industry exposure. They don’t come job-ready. They come to become job-ready. And despite these gaps, we genuinely try our best to upgrade them, change how they think about learning, and push them toward practical skills. On top of that, we take responsibility by providing guaranteed internship opportunities so they at least get real-world exposure.  3. Internships are where most people get stuck in Nepal The harsh truth is this: a huge number of IT graduates in Nepal never get an internship at all. Without that first step, they never discover what they’re capable of. Many eventually give up, leave the field, or leave the country believing Nepal has no scope. We may not be perfect, but if we can at least help someone start, that matters to us.  4. We are transparent from day one Before anyone joins Mindrisers, we explain things clearly, how the course works, what’s expected from the student, how internships are handled, everything. We use written agreements so there’s no confusion later. If, despite that, posts like this come up, all we can do is stay honest and let time speak. We truly believe karma catches up to both good and bad intentions.  We’re still learning. We’re still improving. And we’re open to real feedback. But please understand, we’re not here to scam, exploit, or sell fake dreams. We’re trying to do something meaningful in a system that already has many problems.  Thanks to everyone who took time to read this. Team Mindrisers",

So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.

Don't get me wrong - vibe coding and low code/no code methods are getting popular with some LLM coders (Claude, Gemini) becoming absolute beasts, but, the real need of a human is in problem solving and building scalable systems. My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.  The problem is people jumping on the bandwagon which is creating a terrible environment for business owners, recruiters and stakeholders.  I hope you do well in your career my friend. Let's all stay hopeful about the future. We have a long way to go before judgement day arrives and they finally take over.",

Kehi galat nagaresi..  Also uhako math book ta padhekai ho|||You are expecting research contributions from him? But have you done a research about him? His books have changed the entire learning journey of school level mathematics in Nepal. That even for decades. His name used to be in every student's tongue. I am no genius in mathematics but I use it in my daily work (ML stuff) and if I have to give some credits for my skills in applying math, I can give his name. And you know what was it like back then when he started writing first book? There was literally no internet, he collected past question papers and had from like 2065. And he even categorized questions, contents based on level like basic, intermediate, advanced and so on. And he even used to add the most prominent mathematician in each chapter. That I even consider a some form of research. Not every research has to wear a PhD hat. So for me, I consider his contributions in mathematics to be highest in Nepal.   But I do not know what goes inside his head and now his fourth masters? This I find weird. May be he should have done PhD and finally become a correct Dr.?|||Stop the hate.

Why is it that other communities are literally filled with intellectual posts but here, we have people like you berating the work of others. You're getting downvoted for a reason. That's the general consensus.  \"What has he done to contribute for mathematics?\" His books are influential. He's an educator not a researcher. Probably a faculty at KU or some place.   That makes me curious. Are you \\*sponsoring\\* him to do research? \\*Why\\* does \\*he\\* have to contribute? Are you trying to prove he's inferior to you somehow? What's the bloody point.  Yashavant Kanetkar is a common name - his books are barely technical. But you'll find many many people who started out with his books. You can hate all you want; doesn't change a thing.  People pursue multiple degrees for many reasons. I plan on getting several. PhD isn't interesting to everybody. Literally anybody can publish papers. I've seen folks in PhD programs who've made me question the bar in Science.  If you think about it, you can do more contribution as an entrepreneur. Or by relocating to a remote village and educating kids. There's a book called 80000 hours that breaks this down. I'm sure it's free shipping. Look into it.  I care more about earning than the number of papers I publish. Or having a PhD to my name. I care more about what makes me happy. The last thing on my mind is what you'd think of it.

            "body": "I’ve been thinking about this for a while. It feels like in Nepal, we have tons of programmers and tech talent, people who can build apps, websites, AI stuff, you name it. But when it comes to GTM, growth, marketing, or just figuring out how to actually sell and scale a product… there’s a huge gap.  Most startups here are run by tech engineers, and naturally, the focus is on building the product perfectly. That’s great, but then things like growth strategy, customer acquisition, positioning, and distribution get ignored. People just assume if you build it, users will come. Spoiler: they don’t.  Most of the startups here in Nepal fail less because the product is bad, but instead because the distribution/game-plan is weak.   Here in Nepal, GTM skills aren’t really taught, nor are they considered “cool” compared to coding. Most people in IT industrychase programming jobs, freelancing gigs, or outsourcing contracts because that’s a safer bet financially.  I think this is actually a huge opportunity. Someone who can master GTM skis here like: user research, acquisition channels, funnel optimization, sales psychology could easily dominate the startup scene.   Instead of just learning yet another JS framework, you should also learn GTM skills.   What do you guys think?",

Look at Indonesia it follows Sufism mixed with agakhani sect do we hear minorities being treated badly? No. Mostly it's the south Asian Muslims who are radical because they follow a very strict islam of deubandi and wahabism school of thought which has caused problem historically it's moderate example would be creation of Taliban and extreme example is creation of Pakztan. Now contrary to that you've Indonesia which is also a majority Muslim nation but follows Sufism school of thought which is why they are much more liberal. They're okay with currency having Ganesha, okay with garuda being national symbol(coat of arms), and even okay with naming kids from Sanskrit derived names like majority of their head of the states have Sanskrit origin names there will be some ups and downs in writing because Indonesia didn't follow devanagari it followed the Brahmi script earlier, in that way it's still preserving the culture. But if you tell this to a MUSLIM.from south Asia he will say it's shirk/haram in islam and that being associated with polytheism is bad and that they are a lost tribe of Turks and Arabs who had invaded our land. So, wahabism and Deubandi unless remained will not allow for inclusivity among the people islam factor will be there no matter what|||Can't decide which is the worst religion - Islam or Hinduism.

You set the mood, locked the door from outside and paid the electricity bill while that randi was getting railed on your own pillow.

What is wrong is wrong, I dunno what the procedure for BSF to enter each other countries is, with the open border and all, but I'm sure they are only able to enter after some permission from each other's authorities. If that is not the case here, then it's wrong and us Indians should accept that. 3. Nepal is a beautiful country. People have more civic sense and overall better sense of community and cohesion from what I have seen.  4. What Nepali people have to understand is India is a big country 1.4 billion people is a lot. So, of all the counties in the world, India is probably the only one you should never generalize. 6. Both Nepali and Indian people can have good relationship with each other, just learn to talk properly and not take things to ego. 6. Yes, India is a bigger economy, and has more resources, but it is not in competition with Nepal. Nepal has it's own strengths that it should not forget.  7. Open border has it's pros and cons. Yes, many Nepali are in India, do they get to build a life, yes. Do they get discriminated, yes, and so are Indians from other states. And Nepali also discriminate against Indian tourists and workers. 8. Always remember, most average Indians will probably only have good will towards Nepal and no hate.  9. It is very important that rather than spreading unnecessary generalized hate, we judge people on individual basis.

            "body": "Yesterday I posted about how I felt like a Pathao for my girlfriend, and almost everyone agreed that I was being used. So I finally talked to her about it. She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

            "body": "Namaste everyone,  I want to share an incident that happened to me in the last two weeks here in Germany.  My name is … Khadka, and I’ve been doing an Ausbildung at a Hofladen for the past 7 months. My chef treats me really well, like family.  Last week, I was at an Indian roadside café with my sister and some German friends, waiting for my chef to pick me up before visiting the Weihnachtsmarkt. We were waiting , suddenly two indian boys came to us and we had a short conversation . They were annoying so we started ignoring but they soon started making disrespectful comments like calling me MOMO and then mocking Nepal, our size, economy, and poverty. I didn’t respond with racism, though the conversation got heated.  Coincidentally, my chef was nearby, noticed something was wrong, and later asked if I was okay. I explained everything to him. He took it seriously and suggested legal action.  With the help of my chef’s lawyer, a legal letter was sent demanding an apology and €270 from the men. After a few days, they agreed to pay the money and apologized so the case would not go further.  Fun Fact : I and my sister literally eat MOMO after getting that 270 euro 😭😆  So reason of writing this post was just to sharing the possibility of what wrong can happened and how to handle this things.  Edit : For OC (https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204052999996390/permalink/2475725379495816/?mibextid=rS40aB7S9Ucbxw6v)",

Ravi will feel suffocated every single night, unable to do anything within yet another coalition government with Congress and UML. Rise and fall.

            "body": "I've been tempted to write this for a long time.       I was in a relationship with a popular male influencer for a long time. We broke up 2 years ago. During our 3+ year-long relationship, I got to be in his inner circle and hung out with Sisan and gang (and Shrinkhala too, before she went to Harvard). We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective. Just like Shrinkhala shamelessly posted those yellow highlighted Excel Sheets as her proof of innocence which had no third party audit or any verification.|||I have never watched Sisan Baniya, but I didn't feel that he ever portrayed himself as self made or coming from a humble background. He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Yeah, Sisan isn't 'dudh ka dhula' as he shows himself to be, he might be even worse.

And they give such an Incel vibe, hating up on a woman.  I really hope they are all kids who will grow out of this someday and realize how lame they were.

I also worked and hung out with and around Sisan Shrinkhala a lot.

And the way he spoke up about the Miss Nepal funds k k when the hate for her was at an all time high. Personally I have no sympathy or love for Shrinkhala so I am not saying this to defend her.

            "heading": "Went to India recently and it was immensely traumatizing",
            "body": "So I (27M) went to India for the first time. I was traveling solo turns out it was a bad idea. It was for work related events. After the event, I decided to explore a few places.   Until the work event, everything was fine. It was great learning and networking in the event. I actually speak Hindi very fluently so communication wasn’t an issue at all. After the event, I wanted to travel and explore.   I had booked a pretty average room for my accommodation. Nothing fancy, just the most budget friendly one I could find. There were a couple of people in the lobby and they greeted me nicely and asked for my ID. I showed them my passport and their faces instantly changed after seeing my Nepali passport. The guy said oh you’re from Nepal. I said yes and the another man said, this doesn’t work, we need to see an Indian ID. They weren’t smiling anymore and were giving me very skeptical looks. I tried not to overthink it. He kept insisting for an Indian ID and I explained to him that I am not from India, it’s my first time here so it’s not possible for me to have an Indian ID. Then they asked me for my contact number and I gave my phone number (didn’t have Indian number). Once again, they kept on asking for an Indian number. I was really surprised seeing their hospitality instantly changed after learning about my identity. Not sure if they did that because I was a foreigner to them or because I was specifically a Nepali guy.   While I was exploring the local market, I went to buy some souvenirs. One shop guy asked me where I was from and I said Nepal. He then started lecturing me saying don’t be close with China. They will do the same to you what Pakistan is doing to us. He kept yapping about how Nepal is a small part of India and that we should be grateful that we have a “bada bhai” like India. I left the shop without saying anything.    I wanted to travel by train but had absolutely zero idea about it. The people weren’t helpful there either. I was asking the various staff in the train station saying I wanna go here where can I find a ticket. They just vaguely pointed go there, it’s over there. Finally one guy at the ticket counter helped me get tickets after nearly couple of hours of running frantically here and there. I told him I’m not from India, traveling by train for the first time. The counter guy gave me a ticket saying this is for general class, it’s not safe to travel there..very crowded and chaotic, after your train arrives, meet the ticket guy and ask him to upgrade to AC compartment. I thanked him and went to the platform. There was a police officer whom I asked about upgrading the ticket. He too said the same thing i.e. meet the ticket guy once your train arrives and he will help you.   I still had about 3-4 hours before my train arrived. I just stayed in the platform watching movie. After the train arrived, I was frantically searching for the ticket guy. One police officer came near me charging with his baton. I was shit scared. He almost charged me saying why are you in the AC compartment with a general ticket in your hand. I was literally shaking at this point and with a shaky voice, I explained him my situation. He said haven’t you been in a train before where are you from. I said I’m from Nepal and he laughed saying oh you guys don’t even have trains there haha. Are you really from Nepal, your eyes don’t look like Nepalese. (I think he was referring to Mongolian eyes). I saw the ticket guy and went to him. He said me go to this seat and I’ll come. Later, he came to me and upgraded my ticket. The journey was a little over an hour long. And I was constantly replaying the entire experience from the hotel to the local market to the train station police guy.    Not sure if I just happened to meet all the wrong people or that everyone is the same there. Either way, I’m not going back to India for a long time. And I haven’t even mentioned the kids constantly following you begging for money, the dirt and litter everywhere, people peeing and even pooping in the open, unnecessary horns, air pollution.   PS: not trying to spread hate— just sharing my personal experience.",

Which cities did you visit, by the way? and as far as I know, many hotels in India especially smaller ones usually avoid foreigners because of paperwork and FRRO/police registration requirements. It’s better to stay at big hotels or resorts while traveling. I personally mostly stay at resorts, especially Club Mahindra ones they’re quite good, with solid service.  Also, try to do everything online in India train bookings, hotels, cabs. That way you’re much less likely to get scammed or harsh treated. Offline train ticket booking is honestly very hectic, even for Indians, so always book train tickets online. Use the official IRCTC website or authorized partners like MakeMyTrip, ConfirmTkt, or Paytm then you won’t face these problems.  And if you remember the time, location, duration, or the office name, you can also register a complaint on the Rail Madad portal or app. Lastly, there’s a huge generation gap in India you’ll mostly hear such racist things from older people or those in the 30–40 age group, but the younger generation is usually nicer and more helpful .You can even see this generation gap while speaking English. If you start speaking English in front of older people, they often treat you like some different person almost a ‘raja sahab’ type. But with the younger generation, it usually doesn’t make much of a difference. Anyway, I hope your journey was safe.|||Mods, how much racial abuse is tolerated here?

He seems the most capable guy among all the fkin leaders, including balen and rabi. When he speaks , he always seems calm even when he is provoked, unlike balen. He does not have an ongoing corruption case like that of rabi. He is an engineer who studied at the most prestigious university of our country and also studied at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. he went as a Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar to study water science, policy, and management. This is different from most engineering degrees  because he isn't just an engineer who can build a hydropower or dam. He has knowledge of policies and understands the economics and geopolitics of water—Nepal's most valuable resource. Has worked in developing countries in Africa. Seems like he has some political knowledge. Also, rabi and balen were celebrity figures, but he wasn't and dared to challenge one of the biggest political figures in a less urban or even rural city(dadeldhura). In a time where every nepalese wants to leave the country, a guy from oxford who could have easily left the country, not only staying but wants change in his country, shows bravery and patriotism. He hasn't been in power, so we can't gauge him, but we can gauge him based on what we have seen so far - a calm, educated, brave and exceptionally brilliant young guy, and i would definitely prefer him over any politican i have witnessed so far.|||\"Oxford padheko bhandai ma should be a leader\"  Can see the mindset of OP here.

You feel lost in those reactions and might even get out of your mind just looking at them. But listen to the tale, the story of how learning really happens. I don't know if you play games like Free Fire, PUBG, Royale, or something else. Ask yourself how you remembered all the gun names, location names, and the different things in them. How you remembered a whole 3-hour-long story you watched years ago? Treat these things the same way. Connect with them. Practice writing out the reaction yourself. Guess how they could pair up and react to give products. In the beginning, you will make mistakes, but slowly you will get used to it. Just know the reaction types: what acid-base rxns do, salts, catalysts, how oxidants and reductants work in any reaction. Try to understand these basics, and then you will not have to blindly learn rxns.|||On youtube watch pw lecture |||Old is gold ma vako haru pada yo sabb padna maile ta sakena yrr thett|||Haina ho sab Chinese letter dekhchu ta|||dont read all just read half the syllabus tara tyo half chai purai aunu paryo ......and u will pass|||Heri raakhnu parxa, kasto ma displacement, kasto ma substitution vanne crack vayesi sajilo hunxa|||I skipped the all organic portion but still got B+|||I didn't.

            "body": "My college head and a friendly botany teacher who has seen thousands of students always says just do enough to pass all subjects. Thats it. Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

We skipped the formal lectures and kept things simple—just hands-on demos and honest conversations. The goal wasn’t to teach a full curriculum in an afternoon; it was to show these kids that technology isn't out of reach.  As a student-led initiative, we don't have a big corporate engine behind us. We’re just a group of peers showing up and leading where we can. This reel captures some of the curiosity we saw that day—it’s a small start, but a meaningful one.  If you want to build, learn, or contribute to what we're doing, we’d love to have you.  👉 Join the movement: https://codeyatranp.com/join",
