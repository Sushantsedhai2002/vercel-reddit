Partly, our people were jealous of how you handled your corrupt politicians, but partly, I wonder if the situation in your country will get better now. I am guessing there are a lot of opportunists who now want to take the place of the old government. Are you in any kind of way preventing them from that?

These people didn't have any relation with the current government, nor were they ever in politics( this was done because Serbian people believe that the opposing parties are also corrupt).",

These people didn't have any relation with the current government, nor were they ever in politics( this was done because Serbian people believe that the opposing parties are also corrupt).   >sounds cool. so, a new political party? I hope they win, they probably will.   man, I'm burned out from Nepali politics. there is a high chance that, there will be more division and more instability. AAAAAA I don't want to think about this. all I know is few people in current interim government are the best that there is. beyond that, I don't have big faith in anyone. countless factions. many opportunists. I don't see the wisdom in many. and the selfishness needed to birth a capable and wise polity. only thing we can hope for is a good political party. and that's uncertain. one thing is for sure, there are more political parties. and more division.   I'm starting to believe that almost all people are incapable of deep reasoning and far from understanding what is needed for a successful government. and in upcoming elections. discourse will be hijacked by demagogues with those shallow stirring speeches. slanders of oppositions. hard to see political culture changing for better. and if individuals are like this. it's much harder to be an impressive unit with cohesion as a government. I don't feel like things will get much better. it really felt very hopeful a month back. let's see what happens in the next elections. it's too messy to predict stuff rn. and we can't do much, I think.|||First of all, I think Serbia is on the right path and I hope the best people will win the election.   Nepal is currently administrated by an interim government which is working to hold an election within the next 5 months. This interim government is doing just fine, not the best. But as the whole system is filled with corrupts, the government hasn't been able to deliver as per the high expectations. However, I think the corruption is almost nil right now because who would dare, right? The ministers we have currently have are definitely the best ones as compared to any of the ministers before. Especially the education minister is doing great imo.   But the main question is, what would happen after the new election. If the thrown out parties came back to power, we are doomed. We do have many leaders who are respected by most and not linked with the old big parties but don't know their exact plan for the election. They must be working on it, but a lot of confusion remains, and rightfully so, because nobody was prepared for this situation. I personally have big hopes and positive vibes for the coming election as people are now more aware about the politics, especially the younger ones.|||It was a anger buildup of 30 years of corruption concentrated in 1 day alongisde mass unemployment and that protest was like we scored 1 goal but conceded 5 goals in return. that 1 goal was few politicians got beat up and their houses torched (maybe you should get hints, it just needs a angry crowd) but the 5 goals are lots of weapons were looted (will be used in future civil war), police morale at lowest, lawlessness, a government approved by the \"indo-west\" MCC similar to bangladesh and free tibet (sudan gurung/TOB) has gained momentum to anger china. The current govt is also scared cause pepl know where they live and next time, their houses will be targeted",

Do you people even realize that words can scar someone for life? That trauma does not disappear once the trend fades?

And to those public figures who stay silent or worse, enjoy it, you are part of the problem.  Sandeep, if your heart was truly pure, you would have intervened long ago. You could have told your followers to stop this bullying and personal attack. But your silence speaks volumes. A good heart does not take pleasure in someone else’s humiliation.  Today fans may be cheering for you. Tomorrow the same crowd can turn just like they did with others. Fame built on hate will always collapse on itself.  We desperately need social media ethics and intervention in Nepal. Freedom of speech does not mean freedom to destroy someone’s dignity.

He just completed his final semester exams for his Bachelor in Computer Applications (BCA) and has consistently performed  well academically. He’s a quick learner, passionate about technology, and eager to contribute.  However, he is differently-abled. When he was 6 years old, he suffered from a mosquito-borne disease that caused paralysis. Over time, only the left side of his body (hand and leg) functions properly  his right hand and leg are still paralyzed. Because of this, working in an office setting or traveling daily is very difficult for him. He really wants to learn more, work, and contribute, but in Nepal, opportunities for people with disabilities are extremely limited, especially in tech and remote work setups.  He’s recently been feeling a bit helpless and worried about his future. So, I’m reaching out here to ask: -  Does anyone know about remote job or internship opportunities suitable for differently-abled individuals in Nepal?   - Are there any organizations, NGOs, or initiatives that support people like him in gaining skills or employment in the IT field? If you have any suggestions, leads, or contacts, please connect with me directly or share them here. It would truly mean a lot and could make a big difference in his life.  Thank you so much for reading and helping .",

            "body": "I think there’s a deeper psychology behind why so many boys come to defend Sandeep Lamichhane. He’s someone who came from a humble background and made it big. Something a lot of young Nepalis dream about.  When Sandeep was accused of SA (and later cleared by the court), it wasn’t just about the case for many people. They saw someone like them, a regular guy who fought his way up and suddenly facing something that could take everything away. And that fear hits close to home.  For a lot of Nepali boys, Sandeep represents the idea that talent and hard work can actually take you somewhere, even from nowhere. So when he’s criticized, it feels personal like the world is trying to pull down one of their own.  In a way, Sandeep has become more than just a cricketer. He’s turned into a symbol of hope, but also of insecurity, the fear that success for people like him (and them) can be taken away anytime.  Anyways I do not support extremely scary and abusive comments posted on those influencers post. It is necessary to call out people rationally rather than threatening them every time.

He still is a citizen and with all this fame and influencing power he should have  been more careful on the sensitive things like drugs, alcohol, sex and others.

Most Nepalis are sheep with a huge celebrity worship culture ... doesn’t matter if it’s athletes, actors, or politicians. Sandeep’s probably the most successful athlete the country’s ever produced, so of course he’s got a massive following. These sheep will do anything for him. A lot of his fans even attack players like Rohit just because they think Sandeep deserves the captaincy. So when they hear someone’s gone after their god, they lose their minds. Nothing surprising or deep about it..  These traits are mostly seen in people who aren’t very successful or capable on their own, so they latch onto others to feel a sense of pride or importance. Not saying every Sandeep supporter is like that .... but most of them definitely are.|||Lowest Iq 😂. Real ma bhannu parne ho bhane its misogyny.

Speaking on legal cases without understanding the facts is reckless. I’m not referring to women in general, but to those commenting on the Sandeep Lamichhane case without proper study. Many have only heard rumors like ‘this happened, that happened, this man is bad’ without reviewing what the judiciary actually decided.  Some so called female influencers are being targeted for speaking based on incomplete knowledge and commenting randomly without full understanding. If a so called male influencer had spoken in the same way, they likely would have been targeted as well.  Legally, no one has the right to make public statements about an ongoing or concluded case without proper knowledge. The final authority lies with the courts, and public commentary based on incomplete or false information undermines both justice and public understanding. Always check the facts, understand the law, and respect the judiciary’s decisions before speaking publicly.|||Hello is proven innocent.nepal Sarkar bata law bata..Hera we have our own opinion but judgement vaye sakyo .he is innocent  So please stop overreacting",

            "body": "Let’s be honest, the best thing we Gen Z Nepalis can do right now is to leave the country, explore opportunities abroad, and invest in ourselves. This isn’t about giving up on Nepal. It’s about understanding that the system here gives you no real space to grow.  There’s a growing push to pull young people directly into politics with emotional slogans like “change the country” and “be the new generation of leaders.” It sounds inspiring, but it’s misleading. You need to build yourself first. Learn how systems work, gain professional experience, and earn credibility. If you jump into politics without that foundation, you’ll end up neither respected nor self-reliant.  Look at Sagar Dhakal for instance. He didn’t rush into politics. He built his career, gained international experience, worked with organizations like the UN, and then entered the political arena. He has a life outside politics, and that gives him independence, perspective, and strength. That’s how it should be done.  Now, look at what has happened to some of these so-called “new parties.” What started as a movement of hope has slowly turned into a one-man show. It was supposed to represent professionals, thinkers, and change-makers. Instead, it has become another personality cult one person in the center, unquestioned, untouchable, and worshiped.  Let’s not forget, that same person became Deputy Prime Minister with the same old political figure (Oli) not once but twice. The same figure they once criticized as the face of everything wrong in Nepali politics. And now that the tables have turned and he’s in trouble because of his own reckless actions, people suddenly want to treat him like a victim or a hero. What happened to all the outrage when he helped change governments twice? Are we supposed to forgive and forget? That same party once said others were responsible for political instability, yet it played the exact same game. If they had stayed out of government in the last three years, we wouldn’t have had three or four governments changing within months. There were no expectations from the Maoists, UML, or Congress but from them, there was hope. And that’s what makes the disappointment sting more.  Maybe that’s why Balen keeps his distance from the core RSP cult. He’s not perfect; he’s aggressive and arrogant at times, and maybe he doesn’t even want to be a “leader” in the traditional sense. But what he does have is integrity. He’s not selling his narrative on how others made him scam and he didn’t know. He’s not pretending to be a saviour. And in today’s politics, that alone is rare. A man is defined by his integrity, and that’s where Balen stands apart.  I genuinely hope Balen eventually gathers the real new and capable people under one roof. Not to build another personality cult, but to unite professionals and thinkers who care about integrity, discipline, and purpose. He doesn’t have to be the face, but he can be the one who brings together those who still believe change is possible without selling illusions or narratives on people.   So to my fellow Gen Zs: before you jump into politics, build yourself first. Go abroad if you can. Learn, earn, and return stronger. Politics should be something you step into after you’ve built your life, not the shortcut you take when you haven’t.",

He's said that confidence won't build back up easily.    No matter who wins the next elections, job creation within this country is not a joke and is very very difficult task. Our society for some reason hates the rich. If any foreign company enters the country, we don't even hesitate to put some tag on them and spread negativity like \" bideshi dalal\", \"hamro desh lutna aako\" and what not. Making some profits in this country is seen as sin, while they ignore the amount of tax those industries pay and number of jobs they create.   FDI was already really bad. Nepal really never recovered in terms of FDI after maoist terrorism. Many international brans like Unilever, Cocacola , Dabur, Standard Chartered and other international banks entered nepal after liberalization of 2048 but that started going downhill after maobadi started their terrorism in 2052. Since then most of the investment has been done by local entrepreneurs but after gen Z arson and looting, their confidence is down too. That day showed how weak our security system is, how our security system is not cable of protecting private property of the citizens. Will that incident be the black day for domestic investment like maobadi terrorism was for FDI? Or will we bounce back?",

Or you could explore other options like ConnectIPS, Khalti, Bank cards, etc.  Regarding another question & concern about what problem does API solve?   \\- Assume you are running your business (selling products), as you have mentioned in the post, customers can just download the QR, pay and confirm via call or message (screenshot). For smaller scale this is feasible. But when it comes to scale, you won't be able to receive calls or verify payment screenshots of 100s of customers per day, you either need to hire more people or apply some automation. Another problem you will face is fake screenshots, order confusion, etc. Here's where APIs comes into play, once you integrate the API in your website, the API does the payment/verification part, your application (website) will connect the payment to the order, and flag the payment status as \"PAID\", you won't need to verify each and every payment. You can focus on the product and delivery.  TLDR; For small scale business, QR option with phone/message verification will work fine. For larger scale, API will help you a lot by automating the verification, and order status updates.|||Don't get it for 25k. It's negotiable. Say you are thinking about using Khalti but will consider using eSewa if they waive the fee. I actually got it for zero charge (only the commission, which I also negotiated), but I was integrating for multiple companies.|||use khalti, esewa is just a monopoly fintech|||Lol !

Similarly, reports of Chirayu Hospital show that he also suffers from asthma,\" the bench said. The hospital has provided the prison with Malla’s medical diagnosis. Malla has been diagnosed with hypertension, severe depression with adjustment disorder, along with asthma, leading to blood pressure and oxygen saturation problems. However, doctors unaffiliated to Chirayu Hospital say that it is unlikely that Malla is suffering from all the problems stated in the diagnosis.  [https://nepalitimes.com/opinion/i-speak-nothing-but-the-truth-your-honour](https://nepalitimes.com/opinion/i-speak-nothing-but-the-truth-your-honour)  >For example, in the hit-and-run case of Prithvi Bahadur Malla, in the police interview, Malla confessed that as a result of partying and sleep deprivation he briefly dosed off while driving and ended up hitting the pedestrian. At court he stated that the steering wheel of his car locked and the vehicle swung into the wrong lane hitting the pedestrian. Judge Surya Prasad Adhikari admitted his testimony to the court (as opposed to the police) as evidence. When stories change so dramatically there is nothing a suspect will verify off of their own accord.   The district court’s sentence was overturned by the High Court but still just a 4 year sentence for drunk driving homicide? No action has been taken against the judge who imposed a six month sentence. Shouldn’t that be grounds for disbarment? The High Court’s full judgment and charge sheet was never released. No way to know whether the charges included a fake driver’s license.

The learner's permit does not allow him to drive without another driver seated next to him, let alone drive outside the US. The document he presented can be easily obtained from [https://e-ita.org/](https://e-ita.org/) and does not appear to be legitimate. Rabi Lamichhane was able to get an \"International Driving Permit\" in the name of \"Bhusyaha Kukur\" [भुस्याहा ककुरको नाममा पनि पाइयो– पृथ्वी मल्लले लिएको लाइसेन्स | नेपाल फर्काइदिन युवाहरूको गुहार](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_U7ZjSy9Fo&t=633s).  >On the document, it states that the \"permit is valid when shown with Domestic Driver's license\" (यो document को त केहि काम नै भएन) lol. Since Prithvi Malla does not have a Nepali (domestic) license (he doesn't even have a US license) how was this document accepted in court? Even if the fact that he was under the influence was conveniently omitted from the case files, without a valid driver's license he would still be tried for involuntary manslaughter and not an accident, with a minimum sentence of 3 years.  >The case should be reappealed. If that does not happen, people who are, or have friends abroad, should just pay $35, get an \"International Driving Permit\" from i-eta, and won't have to take driving tests. Its validity has been vouched for by Kathmandu District Court. थुनामा परियो भने यो decision/precedent/नजिर cite गर्न सकिन्छ lol  First step of dictatorship in faux democracies is to control the judiciary by packing the courts. Erdogan in Turkey, Orban in Hungary, Trump with his supreme court shenanigans. The same is true in our country. Does Sushila Karki have the political will to do anything regarding judicial independence?  [Politicization of Nepal’s judiciary is entrenched.

They had been sitting in the hotel and having lunch and beer before the accident. They had left the hotel around 5:20 pm after having beer and lunch at the Admire Cafe in Biratnagar-5. The car was being driven by MP Karki's son Rabin Singh Karki.  >The police were investigating the incident where Karki had been driving under the influence of alcohol. The police submitted the investigation report to the government prosecutor's office that Karki, who had been drinking beer at the Admire Cafe in Biratnagar-5, had hit Das at the airport mode.  >However, the police did not conduct a physical examination of Karki, saying that Karki had fled immediately after the accident. Based on the statements given by Karki's friends and the hotel owner, the police concluded that Karki had also consumed alcohol. In fact, 4 other people had also fled immediately after the accident.  >Rabin surrendered himself to the police three days after the accident. Three days later, when Karki was arrested, a medical examination could not prove whether he had been drunk on the day of the accident. Although the medical report could not confirm the intoxication, the statements of the hotel owner and the people in the car indicated that Karki, who was driving the car, had admitted to being drunk.  >Cafe owner Pankaj Sah, in his statement to the police, said that Karki and his friends had consumed 16 beers.  >Sah wrote in the statement, \"...When Rabin Karki called me and asked me to give him beer, fish and meat, as well as cigarettes, I gave them a total of 16 Mustang beers, fish and meat, and other things they had ordered.\"  >Not only Sah, but Raman Adhikari, who was inside the car when the accident occurred, also admitted to being drunk. He said in his statement, \"While going to the car, we went to Admire Cafe after being advised by the sir to eat food. Richu Giri did not eat, we all ate food including fish and meat and beer.\"  >Based on the statements of Karki's friends and the hotel owner, the police concluded that Karki had also consumed alcohol. Despite the lack of a medical examination report, a case was registered at the Morang District Court, alleging that Karki had caused the accident by driving under the influence of alcohol, based on his statement.  >Based on the police report, the District Attorney's Office, Morang, filed a case in the Morang District Court on June 15, 2078, claiming that the accident occurred due to drunk driving.   The District Attorney's Office had demanded punishment for Karki under Section 161(2) of the Vehicle Act 2049 on the basis of drunk driving.  >According to Section 161(2) of the Vehicle Act, if someone dies within 21 days of the accident due to reckless driving, the driver will be imprisoned for 3 years to 10 years and fined between Rs 30,000 and Rs 100,000.  >The Government Attorney's Office had termed the accident as negligence because the accident occurred due to drunk driving. The next day after the case was filed, i.e. on June 16, a closed-door hearing was held in the District Court. The District Court ordered that Rabin Karki be sent to prison for remand.  >After Karki was sent to remand for remand, the hearing resumed in the Morang District Court on September 20. During the hearing, Karki's side claimed that the accident was not due to drunk driving but due to a burst tire. Senior advocate Suresh Lal Shrestha and advocate duo Bharat Bahadur Thapa and Hari Bahadur Shrestha tried to prove that the accident occurred due to a burst tire.  >However, the district court rejected the claim that the accident occurred due to a burst tire. Three months after Karki was sent to prison, on Asoj 13, the Morang District Court found Karki guilty. However, it did not determine the punishment.  >About a week after Karki was found guilty, on Asoj 19, District Judge Sudarshan Lamichhane sentenced Rabin Karki to 3 years in prison and a fine of 35,000. Judge Lamichhane sentenced him to 3 years in prison and a fine of 35,000 for causing death by driving under the influence of alcohol under Section 161(2) of the Vehicle Act 2049 BS.  >\"The facts and evidence clearly show that the defendant Rabin Singh Karki was driving a car at a high speed while under the influence of alcohol and hit Mukesh Sharma Das and Rajkumar Rajbanshi, who were walking on the roadside, due to which the car went out of control and crashed into Mukesh Sharma Das and Rajkumar Rajbanshi, who were walking on the roadside. Mukesh Sharma Das died from the same injuries and Ram Kumar Rajbanshi's left hand was broken and amputated. Therefore, it is held that the defendant Rabin Singh Karki committed the offense as per the prosecution's claim under Section 161, Sub-section 2 of the Vehicle and Transport Management Act 2049 and Sub-section 1 of 162 of the same Act,\" the verdict states.  >Karki was given only the minimum punishment for driving a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and causing death. The Morang District Court also explained the reason for imposing the minimum punishment. Karki is a social activist. The district court had clarified that the minimum punishment was imposed on Karki because he is a young man and does not have any other bad conduct.  >The Morang District Court was lenient towards Rabin Singh Karki and imposed only the minimum punishment. However, the Karki side was not satisfied with the district court's decision. They approached the Biratnagar High Court against the district court's decision.  >On 22 Kartik 2078, the Karki side approached the Biratnagar High Court against the district court's decision. The main purpose of the appeal was to confirm that the Karki side did not commit the offence.  >If it is possible to prove that the accident was caused by a technical fault and not by human error, then Sub-section 3 of Section 161 of the Road Traffic Act should be used. That is, if a person dies while driving without any negligence, there is a provision in Sub-section 3 that a maximum punishment of 1 year is imposed.  >The High Court, on the issue of the district causing the accident due to drunkenness, found that the accident occurred due to a burst tire. Based on that, the bench of Justices Krishna Kamal Adhikari and Jagat Narayan Pradhan of the High Court partially overturned the district court's decision, saying that the accident occurred due to a burst tire  >. 'It is natural for a vehicle that is on the verge of a sudden burst tire to shake and it can be easily assumed that an accident could occur in such a situation. Mukesh Das died because the vehicle went out of control after the tire burst and the accident occurred,' the High Court's decision, proving that the accident occurred due to a burst tire, wrote, 'The fact that the defendant was driving on his own side and caught the tire and caused the accident has been established.'  >Three months after the district court sentenced him to three years in prison, on 20 December 2078, the high court sentenced Karki to six months and 15 days in prison and a fine of Rs 2,000. The high court's decision states that Karki was not under the influence of alcohol while driving.  >**Karki obtained his license while he was in jail,**   but one thing was left out of these arguments and arguments of the two courts. The issue that the court did not consider was Karki's driving license. The police also emphasized only whether Karki had consumed alcohol or not during the investigation. The investigation regarding Karki's driving license was weak.  >Despite knowing that the person driving the vehicle was Rabin Singh Karki, the police were able to take Karki under control only after 3 days as a fugitive. That is, Karki, who was also an accused, had surrendered himself to the police office.  >It is not difficult to say that Karki surrendered to the police only after it could not be confirmed from a medical point of view that he had consumed alcohol. That is why the high court decided that the accident occurred due to a burst tire, not due to alcohol.  >Although Karki gave a statement confirming that he did not have a license, the investigating agency and the prosecuting government attorney's office did not inquire much about the driver's license.  >**How did the relevant agency fail to investigate the issue of not having a license?**  >In the statement given during the investigation, Rabin Singh Karki had said that he had obtained his motorcycle and car licenses from the Transport Management Office, Koshi. However, he had said that he did not remember his license number.  >In the District Court, Morang, he said, 'I have obtained A and B driver's licenses from the Transport Management Office, Koshi. I do not know the driver's license number at present.'  >Although he said that he had obtained the license from Koshi, Karki did not actually have a license. In fact, Karki obtained his license from the Ekantakuna License Office in Lalitpur, the federal capital, Kathmandu, that too when he was in jail due to an accident.  >Karki's mother, MP Bindiya Karki, arranged for her son, who was in jail, to get a driver's license.  >After getting the driver's license from the federal capital, Karki changed his statement. Initially, Karki stated that he had obtained the driver's license from the Koshi Zonal Transport Office, but later said that he had obtained the license from Bagmati.  >According to the Morang District Court's decision, MP Karki had submitted a photocopy of the government receipt showing that his son had obtained the driver's license in the court.  >After his mother obtained the driver's license from Bagmati, Karki changed his statement, saying, \"I mistakenly stated in question 9 of my previous statement that I had obtained the driver's license from the Transport Management Office, Koshi. I have obtained a Class B transport driver's license from the Transport Management Office, Bagmati. My Class B driver's license number is 01-06-00542589, and the date of issue is 2075.7.12.\"  >When the court asked him to produce the driver's license, Karki said that the license was lost. In his statement, he said, \"I lost the original copy of my driver's license about a year ago while coming home from Kathmandu to Biratnagar, and I have not been able to get it back because I have not been able to go to Kathmandu to get it back due to the coronavirus pandemic.\"  >However, Nepal Khabar's investigation has shown that Karki obtained the driver's license incorrectly. While Karki was in jail, a driver's license was issued in his name from a secluded corner of the Transport Management Office.  >Physical presence is required when filling out the license form. However, Karki's photo appears to be inconsistent in the details of the driver's license issued in Karki's name. The office's source said that there was a mistake in Karki's license.  >Karki had stated during his statement that he had obtained the driver's license on Kartik 12, 2075. That is, he had stated that he had obtained the license on October 29, 2018. According to the department's details, Karki's trial was held on April 13, 2018. And, the registration number of the application he submitted to the department was 67095432.  >However, this application was not in Karki's name, but in the name of Bhesh Bahadur Majhi. The computer details contained a driver's license in Karki's name, but in the other file, an application was found for Bhesh Bahadur Majhi.  >According to the department's details, Majhi had failed in his application for a driving license. However, it seems that Karki, who was made on the basis of the same application, got a driving license.  >'Amma, you're the one who got the license, man. This is a game of chance.'  >He tried to explain to me, 'Listen, sir, now I understand. Bhesh Bahadur Majhi had also failed. Someone created a license using the same failed ID in a two-digit way. In fact, this license may not be with anyone who has issued the license, but when necessary, it is shown in the name of the person who needs it.  >In fact, Bhesh Bahadur Majhi failed in the trial. His application was issued a driving license using the RID. However, after the High Court's decision, the same driving license in Karki's name appears in someone else's name.  >Initially, the driving license in Bhesh Bahadur's name reached Karki's name. After the High Court's decision, the license in Karki's name was found in the name of Sahadev Gajmer. The next day after the permit was received in Gajmer's name, it was returned to Karki's name. And, the photo previously placed in Karki's details was also changed.  >After confirming with the source, Nepal Khabar also confirmed this matter through the office. Using the Right to Information.  >'.....Since the court has made the details public along with the order, it is desirable to provide the information for journalistic purposes as per Article 27 of the Constitution of Nepal, the Right to Information Act 2064 and the Rules of the Act 2065.'  >The office then gave the information along with a copy of the transcript from the then trial. Where it is clearly written '...As per the attendance record of the examination and the experimental check list, the details seen in the name of Bhesh Bahadur Majhi are requested. Also, a certified copy of his check list and attendance is provided with this letter.'

The case made national headlines after the high-end car allegedly driven by the 17-year-old boy in an inebriated state mowed down motorcycle-borne IT professionals Anish Awadhiya and Ashwini Costa in the Kalyani Nagar area on May 19 last year.  >\"Last year’s Porsche car crash case sparked widespread discussions about Pune’s deteriorating social culture, alleged police corruption, and several other issues. Amid all the criticism, one positive aspect stood out: the case exposed systemic corruption.  >The boy who allegedly caused the accident was 17 years old, and he got relief and is out. But his mother was in jail for 14 months. His father has been in jail for the last 17-18 months. The doctors and staff of the Sassoon Hospital have also been in jail for 18 months.  >Many things were said: Pune’s culture has been ruined, Pune police and society are corrupt, etc. But in all this criticism, one good thing emerged. Whatever systemic corruption was present there, it got exposed.” Kumar said the police investigation exposed the “complete racket” that had changed the blood samples.  >The blood samples of the minor, collected at Sassoon General Hospital, were allegedly swapped with his mother’s to show that he was not drunk. The police arrested the minor’s parents, two doctors, and a hospital staff member for their involvement in the sample swapping.  >While it is true that the probe brought to light alleged cover-ups in the case, the police also not covered themselves in glory in the case. In fact, the conduct of police officers at the Yerwada police station, where the accused was taken after the accident, had also come under heavy fire at the time. The late collection of blood samples for alcohol testing, along with the involvement of then MLA Sunil Tingre, raised allegations of “VIP treatment”.",

Rather, in his essay, he defined “history” in a broad sense: as a clash of ideological frameworks for how to legitimately govern societies.  >As Fukuyama noted, the 20th century saw immense change on this front. Democracies were rare at the start of the century, and fascism rose as an alternative model—embraced by regimes that later killed millions of people. World War II settled the democracy vs. fascism debate, for a time.  >Then, during the Cold War, communism challenged democracy, with the Soviet Union presenting a rival model for governance that was adopted by large swaths of the world. However, the Soviet Union collapsed, and the 1990s became a period of surging global democracy. In particular, much of Africa and Eastern Europe moved toward democracy.      >Fukuyama argued that the end of the Cold War—and the triumph of the democratic West—would signal “The End of History” in the sense that rival models to democracy had been defeated, relegated to the dust bin of history. Everyone, everywhere, would soon accept that democracy was the legitimate form of government.  >Was he right? The answer is more surprising than you might think. And it lies with a concept that I’ve coined in my research, called *counterfeit democracy*.  > Most people think of democracy as a binary—you’re either a democracy, or you’re a dictatorship (which political scientists sometimes call *autocracies*). In reality, regimes exist on a spectrum. On one end, you’ve got the consolidated democracies, such as New Zealand, Japan, Denmark, Costa Rica, and Finland. On the other, you’ve got the full-blown dictatorships, such as North Korea, Turkmenistan, and Equatorial Guinea.  >In recent years, global democracy has declined—in just about every index —since around 2006 (there’s nothing magical about this date; it’s just when more countries began lurching toward authoritarianism than the number of countries moving toward democracy on the spectrum).  >**Forgeries and Fake Democracy**  >But here’s the crucial shift: everyone *pretends* to be a democracy now, even the totalitarian dictators.  >Have you ever noticed that countries that are often awful regimes have *democratic* in their names? (The official name of North Korea is the *Democratic* People's Republic of Korea; East Germany was the German *Democratic* Republic; and the *Democratic* Republic of Congo is lying about two of the four words in its name). But those countries don’t/didn’t fool anyone. They’re straight up dictatorships, no matter the labels used.  >However, there has been a major rise in the number of in-between countries, those that have the trappings of democracy, but that, when push comes to shove, are authoritarian. I call these the *counterfeit democracies* and it’s a group that comprises, in my view, the majority of countries in the world. Within this group, you’ve got countries like Hungary, Turkey, the Philippines, Madagascar, Tunisia, and countless others. They’re fake democracies, authoritarian wolves in the sheep’s clothing of democracy.  >**Many have wrongly condemned Fukuyama’s End of History argument as being naive and misguided, proven embarrassingly wrong by the** ***democratic backsliding*** **that has comprised recent global political history. How can Fukuyama be right if democracy is declining rather than surging? But his central claim—that democracy would prevail as the consensus legitimate form of government globally—has been proven correct by the rise of counterfeit democracies.**  >In the past, authoritarian regimes didn’t pretend to be democratic. Why bother masquerading? Now, almost all countries hold elections, and they pretend to have rule of law and other core institutions of democracy, hoping that everyone—including their citizens—will be fooled by the forgery. For, like a counterfeit bank note, it only works insofar as some people believe it’s real.  >Some, such as Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, have tried to coin their own word, putting a positive spin on their embrace of authoritarianism. He calls it “illiberal democracy,” which, like “working vacation,” is an oxymoron. If a country is illiberal—and it doesn’t have the core institutions of liberal democracy, such as a free press, rule of law, protections for minorities, and freedom of speech, religion, and assembly—then it’s not a democracy. It’s that simple. After all, who cares if there are elections if they’re rigged, or if the winner of those elections doesn’t ever gain meaningful power?  >**Counterfeit Democracy in Action**  >How does counterfeit democracy work in practice? This dynamic is on display now in Thailand, a country that looks like it’s on the [precipice of a major upheaval](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Thai-election/Thailand-s-pro-democracy-coalition-mulls-next-steps-without-Pita) and significant volatility, even though it’s not being covered much in the Western press. I’ve spent many months living in Thailand and researching its politics (it’s the most coup-prone country in the world over the last century). And the Thai pattern is one that is becoming familiar to counterfeit democracies, because they’re learning from each other.  >In Thailand, the story goes like this: a popular insurgent reformer takes on the establishment. Despite barriers put in place to stop them, they win an election, sometimes in a landslide. But then, the reformer tries to dismantle outdated structures of power, taking aim at the old guard. So, the old guard punches back, making sure that the reformer doesn’t reach power, or ends up being forced out of power in a military coup. This playbook has been used to exile, jail, disqualify—even kill—dissidents who have taken on Thailand’s entrenched dinosaurs.  >In this instance, a young, reformist party called the Move Forward Party shocked Thailand watchers by winning the elections in May. The party’s leader, [Pita Limjaroenrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pita_Limjaroenrat), should have easily taken power as the prime minister.  >Instead, surprise, surprise, Thailand’s military junta had changed the constitution. Now, to become prime minister, you need to win over much of the Senate, which due to “reforms” instituted under the military general-turned-prime minister who has been in charge since 2014, is directly appointed by Thailand’s military. The Senate just blocked Pita from taking power, and barred him from seeking the role again.  >**This is the** ***modus operandi*** **of counterfeit democracies: make changes that ensure that you can have elections without real democracy. Rig the elections if you must, or, better yet, make them meaningless. Just in case your rivals get into power, fill the courts with loyalists, who will strike down legislation they pass (this one hits a bit too close to home with the United States at the moment, though it’s far more severe in most countries). Intimidate the press, either by using violence—as in Russia and Turkey—or by demonizing them relentlessly.**  >This is why all the institutions that traditionally produce accountability—dissidents, the press, independent courts, and free and fair elections—are the first targets of would-be despots.|||misaligned misguided xan sabai yaha. ani attention dina lai \"biggest nepokid paras\" le gareko hora yo ?? /s|||Paul shah ko ne video halana yar kati Sandip मात्र gareko hun|||Raksi ban hannu paryo",

That doesn't mean keep it on leash 24/7. When you take it out, YOU should be present there to control it. You can protect your dog from others(people or other street dogs) or maybe protect others from your dog.   If your dog starts barking at people then no one knows if your dog bites or not.

You knew how jagged I could be, how I turned love into a battlefield, and you still came unarmed.  You loved me like you weren’t afraid to bleed. And I kept testing you, kept waiting for you to stop trying, because everyone else always did. But you didn’t. You stayed through the silences that could’ve drowned you. You stayed when I made you question yourself. You stayed until there was nothing left to stay for  and even then, you looked back.  I see it now, the way your eyes pleaded for me to say something worth hearing, for me to fight for you, for once. But I was too good at pretending I didn’t care. And now I carry that moment like a scar I carved myself.  I tell people I’ve moved on, but the truth is I still flinch at kindness. I still wait for footsteps that never come back. And every time someone loves me, I ruin it a little, because I’m still trying to unlearn what I did to you.  You would’ve stayed. That’s what breaks me  not the leaving, but knowing you didn’t want to. That I pushed away the one person who would’ve never asked me to be anyone but myself.  If I could tell you anything now, I wouldn’t say I miss you. I’d say I understand. I’d say I finally know what you were trying to teach me  that love doesn’t leave, people do.

I understand those jokes were cheap and you were hurt by it, but seriously? And you dare to post a story wishing Paras Khadka, blatantly ignoring the posts, like you haven't seen cultism in your name?  Professionals don’t need mobs to defend them. They don’t hide behind fans, throwing filth on others. They rise, perform, and let their work speak. They take hits with dignity, not revenge. They use their platform to stop hate, not feed it.  The difference between a player and a professional is simple:   A player complains about being misunderstood.   A professional understands the responsibility of being seen.  And if you can’t carry that weight, then don’t pretend you can. Leave Nepalese cricket. Don’t act like the world owes you sympathy when you can’t even stand up against harassment done in your name. You’ve got thousands of people who’d move mountains for you, but instead of using that power to inspire, you let them spread poison.  You can call it “fan support.” I call it cowardice.   Real strength is when you protect the people who can’t fight back; real strength is forgiving those who so dearly need your support, even if they have committed a mistake.  I’ve seen soldiers, workers, artists, and athletes break under pressure, but the great ones? They rise again without blaming others. Tanmay Bhat, Anurag Kashyap, name it. They took every insult and turn it into fire. They don’t cry for pity, they fight for purpose.  You want to be respected again? Then earn it. Not with PR posts. Not with silence. With action. Speak out. Take responsibility. Stop the hate that uses your name as armour.  Until then, you’re not a symbol of resilience. You’re just another cautionary tale, proof that fame means nothing if your heart can’t carry it.  And to everyone who blindly worships personalities while dehumanising others, remember this:   Your idol can’t save you from your own cruelty.   But standing for what’s right might just save them from theirs.",

I also don’t want to do BSW/BASW because too many people struggle to find work after that.

Then in 4 mark qn, I wrote 2 lines of introduction (definition) then I skipped a line and wrote \"The related points are below\" I wrote 6 points then concluded in 2 lines. That should cover 75% of the page. Start every 4 and 7 mark QN from a new page. In 7 mark qn, I wrote around a para of introduction then 12 points then a paragraph of conclusion.   3.

While most countries have been struggling with deforestation, Nepal somehow managed to reverse the trend.  A few key reasons:  * **Community Forestry Program** — locals manage and protect their own forests instead of the central government. * **Rural-Urban Migration** — many farmlands were abandoned as people moved to cities or abroad for work, letting nature reclaim them. * **Alternative Energy** — more use of biogas and LPG means less dependence on firewood. * **Reforestation & Conservation** — national parks, reserves, and local planting drives helped too.  Now nearly **45% of Nepal’s total land** is covered by forests — up from around **25% in the early 1990s**.  Pretty wild, right?   What do you think — is community-led management the real key here, or did urban migration play a bigger role?

I’m currently abroad, but my mom and my rabbit were at home. The noise was so intense that even over the phone, I could hear it in the background. My rabbit was terrified and yesterday morning, on Laxmi Pujamy mom called crying, he was gone. The continuous sound of fireworks had stressed him so much that his little heart couldn’t take it anymore. He died scared and alone, and I wasn’t even there to hold him. I was supposed to be home in just 1.5 months. I kept imagining how happy he’d be when he’d see me again.   He wasn’t just a pet. He was family, my little brother. I don’t have siblings, and he filled that space in my life with his sweet energy and unconditional love. I can’t describe the guilt and pain I feel. I keep imagining him hiding in fear, shaking every time another pataka went off, and I hate that I couldn’t be there for me. My lil bro didn’t deserve this. None of them do.",

I'm very sorry for your loss. What was meant to be a heartwarming celebration, was infiltrated by these customs no one knows who started.|||I am so sorry for your loss. Try to dont play such scenarios in your head, I know its hard..  Yes, many animals experience severe distress due to fireworks and firecrackers, cows, dogs, cats etc. The smaller the animal, stronger the distress.   You can check statistics over the world, its a real issue. We humans dont respect the native habitants (animals) and this is just one of examples. Like, is the loud sound more important than a divine life (as all life is divine)?  Can that simbolism be expressed in a better way, by singing, instruments etc...  Luckily, as the world is slowly becoming aware of this, so the regulations starts to exist. In many countries there are now regulations that prohibit fireworks and firecrackers, exactly because of this reason (not to mention distress to some humans that exist too..).|||I am so so sorry.  Animals are the first victims of fire crackers.  I'm sorry your beautiful little bunny brother is gone.|||Here's a hard truth: that's on you. That's a fucking animal.

I'm not trying to be rude or to devalue your loss. It must be sad for you, yes, but I feel worse for that rabbit who lost its life because you made it live with humans and could not accommodate its needs. Firecrackers didn't take his life.

I’m not expecting anything from anyone anymore. I just want to appreciate the people around me. Even those who’ve hurt me in the past. I don’t hold anything against them now. Everybody around me seems so helpful. I wish I could stay in this enlightened state every day.  A bit of behind the scene:  After the whole Gen Z  movement, I quit using social media; Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, even Discord. I only use Reddit now, mostly just for reading news and updates.  Just after: I started waking up early, built a consistent morning routine with workouts and yoga, and began eating healthy. I’m focusing more on my personal growth and learning — I’ve been exploring global markets, finance, and the stock market. My screen time on my phone is now barely an hour a day, and on my laptop, I’m mainly learning productive skills like basic Excel, Tally, QuickBooks, and more.  Why all this change?  Because a few months ago, it felt like my world had ended. I went through a really painful incident about four months back. For 2-3 months, I kept trying to move on, but it just got worse.  Before all this, I was a very talkative person, good at academics (not trying to brag). I had joined CA (Chartered Accountancy). Just a month into it, that incident hit me like a train  unexpected and brutal. I stopped going to regular classes. Life suddenly felt meaningless. I even fell physically sick for a week. I was completely overwhelmed — personally, emotionally, academically. It hurt more because it all ended without any closure.  But now?  I think I’ve finally come out the other side. I’ve realized I’ve got nothing to lose anymore. From here on, it's all about gaining. That’s the mindset I carry now.  What have I started doing?  I love helping people. And helping doesn’t always mean money. Sometimes, it’s just appreciating someone’s efforts. Sometimes, it’s being there for someone who’s lost, stressed about their future, or stuck in life. I want to be that small light in their darkness.  I’ve even tried helping a few people here (and if you’re one of them, don’t feel awkward). I just want to say this: there’s so much more to life than just these things. You never know who out there just needs a little push, a little light.  Dui din ko jindagi ma marera laanu k nai xa rw.

            "body": "One another question. Am I the bad daughter?   In 2013 (I was 10) my parents, my brother and I immigrated to Australia. My dad never wanted to come but my mother convinced him  When we arrived, I was homesick until 2018. Same for my dad My bro is 9 years younger than me so he not care.  Now it’s 2025 and my father still really wants to go back to Nepal  Deeply.  Me? I love it here now. Yes racism sucks but except for that I’m happy here and I still studying. My father has sacrificed soo much for me  He’s an amazing father, and would do anything to make me happy. He loves me unconditionally, and would put me above himself. Even if he doesn’t benefit from it.  My father isn’t happy here  It’s been over 10 years and he’d say that if I said I wanna go back he’ll book in ticket immediately. But he never forced me to go back or stay there. He did say that once my brother is old enough to take care of himself he will go back to Nepal and visit every 6 months or so.  However. My grandmother (mom side) told me the conversation between her and my dad.  Everyone in my family knows my dad hates it here.  So my grandma is like (sweet polite tone) “Tell your father this. ‘Dad, if I go to Nepal with you are you gonna come with me as well?’ If you say this your father will be the happiest person on earth. He’s here because of you. He wants to go back to Nepal. I even told him —just him to leave you guys and come back. But he refused as he doesn’t want to leave his family here”  I then said “dad’s gonna go back on the ten years anyway. That’s what he said”  Grandma “he said to test you. Just come live in Nepal, for  this country you’re always gonna be an immigrant. Your dad will be happy. Your mother is too stubborn”   Me “but, I like it here”  Grandma  “Do you love your dad or not? He’s done so much for you. He works 12 hours everyday. He’s 53 now. Come to Nepal. I’ve got money to pay for your school fees”  That’s when the guilt hit me. Yes dad works over 10 hours  And yes it’s especially hard in the hot son as he’s an engineer.  Yes my dad doesn’t like it heere and he’s much happier everytime we’re in Nepal.  My dad did say “we should’ve gone to Nepal when my daughter (me) was still homesick” But I’m 23 now  And I don’t wanna go back to Nepal. But I love my father. He’s an amazing person who’s gone through so much.  But I see my future here. Knowing my dad, he cannot live without me and if I say “I want to go back to Nepal” he’ll happily book a ticket and go. So it seems like I got the “power” but I hate it. I feel like a horriable person and failed as a daughter. On one hand I see my future here and I like it here. On the other hand I wanna see my father happy  I told my cousin about this and here’s what she said “Your dad is 50 now. He’s been sacrificing you for your whole life. Don’t let me stop you but if I was in your place, I’d come to Nepal for your father. It is your duty as the oldest child to make sure he has the safe retirement Once your father is here you can go back. Finish your bachelors”  I hate it. Also my grandma isn’t a bad person  My aunties  1 is in US 2 are in Canada  And 1 is in Nepal  So grandma lives Alone The auntie that’s in Nepal stays with her.  So Idk what to do I’ve got an Australian license. I’ve built a life here  I’m studying and don’t work atm  I’m an Australian citizen I wanna cry. I feel like I’ve failed as a daughter.",

            "comments": "Your dad also probably doesn't  expect you to sacrifice your career and life that you are building in Australia. If he has worked so hard for you all these time he definitely understands that. Don't listen to others opinion and have a proper talk with your dad, that's the only way to navigate through this dilemma. Best of luck hope everything works out in your favor.|||U have family in Nepal that care about your father. U have lived in Australia for more than u lived in Nepal. I'm sure ur family here had good in their hearts in regards to your father but they also can't expect u to uproot your whole life for it.|||Nope ur not. as much as what your dad has done for u is undeniable but ur your own person not him or his extension. Ur free to choose as you like. Would it make him happy if u agreed? Of course. But that's your choice to make.|||Hey, Nepal aara 1/2 mahina basera farkine ho vane ramro xa afanta vetinxa garinxa but permanently are you sure? Almost everyone is tryna flee the country.You are in the position many people want to.|||live your life. Just tell your dad that if he is happy in Nepal, he should go there. You can be happy in Aus, he can be happy in Nep. Both of you can visit each other every so often. It's time for you to leave the nest anyways.|||No. Anyone who says \"oh your dad's done so much for you\" and tries to blackmail you is a terrible person.   Also, move to Nepal and do what? You grew up in Australia.. you're more in touch with Australia than you are with Nepal...   Its a parent's job to provide for their children... they're not doing you as a favor, that's literally their responsibility.  Maybe once he's older then sure, if you want to take care of him go ahead. But he's a fully capable man, fully capable of living on his own.   You're only 23, you should be traveling, having fun, focusing on your career.. not worrying about what people in Nepal think.|||Grandmom sounds like a manipulative person tbh hearing your replies and stuff.  Baru have an open convo with your dad with what your grandmom is saying.  Do you really think he’d want you to sacrifice your education, career, your life after he’s worked to hard all his life to provide for you?|||Your father isn’t that old. He can definitely live alone (if he doesn’t have anyone here in Nepal) for 15 years at least and you both can visit each other in the meantime.|||Looking at your replies to other comments, it seems like you have already made up your mind. Are you just here looking for validation that you are right?|||Whats wrong coming here for a while, mountains are calling anyway.|||Think about your future is what I will say.       Let's say your entire family migrates back to Nepal and you and your brother fail to have a  good future here.        Do you think your father will be happy?       He will blame himself.       So will you after some times.           Convince your dad to take long vacations in Nepal now and then.        That will help ease the homesickness.   Don't let your emotions ruin your future ahead.     |||It’s simple: J sukai gara! It doesn’t matter. There is no right or wrong options here. You are a nice daughter anyways since you are thinking for him, thinking about him. Nothing else matters. Tetai basey ni it’s good. Farkey ni it’s good. No need to listen to many people and make it complicated.|||Your dad will understand that you can make your own choices. Bela mauka ma Nepal aaunu, ani your dad can come to Australia once in a while.   Another solution is get married and have few children. Tes pachhi ta your dad and others will understand. |||If you can earn good money in Nepal, return. If you can't, just tell that to father.|||Your dad took you to Australia when you were 10 , you didn’t get to choose what you wanted. Now you are 23 and he and his family is manipulating you to move back to Nepal. Sorry girl, but you are being played like a ping pong ball here. Kaile kata kaile kata. I know you love him tara at the end of the day it is your life. If you don’t like it in Nepal you will never forgive your dad coz you will feel like he caused that misery and maybe your relationship with him will also go down hill. You need to have a proper conversation with him and let him choose. He can’t have both haath ma laddu, you plus his want to go back to Nepal. For once, be selfish and choose what you want.|||if you can afford, you can come to Nepal with your family and enjoy a vacation here but not fast paced khale. Spare some time like a month or so and enjoy a laid back life for some days. He is probably exhausted being in a foreign land. But you can have your own preferences of living here or there permanently.|||I have seen many cases like that. Send your father Nepal for few years I bet you $1000 he will be back to Australia. My friend family leave USA for good because his parents wanna go back to Nepal. They purchase land and properties and lived for 3 years in Nepal but they’re back again in US after selling their house and land.   They can’t live without their kids. And their kids basically grown up in US. They love and know US more then they know about Nepal.|||Your dad ‘sacrificed’ for you, you will ‘sacrifice’ for your kid, such is life. I am sure your dad understands this. Stop letting old people guilt trip you to do things you aren’t comfortable doing. Talk to your dad! Always remember, most of us internet strangers are stupid af, especially in this sub, so take every comment here with a grain of salt.|||honestly i haven't read half of what you have written but i will say:  We all acknowledge your father love toward his motherland. but nepal isn't so good in condition rn basic facilites are expensive and hard to get. So stay there now for the sake of your brother and when you start to earn to support your family send your parents here the facilites maybe less but the pleasure is unmatched anywhere in the world. and seeing your condition you might me a australian citizen even so visit nepal sometimes and never forget your motherland and who you are.   \\[Just some emotional and logical dialogues your father will melt thinking my daughter is matured enough to say this and stay happily.\\]   you can dm if you want any help. :)|||I'm kind of in the same situation as you, same age but male in Canada. Both of my parents are pushing 50 and want to go back to Nepal and take me with them, but I've chosen to live here and let them go back to Nepal when my little brother is grown up. The reason is very simple, there is absolutely no future for me in Nepal and recent events merely strengthen my resolve to stay in a developed country.   I know my parents have worked hard for many years to raise me and my brother, but I know that if I choose to leave my career and life here for Nepal, I will have to work just as hard in a country that does not reward hard work and dedication like a developed country like Canada or Australia does.  Another reason for you to not go back if your gender. You have more rights and freedoms in Australia than you do in Nepal, and you might not get used to the regressive expectations that native Nepalis have for women.|||No offense, but it seems like she's engaging in some extremely manipulative behavior.   P.S. I don't know the whole story. This is just the feeling I got from reading this post. I might be completely wrong.|||You father will not want to destroy your life and career and come to Nepal. Stay there make a good living come back 10 yrs later retire early.|||I talked with my mother recently about their early life in Australia and she struggled with the adjustment, especially since she is the social one of my parents. Only after 10-15 years in Australia did her feelings adjust and after 25 years of living here has she shifted her preference for country of retirement.   Nepal has had so many changes that the environment they are nostalgic about doesn't exist. They've taken so much time to assimilate as NRN Australians that they don't want to do it again if they were permanently returning to Nepal.   Anyway, Asian cultures have a history of intergenerational trauma and Nepal is no exception. Obviously there is a deep rooted Nepali culture that carries through generations as well and something you should recognise is that the culture of taking care of your parents is not just being experienced by you but by your father as well.  If you ask me, your father is feeling responsible for taking care of the ageing parents in Nepal but he is split because he must also take care of his family (ie, you and bhai).   One of my dad's close friends returned to Nepal for this exact reason in his 60's and left his kids in the US because they have the capacity to be independent. My parents have said that they will follow us because we are the next generation and they will become the grandparents.|||Don’t feel anything bad about yourself. Its his decision and not yours.   Years ago he was coerced by your mom and now your grandma wants you to coerce him back to Nepal. I don’t know what it is with the ladies of your household but I think he has to make his own decision   Every parent makes  sacrifices and if you become one you will too. And what if father you go back what about your brother ? It is what it is . If he wanted to leave he should have done years ago. Complete your studies first and than think what you should do? And don’t feel guilty about anything, this situation isn’t of your making and you shouldn’t sacrifice your studies or career for this. Your father will never be able to forgive himself.|||It is hard to deal with manipulation from adult family as we get older. As children our adult family are our guides and heroes. When we grow we start to learn they are flawed people just like everyone. But learning to handle their manipulation will make you stronger. You are an adult now and allowed to make decisions about your own life and how you live it   Maybe you can find some way to help your father enjoy Australia more? Is he involved with the nepali community? Maybe he can do a hobby or a sport? Enjoy some day trips on the weekend to parks or gardens|||Don't let your dad's sacrifice go to vain. He endured to give you the opportunity, don't let it go to waste.|||Hi, I cant provide the solution. But I am an engineer and currently living in Australia. Can you ask your dad to provide job refrence to me please. That will mean alot to me. Thankyou|||Never needed to post this as your grandmother and cousin said it best but if you really want to make your happy, convince your mother to consider her husband’s happiness too as you said he’s not happy and you should complete your studies. Consult with your family about each others needs but for you tell them that you are considering to go back to Nepal temporarily but will return as even after completing studies you won’t get better job opportunities in Nepal and even then you’ll visit your family. Hope this helps",

And to those public figures who stay silent or worse, enjoy it, you are part of the problem.  Sandeep, if your heart was truly pure, you would have intervened long ago. You could have told your followers to stop this bullying and personal attack. But your silence speaks volumes. A good heart does not take pleasure in someone else’s humiliation.

He's always talked about his instance on corruption, called for investigation all the cases regardless of which party the alleged politicians belong to. He's always talked about how the top three leaders have ruined democracy and has established themselves as face of this system that has made people hate this system. He's said same thing in this interview too, and suddenly people are back to supporting him? So they actually never watched his interviews and just hopped in 'gagan hate club' or what?  If he hadn't been fighting against status quo (deuba gang) inside Nepali Congress, Gagan would've have been minister more than 6-7 times for sure. He actually should've done that in my opinion. his only executive role ever was a 9-10 month as health minister as far as I know.  Also, I might be called jholey as there are many RSP supporters here, and blame gagan for rabi being jailed which is so funny to me. you think the district courts, the high court and supreme court (which denied his habeas corpus writ) were bought? not one , not two but all three tier of courts? I don't buy that rabi is being kept in custody without any proof. Also, why did rabi not investigate Gagan for his bakhra chor case while he was home minister?",

Also I was just using twitter, and someone said that they watched the entire episode, and yes, there's nothing new. It's the same thing he has been saying since years.   I don't like this guy at all these days, and it's because he's all bark no bite kinda person. Also he dosen't speak regarding issues until last minute. Also if it's his party member involved, he won't speak at all. Even if he does, he will repeat the same old dialogue of Yes investigation must happen.   Literally few days back his party leader Deuba said without any shame that the videos from his home is nothing but AI, all those money clips are AI generated. This shows that he thinks Nepali people are nothing but fools. And this Gagane and co, non of them dared to question it. They all just accepted it. I can go on and on about how this Gagan Thapa has been silent when his party was involved. And how he will be the first to shout if opposition does anything.

Even in well-known restaurants, you don’t get a menu. You have to call staff multiple times, and when they finally come, they’re rude.    * Local leaders and youth behave like they own the place and can do whatever they want.    * Loud music in public transport and public spaces is normal.    * People get aggressive and start fights very quickly.    * If a policeman tries to enforce basic civic sense (like asking not to play loud music), people threaten him — “I’ll burn your police station.” * One time, Janakpur was known for quality education. Now it feels like the complete opposite. And the list goes on. Why don’t the people and leaders of Janakpur want to learn from other places? Why isn’t civic sense a priority for the local government? Why can’t people just be calm and respectful?",

            "body": "Lee Kuan Yew once said, “If Singapore is a nanny state, then I am proud to have fostered disciplined citizens.” Those words came from a leader who understood that progress is not built on chaos but on control, not on popularity but on principles. Singapore did not rise because of luck or slogans. It rose because its people accepted discipline, structure, and long-term vision, even when it was uncomfortable.  Nepal, sadly, seems to be heading in the opposite direction. We fought hard for democracy, for freedom, for rights. But somewhere along the way, we forgot that freedom without responsibility is self-destruction. Today, we can say anything, post anything, and do anything without consequence. What was once the voice of democracy has turned into the noise of disorder. We confuse outrage with awareness, and chaos with choice.  Look around and you will see it everywhere. People peeing on the streets, spitting in public, ignoring traffic lights, bribing officials to get their work done faster, and still blaming everything on “bad leaders.” We fail to see that corruption is not only at the top; it begins within us. Giving a bribe is as much a crime as taking one. Our crisis is not just political; it is moral and cultural.  Freedom is beautiful, but when it comes without accountability, it breeds anarchy. Discipline is not a form of oppression it is the foundation on which a nation stands. The countries we admire today, such as Singapore, China, and even post-war South Korea, built their futures on order, not outrage. They accepted strong leadership and collective discipline, even when it meant individual discomfort. The result was growth, stability, and identity.  Nepal today, however, is driven by the wrong fuel. It is driven not by discipline but by social media, emotions, and narratives. We react to everything, think about nothing, and follow whoever shouts the loudest. Our national debates happen on TikTok and Facebook, not in classrooms or parliament. The danger is not that we will run out of freedom, but that we will drown in our own noise.  I fear that we are entering an era where the populist will triumph over the professional, where emotional speeches will defeat rational ideas. It is a sad truth, but Nepal has no Lee Kuan Yew. The closest we have is Harka Sampang a man with the heart of Lee Kuan Yew but without the mind/brain to match. He symbolizes our tragedy: passion without direction, courage without structure.  Meanwhile, many citizens are busy idolizing a so-called “superhuman” sitting in jail, someone who has lived a life of controversy and even once renounced his Nepali identity. People follow him not for policy but for emotion, not for logic but for rebellion. This obsession with personalities over principles is the exact disease that destroys nations.  A country cannot be built on emotion alone. Emotions can ignite revolutions, but they cannot sustain them. Discipline, integrity, and intellect are what turn movements into nations. We need fewer loud heroes and more quiet builders people who repair roads before recording videos, who teach values before preaching patriotism, and who lead by example rather than outrage.  The truth is hard to accept, Nepal does not only lack leaders. It lacks disciplined citizens. A nation becomes strong not when its people defy the state but when both walk in balance. If citizens act responsibly and unite with shared purpose, they become more powerful than any government. But when citizens are divided by hate, driven by noise, and the state fears to enforce order, it becomes a failed one.  Unless we rediscover discipline, the very freedom we celebrate will keep destroying the nation we dream of building. Real freedom is not doing whatever we want. It is doing what is right, even when no one is watching. When looting becomes a proud moment and chaos a national celebration, it’s not freedom we’re living in; it’s decay disguised as democracy.",

There’s downsides in every country but if I can use my qualifications in Nepal that’s still some sort of development in the system. If anyone is thinking of coming to the UK for study, I would honestly say degree sakinai betikai aus/canada janu lol. A lot of people here have relocated to NZ, AUS and Canada. F the UK not worth it unless you’re a British laure or whatever.",

The background I had academically from Nepal was fine. I’m 33 of age now. My school and parents were quite strict on me so I pushed myself hard academically but I would say I wasn’t able to develop well in other skills. However there are plenty of people who are able to gain those skills in Nepal.   School was very toxic with physical and emotional abuse, discrimination, zero freedom and not very nurturing apart from just bullying you to study. I found in UK there are other opportunities, if you didn’t want to go the uni route. I also like they try to prepare you for work experience and building other hard and soft skills.  I do feel there is some change in Nepal now hopefully as I can see many young people trying different routes and perspective seem to be shifting.    I am also thinking of soft retiring and trying my luck in Nepal. Pay is definitely not comparable but the cushion you have from your savings in Uk may go a long way. I believe the pay is very basic in healthcare if you don’t own your business but may be enough to sustain yourself  I have heard of consultant doctors getting paid 50k to only 1 lakh but there is less restrictions in Nepal. It not very regulated like in Uk and a lot less rules to follow. Maybe testing it out for 6 months might give you a feel of what it’s like ? It will also depend a lot on your personality. I stayed in Nepal for 6 months and hardly missed UK but some of other friends would hate it.   Lastly, My parents managed to retire in Nepal for the last 7 years and they love it in Ktm.|||Try for Aus, Ireland or other countries first, stash 300-500k and then retire in Nepal; I know easier said than done but that's my plan as well. Nepal is absolutely the place to retire, raise kids and for people who've grown up there, there's nothing quite like it, but poverty sucks as well. So I highly recommend stashing away atleast a 100k before returning to Nepal. 100k will earn you 8-10k of interest a year which is enough for basic expenses and a job that pays 50 thousand rupees a month would be a good supplement. By retire I mean mid 30's to at most 40. If you wait any longer to return to Nepal, I feel like you've missed a good chunk of life. I know its a tall order but try to save as much as you can in the next 5-10 years and it will really enhance the QOL back home.|||As someone who  once moved back from a \"developed\" country to Nepal, only to leave again after a few years, these are my observations. I'll try and be as objective as possible.  - The work culture is different. You're expected to kowtow to your seniors and to management. There is little concern for your well-being. You can say it's not very different from the UK, but the frustration will set in when you have to make a case for every sick leave, when your performance reviews etc are decided on the basis of who you know/connect with rather than on merit. - Work-life balance is pretty much non-existent, unless you find a kind manager/supervisor. You're expected to put work before family.  - Purchasing power is obviously better and you can buy services, i.e get someone to do your chores for you, if you're so inclined.  -  Less freedom of movement. You can probably go to a seaside town or on a long drive in the UK on a day off. Good luck buying a car for transport with a nurse's salary in Nepal. If you chose to take public transport, good luck with that too. Unfortunately, you also have to watch out for yourself if you're a woman. You'll have to be more conscious of what you wear and where you go.  - International travel? Fancy a weekend trip to a different country, perhaps? Good luck! - what i found the most frustrating was the (lack of) basics and how you are expected to get along without them. Power cuts, water problems sometimes, hot showers are a luxury. Things we don't have to think twice about while living in the developed world.  - basic cleanliness. Can't enter a public restroom without coming close to puking. Even the nicest restaurants have stinky as toilets. Roads are lined with litter. You have to watch every step while walking on the roads and if it rains, the entire city/town becomes a mudpit.  - you mentioned rising racism where you are. Nepal does have a plus there- you won't be treated like a second class citizen. - i also love traveling around Nepal. It calms me and it's definitely a profound experience. But it's a lot easier to do when you are earning in dollars/pounds and travel while on paid leaves, as opposed to when you're earning in rupees.  I can go on forever, but the decision is obviously yours and your experience might be very different from mine. You might find it all rewarding and decide it was worth it in the future, once you get past the initial frustration.  Good luck with whatever you do!|||Also, how is the education system? My brother is a whole 18 years younger than me so I don’t want to absolutely ROB him of opportunities. To be honest, I do have faith in the Nepali system and I know quality comes at an extra cost (unfortunately) which I don’t mind covering because it’s just him and I’m not fussed about all that money drama. I’m set on being childless so may as well financially support his upbringing. My parents have been here since 2000 and 2003 (laure/military dependant route) and have been working ever since. My dad had an early retirement for health so it’s not been glamour, work wise army bata niklesi. I want them to be comfortable in Nepal without staying in the UK for another two decades for the little one. That’s too much labour. I have thought of keeping him here with me and letting my parents stay in Nepal but 1. They wouldn’t do that 2. He needs parents for his emotional development. Nepal is the best option. I care about my career but I also wouldn’t kill my mental health for it.   Note: For any Bhai haru looking to become British laures, PLEASE do a degree or get a qualification of some sort army ma huda because the army will pay for it. I know QGE fund engineering degrees and signals fund cybersecurity? There is not that much support after retirement and if you don’t plan ahead now, it’s hard to get by. I’ve seen it firsthand. 20 years go like a flash.|||Heyy , I know 2 of my friends who were born and brought up in US and UK and have shifted to Nepal permanently.   One from US use to work as a lawer there , she left states because she was not happy with her life style and just like u said she use to work 10 hours a day and was still not satisfied with finance and other facilities. She runs an INGO here . My second friend from UK kinda stays both the places , she shuffle between London and chitwan , she shifted here after she completed her studies , she is into technology business here .   About me . I was also born and brought up in India (not like western countries but still not Nepal ), I also shifted here some 15 years ago after I completed my graduation, my Nepali was not that fluent back then . I did face few challenges here and there in the beginning but honestly every one here is so lovely and cooperative that u will never realise the hard ship. Since then I have travelled to different parts of Nepal , have made zillions of friends and have carved my own name . I am into hospitality business here .

Just give them healthy food it's your responsibility as a parent.

But for those of us who worked there for years, the experience wasn’t as bright as the news sounds.  We went through years without increments, always being told things would get better “next quarter” or “soon,” but that day never came. The salary and facilities were far below standard, and the stock options they talked so proudly about couldn’t even be used from Nepal. They’d say there wasn’t enough money for employee salaries or even canteen bills, yet somehow there was always talk of big growth and expansion.  They didn’t even manage taxes properly in Nepal, and most of the work was done by Nepali teams who were underpaid and overlooked while the company operated from New York. “Democratize AI” sounds great on paper, but for those who actually built and supported the company from Nepal, it felt like nothing more than a marketing line.|||Neapli company ki nepali le establish gareko company?|||Which investing site is it|||not nepali company. founded by (likely ex) nepali?|||reading all these comments is hilarious, lmao nor do i endorse fuse nor i love it, if someone has done something learn to appreciate it.",

I help with initial screening sometimes and I see intern resumes with 1-2 years of experience and seriously amazing projects these days and even those aren't getting ROs. The market is heavily skewed rn, like I saw a resume with 4 years experience,  lot of official blogs and solutions published applying for an associate level position.   I say keep grinding and work on GenAI projects. That's what the upper management wants to see these days. Referrals won't be that helpful if you're getting screened out before getting a call.|||Does working as janitor at Netflix count?|||FAANG?   get some hands on experience at real companies and projects.  It's competitive and everyone else is smarter than everyone else 🙌🏽|||I think its better to communicate in indian sub Reddit|||Now I am thinking why do nepali youths are not into FAANG thing? Unlike Indians?   We are not competitive enough? OR We are not Intrested enough?|||2x summer intern in faang. Oh ur location is india.|||If you are talking about direct recruiting from Nepal,  I don't know so far, but one of my friend and senior from Nepal working at VISA with the level of pay that FAANG and all does. But we studied together at NITR, India.  The process in India itself is top, so it's real hard to get recruited from Nepalese colleges.|||Applying to FAANG from India is not worth it bro. First thing the competition is huge and second thing the pay for FAANG position in India is like what at max 1.5 to 2 Crore if you get lucky. And I seriously believe that the stress to compensation is not worth it.  If it was in the case of USA especially in the bay area, then I would say the grind was worth it because they pay ridiculously high, like even after all the tax cuts and expenses you can save around 100-150k easily in a year given your compensation is 350-400k USD per year and the position is at the bay area.  But competition is tough there too, you need PhDs and all.  But I think it's still better than India. In India nowadays almost like minimum 10 lakhs students have already mugged up at least 300-400 leetcode questions so, chances are slim there.  My advice is target for such positions where the competition is low, grind there for 3-4 years and apply as independent contractors for remote position, you can easily make above 100k if you are sharp.  Then move to Romania applying a digital nomad visa and pay only about flat 10-11% tax for your 100k plus income. Cost of living is also affordable in Romania, soon to be included into schengen and of course after 5 years apply for PR, get the passport and travel freely for vacation. (It's passport is in top ten strongest list)  And this is the most achievable goal and path for a Nepali IT specialist. Even if you get 60k USD remote job in Nepal, it's not worth it because the progressive tax system will make the effective tax to around 30-33% and all your tax for what? Into the belly of corrupt politicians.  Actually it's a bad idea to live in Nepal, the tax is too much. You pay 25% tax and 13% vat for almost everything. Forget about buying vehicles, the added cost is like price of Vehicle(100%) and 80% flat tax + 13% vat + 10-25% profit margin + extraa whatever. You pay more than double for any vehicles.  Bro I'm hoping that the new government will make Nepal similar to a tax haven nation, otherwise I'm leaving Nepal too in next couple of years myself.|||Almost all hiring in India happens through on campus placements. Look at what companies are coming to your campus and prepare for it. Thats why most people are obsessed over getting into good universities there. Off campus hiring, on the other hand, is extremely brutal. Leetcode probably won't be enough. If you're a first year/second year, I'd suggest to start doing Codeforces. You'll thank yourself later on. Don't fret over it, know that resume screening is largely arbitrary. Also, stating the obvious but apply outside of FAANG -- its not what it used to be.|||referral khasai aba work gardaina,tei level ko manche le gareko rahecha bhane work grcha on campus ma focus garaa FAANG target rakha tara oncampus placement focus gara , senior hru huna sakcha FAANG ma try to reach out senior hru le sure rply dinchaa,ma pani google ko 2ndround interview ma reject bhako ,mero sathihru chan FAANG ma opening rahecha bhane you can send me on dm i will send them they will refer you(resume impressive rahecha bhane ATS score 80+ aayeracha bhane)|||DM for referral.

Here’s where it gets worse:   I contacted customer care, and they told me to wait 24 hours for the balance to be updated. Even after 2 days, nothing happened. After following up again, they finally asked for my bank statement and transaction details. Only then was the missing amount credited to my eSewa account.  Now imagine someone in an emergency tries to load money, and the first attempt fails, but the amount is deducted. Naturally, they try again. The second attempt works, and the money is credited. But the first deducted amount remains unaccounted for unless the user remembers and takes the time to go through the whole complaint process.  This is unacceptable.

Or you could explore other options like ConnectIPS, Khalti, Bank cards, etc.  Regarding another question & concern about what problem does API solve?   \\- Assume you are running your business (selling products), as you have mentioned in the post, customers can just download the QR, pay and confirm via call or message (screenshot). For smaller scale this is feasible. But when it comes to scale, you won't be able to receive calls or verify payment screenshots of 100s of customers per day, you either need to hire more people or apply some automation. Another problem you will face is fake screenshots, order confusion, etc. Here's where APIs comes into play, once you integrate the API in your website, the API does the payment/verification part, your application (website) will connect the payment to the order, and flag the payment status as \"PAID\", you won't need to verify each and every payment. You can focus on the product and delivery.  TLDR; For small scale business, QR option with phone/message verification will work fine. For larger scale, API will help you a lot by automating the verification, and order status updates.|||Don't get it for 25k. It's negotiable.

But now, I’m in a dilemma: should I pursue my Master’s in Nepal or go abroad (thinking USA or Australia)? My long term goal is to land a solid job in the IT with a good package (around 4–5 lakh/month), and build strong network.  If I stay in Nepal, I can probably manage an IT job alongside my Master's and even try applying for remote jobs abroad later on.

Whereas, if I go abroad (Targeting USA/AUS), I might be benefited with great exposure, networking, etc. But what I fear is I might not get to focus on studies and even IT altogether due to side job (Non IT) that we have to do for survival there. And I might get diverted from tech to other domain of jobs. Let me know if its not the case. What I want is to stay in IT domain.  So, what should be the best approach for my target?

I don't think masters in Nepal is worth it since its as you stated; not so serious and doesn't open much doors but even abroad i don't think degree alone does that. The degree doesn't do it abroad but the location might do it depending on where you go to study.  So I decided that if I am joining masters then its going to be somewhere nice and I won't have to worry about basic survival needs. So to have a better understanding of the whole thing and also to have some financials setup, I decided to take a gap year, work for a year or so, do some research on where i can get universities with either full scholarships or close to that (including assistantship or RA/TA positions).

I managed to grow an Instagram page in the entertainment and infotainment niche to over 55K followers, and even built a small SaaS website for my audience. I was really excited to try something new, but after losing $10 on a domain, I had to pause it for now. Still, it was a fun project and I learned a lot from it.  As a content creator, I don’t think I wasted my time at all. I got hands-on experience with Canva, video editing, and engaging with my audience. I even collaborated with an app (though I didn’t get paid), but it helped me understand how brand deals work. Later, I built and deployed a subscription-based website but never launched it because I doubted if anyone would actually pay for it.  I also tried posting on Facebook as i was eligible for monetization, but things didn’t go as expected. None of my 25–30 posts or reels even crossed 100 views, and more than half got copyright claims. It was a bit frustrating, especially since I was used to getting 8–53 million monthly views on Instagram.  Now I’m just looking for a job where I can use the skills I’ve learned: content creation, photo and video editing, Canva, social media growth, content strategy, and web development. I’ve learned how to understand audience behavior, spot trends early, and manage online communities, and I’m excited to bring all that experience into a real job.",

The only person who publicly embarrassed Business as usual are Business as usual owner himself.  You talk about “mocking your life”. Bro, you mocked your own career the day your name hit those headlines and carbon. You think people forgot how much damage your scandal caused to Nepali environment? To the very customer who used to buy your product?  Now you’re crying about “character assassination.”  aka carbon tax.   You assassinated your own character long ago with carbon pollution and refusal to polluter pay fee. Greenpeace didn’t need to lift a finger; they just reminded people what you did.  And “psychological pressure”? You mean the same kind of pressure your controversy dumped on an entire country that once adored you? The same customer who had to defend consumerim and capitalism and privat business ownership while you were hiding behind lawyers and Facebook posts?  Let’s be real, you’re not being defamed, you’re just being remembered and reminded of your past Carbon emission and GHGs you have ever emitted.   You’re not being bullied, you’re being held accountable and pay fair share.  And that “Shame on you, GreenPeace” line? Cute.   Because honestly, the only person who needs to feel shame here is you for buying leaders and avoiding taxes.   You lost your respect, your reputation, and your credibility, and instead of owning up, you’re out here trying to sound deep on Facebook and social medai. Bro, that’s not redemption. That’s delusion. Customer are always right. This earth belong to us the whole world not for one corporation to benefit at the expense of other.   So stop acting like the world owes you sympathy and our tax credit.   You’re not the victim, you’re the reason this whole mess even exists. aka climate change.|||Jindagi ma fasle accusation chahi kosailai nalagos bhagwan, not talking about sandip , ekchoti testo case lagyo bhane nagareko bhayeni dukha paine chai raicha!

I agree that we have seen many rich and high power people get away with any crime. But let me remind you some cases : Maina Sunuwar, Rabi Lammichanne and other where everyone praised the court and claimed justice stood.Even you might know many of the cases  What I find uncomfortably troubling is that  People have been shifting their narrative about the court in whatever comforts them. Literally what Rabi did : When big politicians got GUITY from the court he said \"adalat le vaneko namanne?\"  When it was his turn he said every court is corrupt trying to get away. We are facing a same scenario here. Firstly the case was approached from a minor consent. And as far i believe the age couldn't be proven to be under 18. So this might have been a consensual sex.|||Maile timilai euta kunai case lagaidiye vane timi criminal vayou?

The day that couple spent the night together, next day aayera afnai room mate sanga ekdum excited bhayera Kura gareko cha. A few weeks later gayera case haleko cha. Usko roommate ko statement sunnu paila.   First ma statutory rape bhanyo, which was a massive one. Tyo case ho Bhane Sandeep should rot in jail.

Tyo pani when you go through the whole thing, it is pretty easy to make it out that the girl was trying to mint money out of Sandeep. It was a honey trap Bhanera ta sabai lai tha cha.   I don’t know Sandeep personally and don’t care if he’s arrogant or k k. It doesn’t matter. Because that’s not why he’s defamed.   Aba you’ll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re. Harek din naya bayaan and naya kahaani. Kt party ko main intention nai was to get as much of compensation as possible rather than punishing Sandeep.   And brought shame to our cricketing fraternity rey? Yo statement batai it’s easy to assume ki yo post garne eauta kti ho, ki jindagi ma lukera basne kta ho or Bharkhar ko fucche ho.  Even Cristiano Ronaldo was accused of rape numerous times. Eauta case ta it’s ekdummai severe. That girl immediately told her friends and filed lawsuit walla. Sandeep ko ta proper honeytrap thyo, Ronaldo had an actual case against him. But bail payo, where he still continued with his career. Unlike Sandeep, Ronaldo continued with his career. Pachi final verdict afnai favor ma payo.   So did he bring shame to Portugal? To Real Madrid? (at the time of the case) Ani Sandeep le chai kasari?   You put yourself in his shoes. You go out on a date with someone. Everything seems perfect, you guys kiss hug and spend an amazing time together. Belka you guys stay out ani make out. Bholi you drop her home. Then you go out for your work, ani bahira huda nai after a few weeks you find out that girl has filed a complaint for rape against you. What would you do?

            "body": "I always thought my life was done for. I was a bad son and a bad brother. I let my family down so many times that they eventually kicked me out. Fair enough, I couldn’t offer them anything except shame and duniya ko tana. I’ve heard things like “Yesto xora janmaunu vanda na janmekai thik hunthyo”. Those words used to hurt me a lot, but still I couldn’t change.  I’ve done many wrong things in life which i regrets . Been to jail a few times, have criminal charges, got rusticated from college because of fights, couldn’t complete my bachelor. Friends betrayed me too they were only there when they could use me. As time passed, I got more depressed. Most of the time, only suicidal thoughts used to come to my mind. I had no place to stay, used to sleep where I worked or sometimes on the street.  One day I finally decided I’d had enough. Bought a mouse poison, tried to take my life. But at the very last moment I was too scared to die. I cried for a long time that night. I realized how miserable I had become to even think of doing that.  But that night I also realized something  maybe I’m not done yet. Maybe there’s still a small ray of hope. I still wanted to live, and live a good life. I had only two options: either change myself completely or kill myself. I couldn’t choose the second option.  So I started working hard doing different odd jobs. Quitted smoking and drinking at once it was so hard. I used to get worst panic attacks, but I managed.   Now I’ve been clean for a year. I have my own small room to live in, my own second-hand bike, and I earn through a ride-sharing app. I also started self-studying because I couldn’t finish my bachelor. Been learning programming from YouTube for two months now. It’s tough, but I’m thinking of joining classes soon. Someone told me you don’t need a college degree to become a software developer, and that really motivated me.  I even tried to apply abroad, but because of my police record it wasn’t possible. So now I just want to become someone respectable in my own country. I want to prove my father wrong. They still don’t know where I am, but one day I’ll go to them when they can proudly call me their son.  It feels unreal sometimes that I have my own room, my own food, my own bike , own laptop(second hand😁) all this within just one year. I can’t believe it. A year ago, I wanted to die. Now I just want to live better. Even though I'm alone , It really feels like dream to live like this.   Happy Happy tihar everyone and happy  bhaitika. Aja didi ko kasto yaad aayo!!

Both were done by the West through TV and meta apps, and yet we are too stubborn to see it because of our ego. And still, people want to die for those- they worship blindly, but not for their own kings. Kings -especially the Shah dynasty, were the true heirs of this country. They are literally the founders of this nation, and yet this generation doesn’t realize it.   If we don’t realize why we are in a mess today, then we shouldn’t call the UN for help when things get worse in the future and believe me, it will. And the matter of fact, the UN doesn’t truly exist for justice; pedo-elites are at the top hierarchy.  We are not a developed country because we try to copy the West and their agendas to go against India and China, which are now two supergiants. The media also played its part well, creating division through religion, caste, and gender. Nothing like that should exist in a free world. God is one source-energy and eternal, yet we are too brainwashed to see the truth.  This isn’t the same Nepal that we once cherished and loved. Our history is slowly turning into ashes, and we’re enjoying every bit of it without understanding the true hidden agendas. We always say \"Sati le sarape ko desh\" but we never tried to search for truth and be educated of our history. This is the real Kaliyug, but I still hope we prevail over this chaos, not only Nepal but all over the world where humanity is going downhill.|||still his prediction match 🤣",

All of them give bullshit why king is necessary,  doing stage talk where they bring their own people and do prentend interview. They talk bullshit and conclude why king is necessary in the end.

The Sept 8-9 movement is against corrupt politicians and their cronies, the ask was simple make public institutions trustworthy, give us reason to stay in Nepal work, live and be happy. \"Life, Liberty and Pursuit of Happiness\" which is literally the core of people's democracy.

Do you really think at this moment you are not slave ? Bro this is a problem with democracy. Democracy work in such a way that it seems like democracy but it is dictatorship. During the removal of monarchy just see how many people died there and now see how many people die. You can see the clear difference. After the end of monarchy the king silently returned but now see the attitude of this KP baze. The is pretending to be greater then king. So Who is the king? And are you a slave or not now? I am also not pro monarchy but if you could build a democratic system which is really a democratic then it's Great. But the single fact is, it is not possible. About Hindu rastha I am a  Atheist. But still I support Hindu rastha. Do you know why. The first step to break any country is to remove the pride for there culture and religion. So the establishment of Christianity is not random it is heavily planned. So Just to protect the country I am with Hindu rastha even being atheist.Yep monarchy was not good and evil before but I think it will work better cause of fear of People. They saw many people protest and Foreign intervention. So I hove they can rule better. And what's different in the political party and Monarchy. Only one difference, Political party is for certain time so they have the concept to just take a bribe and collect a lot of money for future retirement and there children. But for King they are permanent and there pride is associated from the standard of their country. One person of 100billion dollar networth VS a King with 100billiondollar GDP. In this case the king will have more pride. At last I don't know whether the monarchy will be good for our country or not but I know It can never go more worst than this. Edit:    Also one point is Our country Just need Stability and some long term vision. Other Development can be easily done by the youth of Nepal.|||Raja Huda, ko chai slave thyo ra pahila 🤔|||Gyanu le affai ma aaudina vandai cha ta. Kina attirako bro",

            "body": "The Patan High Court acquitted Sandeep Lamichhane on May 15, 2024, overturning the Kathmandu District Court's December 2023 conviction and January 2024 eight-year sentence.  The court's reasoning, centered on insufficient evidence to prove rape, the victim's adult status (**not a minor**), and contextual factors suggesting **consent** or ulterior motives rather than coercion. And she was 18 and he was 22 during the time of the incident.  Here are the details released by the court about the case:  1. Victim was 18+ and lied about her age 2. The girl checked into the room while Sandeep was parking, and they were holding hands leaving the hotel after the alleged rape based on CCTV evidence reviewed by the court. 3. The girl had a boyfriend and told her roommate she needed sponsorship from Sandeep 4. The accuser asked her roommate to lie to her boyfriend about her whereabouts.  5. While out with Sandeep, the roommate checked in; accuser said everything was going well, with no distress signals. 6. She lied to the roommate about returning home, saying Sandeep would drop her at a friend's place to hide spending the night. 7. The roommate testified that, upon returning the next morning, the victim appeared joyful and soon began enthusiastically following Lamichhane's cricket matches. 8. The roommate overheard the victim on a phone call post-fallout (after Lamichhane left for cricket abroad without fulfilling promises), discussing extracting \"at least 10-15 lakhs\" via a legal case. 9. The roommate (a key witness) provided the bulk of behavioral and motive evidence during appeal hearings. Combined with CCTV (demanding voluntary check-in/exit), social media logs (victim-initiated contact), and lack of physical proof of force, it led to the **clean acquittal.**  Plus, **fck Paradigm TV** and the brain rot content and 'influencers' that they promote in their channel. I noticed their viewership is slowly dying, so this controversy might be a good thing for them to become a little relevant but the audience are smarter now and see right through these people.",

One advice that always resounded to me by a friend was \"So you think life's unfair? There's people that haven't been a kilometer within to a chau chau wrapper. So next time you resort to it, learn to put your head down, and look for that light in the end of the tunnel\". I'm afraid I'm in no position to type in devnagiri, but it sounded even more rousing in Nepali.  Your mileage may vary. But acknowledging you have a chance to make something out of yourself is concrete, palpable, and actionable.  Make no mistake, I hate mincing words: when depressed, remember all the lives that are designated to a mere existence, not the ones that thrive. It'll remind you to be motivated enough to put yourself out of that circumstance.  Here's an advice: Get to a point where you're able to self sustain. Sure, the few years are going to suck, but you'll be happier. Move out of there asap.|||There are people who actually read it all. Leave it be such comments. Rant here often and vent it out , take advice  If it's the environment that's toxic to you , you have no option but to have acceptance of it being such and then changing the very environment is the only way you can thrive again in life .  You have to find the way out . Make the change . Be determined.  The darkness and spiral of depressive mind will try to bring things down but you have to be stronger than that. There is no other way .

            "body": "Sandy, you really outdid yourself this time. One day you’re “protecting your dignity,” the next you’re lecturing YouTubers about morality while your own fanbase floods the internet with threats and abuse in your name. Irony called; it wants its crown back.  Let’s get real. Paradygm didn’t invent your controversy, **you** did. And now, instead of introspection, we get a Facebook rant about “conspiracies” and “character assassination.” No, Sandy. That’s not a conspiracy. That’s a consequence. You can’t play the victim of public opinion when you wrote the script yourself.  And the funniest part? The same Sandy who’s crying about people “mocking” his life is now silently watching his stans do exactly that to the women and creators who merely scratched the surface of the topic. Harassment, rape threats, mockery, insults, death wishes, all in your defence. So tell me, Sandy, are you going to post another essay about that? Or does “shame on you” only apply when someone else talks back?  The women and creators you’ve defamed aren’t sitting quietly. They will be documenting everything, the messages, the threats, the slander. And if needed, they’ll file actual cases of actual defamation, unlike a mere mention of your rape charges in a YouTube video.  Defamation, online harassment, cyberbullying, death threats, rape threats, and name-calling. Real legal action, not dramatic Facebook paragraphs. You will suffer because of your actions.  So, Sandy, here’s a tip: before you start crying “assassination of character,” maybe stop letting your followers do the same thing you claim to hate. You’re not the victim of a smear campaign; you’re the author of your own downfall.  Keep talking, Sandy. Every post digs the hole deeper. And this time, it’s not the internet that’ll judge, it’s the law, the people who know what defamation is and what's not.",

He was defamed by the guests and he pointed it out.  The girl is definitely playing victim card and have not even apologized. She mentioned a personal case so cheaply in the show.

When you are a public personality and say something so insensitive, there are always frustrated people in the society to spit all the hate and abuse. Not everyone is capable to be a celebrity/influencer. Its not for everyone. Even though, she did not deserve this abuse it is the reality of society. HATE IS FOR THE WEAK someone said.  And to people telling that its all boys. No there are girls as well. Being the case that there are most of the boys who are commenting, it is because the audience of cricket is primarily boys in Nepal.

He might've been acquitted by the court upon appeal, but that does not prove his innocence. It is so frustrating how the burden of proof is upon the victim.    Fans acting as if his cricket skills makeup for the fact that he raped a minor and if you don't believe it, he still had sex with a barely 18-year-old girl, who was poor and star struck by the guy. This happens way too often where athletes misuse their fame and influence.    We are not unaware of how easily influential people in Nepal get away with anything, they've gotten away with hit-and-runs, DUIs, this is only a rape of a girl, they already care less. It is disgusting how he was even allowed to play and still represented Nepal while he had an ongoing case. This is why victims don't come forward.    But of course guys would have no regard for that girl, because for most guys the number of rapes happening is merely a statistic BUT for almost every woman, it is a reality that they could be exposed to at any time. I definitely believe the girl more, I think she was a victim.       People complain about false allegations but according to studies, \"False rape allegations are rare, with studies consistently finding that approximately 2% to 10% of reports are proven false. Rigorous research indicates the rate is typically between 2% and 8%. The perception that false allegations are common is largely a myth that can discourage real victims from reporting sexual violence.\" Rape allegations ruin a woman's life more than it ruins a man, even though he's the perpetrator! The victims rarely get justice and the rapists still get to live their life out large.

No. From my perspective, any individual who weren't okay with the comments passed on them, whether a girl or a guy, has a right to express their dissatisfaction. And I think they should too. So that this won't be an issue in upcoming days, and anyone would think twice before commenting and degrading someone ON A PUBLIC PLATFORM.   Regarding Sandeep case, they used the name of Sandeep, and commented on him. A man of his public fame, you are bound to get the public reaction. If you say he is good, you might have gotten praises from the herd public, but you tried to say 'dark jokes' on his expense. He expressed his dissatisfaction and then came the HUGE public reaction.   I don't know why most are saying girls cannot choose who to date, or say I don't want to date him. I don't think this is the reason. **The comments passed regarding 'why', and the laughters were the reason.** If there were no such comments, I don't think such huge support would have garnered on his favor.   And I also saw those saying Sandeep should save those girls from online harassment, else he is worse. I kind of agree that he could, but he SHOULD? I don't know about that. Do I support such harassment or comments on them? NO. All of them saying 'violent' threats should be prosecuted. If the ladies want to, they can complaint, and express their dissatisfaction too. It is very valid, and I would be supportive of it too. But when you are okay with commenting about big personalities, I believe you should expect the wave of reactions you might get. Good or bad.|||yo dekhaera slut shaming justify garna khojeko hora|||Maile ta hijo matra thaha payeko yesto cringe YouTube channel ni exist garxa vanera|||kta haru majak garira ho. seriously naliu naa😂😂😜🤪|||I dont understand why was sushila karki in that episode sala clout ko lagi j pani content re|||frrrr|||Hypocrisy of who exactly?

I love exploring the world, meeting people, understanding life, and actually working for society. Engineering feels like endless calculations, IT and physics don’t excite me anymore, and law… I just can’t spend years memorizing articles and stressing over licenses. I also don’t want to do BSW/BASW because too many people struggle to find work after that.  I want a bachelor’s where I can study and work at the same time since my family do not earn well and I definitely have to look after my family after 12.

Try to answer all 1 mark questions correctly otheriwse A+ aaudaina. Then in 4 mark qn, I wrote 2 lines of introduction (definition) then I skipped a line and wrote \"The related points are below\" I wrote 6 points then concluded in 2 lines. That should cover 75% of the page. Start every 4 and 7 mark QN from a new page. In 7 mark qn, I wrote around a para of introduction then 12 points then a paragraph of conclusion.   3. In Nepali, get all the grammar correct and try to maintain the answer sheet clean. Decent length ans will get you an A+   4. Maths ra Opt maths ma ta tei practice gare pugi halxa.

The funding that has been availed through Carbon Purchase as well as NGOs and INGOs have also played a critical role. I don't remember exactly, but UNDP or something published a really great report on the success of community forests and improvement of forested areas in Nepal.   Actually Nepal despite everything and has had excellent metrics when it comes to nature and biodiversity conservation.|||Folks who grew up in the 90s may remember efforts put into forest conservation through media. Maha Jodi ko BannPale. Impressionable ads like an old woman carrying doko vari ko daura and wondering “Aja lai ta taryo voli k garne?” We have done a lot in the field of forest and wildlife conservation.

This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it. You can hear the news for development work and of NEA cannot cut down the trees easily, yup that is because of same strong protective law.|||It’s because of movement of people and reliance on gas, concrete instead of timber.|||No , it’s a result of migration of people from hills to concentrated cities and Terai .

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts.

No confirmed sighting.   No verified proof of life.   No closure.      Two years have passed; two years of waiting, diplomatic efforts, and hope refusing to fade.      Today, reports have emerged suggesting he may no longer be alive.   But even now, there is no definitive evidence; only assessments, assumptions, and silence.      His family still holds on.   Nepal still waits.   And many of us wonder: how different might things have been?      If Bipin were from a more powerful nation, would the world have moved faster?   If he held a different passport, would there be answers by now?   If every life were valued equal, would this post even need to exist?      Bipin’s story is not just one of tragedy.   It is a reflection of how quiet lives are often overlooked,   how conflict steals not just people, but peace itself.      We continue to hope.   We continue to speak.   Because silence is not an option.",

They called the “earn and learn” program an internship, likely just to bypass foreign employment laws. In reality, it was pure exploitation. From what I’ve read, students were made to work five days a week in questionable conditions and study only one. I wouldn’t be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.  I just hope this changes with the new government.|||i thought hamas was fighting gaza right after they kill him i think they just sick isreal PM both are shit they just want control people.. fucking hate hamas|||Sad|||I'm Israeli, sadly his DNA was diagnosed and was believed to die in the first months of the war R.I.P Bipin|||Vayo vayo pugyo,  He is dead, confirmed by Israel and hamas both.

While most countries have been struggling with deforestation, Nepal somehow managed to reverse the trend.  A few key reasons:  * **Community Forestry Program** — locals manage and protect their own forests instead of the central government. * **Rural-Urban Migration** — many farmlands were abandoned as people moved to cities or abroad for work, letting nature reclaim them. * **Alternative Energy** — more use of biogas and LPG means less dependence on firewood. * **Reforestation & Conservation** — national parks, reserves, and local planting drives helped too.  Now nearly **45% of Nepal’s total land** is covered by forests — up from around **25% in the early 1990s**.  Pretty wild, right?   What do you think — is community-led management the real key here, or did urban migration play a bigger role?

The guy *never* talks about KP Oli, UML’s corruption, or even the brutal killing of protesting students. Not a single strong word.  But the moment it’s about Balen or the current government, he suddenly becomes super active — posting videos, making speeches, calling everyone out. Like, where was all this energy when students were being beaten or when Oli was selling out the country’s interests?  It’s like he selectively targets whoever’s in power now, just to look “anti-establishment,” while conveniently staying silent about the past. If he really cared about truth and justice, he’d call out *all* sides — not just pick easy targets for clout.  Feels like he’s slowly turning into just another political opportunist hiding behind the “independent” tag.",

The salary and facilities were far below standard, and the stock options they talked so proudly about couldn’t even be used from Nepal. They’d say there wasn’t enough money for employee salaries or even canteen bills, yet somehow there was always talk of big growth and expansion.  They didn’t even manage taxes properly in Nepal, and most of the work was done by Nepali teams who were underpaid and overlooked while the company operated from New York. “Democratize AI” sounds great on paper, but for those who actually built and supported the company from Nepal, it felt like nothing more than a marketing line.|||Neapli company ki nepali le establish gareko company?|||Which investing site is it|||not nepali company. founded by (likely ex) nepali?|||reading all these comments is hilarious, lmao nor do i endorse fuse nor i love it, if someone has done something learn to appreciate it.",

I help with initial screening sometimes and I see intern resumes with 1-2 years of experience and seriously amazing projects these days and even those aren't getting ROs. The market is heavily skewed rn, like I saw a resume with 4 years experience,  lot of official blogs and solutions published applying for an associate level position.   I say keep grinding and work on GenAI projects. That's what the upper management wants to see these days. Referrals won't be that helpful if you're getting screened out before getting a call.|||Does working as janitor at Netflix count?|||FAANG?   get some hands on experience at real companies and projects.  It's competitive and everyone else is smarter than everyone else 🙌🏽|||I think its better to communicate in indian sub Reddit|||Now I am thinking why do nepali youths are not into FAANG thing?

But we studied together at NITR, India.  The process in India itself is top, so it's real hard to get recruited from Nepalese colleges.|||Applying to FAANG from India is not worth it bro. First thing the competition is huge and second thing the pay for FAANG position in India is like what at max 1.5 to 2 Crore if you get lucky. And I seriously believe that the stress to compensation is not worth it.  If it was in the case of USA especially in the bay area, then I would say the grind was worth it because they pay ridiculously high, like even after all the tax cuts and expenses you can save around 100-150k easily in a year given your compensation is 350-400k USD per year and the position is at the bay area.  But competition is tough there too, you need PhDs and all.  But I think it's still better than India. In India nowadays almost like minimum 10 lakhs students have already mugged up at least 300-400 leetcode questions so, chances are slim there.  My advice is target for such positions where the competition is low, grind there for 3-4 years and apply as independent contractors for remote position, you can easily make above 100k if you are sharp.  Then move to Romania applying a digital nomad visa and pay only about flat 10-11% tax for your 100k plus income. Cost of living is also affordable in Romania, soon to be included into schengen and of course after 5 years apply for PR, get the passport and travel freely for vacation. (It's passport is in top ten strongest list)  And this is the most achievable goal and path for a Nepali IT specialist. Even if you get 60k USD remote job in Nepal, it's not worth it because the progressive tax system will make the effective tax to around 30-33% and all your tax for what? Into the belly of corrupt politicians.  Actually it's a bad idea to live in Nepal, the tax is too much. You pay 25% tax and 13% vat for almost everything. Forget about buying vehicles, the added cost is like price of Vehicle(100%) and 80% flat tax + 13% vat + 10-25% profit margin + extraa whatever. You pay more than double for any vehicles.  Bro I'm hoping that the new government will make Nepal similar to a tax haven nation, otherwise I'm leaving Nepal too in next couple of years myself.|||Almost all hiring in India happens through on campus placements. Look at what companies are coming to your campus and prepare for it. Thats why most people are obsessed over getting into good universities there. Off campus hiring, on the other hand, is extremely brutal. Leetcode probably won't be enough. If you're a first year/second year, I'd suggest to start doing Codeforces. You'll thank yourself later on. Don't fret over it, know that resume screening is largely arbitrary. Also, stating the obvious but apply outside of FAANG -- its not what it used to be.|||referral khasai aba work gardaina,tei level ko manche le gareko rahecha bhane work grcha on campus ma focus garaa FAANG target rakha tara oncampus placement focus gara , senior hru huna sakcha FAANG ma try to reach out senior hru le sure rply dinchaa,ma pani google ko 2ndround interview ma reject bhako ,mero sathihru chan FAANG ma opening rahecha bhane you can send me on dm i will send them they will refer you(resume impressive rahecha bhane ATS score 80+ aayeracha bhane)|||DM for referral.

The situation remains uncertain. Several media outlets have only reported that his name is missing from the list of 20 hostages confirmed to be alive, yet some are hastily jumping to conclusions without verified information. Such speculation is irresponsible, especially when the facts are still unclear. These pages are so immaturely jumping to conclusions in a state where things are uncertain.|||Bipin looked fine in that released video dated November 2023. It means that either Bipin died during the strikes or Hamas' foul play. Our foreign policy is also to be blamed. How could they detain Nepalese who had no association with Israel?

Eleven of our sons, including Bipin Joshi, who arrived in Israel just 25 days before Hamas’s October 7, 2023, bloodbath, were brutally murdered. Four days ago, 48 hostages clung to life; now, only 20 survive. Hamas’s “justified” slaughter, draped in twisted dogma, mocks humanity. Two years of torment, dangling hope of Bipin’s survival, only to end in his cold-blooded killing by these bloody cowards. At home, Gen Z’s September “uprising” killed 51, including kids, burning Kathmandu, freeing 12,500 criminals to prop up corrupt elites’ spoiled brats. Our nation’s credibility is trashed, a global joke. Hamas and their ilk, like Jamkash, happily point fingers at Jews and Hindus for every woe, but when it’s time to face their own kind, they scatter like roaches, spineless. Yet we let their hate-preaching ideology fester in our hills, unchecked. No more. Deport their firebrand clerics, cut off their dirty foreign cash. We must back our own against Hamas, demand international recognition to flex Nepal’s strength, resilience, and power. This must never happen again. Israel’s crushing these terrorists, shutting up the bloody liberals whining “context” over our dead. Nepal, rise, reject this death cult, or lose more Bipins. #NepalStands #HateKills #GenZFails|||also euta kura sachhauna mann lagyo yo Rest in peace vanne sabda christain haru ko ho , they do not believe in re-incarnation so they say that rest in peace so that they won’t come back but hamro hindu sanskar ma we believe in next janma and we say “ Hardik shradhhanjali “|||[deleted]|||Bro what|||We had hope.

I agree that we have seen many rich and high power people get away with any crime. But let me remind you some cases : Maina Sunuwar, Rabi Lammichanne and other where everyone praised the court and claimed justice stood.Even you might know many of the cases  What I find uncomfortably troubling is that  People have been shifting their narrative about the court in whatever comforts them. Literally what Rabi did : When big politicians got GUITY from the court he said \"adalat le vaneko namanne?\"  When it was his turn he said every court is corrupt trying to get away. We are facing a same scenario here. Firstly the case was approached from a minor consent. And as far i believe the age couldn't be proven to be under 18. So this might have been a consensual sex.|||Maile timilai euta kunai case lagaidiye vane timi criminal vayou?

You don’t want to make fun of someone without evidence, period. Whatever Sandeep has done regarding such youtube content is very right. The cheap YouTube channel should be banned.|||All you blaming Sandeep are either girls or just boys that are sore losers in life. Aba they’ll say I’m being sexual ki rude eta uta. Okay let’s go thru facts one by one.   Firstly the whole case looks fabricated as hell. The day that couple spent the night together, next day aayera afnai room mate sanga ekdum excited bhayera Kura gareko cha. A few weeks later gayera case haleko cha. Usko roommate ko statement sunnu paila.   First ma statutory rape bhanyo, which was a massive one. Tyo case ho Bhane Sandeep should rot in jail. Tara that wasn’t the case, ani age ta 18 above cha raicha Bhanera tha paye pachi case chai rape ko ma change bhayo. Tyo pani when you go through the whole thing, it is pretty easy to make it out that the girl was trying to mint money out of Sandeep. It was a honey trap Bhanera ta sabai lai tha cha.   I don’t know Sandeep personally and don’t care if he’s arrogant or k k. It doesn’t matter. Because that’s not why he’s defamed.   Aba you’ll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re. Harek din naya bayaan and naya kahaani. Kt party ko main intention nai was to get as much of compensation as possible rather than punishing Sandeep.   And brought shame to our cricketing fraternity rey? Yo statement batai it’s easy to assume ki yo post garne eauta kti ho, ki jindagi ma lukera basne kta ho or Bharkhar ko fucche ho.  Even Cristiano Ronaldo was accused of rape numerous times. Eauta case ta it’s ekdummai severe. That girl immediately told her friends and filed lawsuit walla. Sandeep ko ta proper honeytrap thyo, Ronaldo had an actual case against him. But bail payo, where he still continued with his career. Unlike Sandeep, Ronaldo continued with his career. Pachi final verdict afnai favor ma payo.   So did he bring shame to Portugal? To Real Madrid? (at the time of the case) Ani Sandeep le chai kasari?   You put yourself in his shoes. You go out on a date with someone. Everything seems perfect, you guys kiss hug and spend an amazing time together. Belka you guys stay out ani make out. Bholi you drop her home. Then you go out for your work, ani bahira huda nai after a few weeks you find out that girl has filed a complaint for rape against you. What would you do?   I’m more than happy that our recent constitution and policies are in full support of women.

They are simple and have generally easy solutions that most if not all can understand. But they ask questions that often require you to interpret the asked topic in a different way. Thwy might twist a simple concept like vector addition and join it with irl examples. If one has core understanding of the subject and knows how to manage time with good handwriting, it isnt difficult to score 70+. You will need to be consistent though.|||Maile ni 2 barsa almost every exam ma 85 katako ho tei pani 2L jati ta tirnai paryo so its kinda hard tara ali mehenat garyo bhane chai sakchau easily 85% just math lastai dami banaunu paryo ani aru ma decent bhayepani katcha|||Hello u/Technical_Cat6948, thank you for contributing to r/NepalPlusTwo.

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can’t get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it.

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts.

If he held a different passport, would there be answers by now?   If every life were valued equal, would this post even need to exist?      Bipin’s story is not just one of tragedy.   It is a reflection of how quiet lives are often overlooked,   how conflict steals not just people, but peace itself.      We continue to hope.   We continue to speak.   Because silence is not an option.",

They called the “earn and learn” program an internship, likely just to bypass foreign employment laws. In reality, it was pure exploitation. From what I’ve read, students were made to work five days a week in questionable conditions and study only one. I wouldn’t be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.  I just hope this changes with the new government.|||i thought hamas was fighting gaza right after they kill him i think they just sick isreal PM both are shit they just want control people.. fucking hate hamas|||Sad|||I'm Israeli, sadly his DNA was diagnosed and was believed to die in the first months of the war R.I.P Bipin|||Vayo vayo pugyo,  He is dead, confirmed by Israel and hamas both.

            "body": "My house was vandalized in the name of \"Gen z protest.\" My dad is a civil servant, and we live in a humble 3 story house (the third story was only recently built). It was a small house when we moved in, which was 17 years ago— few months after I was born.   After working for over 25+ years for the government, this country, and its public, my dad still has a very clear history. No bribery, no corruption, no money laundering— nothing. Rising high in status and the post, he is recognized for his diligent work and highly stable work ethic.  Now, back to the present. The protestors had reached our house. I had once thought, why would anyone target our house? It's a civil servant, not some minister or anything of that sort. My father rose high due to his hard work and competitiveness, not any connection or bribery. We can all see from how my parents lived rental first (he was already a civil servant then). Only after a few months of me being born did they buy a house, not without taking loans.  I don't know why it happened because our house was aba and definitely not supposed to be a part of whatever that was. The protestors were going to burn our house, but because of it being attached to other houses, the neighbours finally calmed them down into not burning our house. Instead, they burned our bikes, went into our house, and threw things out to burn them. What's worse? When the protestors left, all the people living nearby, went in and out for 2 days straight— morning, day and night, pickng whatever things they liked amd taking it home with them as if our house was some kind of thrift store giving away our stuff for free.  We were at our relative's house, and when we saw all the black smoke coming from the direction of our house, we were devastated. \"Our house got burnt.\" That's what we thought. As i was the oldest child in the family, i couldn't let myself break down. I can still hear those devastating gut-wrenching cries and sobs from my mom, haunting me like a ghost every time i close my eyes.   I am a college student. My uniform is gone, and so are my books and copies. My sister is in middle school. Her uniform and books and copies are nowhere to be found as well.   Our money and jewelries, of course, are gone too. The same money my father earned and mind you, a civil servant's earnings isn't much. Only enough to label us as a middle-class family. The same money my sister sent us, her hard-working money(which was in dollars at that).  Our clothes, bags, and even utensils are gone, and so are our food storage(stuff). My mom is someone who saves money. However, she can just like my dad because she knows she has experienced the hardships with my dad. Because they know. Because they have experienced hardships and complications in their life. Because they have faced obstacles.  We have never wore any designers, no luxury fashion brand. All are affordable and comfortable. The only designer my mom and dad ever even had is when my big sister from abroad visited us and surprised us with some designer bags (which she also got scolded for spending so much because she is still studying and working in between only).  Our guests'clothes, laptops, phones, everything is gone. Me and my sisters' savings and my mom's little spending for managing our household— nothing is left. Not even our puja ko thaan(a small place we had to worship and pray gods).   We have tons of debts. I am old enough to learn that by now. Now that our house was totally and utterly robbed and vandalized while my dad kept on working for the same public, we have nowhere to sleep on. No clothes to wear. There is no place to shower or bathe.  We had to hide away from our own house we once called home to keep ourselves alive. My father was lucky enough to be safe because if it was even a few seconds late, it would have all been over. We were fortunate to be alive, even though we had done nothing wrong to people.  Morality? Humanity? Conscience? Guilt? Remorse? None. The same people, the same public, that my dad is working so hard to serve with his whole heart, has done this to him, to his family.  Gen z, huh? Protest against corruption, huh? My dad, having the cleanest history— no corruption, bribery, connection, whatsoever. So why our house? Why? What had we ever done to them? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.   I have no hope left. None for this country, none for the people of this country. This is now a country full of robbers and thieves. Humans are jealous. Humans are greedy. People are full of themselves, full of greediness and selfishness. In my heart, humans are creatures who have ruined any hope for more in me and my family. My father, who once poured his heart for this country and the people in this country, is on the verge of giving up on it.  You people, opportunists, and robbers who call yourselves voice of justice— I'll be watching, watching who you are going to tame to pull this country back together. People like my dad who are so wronged will be out of all this mess soon, Who are you going to pull to patch this broken country? I'll be watching. I'll be happily watching everything crumble and fall apart with your \"justice.\" You have given the opportunists a sense of win. You've let them think anything is possible, and now, everything will fall apart while you watch everything crumble in front of your eyes.  Lastly, I'd like to be a little vulgar and uncensored. If you are uncomfortable, scroll away.  Whoever has participated in vandalizing my house and robbing it empty— You are going to see hell and worse. I hope you feel yourself rotting away. I hope you don't think it's over now because whatever you stole, it will haunt you for the rest of your life and afterwards. I will forever haunt you, even in your dreams, converting it into a disastrous nightmare. You'll see hell. You are going to suffer.  [Edit: I never expected this post to gain so many views. I’m very grateful to those who are wishing me and my family well, thank you very much for that. And I also understand those who might raise an eyebrow on this post and not believe in my words. It’s up to you, whether you want to believe me or not. I have no intention of forcing it on you.   I’d also like to request anyone who knows me through this post to maintain my privacy and not reveal anything about me or my family on the internet(please refrain any stalker behavior). I have never gone public like this and I also don’t like the attention this is getting(makes me uncomfortable) but I’m going to keep this post so other people who have experienced something like this can be open about it here. Let this be a safe space for those to speak up.]",

We are still finger pointing everyone we hate.   We still haven't learnt anything.

Hopefully the future won't be dark like the few weeks for you was. 🫡|||I know this will be an unpopular opinion, but I feel the Gen Z protest got out of control.  While this was an absolutely needed protest and it did bring much-needed attention and change, we also can’t deny the darker side of it. While the deaths of innocent people rightfully shook everyone and fueled the anger, more innocent lives were lost in the chaos that followed.  Gen Z cannot ignore the fact that others died in fires, or that people were looted and harmed during the unrest. It’s easy to say the movement was hijacked by goons, but the videos and reports show some protesters themselves vandalizing property and stealing from people who had nothing to do with the issue. Ironically, those who stood up against corruption ended up damaging the lives and livelihoods of ordinary citizens.   Those responsible should be held accountable for it!!!

Your family will rise again and rebuild everything you’ve lost. Wishing you strength, courage, and healing🙏|||Any CCTV footage? Do you know who started it?

The good deeds of your father shall come upon you and the bad doers would be punished in either form.

They are members of a party and whatever they are being told they will follow it without thinking. If this has happened to me none would know how far i would go to get back what is rightfully mine. Do what you can. Why you acting like a loser. These people are the demons, a parasite. They will again vandalize innocent Individuals houses. Prep yourself up.

The protest’s cause is indeed the corruption in the government. You can direct your anger towards the people who vandalised your house. The cause of the protest was right, the meaning was valid and the motive was strong. During an uprising of this scale unrest leads to actions like this where wrongdoings occur. You were wrongfully harmed by the angry public. You deserve justice but so do the poor of this country and I truly hope that the new government is better than the last and you can get some compensation. Please take care🙏|||Im sorry for this man.

It’s a norm to see this kinda stuff happening in the West.|||welcome to the uk|||Dude you think a racist person is going to know that a brown guy wearing a Dhaka Topi is Nepali and not Indian???|||It’s abt the color of our skin not the nationality with them.|||Stay safe! Life abroad has been tougher than ever before!  Nepal might be calling all! But let's hope until we return, things get straightened up back home! 🇳🇵|||It's not about the way you look, I look a bit more east asian and people have told me to \"Go back to my country\".   These people just want someone to hate, their life is probably miserable if they have to live like that. You can't do nothing about that. Just go on about your life and live the best life for yourself.|||By the looks of things, it's going to get sooo much worse.   Stagnant economy + shit leaders =  Blame the foreigners: Tale as old as time.|||Not a good time to be in the west. The decline is in full force. Economically and culturally. If you understand how whites operate you know why they are actually scared. Birth rates below replacement is a huge issue for them. It’s understandable they don’t want to be a minority in their own country and due to this racism is bound to be mainstream. I guess Karma waited some few hundred years to give them back a taste of their own medicine.   It’s time to build Nepal. I’m in the US and strongly considering moving back. You will never be a Brit to a native Brit. You will never be American to the whiltes in America.   The rise of Nepal and the eastern civilization will be glorious.|||As a white dude, I can't stand when this happens.

There are some spectacular idiots, and they will spout stupid things at you. When I was young anyone 'brown' was called a Paki (it makes me shudder just to type that), believe me the people shouting it had literally no idea of different south Asian countries, and wouldn't have cared even if you tried to correct them. (I was once walking with a friend who was half Iranian, so had the crime of black hair, and someone drove past yelling at us about Paki go home). It's nothing like as bad as it was 30 years ago, but still sucks to be on the receiving end of it. You can only ignore I, though my husband's technique in super white country pub places was to get in with the ghurka talk quickly (even though we're in no one way a gurkha family). The old dudes love that stuff!|||here are few things I would like to share with fellow countryman.   most of bahun/ chetri look (including me) look Indian ... so sometimes face racism due to appearance.   Most of times Indian (south asians) face racism is due to...   1. bad dressing up sense , fashion.  2. manners   3. smell     Always dress well, wear clean, not necessarily new, clothes, be polite in train, bus ( say thank you to driver, leave seats for women , pregnant, elderly etc ), don't play music in phone without earphones, don't speak in phone in crowded space, hold door if you can, and use thank you, sorry, excuse me please as often as you can. And avoid eating food with garlic, onion like lot ... mild amount won't be cause body odour.      Chinese, Korean look same as Japanese , but Japanese never face racism (mostly) , it is because they are so conscious about their appearance in public, their mannerism and they are so well dressed, we must be like Japanese ;)|||Dhaka topi lagayera k hunxa ra ?

You are already better than any uneducated inbred fool so its ok just don’t think too much.|||bro thinks brits who hate indians aren't also gonna hate nepalis|||Same as with Madhesi when they are in Nepal.   In Nepal, it's same racism in each district. East or West of Nepal. Same everywhere in the world.|||Racism has been in peak form almost in all european and South American nations. You can't escape it. Try not to respond, unless an attack. Then call police|||Hey I'm from UK it's all crazy at the mo don't listen to a word of it, people are being brainwashed that 'immigrants' are the problem. The intelligent ones know we need you ❤️ sorry you've experienced this but know it's just ignorance, the same people probably never even heard of Nepal 😂|||American here, apologizing for well….🤷‍♂️everything.|||I think it is pretty reasonable for him to say that because we all know there are many Indians there so does the UK government but they don't take action and people are fed up with their government and all the mindless immigrants, I mean if that many Indians were in Nepal taking our jobs you would have the same reaction. So don't prove that you aren't Indian instead finish the course you are taking or any job and come back home You can't find your home in others' homes|||So stop ruining their country, do not go to foreign countries as a restaurant worker.|||Brandish a Kahukuri around & that’ll shut em up….jk Just put a khururi cross lapel on your jumper|||As someone in USA, many times people tell me the stuffs like curry, do not redeem.

Now nearly **45% of Nepal’s total land** is covered by forests — up from around **25% in the early 1990s**.  Pretty wild, right?

This affectes every country in south Asia including Nepal. That's a problem we should solve. IT's gradually under control I guess.|||Google Bangladesh. And let me know if you found the answer|||Don’t look up bangladesh/australia. Nepal has average population density.|||Population in SE Asia seems to be quite high in general. I think regarding your question about where the population is concentrated, you will find that the population is scattered throughout the country - everywhere minus above 3000m up the himalayas. Then if you do a deep assessment what % of Perus Land actually has people vs % of Nepal where people reside, you may find the two land sizes may not be off by a magnitude like now when you compare the full size of the country. For eg UK has a landmass of 250k but has a population of 69 mil. That's 2x population of Peru in 1/5th of land. In the other hand australia has a population of 27mil in 7.7mil km2. Russia has 143mil people in 17mil km2 (4x Pop of Peru in 16x land area).  You are also looking at the mercader projection which further makes Nepal look more visually small in the map. Not that it should have any basis when you talk about numbers.   I suppose what I am trying to say is the population may still be high in Nepal but it may not be as high as you think when you factor in livable land in the country. Total land mass alone is not a great indicator.|||Fertile land, fertile people, most are on terai belt. Look at india and bangladesh, how densely populated they all are.

Also temperate climate.|||Time zones bro.|||Look at bangaldesh's area and population. You'll be shocked my guy|||The reported surface area of a country is always the 2D surface area. It calculated on a flat, two-dimensional plane, not by measuring the surface area of its mountains, hills, and valleys. The total land area of a country is determined by projecting its borders onto a standardized reference surface, typically an ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the Earth.      Nepal is roughly a \\~1000 km long, and 150 km wide and so the approximate area of 150 sq km.   Now if you count the mountains and valleys that covers like 70% of that 2D area, the actual habitable space is order of magnitide larger. maybe even 50x.   So the actual living space is quite a lot for mountainous country like Nepal. I would imagine same for Peru.|||You know about canada?|||You should have started with Bangladesh and it's population density.  Regardless, depends on how fertile and navigable the lands are.

Something big is happening in Nepal. Political parties are cooking something inside. They are now the most dangerous **virus** in Nepal that they are slowly attacking the emotions of the citizens and democracy. Nepal has become more unstable than previous government. There is an all time high chances of happening **Civil War in Nepal** now. Prachandra is the master mind in this game. He knows how to do these games by collecting all political parties. For this, **they have already started to produce a lot of fake account in Instagram, tiktok and started presenting fake news in these platforms.** I have seen a lot of fake news in social media in these past 3,4 days from fake account. I researched and found that they are spreading fake news, be cautions guys. They still have enough money and manpower to do a civil war in country because all these years this political parties are looting national budget and depositing in foreign countries like in Swiss Bank, UAE, India etc.   So, stop saying **\"Aama ta aayo tara Sautini Aama aaixey\"**, **\"yo sarkar pani testai niskexa\"** bla bla bla, This isn't a joke.

It's our duty to keep ourselves informed and not to falls for all the bullshit. Remember the cost paid before and during the revolution and be vigilant. Most of all, register and VOTE.|||No, we should be thankful that we have overcome the first step of political crisis. Yes, at the time constitution's word by word wasn't matched for forming government. But President did form the govt and dissolve by abiding with the constitution. And not anybody was appointed. The former Chief Justice was appointed, who , even by the position, is supposed to be the most learned of the laws worldwide and Nepal. The only bad is that we have an interim government, but the election date has been fixed and we should in anyway possible make the election successful, even if the interim government fails to do any other thing beside that. Cuz having a parliament is very very necessary brother. Good governance, Corruption control and investigation, all can come in time being, but the democratic, free, and sovereign country do need parliament. We may not like the members and representatives there, but for our democracy and peoples sovereignty, parliament must be there. That is the reason, the upper house National Assembly is still there.  I just read the news in BBC that Taliban government shut down all the internet in Afghanistan. And the people have nothing to say there. Already they had girls education completely removed from the country. And in Sudan there is a terrible civil war ongoing, even worse than Ukraine and Gaza, merely because multiple factions within the army and political groups want executive power for themselves. The condition is pathetic there. Just so so sad.  I know Nepali are frustrated with the government. But let's understand one thing, in Nepal our Parliament and legislative is supposed to be more powerful than the other two bodies. If government fails to do as expected, we should elect better party in the Parliament. Moreover, the development is not just duty of Prime Minister and council of ministers. The administration of Nepal also called the permanent government is there to carry out the tasks for governance and development. The political structure, that is PM and council of Ministers are primarily to make the administrative structures accountable and focused to the citizens' need, demand and aspirations.  So, let's not be too emotional and aggressive to the point that we focus too much on executive and not the legislative and parliament. Laws, Constitution, System can only be changed through Parliament only , and that should always be. So please, dear fellow Nepali brothers and sisters, let's help the interim government to function as best as it possibly can and soon have the parliament, and fully constitutionally functioning all three organs of the state: Legislative, Executive, and Judiciary. Let's participate in the election with joy and hope, and elect the best, if not, the best among the worst, and bring the country into running and stability. Please. This is not the time to fight amongst each other. We need to be united as one Nepali in this so vulnerable time. We will not have a country man, if we keep on fighting and not helping the interim government. Let's elect our representatives in Falgun 21, and do fighting then after. Making the representatives accountable, pressuring them to amend as per our choice through peaceful protest, signature campaign. But for the few coming months till election, let's be optimistic and help each other in family, friends, and communities to participate and be excited for election. We will only have a country, if we can keep it. A country needs the parliament. It is the soul. Executive helps develop, provide security. But the source of our sovereignty, our say in the nation, is through our representative in parliament. How much we want to fight now, let's fight in the parliament. Parliament is literally a place to hear each other, discuss and debate. Let's be fully focused in electing our favored representative and , in bad case best amongst worst, for now please guyss.|||The cleanest and the only way GenZ can get out of this is to win the election by a massive landslide  Parties haru khatisakey.

But   the thing is older gen didn't account that the interim leader would be choosen within 2 day and in discord.  That was their blind spot.    That was uncalculated,  from what i know many things went south, in many places the people involved vandalism where not many local.   its an open secret that protest was overtaken by many parties.    we can't know everything but the best option we have is we are not a member of any party, we are un-predicatble cause we also don't know many things. this is double edge soward we can also be manipulated, this miraj vs sudhan blaen vs harka   and the ekanitpur shit.   so, my suggestion listen to old folks they definitely are all vedas, they know someone and that someone might just have many sources.   i am not asking to be a spy and report,  but its better to learn many things but also don't believe everything.   And i can't share many things i learned as it account as Rumour and flase narrative and can be dangerous but i think someone behind seen things might be going on,  best source of information look for people whose gob is to protect all, you know.   i don't want to leave this country, Adding loan to family with their own debt while others country are hating on foreign students now and how i might not able to meet them in next or another dashin or for years, if i did go out thinking about this all, i don't wish for money this dashin but hope till i graduate form college, i am not forced by the conditions to go out to in name of study and work.|||I think for a fair election, the Nepalese government must ban 500 and 1000 notes.

I mistakenly **did a Rs. 40,000 mobile top-up to my own NTC number** through the **Mahila Smart app** (which uses eSewa/vendor system).  My intention was just to **load my wallet**, but I selected “mobile recharge” instead. The transaction went through, and now my NTC balance shows Rs. 40,000 😭.  I already contacted both Mahila Smart support and NTC, but they said **there’s no refund for completed recharges**.  If recovery isn’t possible, does anyone know **any trusted shops, vendors, or businesses that buy or accept large NTC balances** (maybe at a discounted rate)? I’d be okay selling or transferring the balance if that’s the only option.  Any help, experience, or guidance would really mean a lot 🙏",

In very rare, exceptional cases, NTC may have options for extremely large accidental top-ups, though the taxes already paid to the government make a full reversal highly complex. * **Attempt a formal complaint through the digital wallet:** If they used a digital wallet like eSewa or Khalti, they should file a complaint with that wallet provider. These wallets can act as intermediaries and request a reversal from [Nepal Telecom](https://www.ntc.net.np/), though ultimately, NTC controls the outcome.   Long-term strategies for using the balance  Since a refund is almost certainly not an option, the best approach is to recover the value over time by converting the credit back into cash.  * **Offer balance transfers to friends and family:** The Reddit user can offer to transfer balance to friends and family in exchange for cash. This is a common and reliable method of liquidating NTC balance.    * **Balance transfer limits:** NTC allows up to 20 transfers per day, with a maximum of Rs. 500 per transfer.    * **Execution:** They can use the NTC mobile app or the USSD code `*422*SecurityCode*RecipientNumber*Amount#` to initiate transfers. * **Offer mobile top-ups in the local community:** For people who prefer cash transactions, the user can act as an unofficial recharge agent. They can offer to top up people's phones in exchange for cash, perhaps at a small discount to incentivize the transaction. * **Bundle and sell discounted packages:** The user can purchase various voice, data, and SMS packs offered by NTC and resell them to others at a discounted rate. For example, they could buy a large 28-day data pack with a market value of Rs. 999 and sell it to someone for a reduced cash price. * **Use the balance for services and bills:** The user can offer to pay for other people's utility bills that can be settled via an NTC number and accept cash in return. This could include things like landline or internet service bills if NTC provides them.   Warning for the Reddit user  * **Scams:** Advise the user to be very cautious about offers from strangers promising to buy the balance or provide a refund. They should only perform transactions with people they know and trust to avoid losing the balance without getting paid. * **Security code:** The NTC security code for balance transfers is like a bank PIN and should never be shared with anyone. The user must perform all transfers themselves. |||Chora chori thula vayinjel samma balance halna parena aba..😝|||1xbet money.|||I have seen such thing alot of times I don't think now they did it mistakenly.

But for those of us who worked there for years, the experience wasn’t as bright as the news sounds.  We went through years without increments, always being told things would get better “next quarter” or “soon,” but that day never came. The salary and facilities were far below standard, and the stock options they talked so proudly about couldn’t even be used from Nepal. They’d say there wasn’t enough money for employee salaries or even canteen bills, yet somehow there was always talk of big growth and expansion.  They didn’t even manage taxes properly in Nepal, and most of the work was done by Nepali teams who were underpaid and overlooked while the company operated from New York. “Democratize AI” sounds great on paper, but for those who actually built and supported the company from Nepal, it felt like nothing more than a marketing line.|||Neapli company ki nepali le establish gareko company?|||Which investing site is it|||not nepali company. founded by (likely ex) nepali?|||reading all these comments is hilarious, lmao nor do i endorse fuse nor i love it, if someone has done something learn to appreciate it.",

            "body": "We all know most ISP here lock the router and dont give any access to the web management. As a devops practitioner and someone who is very invested in homelabbing and selfhosting, locked router was my biggest achilles heels.   Requirement: A secondary router, you main router will stop working and secondary router will only work through LAN1 port.   Solution: All you have to do is create a ticket on vianet app stating \"Turn the router into bridge/modem only mode\". Someone will call you back, just ask them username and password for PPPOE and use your secondary router to configure through PPPOE instead of DHCP. Tada!!! you now have full control over your router.   Bonus 1: You can flash openwrt with Luci web interface and you will be able to configure anything you can think of. extra advantage is you can configure mesh routing without needing a special router. I have managed to easily flash it on my Mi router and a old tp link router, search for guides depending on your model or ask Claude or Gpt to search specifically for your router model.   Bonus 2: Vianet gives you globally accessible IPV6. That means you are free from CGNAT. Use this to access your home services without needing any relay like Cloudflare Tunnel or Tailscale VPN. Direct connection means no extra latency and maxed bandwidth and you can use this to host online game servers to play with your friends!! But for some reason Worldlink doesnt connect sometimes. Ncell and ClassicTech seems to have no problem tho. I am not sure if NTC offers IPV6.  Bonus 3: Host a adguard DNS server and configure your openwrt to use it as your default DNS server. This way you will have adblocking for your whole network. Your parents and old grannies wont have to see ads no more (wont work with Youtube app - use revance) and it keeps them safe from online phishing and malwares. You can also set some static ip and adguard to block some websites like gambling and pornography if there are minors in your household.   Disadvantage: The only downside of this is your main router will turn pretty much useless. Internet wont work through wireless and extra ports. So dont forget the vianet tech support to turn off the DHCP and wireless on the main router. Since my secondary router also has 2 ports only I had to invest some money on extra gigabyte switch.   I know some of you will appreciate this so this is my appreciation and giving back to this community. enjoy and have fun!! Happy Dashain!!!

Right after my final semester exams, I lost my job and haven’t been able to land another job or freelance project since.  For as long as I can remember, I’ve had this “retirement dream” of buying farmland and settling down someday. Now, after not writing a single line of code for over two months and spending most of my days watching YouTube farm tours, learning about crops, livestock, and regenerative agriculture, I’m wondering if this is just burnout talking or a genuine calling.  Has anyone here actually made the leap from tech to farming (or any completely different field)? What was it like financially and mentally? Any lessons or regrets you’d share?  I’m trying to figure out whether I should push harder to stay in tech for a while or lean into this urge and start small with agriculture.

The best investment I see as of right now is cold storage for fruits and vegetables. There are enough farmers who will work to produce but the hardship for them has been for timely rearing and storage during the season so this can be offloaded into the market during off season. This is how off season fruits are made available even during off season abroad. This concept is relatively new to Nepal, if you move into this market first, you will have competitive edge. I am engaged in poultry currently and my company does have cold chain system so I know how it works (specifically for chicken) and the model is very rewarding.|||I feel your pain of not being able to find a job right now. Are you sure you would want to do farming full time as a job/career?

The market is heavily skewed rn, like I saw a resume with 4 years experience,  lot of official blogs and solutions published applying for an associate level position.

But we studied together at NITR, India.  The process in India itself is top, so it's real hard to get recruited from Nepalese colleges.|||Applying to FAANG from India is not worth it bro. First thing the competition is huge and second thing the pay for FAANG position in India is like what at max 1.5 to 2 Crore if you get lucky. And I seriously believe that the stress to compensation is not worth it.  If it was in the case of USA especially in the bay area, then I would say the grind was worth it because they pay ridiculously high, like even after all the tax cuts and expenses you can save around 100-150k easily in a year given your compensation is 350-400k USD per year and the position is at the bay area.  But competition is tough there too, you need PhDs and all.  But I think it's still better than India. In India nowadays almost like minimum 10 lakhs students have already mugged up at least 300-400 leetcode questions so, chances are slim there.  My advice is target for such positions where the competition is low, grind there for 3-4 years and apply as independent contractors for remote position, you can easily make above 100k if you are sharp.  Then move to Romania applying a digital nomad visa and pay only about flat 10-11% tax for your 100k plus income. Cost of living is also affordable in Romania, soon to be included into schengen and of course after 5 years apply for PR, get the passport and travel freely for vacation. (It's passport is in top ten strongest list)  And this is the most achievable goal and path for a Nepali IT specialist. Even if you get 60k USD remote job in Nepal, it's not worth it because the progressive tax system will make the effective tax to around 30-33% and all your tax for what? Into the belly of corrupt politicians.  Actually it's a bad idea to live in Nepal, the tax is too much. You pay 25% tax and 13% vat for almost everything. Forget about buying vehicles, the added cost is like price of Vehicle(100%) and 80% flat tax + 13% vat + 10-25% profit margin + extraa whatever. You pay more than double for any vehicles.  Bro I'm hoping that the new government will make Nepal similar to a tax haven nation, otherwise I'm leaving Nepal too in next couple of years myself.|||Almost all hiring in India happens through on campus placements. Look at what companies are coming to your campus and prepare for it. Thats why most people are obsessed over getting into good universities there. Off campus hiring, on the other hand, is extremely brutal. Leetcode probably won't be enough. If you're a first year/second year, I'd suggest to start doing Codeforces.

            "body": "Hey guys, just wanted to share this so nobody else falls for the same trap I did.  So there was this post by a user named TastyMarketing47 in Tech Buy/Sell offering GPT Plus at Rs.699/month or Rs. 1000/3 months(claiming “pay after getting the product in your own email”).  He had written a long convincing description saying things like:  > “Scam ho vannu vanda agadi read: I buy from Vietnam promotional offer and sell it here with Rs.200 profit per account. The price is cheaper than Toolsmandu (999) because of the Vietnam offer. Search it up.”   Sounded somewhat believable, so I messaged him. He acted very genuine — said “no need to pay before getting access,” and even added me to some kind of Oxaam workspace.  It actually worked for about 30 minutes, then I got logged out. Tried refreshing, logging in again, clearing cookies — nothing worked. I messaged him, and he replied once saying he’s “sorting it out for all clients ,” but after that — no reply, I checked post too deleted, and he disappeared.  I’ve attached screenshots below — just sharing this as a lesson for everyone. If the price looks too good to be true, it probably is.  Stay safe guys 🙏",

This isn't just about a bad interview, it feels like a deliberate strategy to exploit job seekers for free labor.  I went through **multiple** rounds of interviews over several weeks. Everything seemed promising. The conversations were positive, and they talked about a great fit for their team. Then came the \"final\" task: to design a comprehensive digital marketing campaign.  I spent days on this. I researched their brands, analysed their competitors, and built out a full strategy, complete with campaign ideas, target audiences, content plans, and performance metrics. I treated it like a real, paid project because I genuinely wanted the job and to show my capabilities.  I submitted the work, feeling confident. Then... nothing. Total radio silence. I followed up, but no response. The most infuriating part? The reason given was a flimsy, nonsensical excuse that had nothing to do with the work I submitted.  This isn't an isolated incident. I've heard from others who have gone through the exact same process with them. They get you to design a full campaign, which they can then use or adapt, and then they ghost you or reject you on some silly pretext. It's a blatant exploitation of job seekers' time and skills.  If you're a digital marketer in Nepal and you're considering applying to IMS Group, be warned. This is not a legitimate hiring process. It's a fishing expedition for free campaign ideas. Save your time and your work for a company that respects candidates and values their professional effort.  They were still hiring 2 days ago and I gave the interview 3 months ago.",

Build cool projects and show them off on X or LinkedIn. Follow a bunch of US founders. Research YC and follow YC founders. The projects will need to show extraordinary level of depth in whatever field you want to pursue. A simple webapp, or a mobile app wont suffice. I would say, go deep into AI engineering, do multi-model, multi-agent projects and show them off in LinkedIn. Be raw and honest. Good AI talent is hard to find everywhere.

Every time you run an app, the system checks which permissions have already been granted. The same happens when you open the NIC Asia app. Now, why would NIC Asia need access to your camera?

It has to be tied to the QR feature, because once the app is logged in the whole page is swipe-gesture based. When you swipe left, the camera view for QR is triggered, so it looks like a photo is being taken but it’s not. They likely initialize and tear down the camera process in the background to speed up access.|||SBL does that too|||Samsung OneUI 7.0 ma ni xina hai yo problem, maybe device specific ho ki.|||They keep logs for the fraud detection, yes almost all the banking systems keep the camera logs while logging in to the account.|||aru ma no yasto hunxa camera ko permission on bhayara ho|||Same thing used to happen in kumari and prime bank mobile app, I noticed as I used to turn off camera from the software so any app that needs camera would ask first, but for some reason as soon as I logged in those 2 apps asked to open camera and mic settings, but as of recently it seems to be fixed|||Your account might be hacked!!many of peoples' don't know shit..which is why iphone is too good for protection of ur account..if yu using Android then for sure you are on watch..

Because platforms like PayPal, Stripe, and others are not supported, thousands of freelancers, students, and digital creators are struggling to receive their payments from abroad. Many talented individuals are even losing jobs and opportunities simply because there’s no reliable way to get paid for their work.  This issue directly impacts Nepal’s growing digital workforce and limits the country’s potential in the global freelancing market. I kindly request you to post about this problem and urge the Finance Minister and related authorities to take action.  Your platform has a powerful voice, and raising this concern could help push for real change.  Thank you for your time and for always being the voice of the people.  Warm regards, [Your Name",

            "body": "About fifteen years ago, many of us spent hours enjoying games on our Nokia keypad phones or other classic devices running Symbian OS (though brands like Samsung and Motorola were around, Nokia often ruled the roost!). We either frantically search the web for games or head to an electronics shop and ask, \"Dai Dai yesma(sd card) game haldinuna?\" before loading a ton of them onto our SD cards.  However, a major hassle was finding a game that actually matched our phone's screen resolution. Some games were half screen, some were overly zoomed, and the ones that fit perfectly often turned out to be, well, not so great. Despite the screen struggles, those original Java games were special many were unique, story focused, and almost entirely ad-free (Ads here, Ads there, Ads everywhere. We need nokia legacy back).  Recently, the nostalgia hit me hard, and I desperately wanted to replay them. The irony? I had exchange my old phones years ago (for indestructible chiya khaney glass that can survive metoriod strike and last for eternity). My other devices were either lost or simply not working anymore. I started searching the internet and found a great way to play these classic Symbian/Java games on Android. I am only going to share the first method because the other couple of methods I tried were quite laggy.  Some of you might already know this trick, but for others (like me until recently) who are still wondering how to play these games like back, this is for you. (Since I have an Android, this method might not work for Apple users).  Method I use:  Using J2ME Loader  Install J2ME Loader: This emulator is free and available on the Google Play Store. Download Your Java Games: Use Google to search for your favorite titles or visit dedicated sites. Some popular options are Dertz, Mobiles24, and Phoneky. Phoneky is my personal favorite because it makes browsing for the exact games you want simple and quick. (NOTE: PLEASE DOWNLOAD GAMES WITH 240×320 SCREEN RESOLUTION ONLY. IT WILL PERFECTLY STRETCH TO YOUR SMARTPHONE SCREEN)  Launch Games Using J2ME Loader:  Open the J2ME Loader app. Tap the \"+\" icon or the \"Add Game\" button. Navigate to the location where you downloaded the .jar file (this is the game file). Select the game to add it to your list in the app. Tap on the game's icon to start playing! (Pro-Tip: You can also go into the settings to configure the key mapping to suit your playing style.)",

But without any credible information just blatantly labelling it exploitative and child abuse will do more harm than good.|||True, the Kumari tradition is precious but it needs to be modified so culture thrives without harming the child.|||  Wait till the local Newar finds out that someone has spoken a fact here. 😂|||Hi all I am a Newar, and i don’t oppose the tradition.  The child will have access to education and almost everything another child can ask for. We have belief that the child carries spirit of Taleju Bhawani, which gives the child immense power. Again, in an age where we have lost our belief, I cannot prove it.  The kumaris I have visited emit strong aura (i may have been brainwashed to feel this). But she does have to be disciplined (i dont mean someone disciplines her). The child is treated with utmost respect by the best people in a homely environment.   Aba before age of 15 16, Manang Mustang ghumna khasai koi jaadaina hola (only speaking for myself) After she is no longer a Kumari, she can go whereever she wants to.

A 3 year old child has no idea what she is getting into. She cannot grasp what a normal childhood is, what is right and what is wrong. The only thing she knows and does is based on her likes and dislikes, which is heavily depended upon how her parents/surrounding elders dictates.   Ani about 'No complains' from past Kumaris:   Newari culture is super sensitive. You cannot say anything against their culture. Otherwise, you'll have to face \"Tom n Jerry\" like people. I think, every ex Kumaris understands this at some point. With this much pressure along with the grooming done from a very young age, I don't think anyone dares to speak up. Which basically means none of us know what they really feel inside.    Well, of course, keeping in mind how they're thrown away once they reach a certain age or goes through 🩸. At least, a life time opportunity to be a Kumari where they could renounce their position if they don't feel like it should be a way.   They don't preach, they don't teach, they only show up during jatras. I've never seen Kumaris actively participating in rituals or any sort of activities.

The only thing you should feel bad about is her parents who now have to be her full time care takers probably having to leave their jobs and careers and move into the kumari house with her.|||I used to extremely religious before and used to glorify ts But realising Kumari tradition is cruel was my first step towards atheism|||As a Newar, I understand the cultural side of it. But living in the US and having global exposure, I also see it as more of a pageant. If you’ve seen Little Miss Sunshine, you’ll get the context.||| The Living Goddess tradition of Nepal is a complex institution rooted in centuries of culture. While modern concerns about child rights are valid, the practice is governed by strict rituals and has evolved to address contemporary welfare standards. Here are the key facts:  1. The Selection is Meticulous and Considered an Honor:  · A Kumari is chosen from the specific Shakya clan of the Newari community, a Buddhist goldsmith caste. · The selection process is incredibly rigorous. Candidates must meet 32 strict physical perfection requirements (e.g., eye shape, voice quality, hair color) and demonstrate a fearless and serene demeanor (e.g., by not crying during a ceremony in a room of 108 ritually sacrificed animal heads). · For the family and community, her selection is not a punishment but the highest spiritual honor.  2. The Role is Central to National Culture and Unity:  · The Kumari is not just a religious figure but a national symbol. · Her most important public duty is during the Indra Jatra festival, where she blesses the President of Nepal, providing divine legitimacy to the state in a ceremony that blends Hindu and Buddhist traditions. This is a key event for national identity.  3. Significant Reforms and Safeguards Have Been Implemented:  · Education: By law, the Kumari now receives a formal education from private tutors within her residence. The government provides a monthly stipend specifically for this purpose. · Family Presence: Contrary to isolation claims, her family (typically her mother) lives with her throughout her tenure. · Financial Security: Upon retiring at puberty, the state grants her a lifetime pension. As of recent years, this is approximately NPR 10,000 per month (roughly $75 USD), along with a lump sum of NPR 1 million (roughly $7,500 USD) to support her transition. · Successful Reintegration: Former Kumaris like Dr. Chanira Bajracharya, who served until 14, have publicly spoken about their positive experiences, pursued higher education, and built successful careers, demonstrating that life after the role is viable.  The Kumari tradition is a deeply embedded socio-religious institution. It is factually inaccurate to frame it simply as the \"isolation\" of a child. It is a state-sanctioned, culturally sacred role with defined rituals, significant community support, and legally mandated provisions for the girl's education, family life, and long-term financial security. The debate around it highlights the global tension between cultural preservation and evolving child rights, but the practice itself has demonstrably adapted to modern norms.|||I ain't newar but also I think aaba yesto kura chai parents haru le vhaneko ramro hami third party le vhannu vhanda pani . look if kumari ko parents le chahanu hudaina vhani tyo kumari ko candidate mai na leraunu parni ho . so parents lai kehi problem xaina , kumari le as a normal human being ni basna paunu hunxa after completion so I think we are no one to question sodhna lai|||What about the tradition of marrying off daughters into the inlaws house?|||After giving this some thought question is of a philosophical one. What freedom does a child have?  What life does a child choose? Isn’t everyone forced and fed their parent’s beliefs?   Also, can you give some evidence of abuse? If not your post would be baseless and in attempt of defamation of our culture.  One Kumari’s time ended when she was just 12. How much do you remember of your life before you were 12? I asked myself the same question and the answer is not much.   I disagree with your claim that the Kumari’s are discarded. They are always welcome. What it shows is the core principle of Buddhism that nothing is permanent. All things, even being revered as the living goddess, comes to an end. It teaches humility, an art that is now lost in this modern time.

Kumaris have had a long history, have you ever heard one of them come out and say that it was traumatic? Stop your virtue signaling.|||I would like to hear it from past Kumaris, if they dont have a problem, who are we to stop this 1000 yr old practice|||As always kumari tradition is called as a child abusive and inhuman act again. Khaire ko documentary haru herera brainrot kura nagara na. Not everyone is privileged to become kumari and nor they are selected randomly. The family members themself have to fill the form and there's a long running selection process. Only a certain clan of newar can become Kumari. There are lots of inhuman and child abusive traditions going on all over. In case of kumari they get highest level of love and respect. They can live with their parents, they can play, they can watch TV, they can even play video games. It would be better if you watch podcasts of ex kumaris it's really helpful. I used to think same like everyone calling this inhuman before but they are living the normal life as you and me. And the fact that you can't speak up being kumari is totally false, yes you can't but only in jatras and other religious ceremonies, do you speak up during sharad and other pujas(it's prohibited to talk during sharad if you don't know). Go visit sudurpaschim hundreds of girls are being raped during their chhaupadi bas. Go visit terai Muslim villages girls at the age of 15 are getting married and at the age of 21 they are booned with 3 childs. Ex Kumaris themself enjoy being kumari and love to live their that phase again. If they are fine, their parents are fine no need to talk about that. Now the rules and prohibitions are amended. So please watch podcasts of ex kumaris. Btw I'm not Newar. I'm not from valley either.

They will be given a pension afterwards.   They can ask for anything. the parents can give  them phones, games and whatever else etc etc.   To people who are like FRIENDS, SHE WILL HAVE NO FRIENDSS. bruh, its like moving schools during class 2. She will make friends.    How many friends did u have at 3? She is newar. Most of the friends we make are related to us cuz we live in kathmandu. She can meet them whenever.

To those insisting Kumaris are always “grateful” or dismissing criticism by belittling others, few things we can reflect on:   1. How much do we actually know about child psychology and development, especially at such a young age when experiences shape a lifetime? 2. Yes, a Kumari is worshipped as a goddess now but when her time ends, how does a goddess step back into an ordinary life? How do peers treat her? How does she even make friends? 3. With isolation and the constant expectation to suppress emotions, what happens to her social, communication, and interpersonal skills? Who helps her navigate that later? 4. Does she ever get space to express her own feelings and thoughts or is silence part of the job description? 5. We’ve all seen videos of new Kumari, some barely three years old, literally asleep in full dress during rituals. How on earth can a toddler be burdened with divine expectations when they can barely stay awake through it? 6. As Nepalis, many of us defend dal bhat tarkari because it’s what we grew up with it feels untouchable. (I know it’s not the same but for reference) For a Kumari, this role is all she has ever known. So how would she even recognise or articulate what she’s missed out on, when she never had the chance to experience it? 7. And let’s be honest do we really believe someone put on a pedestal that high, surrounded by cultural pressure, guilt, and shame, would openly talk about the negatives of being Kumari? Yes, things have changed there’s more education, some family contact,but none of that cancels out the developmental and human rights concerns we’re talking about.  And honestly, the comments here kind of prove the point: we were never really taught to think critically. Instead of having an actual discussion, people are throwing around “bahun,” “Christian,” or “other cultures” like that somehow answers the question. When we turn conversation into belittling, blaming, or name-calling, we’re not defending culture but normalising this behaviour. I mean how hard is it understand you can agree to disagree without all these?|||Actually the closest thing that happens in the west like this is children beauty pagents  AT LEAST, at the very least, this Kumari affects one child over a years.

Goodness flows through Kumari.  She is worshipped for being the medium of taleju bhawani. They are taught that they as an individual are not god, but the goodness that flows through her is what makes her worshipped.  And calling Kumari as a \"virgin goddess\" is stupid and a complete disregard of religious belief. It's a literal translation not a literary translation.   A lot of misconceptions have already been debunked.  Therefore they are able to integrate back into society well. They have good societal support . They are mentored, taught and are well taken care of. They themselves have immence respect for their religion and tradition.  If you think being a Kumari is wrong, you simply look at other practices in other religions. Nuns are not allowed to marry or consummate. Denying the right to marry and consummate can be considered as an oppressive practices denying one from their human desires. In radical Islam, burka, multiple marriages, denial of human rights for wemen.  While such petty comparisons are stupid themselves, what I want to say is we are worshipping female power. We are actually looking at females as devine. Not simply blind worship.   Nothing about today's childhood is normal.  You see young boys and girls sent off to boarding schools as normal? It's more isolating depressing. Parents just sticking their child to an iPad, or a hyperactive parent forcing their child through multiple activities (music class, sports, extra activities) even when their child may not want to to them, and pushing their child to extremes, putting their child through ridiculously high expectations, so that they can fulfill own ego( yes I've seen it happen).  A lot is not normal in so called modern normal childhood.   A lot of narratives and propogandas have infiltrated our thinking. Be water and explore into the culture. A lot has been written about Kumari from a propogandist and religious infiltration viewpoint.  A lot has been written to criticize our culture and ostracize ourselves from our religion and culture. Beware.|||Yeah agreed I thought it was just culture as a child but now I see it as different|||Sadhguru has spoken about the Kumari tradition of Nepal. It is an understanding about God making.

            "body": "People love to throw shade at King Mahendra, calling him an authoritarian who killed democracy. But let’s be real: he’s the only king after Prithvi Narayan Shah who actually did something that mattered for the survival of Nepal.    Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus — with nine governments in ten years. That wasn’t democracy, it was chaos. Leaders were busy stabbing each other in the back while the nation stayed dirt poor, uneducated, and vulnerable. Tell me, what “stable democracy” exists when governments collapse every year? None. Mahendra saw this and did what no one else had the guts to do: he hit reset.    Yes, he dissolved parliament. Yes, he banned parties. And you know what? He was right to. Without stability, Nepal was on track to become India’s backyard project or another pawn in the Cold War. Mahendra’s Panchayat system gave the country one thing it desperately lacked: stability.    And let’s talk achievements:    He balanced India and China like a chess master. Without him, we’d have been swallowed by one side decades ago.    He pushed Nepal onto the global stage — Non-Aligned Movement, a stronger UN presence, and an independent foreign policy.    He jump-started modernisation: roads, schools, universities, tourism. These are things no king before him, and very few leaders after him, have been able to deliver at that scale.    But historians? They love to cry about “democracy dying in 1960.” These same historians never admit that the so-called “democrats” of the 50s were busy running the country into the ground. It’s easy to glorify B.P. Koirala in hindsight, but Mahendra was the one cleaning up the mess in real time.    Here’s the hard truth: Mahendra was the only king who actually acted like a king — a protector of sovereignty. Everyone after him either coasted on his legacy or failed miserably. Without him, Nepal might not even exist as the independent state it is today.    Call him authoritarian all you want, but facts don’t lie. After Prithvi Narayan Shah, King Mahendra was the only true king Nepal ever had.",

He saved Nepal from being a puppet of foreign countries. He was a gem.|||Its not an unpopular opinion though. Those who know history know how Progressive Mahendra was. One thing though, his rapid advancements did over heat a fledgling Nepalese economy which is why we needed to privatize our industries. But the privatization was a joke,   they privatized it too quickly and privatization advocates in Nepal did admit they made a huge mistake later on.|||Mahendra is a complicated figure. On one hand, he did keep Nepal intact at a time when regional instability and internal divisions could have easily spiraled out of control.  On the other, his coup dismantled the first democratic experiment and concentrated power in the monarchy, which created long-term issues that Nepal is still untangling today.   It’s less that historians hate admitting he saved Nepal, and more that they frame it as a tradeoff between short-term stability and long-term democratic development.|||Popular opinion. It's because of Prithvi Narayan Shah and King Mahendra that modern day Nepal even exists as a separate country in its current form. Otherwise there would not have even been an independent country known as Nepal.|||His authoritarian enforcement of the Nepali language and Hindu traditions on a diverse population that wanted nothing to do with them was one of the causes of the civil war that would follow.  He killed democracy in its crib and pulled us back into medieval institutions. Even if I were to hypothetically accept that he was a good ruler for the sake of argument, there is no guarantee and his heirs and his heirs’ heirs would have been good rulers, which is why absolute monarchy fails. Any good that he might have done during his reign is negated by the fact that long term institutions are more important than charismatic rulers, and he ruined the institution of democracy. All the instability that we have faced since 2008- would have happened in the 1950s and we could have been a prosperous democracy by the present. This guy pulled us decades back.  It’s easy to look back at the past with rose tinted glasses and romanticize it, that is the first step on the road to fascism, but the truth of life, prosperity and happiness is in the future and progressive institutions.|||The problem with Monarchy in Nepal and everywhere else is that there are few good apples in 1 crore ropani orchard.  Except PN Shah, Mahendra and maybe Birendra (many sources call him spineless but I don't know), no one else were fit to rule. The country fell into Ranas dictatorship  because of Monrachy system failure.  So here we are, dealing with generational political trauma.|||A quick ChatGPT will give you some real perspective:  Most historians and political analysts agree that King Mahendra’s reasons were more of a pretext to consolidate royal power rather than genuine democratic concerns. Here’s why:  1. Political instability was exaggerated  Nepal’s first elected government (1959–1960) under B. P. Koirala had been in office for only 18 months.  While there were some administrative problems, it wasn’t long enough to judge the parliamentary system a failure.  Corruption and inefficiency existed, but not at the level Mahendra claimed.   2. Fear of losing monarchical dominance  The 1959 elections gave the Nepali Congress a clear majority.  Koirala’s government was popular and gaining legitimacy, which posed a direct threat to the king’s absolute authority.  Mahendra feared the monarchy would become a ceremonial institution like in India or Britain.   3. Foreign policy pretext  Koirala pursued a relatively independent foreign policy, maintaining balance between India and China.  Mahendra accused him of endangering Nepal’s sovereignty, but in reality, the king wanted direct control over diplomacy, which was vital for aid and recognition.   4. Use of \"underdeveloped society\" argument  Mahendra claimed that Nepalese people weren’t “ready” for democracy due to illiteracy and lack of experience.  This was partly true, but instead of strengthening democratic institutions, he abolished parties and built a system where only the king’s will mattered.   5. The Panchayat system benefited him most  Under Panchayat, all political power flowed through the king.  It created the image of \"guided democracy,\" but in practice, it was royal autocracy with no accountability.   📌 Conclusion: Mahendra used the excuses of instability, corruption, and national unity to justify a royal coup. The deeper reason was to preserve absolute monarchy and prevent Nepal from transitioning into a genuine parliamentary democracy.|||Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus, with nine governments in ten years. That wasn’t democracy, it was chaos.  LOL. The King chose PM. He was the one responsible.|||Yes man agreed. He is the guy who defined Nepal and Nepali people. He did a lot of great works for the country. But many people and our school books consider him as a dictator telling about how he banned political parties and not mention about the reforms and development made by him for the country. One of the greatest leader of our country King Mahendra!!|||Ali history paddam, 1959 ma first election vako ho tyo vanda aagadi sab PM king le choose garya ho, 1st election ko 1.5 years ma coup vako ho.|||But his policies are disastrous for Nepal till this day  He opened Nepal's border with India, opened free trade with India, allowed India to build its Army base in Lipulekh Limpiyadhura Kalapani since then these territories are occupied by India  He also forced Khas culture on Newaris and Janjatis which influenced them to become Communists|||Agreed!|||Will not let anyone discredit the blood of 17k Nepali|||We wouldn't have been swallowed by any side. Non-alignment was the default policy from the beggining, and B.P koirala would have continued that policy. Nepal would have 'modernized' without an iron-fisted dictatorship.|||Matrika literally wanted to suck cock of india..   He was puppet of India...while BP was good...Matrika and BP's power struggle caused mahendra to step in...and take all the powers..   Thats my unpopular opinion too.|||I agree with most of your points. But your point about 10 governments in nine years doesn't show the instability created by parties but by the monarchs. The monarchs were the ones that were making them unstable. The one time it seemed to be stable, he couped the government. That doesn't diminish the fact thought, that his rule saw probably the most balanced foreign policy of Nepal, where Nepal truly stood out as a sovereign nature. I still believe that had Mahendra controlled a bit of his authoritarian ways and worked together with B.P. Koirala, Nepal would have been in a much better position that it is currently. Both of them are the best leaders Nepal had post P.N. Shah. It might be an unpopular opinion but I think P.N. Shah might be more important historically, but these two are probably the best leaders Nepal got, even better than P.N. Shah.|||Unpopular hoina, brain-dead opinion.

Ani jabo dui tukra road pitch garyo bhandai ma khusi hune??|||sovereignty? of who? Mahendra model of nation-building was \"one religion, one custom, one language.\" Hindu orthodoxy was enforced as state ideology, treating non-Hindu communities as second-class. Nepali was imposed as the only legitimate language, sidelining rich traditions like Maithili, Newar, Tharu, Tamang, Limbu, etc. This wasn't genuine unity - it was control through forced uniformity. What looked like stability was in fact suppression. That brittle foundation is why today's Nepal wrestles with federalism, ethnic assertion, and identity politics: democracy didn't invent division, it revealed what had long been silenced.  The Koiralas, born and educated in Banaras, were accused of being \"too Indian.\" But Nepal had no universities, no political freedom, no space for intellectual growth - precisely because the tyrants had closed those doors. Should they be condemned for seeking ideas in India, or credited for importing the democratic imagination Nepal lacked?  So the paradox is clear:  Mahendra centralized the state but weakened society.|||First question, why was Nepal unstable during those years? And second more important question, if stability was the most important thing for us, why did he take over from a parliament that had a 2/3 majority and the government was led by THE BP Koirala? There was a little chance that the Koirala govt would have toppled and was doing good work..  Yes, there were some long term projects under him that were very good for Nepal. There’s no denying that and kudos to him. But he was authoritarian, there is no denying that either. Let’s not over glorify someone and gloss over facts because they don’t fit our views..|||Educated boomers hate him(my boomer dad lol).|||Nepal was too small for the OG Mahendra.

Humans were once living in jungle, then they eventually turned it into a village and a city. It’s not one person who did it. Maybe the reason we are underdeveloped is because we are lazy and expect someone else to come and make our lives better.

I agree that we have seen many rich and high power people get away with any crime. But let me remind you some cases : Maina Sunuwar, Rabi Lammichanne and other where everyone praised the court and claimed justice stood.Even you might know many of the cases  What I find uncomfortably troubling is that  People have been shifting their narrative about the court in whatever comforts them. Literally what Rabi did : When big politicians got GUITY from the court he said \"adalat le vaneko namanne?\"  When it was his turn he said every court is corrupt trying to get away. We are facing a same scenario here. Firstly the case was approached from a minor consent. And as far i believe the age couldn't be proven to be under 18. So this might have been a consensual sex.|||Maile timilai euta kunai case lagaidiye vane timi criminal vayou?

I don’t know Sandeep personally and don’t care if he’s arrogant or k k. It doesn’t matter. Because that’s not why he’s defamed.   Aba you’ll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re.

And honestly, this whole debate reflects how we treat culture in Nepal as well where Bahun Chhetri traditions and Nepali language are promoted as the ‘real’ identity, while 100+ other languages and ethnic cultures are pushed aside.  And culture is never static. Its constantly influenced by a lot of things like art, cinema, migration, globalization, internet, exchange and influence as well.

Don’t get too attached to it.|||Just by criticizing everything doesn't make you intellectual.|||Cultures and traditions naturally spread over time, and this spread is accelerated by influence. Media is the most powerful driver of that influence, and that’s why our local culture feels as though it is being overshadowed. The problem is not that people no longer value their own culture, but that our media presence is extremely weak compared to others.  Think about how Indian culture has spread in Nepal: through movies, songs, TV serials, and now online content. (migration, political connection and cultural proximity are other factors but in this case, the primary driver is media). The same is true for Western cultures, especially American culture, which influences our everyday lives, from what we eat and wear to the way we think. The recent Garba incident may be one example, but it represents a much broader pattern: cultural identity travels and takes root primarily through media.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, since cultures have always spread, adapted, and reshaped themselves over time. (I mean we'll definitely feel good if a foreigner adopts nepali culture). But preserving one’s own culture is equally important, because it forms a core pillar of identity. And preservation in today’s world is only possible through strengthening our own media i.e. by producing movies, songs, and online content that reflect and celebrate our traditions. And they need to be good, not some low effort cash converter sold in the name of patriotism.  And just for context: Garba is not only celebrated in Gujarat, but across India. (showing spread of a culture).|||I dont really see how this would affect op or anyone else for that matter enough to create this discord. And where do you draw the line?

We’ve seen positive signs and their main mandate is successful election and investigations on GenZ killers and past corruption files. So a little bit of faith and patience in your own PM wouldn’t hurt anybody.  What are your thoughts on this brother overall?",

Why do you think it's ok for a 2 year old to be taken away from their parents and forced to stay in temples. I wouldn't be surprised if you're the type that think \"सति प्रथा\" should have continued because it's \"nepali culture\". There is culture and traditions that should be preserved and modernized and there are things that needs reform right away.|||Our species evolved from prior species of primates, spread and settled all over the world, and where we settled,  built intersecting layers of cultures, languages, traditions, superstitions, arts, architectures, religions, gods, etc.  Using logic, reason, and critical thinking to examine these existing traditions, keeping the ones that are sensible and throwing out the illogical ones is not Eastern, Western, Middle Eastern, Asian, African or European. It's just logic.  We can enjoy and celebrate our cultural practices, examine them, and update them.    Our ancestors not only created new traditions but also stopped the ones they didn't like. We can do the same.|||It is important to think about culture and traditions critically. Eg: Sati pratha was perpetuated in the name of culture, but it IS abuse. Not everyone who criticizes traditions are westernized. That is gross oversimplification that prevents healthy discourse.   As for shivling, the whole world is obsessed with phallic structures. Not every criticism needs to be taken seriously. Think for yourself, argue against it if you believe otherwise, and modify the practices based on reasonable critiques. It really isn’t that deep. Religion and faith are deeply personal matters anyway.|||Most of the religious practices are enforced by men and misogynistic, to control women and children.

Therefore, don't intervene into respective private cultural spaces. We can live peacefully, if we became aware of our limits as a Nepali. The notion of being Nepali is a political concept, it's not a homogenous entity. Within it, every community exist as different distinctive individual entity different from each other.  For Newar, the girl who becomes a Kumari is continuation of their identity. She is more than a child girl, a divine goddess. Therefore, as a Nepali, and a non-newari I can only respect and react from distance, without being vociferous about it in public.  Maintenance of distance should be constitutional duty of every citizen. In reddit, we can see a different caste and ethnicity taking shots at other caste ethnicity. It's better that Chettri shouldn't be inferring in Gurung's culture and lifestyle. SImilarl, Limbu shouldn't be talking and critiquing Bahuns way of doing things. Same respective cultural practices should be carried out by other caste ethnicities.|||Secularism isn’t westernization. It’s modernization.|||>Nepali culture is not perfect, but it is ours. Reform must come from us  You said it yourself. It is not perfect and they might need reform.  >orchestrated online campaigns that want us to be ashamed of who we are  I have seen various posts claiming the same thing. What is the basis for that? Is it because many people are parroting *Kumari* culture as \"child abuse\" in social media, just like you are parroting it as \"orchestrated online campaign\"?  I don't think it's orchestrated campaign. It's just because many people don't have their own opinion and get easily swayed by people, posts and opinions that are controversial, that can drive engagement in social media. I'm somewhat victim of that myself, in a sense that, before the \"child abuse\" posts surfaced, I hadn't really given it much thought even if I always felt similar way. Some people like me might have realized it after seeing those posts, some might just be using it as engagement bait (because they are attention whores), or some are just trolling.  >They evolve, adapt, and reform, but from within the community, not by outsiders branding them as abuse to fit their narrative.  Isn't this coming from within the community? Where else is this coming from? I really have no idea. I haven't seen it being criticized or ridiculed by anyone else from international communities.  >We are debating in Western language, wearing Western dress, using Western devices, and posting on Western platforms. Naturally these spaces are full of hate against Nepali culture, because the ecosystem itself is designed to amplify Western values while mocking our own.  How ironic! You could have at least posted this in Nepali then. I don't think most people's goal is to mock our culture, it's more of constructive criticism, at least, from my point of view. Well I do have criticism about lots of aspects of many western cultures as well. But if I make a post or comment pertaining to that then lots of people like you would probably just accuse me of emphasizing western culture too much. I criticize Nepali culture and tradition because I grew up on them and I know them well and it's part of my lifestyle as well. My philosophy is, criticize the part of things you love but find problematic, don't just accept them as they are.|||Not every but u need to understand some of them trully are , Its good to follow tradition but with time we also should improvise , child abuse is a thing people need to consider seriously , I am not only talking about Kumari pratha , also putting children in dungeons during menstrual cycle should be taken seriously.

If we asked 100 ex-Kumaris about their experiences and whether they felt exploited or saw it as a privilege, I’m confident most would say they didn’t feel abused, contrary to what many internet activists claim.  To better understand the reality, I’ll share links to interviews and articles featuring former Royal Kumaris, published by BBC and ABC.  Yes, isolating a child from her parents, friends, education, or the outside world isn’t right, but those conditions don’t exist in the Kumari house as critics portray.   The tradition has evolved significantly. Kumaris can regularly meet their parents, who often care for them, receive personal tutoring for education, play outside with friends, and enjoy movies like other children.   And after retiring as a Kumari, she will be 100 per cent normal Nepali girl who is free to do anything and she'll get a monthly pension of Rs 16k for the rest of her life. (as per 2019 article)  So, don’t let disconnected keyboard warriors, who are influenced by Western lifestyles and detached from our cultural roots, misrepresent our beautiful tradition as a story of abuse or exploitation.

The respect and reverence given to the Kumari is not only religious but also a reflection of Nepal’s rich history and traditions. These people just find way to get away from traditions. Even the kings would receive her blessings before important events, military campaigns, or other significant state matters. The divine grace of the Kumari was thought to ensure his prosperity and the kingdom’s peace and stability.|||Yep, I've talked to an exKumari myself and she said she felt honored about being chosen. Shes married and working now. I don't see anything wrong with the tradition as it exists. In the past there were some issues about schooling and prejudice against marrying exKumari but there have been lots of reforms and cultural mindset changes now, led by exKumaris themselves. If you don't believe in Kumari or are an atheist, noone is forcing you to visit her or seek blessing. Kumari culture, since it does not really harm anyone, comes under freedom of religion and is protected by Nepal's constitution as well as international law.|||If the child says she doesn’t want to be a Kumari will they find another girl?|||>My perspective on the Kumari tradition is entirely based on what former Kumaris think.  Classic case of Stockholm syndrome.

Why do you people need this practice at all? Are your superstitious beliefs and culture more important than the childhood of an innocent little girl?

Of course, certain restrictions are there but just as a child who goes to a monastery or a person going to church has to follow certain rules, she has to as well. We can question some of these rules, but not without understanding the context and significance behind it.   While people are quick to dismiss cultural practices like this in the name of modernization and woke values, they easily forget that tantric traditions are very much alive and thriving in Nepal. Better not mess with those. If you are a non-believer, move on for your own good I would say.|||Not beautiful, it's an ass culture.

The facts, based on local Nepali voices and government policies, paint a very different, much more nuanced picture that overwhelmingly supports the continuation of this vital cultural practice, proving it is not exploitative in nature.    The Reality of the Living Goddess: A Cultural Privilege 🇳🇵  Not Isolated, But Tutored and Connected: The claim of \"isolation from family\" is a common critique. In reality, Kumaris receive personal tutoring, maintain regular parental contact (daily visits), and enjoy activities like playing outside and watching movies. This setup is often compared by defenders to a modern, high-standard boarding school experience, not harmful captivity. \\[2\\]\\[3\\]\\[7\\]  Lifelong Financial and Educational Support: Critics claim the girls are \"abandoned\" after their tenure ends at puberty. This is demonstrably false. Upon retirement, former Kumaris receive a substantial monthly pension and educational scholarships from the government, ensuring their successful reintegration and personal development as regular Nepali citizens. \\[6\\]\\[4\\]\\[5\\]\\[8\\]  The Voices of Former Kumaris: Structured interviews and public testimonials from ex-Kumaris and their families show that the vast majority view the tradition as a privilege and a source of cultural pride, not abuse or trauma. They have actively and publicly refuted Western stereotypes about mental strain or deprivation, emphasizing their positive experiences and agency. \\[9\\]\\[3\\]\\[5\\]  Modern Safeguards and Evolution: The tradition is not static. It has evolved significantly to include increased government oversight, modern educational facilities, and legal provisions for the girls' welfare. This illustrates the community's commitment to protecting the Kumaris and balancing ancient spiritual significance with contemporary child welfare values. \\[5\\]\\[10\\]\\[4\\]  The Kumari tradition is seen by its community as the veneration of feminine power and an integral part of Nepal's spiritual and social cohesion. To dismiss it as \"superstition\" while normalizing practices like sending children to high-end Western boarding schools highlights a clear double standard in criticism. The factual evidence, supported by Nepali citizens and former goddesses, establishes that the Kumari tradition is a source of cultural pride and empowerment, not the exploitation depicted by disconnected critics.|||The thing is people think it’s either right or wrong ; why not keep the perspective open.|||You are forcing a minor to give up the most magical years of her life for something that she has no choice over.

If you don't like it, be silent. Live respectfully separately. Peacefully.|||when someone grows up fully immersed in a tradition, they often won’t criticize it because it’s tied to their identity and sense of pride. That doesn’t make their perspective wrong, but it also doesn’t mean the practice has no problems.  For example, if you ask people who grew up in strict boarding schools, many will say it made them disciplined and strong, while others will point out the trauma from isolation and harsh rules. Both experiences are valid, but focusing only on the positive voices gives a one-sided picture.  The same goes for the Kumari tradition. Former Kumaris may genuinely feel privileged and respected, but that doesn’t erase the fact that historically there were strict restrictions and isolation from normal childhood experiences. Even if those conditions have improved today, that improvement only came because people did question the system.|||This was much needed! Thank you!|||BS, this pratha is blatant child abuse no matter what you try to mask it with.

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. 😭😭2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye 😭|||[deleted]|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

They are simple and have generally easy solutions that most if not all can understand. But they ask questions that often require you to interpret the asked topic in a different way. Thwy might twist a simple concept like vector addition and join it with irl examples. If one has core understanding of the subject and knows how to manage time with good handwriting, it isnt difficult to score 70+. You will need to be consistent though.|||Maile ni 2 barsa almost every exam ma 85 katako ho tei pani 2L jati ta tirnai paryo so its kinda hard tara ali mehenat garyo bhane chai sakchau easily 85% just math lastai dami banaunu paryo ani aru ma decent bhayepani katcha|||Hello u/Technical_Cat6948, thank you for contributing to r/NepalPlusTwo.

I can understand you and what I'd suggest you is to focus on the class properly sit on the first bench, listen to the teacher and mark important things that the teacher says. Thats all you gotta do in college.  Secondly, after coming home from college take a break and revise what has been taught in class. Study consistently. 80% of the questions comes from 20% of the important concepts.

Because there was no one to guide me, i failed this year's neb board.   so from someone who learned from his own experience, my best advice is that you don't depend only on teachers from your school. there are tons of videos on youtube and tons of notes and  straight up answers in the internet.   if you do not understand and get anything at all, then only focus on the questions that are asked many times or repeated i.e only imp questions.   you have to make sure that you atleast passing marks, so look focus on the chapters you understand and master them first then only focus on others.   You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

Even after taking reexam on both, i don't think i will pass. because of me failing on my exams, my mother and entire relatives blame me that i didn't try hard enough, didn't study and other similar things. my mother calls me a faliure, that i destroyed her dreams and i brought her nothing but pain etc etc.       i tried , i tried to focus on class, watched youtube, searched notes, asked the topper friends what they did at home and studied. heck, because of that tension and stress my hair started falling out, at age 17.    i was not even a bad student before. i even got A on SEE.       when choosing what to study, my friends choose management, but following the WISHES of my family and relatives, i choose science. after a week, i told her that i find science hard but she said just \"**The admission money is already paid and is only half can be refunded**\" totaL was 20,000+ BOOKS. and i failed again and again and again.    and still to this day, she screams and brings up my results in every argument and uses me as a example infront of my sister everyday.  now, she has said \" **if you fail again, then go get a room away from home and do what you want or study again from class 11 in management from the start\".**  now, i don't want to get out of my house without proper source of income. i can do every single house work and can even cook nearly everything , no problem if i start living alone. but it will be problem with no money or limited money.  and i would rather die than study and take that tension for another two years again. my mind is already way too damaged from that.  so, if i fail is there a course that i can get in techical line or something. like i heard that there are courses (18 months - 3 years ) that one can complete and start working , even if only SEE passed.    so , if there is any course that exists, please tell me.",

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can’t get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

I thought I’d go into IT, then I got fascinated by physics and decided to pursue that… but now, I don’t even feel like staying in science. Lately, I’ve been more interested in social sciences or subjects related to diplomacy.  I’m not the type to sit in a room all day buried in books. I love exploring the world, meeting people, understanding life, and actually working for society. Engineering feels like endless calculations, IT and physics don’t excite me anymore, and law… I just can’t spend years memorizing articles and stressing over licenses. I also don’t want to do BSW/BASW because too many people struggle to find work after that.  I want a bachelor’s where I can study and work at the same time since my family do not earn well and I definitely have to look after my family after 12. So, are there any courses that actually fit someone like me — social, practical, people-oriented, and not purely academic or number-based? Any suggestions?",

Go there only if you have years of experience in a particular field. And Canada, UK and  Australia are not like they used to be.  Perhaps, Germany is a good choice, but you have to learn german.  If you are fine with India, you could go there too, but only if you can spend 50-60 lakhs, so that you can get into a good private college.|||Ma tw bhanxu abroad nai try gara|||Abroad try garney vaena vaney yetai ramro course padhney.|||If you want to go for studying and make a career then don't stay in Nepal.
