            "body": "TLDR: Do not get a breed dog if you don’t have the time, devotion and money to give it the life it deserves   I just saw a post today saying they want to sell their 6 months puppy because they can’t look after her.  I recently got a dog myself so I want to explain how much a big responsibility it is. If anyone is wanting to get a dog please take the time to read this.  I had adopted a stray dog when I was a kid. But few months back I purchased my first breed dog. And there is a lot of difference between them. Stray dogs are tough but I found out that pure breed dogs like golden retrievers need a lot of care and they are more vulnerable to sicknesses.  If you can’t handle the expenses and care, do NOT absolutely get a pure bred dog.   You have to care for puppies like a human Baby. You have to feed it highly nutritious meals that can be costly, vaccinate them against multiple diseases like rabies, parvo, distemper, Covid, etc on time in quality clinics and vaccinate them yearly, give them health supplements, spend a lot of time daily grooming them, clothe them, clean after them, take them walks, pick up their poop, train them, and Teti matra nabhaera spend quality time with them to make them happy.     Also they can give you allergies (skin, respiratory, etc). You will have to clean your house a lot because they shed hair.    Also maybe you are thinking that you have a house maid or helper so they can take care of the dog. If so , please keep in mind that the dog will see the house helper as their owner - not you.  Since the house helper is feeding, grooming her and taking her on walks, the dog will get attached to them. So in case one day the house helper leaves or anything, the dog will miss them a lot and get depressed.  Mero thulba ko ghar ko dog ran away after the house keeper left. The poor dog thought her owner had left her and ran away to look for her and never returned.    Pure breeds can get easily ill and vet treatments are expensive. My dog got parvo and her treatment cost around 30k.  So, please, unless you have the time, devotion, and money to afford a dog, don’t.   For myself, getting a dog has been the best decision. But I had never imagined that I would have so much responsibilities with it. I want my dog to have her best life so I’ll do anything for her.  I have had so much expenses since I got her, I have cried so many times, my sleeping, working, daily life schedules have turned upside down. But still I could never imagine selling her or giving away.   If you don’t have this much devotion, do not get a dog just to regret it.",

But she(dog) is already 9 years old.|||The taking care of the thing is basically just the inital puppy stages and the potty training part. It definitely depends on the breed and how you are handling the dog too. Some people go way beyond and above and treat them like a literal human child deteriorating their own natural immunity. Unless its like really toxic they are fine with most human edible stuffs hai. The most crucial part is its going be a time commitment. If you are going to have a dog you should be prepared to have them actively in your life for a better part of a decade. Many people dont realise this that its going to be a huge time commitment and of course you do have to spend time with your dog and take it out on walks for it not to destroy your place. Mostly do research on the breed before hand and research its temperaments and if it matches your lifestyle.|||General rule of thumb vaneko do not get any pets unless you can afford, me and my sister got rabbits, tara ek hapta paxi nasakera feri bech dim😆😭|||Thanks for sharing this.

Set a reminder to my post, and check back in 2 years.|||You can literally do all of these but you have to choose 1.    Disclamer, Before doing anythig do research for at least a months. You can always find people who have done this before.    Invest in NEPSE? Which stocks and why?   = Because Investing in NEPSE is investing in Nepal and Nepal price will increase on time.   Start a business? What’s profitable in 2025 Nepal?   = Yes, there are lots of businesses that you can start or invest in a business with the capital and take a stake at those company. But do some research.  If something is Made in Nepal the product is seen as a pride. If you can market well you can make a business.   Buy land outside KTM before it pops?   = Land outside KTM, but it must be a busy area where other local people can lease the property for a do their business. But land near Kathmandu is also hiking so 20 lakhs mignt be not be enough. You can invest with someone with similar intention.   Import something new and flip it?   = Importing a most used product from China and then selling it to the people within the country or abroad is also a great idea. But it requires lots of market research. Your financials must be very strong. You have to add Shipping, logistics, dead stocks, rent, manpower, and electricity costs with other costs. Don't go for the unique product rather go for a product that is an advanced version of a traditional product yet useful. For a unique product, you have to create a market for yourself and you don't have a better cost estimation.   Do nothing because Nepal is too risky?   = Not really, Nepal is a growing market. Of course the government is not stable at all and it can change many things on business. However, investing in insurance, SIP, promoter shares have been a good alternative.     And if it was me with 20 lakhs, i would go for establishing an experience center where i promote new product of younger business with some charges. And for the experience center, i will change the product in a weekly or monthly basis.

Around 8 lakhs should go into strong NEPSE dividend stocks like good banks, insurance companies, and mutual funds, which give stable 10–14% returns plus possible capital gains. Another 8 lakhs should be used to start a small, high-demand business such as water jar delivery, a mobile accessories + repair shop, or electric scooter rentals—these businesses typically generate ₹40,000–1 lakh per month and can realistically add 12–18 lakhs in a couple of years. The remaining 4 lakhs can be used for a high-margin import/trading side hustle (earbuds, powerbanks, smartwatches, small electronics), which can double if done correctly. This balanced method keeps your capital safe, gives monthly income, and adds a high-return element—making it possible, in Nepal’s current market, to reach 40–50 lakhs without depending on unrealistic hype or luck.|||I might increase a bit , but the 50 l|||I'd invest it some low cost index funds and then just work my arse off.

I think this department is needed. Of course, they aren’t really working efficiently, but if taken forward correctly, it could be very useful.  There have been talks about China helping bring railways to certain locations. India le pani banaidinchu bhanekei cha. Feasibility bhairako huncha, inter ctiy train haru chalaune kura haru pani aairakei huncha. But again, nothing really gets done. I guess It’s pretty relaxed for the employees there, which makes it easier for corruption to happen.  Also, we have Panai Jhahaj Bibhag as well, if I’m correct. I’m not really sure what they do. As for railways, at least I know there’s Janakpur Railways, and different feasibility studies are ongoing. But I really don’t know much about Panai Jhahaj Bibhag.

            "body": "This is a vent. this one doctor, the absolute lack of empathy that some of them have is fucking astounding to me. Like you meet people that are low daily and that’s the level of care/empathy you have?   So I was feeling extremely low/weak(like climbing up and down the stairs made my heart race like crazy), sleeping all the time and dealing with hair-loss as well. So, I googled my symptoms and it showed maybe due to iron deficiency. I decided to do some self blood work(which by the doctor’s reaction was a crime??) thyroid, CBC and iron profile. Even if results come normal or not I would have to go to doctor, I was planning on doing that, I just did some obvious blood work because I didn’t want to go through the hospital line, waiting for reports and everything(this would take my whole day to just get the reports). I did the self blood work from a well known independent lab, got my report in two hours and I think this hurt the doctor a little bit with the way he was acting.  So, I went to him in a private hospital with expensive fee for not even 5min consultation, that too humiliating. I showed him my report. CBC, thyroid were normal. My low were  1. Transferrin saturation - 13.98 2. Ferritin- 5.07 3. Hemoglobin- 11.9(not that low and I'm also a woman so this is sort of expected)  I did ask chatgpt and read some websites to understand what these were, as i’m not from medical field (but I think this is okay to understand what the number and tests mean?). I wasn’t going to diagnose myself with these or start to take supplements or anything. I went to the doctors and this is how the conversation went-  He asked me what was my problem.  Me - I mentioned the name of tests and showed him the report, told him the ferritin levels were low, does that mean anything?  Him- asked me why I did those tests  Me- i told him i felt those symptoms and i searched online and that’s how i thought about doing it  Him - *gets a little irritated, in a really condescending tone  * tells me that the reason that i was feeling the symptoms aren’t because of iron. that he thought i did those tests because of online misinformation(he didn’t use the word tiktok but i’m sure he meant tiktok, i also didn’t get influenced because of tiktok). if i had a little bit more understanding(mind you i’m at his desk to get his service because i don’t have a better understanding???), i would have looked at my hemoglobin level which is normal(11.9 as per my report it shows low but it’s borderline low not very low), and it’s normal that my ferritin is low, it happens sometimes(which as per the tests is very low btw, the range is 13-147). That he could prescribe me iron but it will mess with my gut health(which i understand, i have taken iron supplements before and i hate taking them because of how it makes my gut feel). He went on saying how my stool will be black, and my stomach will be messed up. This online misinformation is very  rampant especially in Australia(yo kina vaneko thaa chhaina). Why was  I so thin at my age? This is the main problem re, aba age badhai gaye pachhi it’ll be difficult to gain weight as i’m not in my growing age(15-16 barsha ko chhaina re)    That these reports don’t mean anything, they don’t mean I have a disease.     *at this point i sort of couldn’t believe what i was hearing. He said all these in accusatory tone. yedi ramro sanga vaneko vaye pani, i would have felt okay-ish. I genuinely felt like I was being gaslit/humiliated because I did those tests outside the hospital. Wouldn’t the doctor prescribe me the same tests? Was it wrong for me to do that independently? I just stared at him, he kept on asking if I understood him. If I had more energy i would wanted to tell him “euta patient sanga bolne tarika yehi ho?”, mind you he is my father’s age*    Me- i cut him off and said , i wasn’t here thinking it’s a disease, if they aren’t not the reason, give me new tests that i need to do, because i’m feeling very weak. Which i still am, i’m starting to feel a little discomfort in my heart and also having headache.    Him- at this point he stopped his rambling and went “ma dinchhu ne, thyroid gari sakkyo, thyroid pardaina. Ceratin gareko chha? Chhaina, self garepaachhi kaha hunchha.”    Me- again i cut him off, and told him i just did the 3 tests.    So he gave me further tests, which is okay, i'm not a medical person and I don't know about every co-relation between symptoms and causes. But instead of rambling, humiliating me for doing a self test, he could have just told me that we might need to do more tests as these might not be enough, and gave a reason, in a respectful tone why should i do those tests. Are the test that I did wrong? Would he not have recommended me the same tests?  Is it too much to ask a little bit of respect/ human treatment from a doctor?  Also I don't really understand how those low number means nothing. I couldn't even ask him because i knew he would get more angry. So if anyone who has read this can help me understand, i would appreciate it.",

If it was  a gov \"beema\" hospital could be understandable in your case but not in a private practice.  Also remember the wisest people are the most humble ones.  Tip: Even if you did some tests dont just start conversation with the tests. Start the conversation with your symptoms. Then later when the history of disease conversation is over you can present your labs. This way doctors can rule out certain things. if you present your labs before any conversation i'll develop a bias before any symptoms are established.|||When he asked you what your problem was, why did you mention the test and directly ask what the low number meant? He probably felt insulted.  You should have first described the problem and then could have said that you also have these reports.  It's always better to do the test after a session with the doctor. This way, you won't need to have blood drawn multiple times, and you'll also save money by not doing unnecessary tests.",

Two officers stopped me and the scooter in front. One officer was discussing with the lady in the scooter ahead of me and  another officer came near me, checked my license and bluebook, verified everything, and issued me a 500Rs. chit for traffic light violation. The officer kept my bluebook but returned me the license right there and told me to pay the fine first at the nearby traffic office behind Star Hospital. Only then he would return the bluebook.  I was a bit panicked because I had a family member with me, so I dropped her off first and then went to the office. At first, there was no one at the payment window, so I had to ask around. Eventually, the officers told me to pay via the QR code on the wall (they don’t take cash). After paying online, they gave me the deposit slip.  I took the slip back to Sanepa, gave it to the officer who had my bluebook, and he returned it after verification. He also mentioned I was “lucky” because another officer would’ve fined me at least ₹1000.

Another thing to consider is that you will have more career growth opportunities when you learn programming languages like JavaScript and JS frameworks like NextJS, React, NodeJS, etc. Also, no one codes everything from start to finish. Every dev uses frameworks, libraries, packages, and, these days, AI to make life easy.|||For cms site like news portal, wordpress works like a charm|||i tried once and i personally felt using wordpress more difficult than coding in HTML, CSS and JS.|||After you get comfortable with basic HTML and CSS, you can play around with WordPress and Elementor to get better at visualizing what your code does. Elementor is just drag-and-drop, and it also adds something extra to your CV. After that, I’d suggest learning JavaScript and following the roadmap from there.|||WordPress isn't really a no code tool. It has been in market for quite some time, so there are plethora of plugins available making it possible to be used as no code platform.   If you want to make the best use of WordPress, you need to learn coding. it's a CMS at it's core with website builder like capabilities on top. You can even create the frontend in next.js or any other framework and just use WordPress like a cms backend.",

I've read few posts here about similar concerns and questions and I've found most people suggesting to join government colleges for their low price, and equal credibility of their degree. If so I want to know the list of decent government colleges to study IT.   And also while it is true self-study is what matters, but I think exposure to opportunities is equally important. Learning events like hackathons, Industry speakers, professional modules, job exposure and similar events for building connections are pretty commonly provided in Private colleges and foreign affiliated colleges. But I'm not sure if government colleges will have same amount of opportunities. Or is that not true?   In the end we do have to put in that hard work but government college or local colleges ma gareko hardwork ra private/foreign affiliated colleges ma gareko hadwork le same opportunities/results dincha ra?",

Mahamaya (Buddha's mother) is seen protected by Elephant. Another art shows her dreaming an elephant. There is also a story where buddha tamed Mad Elephant. So elephant holds importance in buddhism. You can google it.   As the time fly, scholars began their own narration and interpretation.  Mahavairocana tantra -7th/8th century. One of the foundational texts of esoteric buddhism. Here Ganesha appears as Vinayaka, often portrayed as an obstacle creating diety sub dued by the buddha's mantra. Yet once pacified. He becomes a protector.  Kanguyar - the tibetan buddhism canon, preserves several tantric texts where Ganapati is invoked. Toh 666, Toh 665 heart of mantra appears here.  Sadhanmala -a vast collection of tantric sadhanas compiled between 10th to 11th centuries include detailed rituals of Maha rakta Ganapati and other ganesha forms. These practice invoke Ganesha as a wealth bestowing and obstacle clearing diety.  In buddhism, the ganapati hridaya sutra also known as the arya maha ganapati hridaya dharani, is a sacred mantra given by shakyamuni buddha to his desciple Ananda.  Mostly Ganesha is seen in Tibetan and Vajryan with more than 4 hands.  All the buddhist countries as Japan, Thailand , indonesia (former), China see elephant head diety as buddhist god.  Ganesha images in China occur between 6th to 7th century.  Lets see where Ganesha appears in Brahmin religion (hindu).  Rigveda - 1464AD is the oldest surviving manuscripts (30 pages or folios of birch bark) submitted by Indian Governmet to UNESCO.  Ganesha does not appear in it.  And in later rigveda version also, Ganesha vagueley appears. In short, hindu Ganesha does not exist.  They may claim Veda is million years old, but we must stick with history not theories.  Ganesha Purana - 13 to 17 th century. It explains the story of Ganesha.  However , it seems the ganesha cult started form 9th/11th century.|||[deleted]|||I like it.

Public transport has always been something the government hasn’t really cared about. It’s just a topic that comes up during elections, nothing else. And then they start talking about metros and whatnot. Just improve the bus system first.  Talking about this specific incident, there is basically zero road safety in Nepal. Sahachalak hanging in the doors, hotting, and all that. Traffic sometimes fines them if they haven’t closed the doors, but that’s something the bus owner, driver, and sahachalak themselves should take responsibility for. Afno surakshya ta afei garne ho ni.  About the Nepal Yatayat you mentioned, yeah, I agree. If there are two buses from Nepal Yatayat running together, it’s like watching an F1 race. They race to the next stop like maniacs. Just last week, around 6:15 in the morning, I witnessed a public bus so packed that passengers were hanging out the doors. We’ve all been through this. I myself was once on a packed bus where a passenger actually fell out of the door and rolled because it was so overcrowded. Traffic came, arrested the driver, and made us leave the bus, but that’s not a long-term solution.  **We all need to reach our destinations, so even if we don’t want to, we have no choice but to get on these packed buses. So 2-3 din ko packed bus chalauna na paune wala rule won't work at all.** I just hope, by some miracle, the government starts focusing on improving the safety and quality of public buses.

After couple of failed relationship and a lot of mental toll, Ive realized that I hate having to do things for people, I mean my significant other. I used to believe that one day I too would someone to love and then settle down, but I'm too set on my own ways. People feel like a baggage for me.  I absolutely love my family and one of the main reason why I'm even alive (haven't unalived) is because of how much I love my mom dad and my siblings. I would do anything for them, and I have, or at least I think I have.   I hate having to do things for people. I don't like it when I have to plan for dates, bring flowers and chocolates and jumkas. I only did it in my past because although they didnt specifically asked for me, I knew it would bring them joy, so I feel obligated to do it. I didn't bring me any happiness.   Also, I just wanted to tell everyone that people aren't flags. People can't be labeled as red or green because of one specific trait. Some traits are good and others might be bad, either compromise and try to improve or move one. It's the whole package.",

Shortening. SS = 2SC; -SS=2CS; CC = 2CC; -CC = 2SS;   3. Now find pattern in the shortening if you want to make the memory stronger. i.e. sin huda bived xa. Cos sablaii barabar xa. + huda first terms same hunxa. - huda first term farak hunxa.  Now you remember it.  Second Technique: Do it hundred of times. When i studied; our class used to fill a 30 page jista each day as math homework. Do whatever math you want but varr hunthyo hamro homework.

Around a year worth of income of an average Nepalese just for a 2 years of teen's study.

The number of calls those nggas made during 2 whole weeks, fk. We kept on declining and blocking their numbers but everytime it was a new number lmao.

I’m just trying to understand what yall would prefer, especially in context of schools as China, and other countries have been using it and would you think it would be more effective? and should schools possibly use it?",

We can't even manage the few thousands of vehicles we have in Nepal. If we could at least stop the black smoke gushing from exhausts in Kathmandu maybe we could act noble, but we can't even do that due to corruption.

We depend without limits upon food grains, vegetables, medicines, fuel, vehicles, appliances that same polluting India creates. Just because your mom or wife is in a smoky kitchen doesn't mean you can act smug and call them polluters while you are still eating the food they cooked.

Awareness 2. Bans, stronger rules 3. Traffic police checks  What has worked and what will work is pricing. Get rid of rules that promote cartelling and let capitalism solve the issue.   If you had the choice to pay 20 rupees more but travel with slightly more comfort, and with a nice seat, maybe 30-40% of people would be willing to pay, which in result means more businesses willing to invest in public transport as they seek profit, more competition, better services. Those who offer neither good service nor good pricing then deserve go out of business.  This weird government backed cartelling with fixed artifical prices will never work.|||We should implement a metro-style system for local transport in Kathmandu. Currently many buses operate within the ring road but cannot travel beyond it due to narrow and congested lanes. Even when they do it only results in traffic jams.  What if we introduced autos in the valley that follow the same routes as local transport and carry 3–4 passengers per ride? Buses and vans could be restricted to the ring road and every bus stop along the ring road could have designated autos and rickshaws to drop passengers to their destinations at the same fare.  If implemented all the microbuses and hiaces could be replaced with standard buses which would likely cause less congestion than the current smaller vehicles.|||The metropolitan and the yatayat syndicate are the problems. There should be a limit on the number of passengers each vehicle can carry. For large buses, it should not be more than 110% of the number of seats. And for microbuses, it should not be more than 100% of the seating capacity. The limit rule should be enforced by the traffic police.

Each public vehicle should have a maximum passenger limit calculated and enforced by the traffic police. The Maximum number of passengers allowed for a bus = Total number of seats + Half of the number of rows of seats on each aisle. (The last joined seat row and the seats in front of the bus will not be counted in the number of rows) (Example: for a bus of 6rows of seats on each side of the aisle, only 3 people will be standing). This will ensure that even for people who are standing, there is enough room to walk around while getting off the bus. For microbuses, the max passenger capacity should not exceed the number of seats available because in a microbus, it is not possible to travel standing comfortably.  2. Ban on speakers inside the bus: The noise levels when we are on the road are already too loud, and the driver playing music in the speakers just adds to the noise levels, and the loudness often exceeds the average of 80dB. It is illegal to exceed the loudness by 65dB in public places, even in the daytime, it's in the law.   3. Buses should be cleaned and inspected for cleanliness, and all buses should have seat covers washed and replaced every week.

Tara Uncle ley bhaney jasto bidesh ma chai paisai paisa falcha, ramaailai matra cha pani haina. I left Nepal back in 08 to study Aeronautical Engineering. But then I switched to Physics… then Computer Science… then Computer Engineering because everyone kept saying “software ko market ta dherai ramro cha.”  First two years here were rough. Worked 12 hours a day, 5 days a week just to survive and pay tuition. Still had to take student loans because whatever I earned wasn’t enough since i was in an expensive city. And because of all the switching and one very bad semester where I got straight F’s, my 3–4 year bachelor’s took me 7 years.  The F’s hurt extra because I was one of those “90%+ in SLC, 79% in +2” kids. Life is funny like that.  Anyway, I graduated, got a corporate job in 2015, and got fired after a year and a half because I overstayed in Nepal. Then jobless for almost 2 years. Somehow landed a dream job in my dream company — the one starting with T, run by EM. Worked there 5 years, got laid off in 2022.  Tried dropshipping, day trading, and now I run a small business. Honestly, I’m happier now. What I’m trying to say is: life has its own weird trajectory. You do what you can depending on where you are in life. If I had stayed in Nepal, I’d probably still be a middle class with perfectly middle class life. We had a house in KTM, a bike, and our basic needs were met.  Could i afford a vacation in Pokhara back then? Yes, but i would have to be very careful about how much to spend, what hotel to stay, if i should order a beer at a restaurant or wait till I get home coz the local kirana pasal has it for cheaper.   Can I afford a Pokhara vacation now? Hell yeah. I can book two rooms in the best hotel and sleep half the night in one and half in the other. Not bragging or anything. But the financial situation has become much better now. Net worth has crossed 1M USD.  But just because it worked out for me doesn’t mean it’ll be same for everyone. I personally know people who stayed in Nepal and are doing insanely well compared to what I see here. I also know people in the US who are still struggling even with family support, degrees, everything. After 17 years here, with plenty of ups and downs, one thing I’ve learned: there will always be people doing better and worse than you. You’ll catch some opportunities, you’ll miss others.  If you think you can do well staying in Nepal, building something you’re passionate about — do that. If you think going abroad will get you closer to your goals faster — do that. Either way, there will be both regrets and happiness in life. That’s just how it is.|||well... fock them|||Paap ho !

            "body": "TLDR: Do not get a breed dog if you don’t have the time, devotion and money to give it the life it deserves   I just saw a post today saying they want to sell their 6 months puppy because they can’t look after her.  I recently got a dog myself so I want to explain how much a big responsibility it is. If anyone is wanting to get a dog please take the time to read this.  I had adopted a stray dog when I was a kid. But few months back I purchased my first breed dog. And there is a lot of difference between them. Stray dogs are tough but I found out that pure breed dogs like golden retrievers need a lot of care and they are more vulnerable to sicknesses.  If you can’t handle the expenses and care, do NOT absolutely get a pure bred dog.   You have to care for puppies like a human Baby. You have to feed it highly nutritious meals that can be costly, vaccinate them against multiple diseases like rabies, parvo, distemper, Covid, etc on time in quality clinics and vaccinate them yearly, give them health supplements, spend a lot of time daily grooming them, clothe them, clean after them, take them walks, pick up their poop, train them, and Teti matra nabhaera spend quality time with them to make them happy.     Also they can give you allergies (skin, respiratory, etc). You will have to clean your house a lot because they shed hair.    Also maybe you are thinking that you have a house maid or helper so they can take care of the dog. If so , please keep in mind that the dog will see the house helper as their owner - not you.  Since the house helper is feeding, grooming her and taking her on walks, the dog will get attached to them. So in case one day the house helper leaves or anything, the dog will miss them a lot and get depressed.  Mero thulba ko ghar ko dog ran away after the house keeper left. The poor dog thought her owner had left her and ran away to look for her and never returned.    Pure breeds can get easily ill and vet treatments are expensive. My dog got parvo and her treatment cost around 30k.  So, please, unless you have the time, devotion, and money to afford a dog, don’t.   For myself, getting a dog has been the best decision. But I had never imagined that I would have so much responsibilities with it. I want my dog to have her best life so I’ll do anything for her.  I have had so much expenses since I got her, I have cried so many times, my sleeping, working, daily life schedules have turned upside down. But still I could never imagine selling her or giving away.   If you don’t have this much devotion, do not get a dog just to regret it.",

It definitely depends on the breed and how you are handling the dog too. Some people go way beyond and above and treat them like a literal human child deteriorating their own natural immunity. Unless its like really toxic they are fine with most human edible stuffs hai. The most crucial part is its going be a time commitment. If you are going to have a dog you should be prepared to have them actively in your life for a better part of a decade. Many people dont realise this that its going to be a huge time commitment and of course you do have to spend time with your dog and take it out on walks for it not to destroy your place. Mostly do research on the breed before hand and research its temperaments and if it matches your lifestyle.|||General rule of thumb vaneko do not get any pets unless you can afford, me and my sister got rabbits, tara ek hapta paxi nasakera feri bech dim😆😭|||Thanks for sharing this.

You can always find people who have done this before.    Invest in NEPSE? Which stocks and why?   = Because Investing in NEPSE is investing in Nepal and Nepal price will increase on time.   Start a business? What’s profitable in 2025 Nepal?   = Yes, there are lots of businesses that you can start or invest in a business with the capital and take a stake at those company. But do some research.  If something is Made in Nepal the product is seen as a pride. If you can market well you can make a business.   Buy land outside KTM before it pops?   = Land outside KTM, but it must be a busy area where other local people can lease the property for a do their business. But land near Kathmandu is also hiking so 20 lakhs mignt be not be enough. You can invest with someone with similar intention.   Import something new and flip it?   = Importing a most used product from China and then selling it to the people within the country or abroad is also a great idea. But it requires lots of market research. Your financials must be very strong. You have to add Shipping, logistics, dead stocks, rent, manpower, and electricity costs with other costs. Don't go for the unique product rather go for a product that is an advanced version of a traditional product yet useful. For a unique product, you have to create a market for yourself and you don't have a better cost estimation.   Do nothing because Nepal is too risky?   = Not really, Nepal is a growing market. Of course the government is not stable at all and it can change many things on business. However, investing in insurance, SIP, promoter shares have been a good alternative.     And if it was me with 20 lakhs, i would go for establishing an experience center where i promote new product of younger business with some charges. And for the experience center, i will change the product in a weekly or monthly basis.

Around 8 lakhs should go into strong NEPSE dividend stocks like good banks, insurance companies, and mutual funds, which give stable 10–14% returns plus possible capital gains. Another 8 lakhs should be used to start a small, high-demand business such as water jar delivery, a mobile accessories + repair shop, or electric scooter rentals—these businesses typically generate ₹40,000–1 lakh per month and can realistically add 12–18 lakhs in a couple of years. The remaining 4 lakhs can be used for a high-margin import/trading side hustle (earbuds, powerbanks, smartwatches, small electronics), which can double if done correctly. This balanced method keeps your capital safe, gives monthly income, and adds a high-return element—making it possible, in Nepal’s current market, to reach 40–50 lakhs without depending on unrealistic hype or luck.|||I might increase a bit , but the 50 l|||I'd invest it some low cost index funds and then just work my arse off.

The medical college I studied in, it was one of the better experiences of my life. It was nonstop fun for the whole year except during the exams. It was probably because I was outgoing as a person and my batchmates were mostly like that as well. But then there were people who couldn't stop studying. They had the stress quite visible on their faces. The college was also lax on regulations and it was your responsibility to keep track of your studies. They didn't constantly monitor or test us but I've heard other colleges are very strict on that regard.   Now, given all this positive experience, do I recommend you study MBBS? ABSOLUTELY NO!!!! (unless you're like extremely passionate for it, but I don't think a plus 2 passout can realistically differentiate true passion from the med-influencers generated hype that blinds them.) It's not worth the time, the money and the effort. Put same effort into something else and you'll be better off. It's not a rose filled walled off garden the medical influencers in some Facebook group or at NAME or Vibrant make it out to be. |||Well first off, 80 lakhs sabai thau ma lagney haina. Some private colleges do absolutely rip off but govt colleges and tu ko pvt colleges don’t charge absurd fees the way kmc, nmc, noble etc. do   If you are passionate, go for it. Paisa vanney kura ko tension lini haina. Mbbs sakkesi nai if you choose to work in rural areas, easily 1lakh+/mnth kamauna sakincha. The same goes for after md/ms. All these years, I haven’t seen a doctor who is “broke”. Sure, underpaid holan compared to the work they put but life nai sustain garna sakinna doctor vayera vanney is just bs.    Time management is a skill that you need to learn. There are so many medical students and doctors with a good social life, pursuing their hobbies, traveling and living life while balancing their studies/work.    Also, if someone says mbbs ma scope chaina, paisa kamauna sakinna, just ask them kun chai career ma 100% khatra paisa huncha vanney guarantee cha? IT? accounting? Engineering? Economics? Kei ma chaina. Harek field ma some people are happy, some are miserable. So just do what you are passionate about.    One might argue 50 lakhs worth it chaina. Well people tend to blow up their entire life savings on their kids wedding ceremonies just to show off their status. But tyei paisa padhai ma lagani garna chai nahuney? Kasto hypocrisy ho tyo?|||Dark reality? That is THE reality of this profession isnt it? That is why Doctors are so respected.|||pustaini sampati xa vaney padda kei farak pardaina!|||A bit of a rant   1) The most taxing aspect i would say is time. 5.5 years for MBBS, 1 year compulsory clinical experience, 3 years for MD, 3 years for super specialty. 11 years of your life and that too if you get the rankings in the first attempt and study in self payment, which is quite unfeasible. If you get into a scholarship then you have to do 2 years of bonded service and cannot apply for MD before you finish your bond. Same for MD and SS. So if you get into a government scholarship all along the way, 17 years from MBBS to SS.  2) The pay is terrible at all levels. Post MBBS inside KTM you're barely paid 40-50K. After MD you'll get a salary bump but that too depends on where you work. If you work in the periphery you'll get good money but very little opportunity to grow.   3) Also this field in itself is toxic. The cycle of suffering is self perpetuated by the medical community. Some people are genuinely just out to get you for no apparent reason other than their supposed seniority. Seniors will justify the abuse and neglect with \"we faced and passed through it so must you\". The ability to work in unimaginable conditions is often celebrated. The more abuse you are able to take and not let it affect your work the more you are praised. Given enough time your brain compounds and warps this into a sick sense of pride. I've seen people proclaim proudly how long they've been without sleep or how long they've stayed in hospital.   3) Neither the government nor your family gives a damn. They expect you to work, to earn and provide. You'll be hailed a dcotor but you won't be paid a liveable wage. They expect you to be a paragon of virtue and humanity but won't give you a decent pay. All government policies feel like they're aimed at forcibly retaining medical professionals in Nepal. The government, the NMC, NMA, NHPC all work against you. Don't expect them to stand for you.   You'll lose time, your youth‌, your vitality, your aspirations, your sense of self and quite often your will to live. So if you have an exorbitant amount of wealth or don't mind depending on your family for 35 plus years of your life then by all means go for it.|||No, MD garera ni pugdaina, DM gara ani Dm gare chi tyo level ko job nai chaina.|||Yes it is the shittiest course. Though people can manage having their social life but life never feels same after joining it. At least I didn't feel it the same when I started this journey. Have to depend upon the parents till your 26 27 is kind of difficult. Even after that you will be not sure what you will do and what is your fate in the medicine. I didn't regret at least till now cause this is the only thing I could do; that's why I am here but life offers you better things which you should accept gracefully. But yeah managing till now but deep inside you never know what med students are going through. At least I can say that if you give a med student a blank sheet and a paper they would fill the whole paper about the things they want to do BUT they can't because they are bounded to so called MEDICINE.|||Unless you plan to work abroad don't do it.|||nepal ma worth xaina hai mbbs garerw|||Bro Mbbs garera Nepal ma matra haina katai kam xaina MD garnai parcha.

            "body": "As an Computer Engineering/IT graduate in Nepal, there are various pathways.  Option A) You stay in Nepal  Option B) You move abroad   Let's discuss about Option A first.  There are two realistic pathways you could take if you stayed in Nepal.  - work at private  - work at government   I have tried working at private. But the amount of discrimination being done in private companies really blew me up. As someone who was also preparing for government jobs, I had noticed lots of underprivileged folks participating in government jobs exam(for computer engineer as well). I used to ponder what made them do this since this is not a very lucrative job compared to what a \"certain community\" person makes at private or \"certain community\" person grows at private job. But later realized that private companies are not interested to hire these \"underprivileged\" folks.   Lots of people might argue (although they know it is not true) private jobs hire on merit. No they do not do so in Nepal. It is completely based off connections. It does not matter your knowledge. It is about who you know 100%. I am not ignorant that this might be the case outside, but I swear to god everyday, esto garera USA ma jasto innovative companies cha tyo ta pakkai hudainthyo..   The reason for such favoritism is mainly because the work they do is so shit. Leaving few companies who developer softwares that Nepalese use on daily basis(Not ludo), other jobs are not very interesting to do either. It is the same low quality menial job with meagre pay.   The companies who have a business are handful already. Investor ko money burn garne jasto nepal ma kei hudaina as there are no investors. So you see these bitchy ass companies hiring full stack developer every day for the salary of an intern.     I could not really be bothered with working under someone and taking all nonsense blames for 30,000 per month on hand. With no future and no growth and dismissing my self esteem. My aviman is and was huge.   The second pathway is to work at government corporations. I looked at the salary of computer engineer at Nepal Army, Nijamati and it is decent. But the upwards mobility is just not there. What I mean by that is salary is not growing when you grow your experience. Aba ta government employee specially nijamati lai dekhne bittikai yo bhrastachari raicha bhanne lagcha. Kinaki bhrastachar nagari ta khana basnai napugne. Pradhan Sena Pati ko talab cha 67000. Social security benefits cha good and all but cash in hand ni aileko market rate anusar ta dinu paryo ni. 67000 ma kam garne pradhansenapati le ghus nakhaye k garera palne? lol.  I looked at corporations salary. And it seems that if you manage to get a handle at a corporation(Sansthans), you can make be sure to make average of 60-70 thousands per month even as a 6th level officer. At this point of my career, this seems fair enough. But it will not be enough after 5 years, if my increment is just 1 thousand per year.    A huge reform is required in government services. Government services (specially nijamati) are the core to how people feel about the government. If we cannot make it attractive and lucrative, it does not matter how rich we are saving on their salary.  Next option is moving abroad.  Aba ko market ma abroad ma PR paune/GC paune biswas ta chaina. Unless you do the jobs that Americans do not want to do (or foreigners) like teaching for 60k/year, nursing old people etc.  15 years bidesh ma basna jane. Kam garne and coming back to Nepal. It seems the most plausible way forward. Nepal ma ayepachi k garne bhanne hunasakcha however.  The countries in option to stay for so long are Japan, India. Do not want to surrender my passport to Dubai sheikh. Also middle east is terror and war prone so do not want to end up there.   Europe tira padna gaye matra ho. It seems bleak for immigrants nowadays. And I do not think they earn that much in Europe (for someone planning to return back to Nepal and not stay there). Teta nabasne bhayepachi social security ko teti matlab bhayena.   How about USA? USA seems fine and all. but I do not think getting a work permit after Masters degree is going to be easy. Or that you are going to make big bucks and save big bucks as an immigrant in this economy. Since PR/GC is not guaranteed, you are basically playing a zero sum game. The experience that you get in abroad and education bla bla is huge investment however.",

I want to build a real career in IT so I can eventually work remotely or move abroad. I want something realistic that I can learn in about a year and turn into a stable, good-paying job.  Honestly, I’m not interested in freelancing or full-stack because (personally) it feels oversaturated and too creative (for each project) and portfolio-heavy, but I’m still open if I’m wrong. I don’t wanna sound picky, and desperate, like “I only want X, not Y.” Please don't get me wrong. I'm willing to learn and work. I’m flexible - I just want something that's worth my time and effort.  I’m looking for an IT path that:  • isn’t super saturated   • is easier for beginners   • hires freshers from Nepal (South Asia)   • has a stable monthly salary (4 digits)   • has a clear roadmap   • doesn’t require a uni degree   • reliable - won’t be replaced by AI soon   • can help me find jobs abroad  If you were in my shoes - 23, broke, no degree, living in Nepal, trying to break into tech in 2025/2026 - what would you realistically choose?  I’m open to anything: front-end, app dev, full stack, IT support, cloud, DevOps, QA, cybersecurity, networking, data, MySQL - anything that actually works for someone starting with almost nothing. Coz, I don't wanna end up being homeless. Seriously, I am so sick of my current lifestyle, I wanna make a change and take some right action that will lead me to my goal. I literally don't care if it's hard or impossible, coz now it's a necessity.. I am ready to sacrifice my time. I wanna invest in myself (my skills).  So, please, I need your help to choose the right direction.  I’d really appreciate any honest suggestions, roadmaps, or personal stories from people who started in a similar place.  Thanks a lot.",

QA is the easiest and fastest way to get a job because it’s not too saturated, Nepal hires many freshers, and you don’t need a portfolio or degree. IT support is the most stable long-term option because it’s beginner friendly, companies always need support staff, and it naturally leads to higher-paying roles like SysAdmin or Cloud Engineer. Cybersecurity is the most future-proof, global, and high-demand field, but it requires more effort in the first few months.  Things like frontend, full-stack, and freelancing are not the best starting point when you’re broke and need stability fast; they take longer and require portfolios or creativity. A simple one-year plan would look like this: for QA, learn manual testing first, then SQL/API testing, and later basic automation. For IT support, learn computer basics, networking, and ticketing tools, then move towards cloud platforms. For cybersecurity, start with networking and Linux, then learn security basics and practice SOC labs.  If you want something fast, choose QA. If you want something stable and practical, go for IT support. If you want long-term growth and international opportunities, choose cybersecurity. Any of these three can realistically change your life within a year if you stay focused|||You’re only 23, so you have time on your side. While I understand you want quick results, consider exploring online degree programs. Many are flexible and work-friendly. A degree can make a huge difference when applying for jobs abroad and competing for better positions - it might be worth the investment alongside building your skills. 🙂🙂|||If I were you, I’d start with IT support → networking → cloud. It’s cheap to learn, beginner-friendly, hires freshers in South Asia, and leads to real stable jobs. Once you get basic support skills, aim for CCNA, then AWS. It’s the most realistic path to a solid career without a degree.|||look for QA, devrel, dev advocate, project manager, sre/devops etc. what's the tech skill that u already know? |||Garo nai cha aile ko situation ma ta.

It feels like Nepal is reaching the end of its “let’s build an app for every small problem” phase. Most day-to-day needs already have apps — payments, rides, food, banking, shopping, telehealth, LMS, ticketing, etc. The market is small, and the problems are mostly solved.  At the same time, many companies are: •\tcutting native Android/iOS teams, •\tslowing down on new product development, • and focusing on maintenance instead of innovation.  Some people believe that in the future, Nepal will simply “import” franchise-level apps once international payment becomes seamless. If apps from abroad work out of the box — with Visa Direct, PayPal, Apple/Google Pay — then why would a Nepali company rebuild the same thing?  So the real question is:  Are we entering a phase where Nepal won’t need many new apps — only maintenance, hybrid development, and outsourcing?  Or is this just a temporary market correction?

I got my laptop when I was in class 10 and ever since I started my grind. At first, I used to watch a lot of video in youtube which didn’t make sense later. Firstly I started learning flutter which I did not enjoy that much so I switched to python and later learned few ml tools, frameworks and concepts but it was way more hard than I thought it would be. All this from class 10 to 11. After that again I switched to web development. I previously made few projects with HTML and css so I moved directly to js. Due to little previous knowledge of programming leaning js was abit easy for me then I continued till my 2nd year of college learning MERN stack. All of this when I choose biology due to family pressure in +2. I’ve even stayed till 2am grinding my ass off. This was my passion. I didn’t have much time for internship due to college so I started hunting projects in fiverr and upwork. Finally all those hard work paid off. I got a project few months ago which turned out to be a long project based agreement and it’s going on. I still try to manage work, college and everyday learning as much as I can.  I feel so nice that I am living the life I wrote on sticky note as a motivation on my wall. Just wanted to share my 4 year long story. Maybe this can motivate newbies who has same passion in tech.

Elementor is just drag-and-drop, and it also adds something extra to your CV. After that, I’d suggest learning JavaScript and following the roadmap from there.|||WordPress isn't really a no code tool. It has been in market for quite some time, so there are plethora of plugins available making it possible to be used as no code platform.   If you want to make the best use of WordPress, you need to learn coding. it's a CMS at it's core with website builder like capabilities on top. You can even create the frontend in next.js or any other framework and just use WordPress like a cms backend.",

People supporting them just wanted something , election bhyera powerless bhyec manche yo yuba sang ka leader haru kasari arko party xercha drama herna maja aaucha.|||political parties are built on a set of beliefs, called ideology. this ideology is like a master plan for how to run the country. it covers everything from how the government should work to how to take care of citizens and deal with other nations.  people often support a party because they truly believe in this plan and its leaders. it is not just about short term benefits(masu baht, jagir, and all) or projects for their local area. they connect with the party's vision for the future.  for democracy to work, we need such organized groups. they help bring many different people's ideas together and give voters clear choices. without them, the system would be just chaotic and unstable.  however, running a political party is very complicated, especially in a democracy like ours. leaders can't just do whatever they want. they have to manage different opinions inside the party and respond to the public. un a country like Nepal, with its difficult geography and many different groups of people, this complexity is even greater. change cannot happen quickly.  a major problem that makes everything harder is corruption. when leaders abuse their power for personal gain, it breaks the public's trust. it also makes the gap between the rich and the poor much worse. this means that while a few people get richer, many others are left behind in poverty, creating a deep social divide.  because of all these challenges including corruption and inequality, parties and their leaders can be slow to create change. a real shift in how things are done takes a long time. maybe decades. because it takes a series of elections and filtrations.  therefore, it is better to try to understand this complex situation rather than simply calling party supporters jholey. understanding the difficulties, including how anarchy and chaos hurt everyone, helps us have a more informed and useful discussion about nepal's future.|||So many dumb people in the country🤦|||Out of 3 crore Nepali UML have just 6 lakh member .   Daraunu pardina |||800-1000 jana jati hola tei mathi crowd thulo dekhauna they called people from other districts jholey where saying yo jilla bata yeti jana lerauchu.

You will be amazed how popular Hitler was in Germany.|||Depends on what type of ans you want.   Trendy: they're brainwashed, selfish, came for masubhat  Reality: UML has strong foundation and institutions in every sectors, from education to workers, farmers, employees, businesses.   These organizations/institutions although have bad reputations, have done some apprecianle deeds too. From volunteering, blood donations, scholarship schemes etc. For eg. UML's student union was the first one to reach to Kalapani and put Nepal's flag on the land.   What we're doing is just bashing them on the internet with mostly baseless accusations. (Mostly, not all). That's not how you defeat an established and strong organization. If we want these parties to perish, we've to understand how they function and why they are still popular in villages and countryside.

I’m truly grateful. Recently during an interview, I shared my personal political standpoint. I mentioned that I do not personally recognize K.P. Oli as a leader whose ideology I align with. I say this not out of disrespect, but from a place of accountability and responsibility toward our nation. After the recent Gen Z protests, I believe many of us expected honest conversations, acknowledgment of public concerns, and accountability for the injustices that occurred under his administration where many lives were lost. When leadership is unable to take responsibility for such serious matters, it becomes difficult for me to support or follow their ideology. My intention is not to attack individuals, but to stand for truth, transparency, and a future where leaders are answerable to the people. I believe Nepal deserves leadership that listens, learns, and upholds justice for every citizen. Thank you once again to everyone who resonated with my thoughts. Let’s continue pushing for a better and more responsible political culture together.|||So many Incel chicks in comment, are we even safe?|||Nepal is literally full of chutiyas like these, logic fact kei chaina 😂 .

Mahamaya (Buddha's mother) is seen protected by Elephant. Another art shows her dreaming an elephant. There is also a story where buddha tamed Mad Elephant. So elephant holds importance in buddhism. You can google it.   As the time fly, scholars began their own narration and interpretation.  Mahavairocana tantra -7th/8th century. One of the foundational texts of esoteric buddhism. Here Ganesha appears as Vinayaka, often portrayed as an obstacle creating diety sub dued by the buddha's mantra. Yet once pacified. He becomes a protector.  Kanguyar - the tibetan buddhism canon, preserves several tantric texts where Ganapati is invoked. Toh 666, Toh 665 heart of mantra appears here.  Sadhanmala -a vast collection of tantric sadhanas compiled between 10th to 11th centuries include detailed rituals of Maha rakta Ganapati and other ganesha forms. These practice invoke Ganesha as a wealth bestowing and obstacle clearing diety.  In buddhism, the ganapati hridaya sutra also known as the arya maha ganapati hridaya dharani, is a sacred mantra given by shakyamuni buddha to his desciple Ananda.  Mostly Ganesha is seen in Tibetan and Vajryan with more than 4 hands.  All the buddhist countries as Japan, Thailand , indonesia (former), China see elephant head diety as buddhist god.  Ganesha images in China occur between 6th to 7th century.  Lets see where Ganesha appears in Brahmin religion (hindu).  Rigveda - 1464AD is the oldest surviving manuscripts (30 pages or folios of birch bark) submitted by Indian Governmet to UNESCO.  Ganesha does not appear in it.  And in later rigveda version also, Ganesha vagueley appears. In short, hindu Ganesha does not exist.  They may claim Veda is million years old, but we must stick with history not theories.  Ganesha Purana - 13 to 17 th century. It explains the story of Ganesha.  However , it seems the ganesha cult started form 9th/11th century.|||[deleted]|||whats bad we should respect our culture|||I like it.

            "body": "Gen-Z Rise Again as UML Welcome Rally Turns Into Street Battle” Simara, Nov 19 What began as a peaceful black-flag demonstration by the Gen-Z youth of Simara took a dramatic and violent turn today, echoing the spirit of the September 8/9 Revolution that first put the city’s young protestors in the national spotlight.   Early this morning, as UML leader Mahesh Basnet was scheduled to arrive in Simara for a grand welcome rally, a group of Gen-Z protestors lined the streets with black flags symbolizing their dissatisfaction with the rapidly expanding UML influence in the region.   But at 11 a.m., tensions flared. According to eyewitnesses, several UML supporters confronted the protestors, harshly ordering them to “go home” and stop the demonstration. The young protestors refused, insisting on their right to a peaceful protest. Within moments, the situation spiraled as a group of UML members allegedly attacked the Gen-Z demonstrators with punches and kicks, forcibly dragging them off the road.   Despite the police presence, officers reportedly took no action against the UML supporters, instead attempting to summon the young protestors who were being assaulted.   The violence triggered swift public anger. Locals rushed to defend the youth, causing the UML members involved to flee toward the Simara airport. Meanwhile, Basnet’s incoming flight was cancelled due to safety concerns. But the confrontation didn’t end there.   The Gen-Z protestors, refusing to back down, marched to the airport demanding the arrest of those who attacked them. Police sealed off the airport to prevent clashes, prompting some protestors to throw stones at the airport gate and officers. With tensions boiling over, the youth of Simara took their demonstration to the streets, blocking the major highway from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m., creating a city-wide standstill. In a heated face-off with the DSP, the Gen-Z protestors issued a clear ultimatum: If the UML supporters responsible for the assault are not taken into custody by 9 a.m. tomorrow, November 20, they will seal the roads again.   Simara now waits for dawn and for the authorities’ next move as the city’s youth once again position themselves at the frontlines of political resistance.",

It should be well investigated that whether its UML's trick or what.

I highly doubt that the script was planned so that election could be disturbed,  chaos will be creates and more and more violence so that the current government gives up.  UML is champion in such script. Remember Bidya Bhandari Ktm baata chunab utheko bela Keshav Sthapit le Bidya bhandari koo poster maa gobar dalerw congress le daleko vanerw anti-congress sentiment create gareko.  GenZ are not matured in such jal jhel and unfair games. That's why we are getting played on by UML. UML is such champion player in such script. They want to defame Genz and want to create more hate towards us. So they attacked airport to show as if gen z are deshdrohi. We need to act mature and be non-violent so that such UML jholeys will not be able to defame us.|||Thoughts on this incident",

Around a year worth of income of an average Nepalese just for a 2 years of teen's study.  My experience with Kavya was that my mom went there just to check it out (ofcourse it was out of our budget) and sadly she entered her number in some survey they had.      The number of calls those nggas made during 2 whole weeks, fk. We kept on declining and blocking their numbers but everytime it was a new number lmao. When we first asked for discount, they declined for even a rupee but later on they started giving offers themselves, despo times for them ig. I shouted at them once and finally they stopped.|||Kavya na jau bhanxu hai Discount kei ma xaina +2 Ko lagi SXC ya sasto, ramro ma gaye hunxa for science Management ho bhane global|||Me who completed +2 in 1 lakh|||Esto mahango cha +2 aile?",

Watch khan academy for general concepts. Use Perplexity AI or something like that for personal guidance. I got away with a 3.8+ GPA with only these resources. Perplexity really helped me understand the topics I was really struggling with. Also take full advantage of your school library. I used different books to get my concepts clear. For example: Use Fundamental Physics by Resnick and Halliday to understand the concepts in Physics, Thomas calculus for calculus, also most of the math is covered in BC Bajracharya's Basic of Mathematics. Even if you study an hour a day using these resources, that would be enough (Considering you pay attention in class).|||How much is the fee|||Too bad youtube ma free ma xa 😢|||Don't take online tuition class myannn|||fee?? |||You can easily access any topics from any elite professors for FREE .

In winter the cold air keeps pollution trapped, neither blowing away nor washing down. Everything contributes here - India contributes according to its size and population, and so does Nepal. We can't even manage the few thousands of vehicles we have in Nepal. If we could at least stop the black smoke gushing from exhausts in Kathmandu maybe we could act noble, but we can't even do that due to corruption. So with what moral superiority can we look down on the chaos in India? We could act superior if we weren't dependent on the same polluting industries and agriculture of India. We depend without limits upon food grains, vegetables, medicines, fuel, vehicles, appliances that same polluting India creates. Just because your mom or wife is in a smoky kitchen doesn't mean you can act smug and call them polluters while you are still eating the food they cooked.

Awareness 2. Bans, stronger rules 3. Traffic police checks  What has worked and what will work is pricing. Get rid of rules that promote cartelling and let capitalism solve the issue.   If you had the choice to pay 20 rupees more but travel with slightly more comfort, and with a nice seat, maybe 30-40% of people would be willing to pay, which in result means more businesses willing to invest in public transport as they seek profit, more competition, better services. Those who offer neither good service nor good pricing then deserve go out of business.  This weird government backed cartelling with fixed artifical prices will never work.|||We should implement a metro-style system for local transport in Kathmandu. Currently many buses operate within the ring road but cannot travel beyond it due to narrow and congested lanes. Even when they do it only results in traffic jams.  What if we introduced autos in the valley that follow the same routes as local transport and carry 3–4 passengers per ride? Buses and vans could be restricted to the ring road and every bus stop along the ring road could have designated autos and rickshaws to drop passengers to their destinations at the same fare.  If implemented all the microbuses and hiaces could be replaced with standard buses which would likely cause less congestion than the current smaller vehicles.|||The metropolitan and the yatayat syndicate are the problems. There should be a limit on the number of passengers each vehicle can carry. For large buses, it should not be more than 110% of the number of seats. And for microbuses, it should not be more than 100% of the seating capacity. The limit rule should be enforced by the traffic police.   It's a systemic problem and requires a systemic solution.|||Nepal yatayat ma gundruk khade vanda namajale khadiyeko yaad ayo|||nonchalant khalasi dai|||Ajhai 3 Jana atne thau cha.|||Khalasi be like pachadi sarnus na tetro khali cha|||aghii pakhai ho ni..khalashi haru huncha micro ra yatayaat ko bhadaa karcha.

The land already belongs to a government body, in this case, TU, it made things easy.  But elsewhere in larger projects, main reason this is difficult is because of people. For example, the nagdhunga project was stalled for 6 months because of local demands of alternative water supply, compensation money, jobs for the locals, etc. Without this, it would have already been completed last year.  Now, significant amount of taxpayer money in infrastructure projects are spent in land acquisition. The only way for Nepal to develop fast is i. stop people needlessly stopping projects and either ii. significant land reform, or complete land price collapse and people to stop seeing land as investment.|||This was a dream for cricket fan like me!!

            "body": "People I’ve known for 24 years turned out to be completely different when it comes to caste.  Today I was invited to my friend’s house for lunch. She recently had a baby, so I was genuinely happy to visit her and meet her newborn. I was meeting her in person after 2 years.  We cooked together, washed the dishes, gossiped a lot, and I came home with a full heart.  Then at the dinner table, my parents asked what caste she is. I told them… and they immediately started talking about caste differences and how I shouldn’t visit her house for meals, and how she shouldn’t come to ours. Hearing them talk about her caste that way absolutely broke my heart. I couldn’t control my tears, and my mom said, “kina yesto chitta dukhako. Pitri farak farak hunxa, manxe yeutai matra vayerw hunna. Hamlai ni aaru le yesto garxan, hamle ni garnu parxa. Paxi tha pauxau, etc etc.”  We never had serious caste conversations before. In fact, I remember them teaching us that these things shouldn’t exist, that we’re all equal. And they’ve never shown this kind of behavior toward others who visit our home or toward our tenants who are the same caste as my friend? I'm confused and upset with this interaction with my parents.",

Our parents grew up in a time where extreme casteism was normal. They didn’t create it, but they were raised inside that system, taught to follow it, and warned about the consequences of not doing so. Education shapes the mind, and the education they received reinforced these beliefs regardless of religion, culture, or society. So they’re not entirely wrong, and we’re not entirely right either.  The real problem is that we often fail to understand the environment they grew up in and the fears they carried. Instead of trying to see their side, we sometimes blame them or play the victim because it’s the easier option. But change takes understanding from both generations—not just criticism. 🙏|||This will just go with this generation or maybe next or next but you just forget what they said and forget about the cast system as well and just focus on people's behavior and if nobody talks about it next generation is not even going to know such a thing and it will just go away. But if we keep saying we're all equal frequently children are going to think they are saying this because  we're all not equal. Indirectly they'll learn that cast is a big deal. that's my point of view. And forget my English as well ☺|||This is really heartbreaking. It’s painful when people who taught us about equality show a different side. Caste ideas came through shared history and influence from India, but we don’t have to carry them forward.

I respect him for his contribution in reformation in electricity of Nepal. But that don’t give him excuse to whatever theater he is creating now.  He was waiting for RSP meeting held in chitwan of central committee and when it was certain that none of them wants him as a president before Rabi either gets convicted of charges from court or finish his two tenure if not found guilty, then why won’t he accept any other role? Rabi and other made the RSP  from dust and he wants a free dinner with zero contribution. I cannot see any other reason other then his aim to bring destabilization in party and finally end this party as Ganesh kakrki revealed that in one recent interviews which also aligns with Balen too plans.  Why they desperately wants to end RSP just like congress and yemale has been trying so far?? Everyone is demanding to form coalition between RSP, Kulman and Balen to get more seats and can justice be given to family of martyrs. Why they are putting their ego first before country interest ??  All this theatrics indicates that kulamn could be still pawn on hand of prachanda and Balen either being manipulated by his close allys or fucking moron that cannot either embrace crowd, face press , or make decisions.

Is this confirmed or just rumors?|||Balen le party banaucha vanera kasle vanyo?|||It is hard for people to believe, but Kulman is corrupt, albeit, not on the level of old goons. His work is visible, but he is corrupt.  Balen is the only person whom I can say with confidence is not corrupt, yet. But he is no politician, and I don't think he will ever be. It is also very hard for him to open party with individual who is not involved in any scandal, and keep his non-corrupt image intact.  Rabi has his own problems. However, he is the only person at the moment who is a politician, and not involved with old goons. Only his party could have defeated the old goons, but since he is in jail, RSP will not get majority seats this time.  So, the new alternative forces combined will still not have majority in present scenario. Only way the alternative forces can have majority is if Balen and Kulman would have join RSP with Rabi still as head of RSP. But this scenario was simply not possible from start. Balen cannot associate himself with people with scandals, and Kulman is not really an alternative force, but rather the produce of the old goons who is not as bad as the old goons.|||Chup machikney tyo purano vanda yei thiq , reddit ma aayera na vuk|||One thing I will suggest if new party is contesting In some constituency just don't contest in that area. The same tactic Congress did with maobadi during election. After winning form an alliance which is the best thing to do. For that rpp rsp and new parties should agree on this.

Another thing CK raut did the worst mistake by completely showcasing the madesh separation thing. The thing is he would have ideal for collation to collaborate in madesh election. But one thing is for sure he lost his own madesh people club after gen z election and this statement have made him more hateful among madesh youth. Boy is gonna loose huge.

Unlike traditional parties, anyone with potentiality can join and compete in elections.  If Rabi Lamichane had wanted, he could have pushed Kulman Ghising as face of RSP for PM. Rabi didn't have to handover chairman. As he is in jail. He cannot run the country anyway.  There are others beside Rabi, who are aiming for PM in absence of Rabi. That's why the discussion failed. Don't blame on Kulman Ghising.  Kulman Ghising is the only person, that knows bureaucracy from core. He knows where to tweak and break. They can't fool him. He is needed for country.

Then, they must give up their ego.|||You can read the indepth article to find out how Sumana and the gang along with Balen and Kulman tried to oust Rabi from his own party. https://www.nepalpress.com/2025/11/03/656615/|||There's no any alternative to Congress and UML.

After plugging in the charger, the laptop didn’t respond at all for hours.  Assuming the charger was faulty, I took it to the Mudita service center. Later, they informed me that the **motherboard was damaged (“shot”)** and needed to be replaced, costing **about 60% of the laptop’s original price**. To make things worse, the laptop had just exceeded its 12 month warranty by around one month, so they refused to cover the repair under warranty.  It feels extremely strange and concerning that a motherboard or CPU would get damaged simply while charging normally. If there had been a high-voltage surge, then **all devices connected at the same time should have been affected**, including my colleagues’ laptops and chargers — but none of them faced any issue.  For a device to fail like this right after warranty expiry raises doubts about **product durability and quality assurance**. Very disappointed with this experience.",

            "body": "As an Computer Engineering/IT graduate in Nepal, there are various pathways.  Option A) You stay in Nepal  Option B) You move abroad   Let's discuss about Option A first.  There are two realistic pathways you could take if you stayed in Nepal.  - work at private  - work at government   I have tried working at private. But the amount of discrimination being done in private companies really blew me up. As someone who was also preparing for government jobs, I had noticed lots of underprivileged folks participating in government jobs exam(for computer engineer as well). I used to ponder what made them do this since this is not a very lucrative job compared to what a \"certain community\" person makes at private or \"certain community\" person grows at private job. But later realized that private companies are not interested to hire these \"underprivileged\" folks.   Lots of people might argue (although they know it is not true) private jobs hire on merit. No they do not do so in Nepal. It is completely based off connections. It does not matter your knowledge. It is about who you know 100%. I am not ignorant that this might be the case outside, but I swear to god everyday, esto garera USA ma jasto innovative companies cha tyo ta pakkai hudainthyo..   The reason for such favoritism is mainly because the work they do is so shit. Leaving few companies who developer softwares that Nepalese use on daily basis(Not ludo), other jobs are not very interesting to do either. It is the same low quality menial job with meagre pay.   The companies who have a business are handful already. Investor ko money burn garne jasto nepal ma kei hudaina as there are no investors. So you see these bitchy ass companies hiring full stack developer every day for the salary of an intern.     I could not really be bothered with working under someone and taking all nonsense blames for 30,000 per month on hand. With no future and no growth and dismissing my self esteem. My aviman is and was huge.   The second pathway is to work at government corporations. I looked at the salary of computer engineer at Nepal Army, Nijamati and it is decent. But the upwards mobility is just not there. What I mean by that is salary is not growing when you grow your experience. Aba ta government employee specially nijamati lai dekhne bittikai yo bhrastachari raicha bhanne lagcha. Kinaki bhrastachar nagari ta khana basnai napugne. Pradhan Sena Pati ko talab cha 67000. Social security benefits cha good and all but cash in hand ni aileko market rate anusar ta dinu paryo ni. 67000 ma kam garne pradhansenapati le ghus nakhaye k garera palne? lol.  I looked at corporations salary. And it seems that if you manage to get a handle at a corporation(Sansthans), you can make be sure to make average of 60-70 thousands per month even as a 6th level officer. At this point of my career, this seems fair enough. But it will not be enough after 5 years, if my increment is just 1 thousand per year.    A huge reform is required in government services. Government services (specially nijamati) are the core to how people feel about the government. If we cannot make it attractive and lucrative, it does not matter how rich we are saving on their salary.  Next option is moving abroad.  Aba ko market ma abroad ma PR paune/GC paune biswas ta chaina. Unless you do the jobs that Americans do not want to do (or foreigners) like teaching for 60k/year, nursing old people etc.  15 years bidesh ma basna jane. Kam garne and coming back to Nepal. It seems the most plausible way forward. Nepal ma ayepachi k garne bhanne hunasakcha however.  The countries in option to stay for so long are Japan, India. Do not want to surrender my passport to Dubai sheikh. Also middle east is terror and war prone so do not want to end up there.   Europe tira padna gaye matra ho. It seems bleak for immigrants nowadays. And I do not think they earn that much in Europe (for someone planning to return back to Nepal and not stay there). Teta nabasne bhayepachi social security ko teti matlab bhayena.   How about USA? USA seems fine and all. but I do not think getting a work permit after Masters degree is going to be easy. Or that you are going to make big bucks and save big bucks as an immigrant in this economy. Since PR/GC is not guaranteed, you are basically playing a zero sum game. The experience that you get in abroad and education bla bla is huge investment however.",

I want to build a real career in IT so I can eventually work remotely or move abroad. I want something realistic that I can learn in about a year and turn into a stable, good-paying job.  Honestly, I’m not interested in freelancing or full-stack because (personally) it feels oversaturated and too creative (for each project) and portfolio-heavy, but I’m still open if I’m wrong. I don’t wanna sound picky, and desperate, like “I only want X, not Y.” Please don't get me wrong. I'm willing to learn and work. I’m flexible - I just want something that's worth my time and effort.  I’m looking for an IT path that:  • isn’t super saturated   • is easier for beginners   • hires freshers from Nepal (South Asia)   • has a stable monthly salary (4 digits)   • has a clear roadmap   • doesn’t require a uni degree   • reliable - won’t be replaced by AI soon   • can help me find jobs abroad  If you were in my shoes - 23, broke, no degree, living in Nepal, trying to break into tech in 2025/2026 - what would you realistically choose?  I’m open to anything: front-end, app dev, full stack, IT support, cloud, DevOps, QA, cybersecurity, networking, data, MySQL - anything that actually works for someone starting with almost nothing. Coz, I don't wanna end up being homeless. Seriously, I am so sick of my current lifestyle, I wanna make a change and take some right action that will lead me to my goal. I literally don't care if it's hard or impossible, coz now it's a necessity.. I am ready to sacrifice my time. I wanna invest in myself (my skills).  So, please, I need your help to choose the right direction.  I’d really appreciate any honest suggestions, roadmaps, or personal stories from people who started in a similar place.  Thanks a lot.",

QA is the easiest and fastest way to get a job because it’s not too saturated, Nepal hires many freshers, and you don’t need a portfolio or degree. IT support is the most stable long-term option because it’s beginner friendly, companies always need support staff, and it naturally leads to higher-paying roles like SysAdmin or Cloud Engineer. Cybersecurity is the most future-proof, global, and high-demand field, but it requires more effort in the first few months.  Things like frontend, full-stack, and freelancing are not the best starting point when you’re broke and need stability fast; they take longer and require portfolios or creativity. A simple one-year plan would look like this: for QA, learn manual testing first, then SQL/API testing, and later basic automation. For IT support, learn computer basics, networking, and ticketing tools, then move towards cloud platforms. For cybersecurity, start with networking and Linux, then learn security basics and practice SOC labs.  If you want something fast, choose QA. If you want something stable and practical, go for IT support. If you want long-term growth and international opportunities, choose cybersecurity. Any of these three can realistically change your life within a year if you stay focused|||You’re only 23, so you have time on your side. While I understand you want quick results, consider exploring online degree programs. Many are flexible and work-friendly. A degree can make a huge difference when applying for jobs abroad and competing for better positions - it might be worth the investment alongside building your skills. 🙂🙂|||If I were you, I’d start with IT support → networking → cloud. It’s cheap to learn, beginner-friendly, hires freshers in South Asia, and leads to real stable jobs. Once you get basic support skills, aim for CCNA, then AWS. It’s the most realistic path to a solid career without a degree.|||look for QA, devrel, dev advocate, project manager, sre/devops etc. what's the tech skill that u already know? |||Garo nai cha aile ko situation ma ta.

I think its a huge mistake personally. I know there are many people who have done great in their lives. but I feel like (in the context of Japan) its a huge mistake to move after +2 because the cultural and language barrier is so high that even people with masters degree are working in convenient stores and other low paying jobs that need no academics. after +2 you just are so young and confused that you don't even know what you want in life and what are your options. at least after Bachelor's I'd guess you get what you should expect from life in general. also after Bachelor's its far easier to apply and get approved as opposed to after +2. also Bachelor's is very cheap compared to bidesh. Leaving the country as a teenager and growing up throughout my early 20s in bides has had me plant a doubt of growth in me. i feel like i have wasted my potential in Japan. I did 2 years of language and 4 years of graphic design and am currently studying 3d designing (1st year) as soon as i complete my study i wanna try and leave this country for good.   but I can also give a reason why you should move. 1. exposure at a young age. you get to experience things for the first time which is a doorway to learn many things about yourself and everything else. you see things that you have never even imagined. different languages and different cultures are important to live outside the bubble and see the world a little differently   2. privacy. in Nepal we have zero privacy. you do get total privacy and you can enjoy your alone time in solitude. this also comes with loneliness so be prepared to live a lonely life for the most part. loneliness also comes with anxiety and depression so try to keep yourself busy and in a circle.   3. life lessons. you start earning and learn to budget your expenses. you realize earning is easy and how much your parents had to sacrifice for you to be where you are. you also start getting very confident because now you are king of your own decisions.  4. You understand where you and your country lacks and how you can improve it. In Nepal there are many areas where change is necessary and if you never see it from others POV you will never know that it needs fixing. for example, i never cooked while i was in Nepal because mom did it all the time. but after coming here i have learned to cook some good food and also learned communication skills because of my work. also you see what exactly is not good in nepal and get the idea how you can fix it. for example lines in hospitals and other businesses like ward offices and banks. this can easily be fixed with a simple token and display. also supermarket like bhat bhateni can be improved with better staff training for efficiency  5.You can finally buy the things you couldn't afford as a kid. and you can buy the gifts for your family without having to worry about money so much. the face they make when you hand them the gifts is just priceless.  6. quality of life increases because you learn to keep yourself healthy and hygienic all the time. wearing nice clothes and with better styles uplifts your life by folds.   7. BAD SIDE  : you might also start drinking and smoking very often leading to sickness in the future when you are in your 30s and 40s|||I think it's the personal choice.

            "body": "Hello everyone,  I never thought I’d be writing this again. I wish our situation had gotten better since my last post… but reality has been harsher than I ever imagined.  My father is battling Stage 3 Gall Bladder Cancer, and his treatment at RGCI, Delhi is ongoing. We somehow managed to complete 5 chemo cycles , by selling whatever little we had, taking loans, borrowing from friends and relatives, and emptying every bit of savings. But now, we are completely drained .. emotionally, mentally, and financially.  The doctors say the next few chemo cycles are critical . If we stop now, everything we’ve fought for so far might go in vain. But the treatment cost has now gone beyond ₹20 lakhs, and we have nothing left to continue.  My father is a simple, hardworking man a small farmer and shopkeeper from a middle-class family. He spent his entire life making sure we never felt our struggles,have some good education. Only now do I truly see how much he silently sacrificed for us. I’m still in college, trying to study, trying to stay strong, but watching him in pain and feeling helpless is tearing me apart. i feel cancer is the worst thing you can ever deal with .  I’ve seen my mother cry silently in the corner every night, and my sisters trying to smile despite knowing how close we are to losing everything. I keep telling them we’ll make it that I’ll find a way but right now, I don’t know how much longer we can hold on without help.  In my last post, so many kind souls came forward. I’m truly, deeply grateful — we managed to raise about ₹1.5 lakh, which helped us cover chemotherapy and hospital bills. Every rupee meant the world to us. 🙏  But the journey is far from over. We still need around ₹20 lakhs more to continue his treatment and give him a real chance at life.  If you’re reading this please, help us if you can. Even a small amount, even a share, even a prayer it all counts.   I’m not asking for sympathy; I’m asking for humanity.

Trendy: they're brainwashed, selfish, came for masubhat  Reality: UML has strong foundation and institutions in every sectors, from education to workers, farmers, employees, businesses.   These organizations/institutions although have bad reputations, have done some apprecianle deeds too. From volunteering, blood donations, scholarship schemes etc. For eg. UML's student union was the first one to reach to Kalapani and put Nepal's flag on the land.   What we're doing is just bashing them on the internet with mostly baseless accusations. (Mostly, not all). That's not how you defeat an established and strong organization.

I’m truly grateful. Recently during an interview, I shared my personal political standpoint. I mentioned that I do not personally recognize K.P. Oli as a leader whose ideology I align with. I say this not out of disrespect, but from a place of accountability and responsibility toward our nation. After the recent Gen Z protests, I believe many of us expected honest conversations, acknowledgment of public concerns, and accountability for the injustices that occurred under his administration where many lives were lost. When leadership is unable to take responsibility for such serious matters, it becomes difficult for me to support or follow their ideology. My intention is not to attack individuals, but to stand for truth, transparency, and a future where leaders are answerable to the people. I believe Nepal deserves leadership that listens, learns, and upholds justice for every citizen. Thank you once again to everyone who resonated with my thoughts. Let’s continue pushing for a better and more responsible political culture together.|||So many Incel chicks in comment, are we even safe?|||Nepal is literally full of chutiyas like these, logic fact kei chaina 😂 .

Around a year worth of income of an average Nepalese just for a 2 years of teen's study.  My experience with Kavya was that my mom went there just to check it out (ofcourse it was out of our budget) and sadly she entered her number in some survey they had.      The number of calls those nggas made during 2 whole weeks, fk. We kept on declining and blocking their numbers but everytime it was a new number lmao. When we first asked for discount, they declined for even a rupee but later on they started giving offers themselves, despo times for them ig.

They outsource their jobs to poorer countries where people are happy to accept a meager $2800/month, whereas a domestic worker in the US would have to be paid at least double that. So the company saves 50% of their costs pretty much immediately. Not to mention the savings due to not having to pay employment insurance, health insurance, retirement contributions, etc all of which a domestic worker would be entitled to. If you include these costs as well, then the company saves like 60-70% of their costs by outsourcing their jobs. It's really sad.   I hope the US government puts into place policies that make outsourcing jobs much more expensive/restrictive than hiring domestic workers.|||Bhik me kuch dedo humko bhaisahab|||What you planning to do with the money saved|||what do you recommend to get the skill on ?|||What courses/sites helped you the most in developing your skills?|||Daily work hour?|||is it that common to find a remote job that pays in dollars or is it very rare? just curious bcz planning to study cs|||Is it too little too late to start at final bachelors year.

            "body": "Hello! Myself (20M), along with two of my friends and our families, visited Nepal during the Diwali holidays. We explored the Chitwan National Park, Pokhara, and Kathmandu regions.  It was a packaged tour, so we couldn’t add or replace any locations. Here’s the list of places we visited (in order):  1. Chitwan National Park   2. Devi’s Fall (Pokhara)   3. Bindhyabasini Temple   4. Mahendra Cave   5. Bat Cave   6. Seti River Gorge   7. Gupteshwar Mahadev Cave   8. Sarangkot Watch Tower (Sunrise)   9. Boating in Phewa Lake   10. Manakamana Mandir (en route to Kathmandu from Pokhara)   11. Pashupatinath Temple (Kathmandu)   12. Swayambhunath Temple   13. Budhanilkantha Temple   14. Guhyeshwari Devi Temple   15. Bhaktapur   16. Dhulikhel (that rock viewpoint)   17. Nagarkot Watch Tower (Sunset)    However, through Instagram and YouTube, I found that Nepal also has some beautiful motorable routes to cold and even snowy regions like Mustang, Manang, etc. I also heard there’s a mountain flight service that lets you see all the major Himalayan peaks within an hour — is that true?  Now here’s the thing — my mom (55+) and dad (60+) absolutely loved Pokhara and would love to visit again, but this time on our own (without any travel agency). We’d love to know about places, activities, and scenic locations around Pokhara that are worth visiting and accessible by road.  Just to note: my mother has serious cardiac issues and cannot hike, so we’re specifically looking for spots that don’t require trekking or long walks.  Would really appreciate any suggestions or travel tips. 🙏  (For hikes, my friends and I are planning to do the Annapurna Base Camp Trek in about 2–2.5 years, which I’ll ask about in a separate post.)

(For all the idiots that will come at me saying it was ChatGPT, he mentions that it was used for refining only).   Let's get to the point. I'm really surprised that your package didn't include Muktinath Temple which is a staple for Indian tourist groups. Look it up. It's up between the mountains in Mustang so you'll get a good combo of natural beauty along with religious significance. You'll need to climb some steps to the temple itself, but should be fine for your mom with plenty of rest. You may find some porters that will carry her for some fees. I haven't seen them when I was there, so I can't be sure. When you go there, there's a lot of beautiful scenic villages that you can stay in like Kagbeni, Jomsom, Kobang, Marpha. While they all are unique in their own rights, they may all look the same for an outsider. There's also time constraint. So research about them a bit and select at least one of them to stay at. If you have time, I will highly recommend going to Upper Mustang. Atleast up to Lo Manthang. The landscape, culture, history is quite unique and slightly distinct from lower regions of Mustang. But it's a protected area, and due to the border with China, a sensitive area as well. You'll need to get specific permission from tourism board (or ministry not sure) to visit there. In the recent light of tensions between China and India, they might not let you go at all as well. Find a good tourist guide/company and they can provide you better information.  Another area that might be of interest for you and your parents is the Kailash/Mansarowar. It is located in China and you can go via heli fligts or roadway through Nepal. Heli flights are expensive but obviously more convenient. Roadway trips are ok if you end up with a good travel operator. Rowdy Indians, and abusive Chinese border guards and police are big problems for the bus trip. The Chinese can deny you entry without any reasons at all, that's a big risk.  You can also go to Kalinchowk from Kathmandu. But honestly, I don't think it's worth the trip from South India to Nepal just for that. Specially because there is not much to see or do anything else in that area. My personal suggestion is to go for Muktinath. You'll be able to visit Pokhara again and there's just so many side trips and places you can go to in that area.  Regarding mountain flights, yes they are true. It's funny and cute that you are inquiring about it like it's a unicorn :D It's one of the most popular and famous activity for tourists. Early morning flights from Kathmandu will take you close to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the area. Weather permitting, you'll get a really good upclose view of those peaks. Winter is a great time for these flights as there's less chances of clouds.  Hope you have a great experience once again. Best of luck.|||guys help him|||Are you from kerala?|||Boost|||During tourist season, managing accommodations on your own can be a slight headache to getting stranded right outside a hotel full of guests, while you're googling other hotels in the area, because everything gets booked by the \"package walas\".  During off season, it's easily manageable & fun because less people & no need to queue to get a selfie with some peculiar rock or a waterfall, butttttt, it's called off season for a reason, the majestic views might be compromised or not, it's a gamble.|||Dhulikhel rock view point, man why would they take you there! 🤦  Are you speaking 'Bangla'?|||Bhaktapur is the jewel 🙏|||kudos to camera work- given the health condition of your mum- i recommend you sepnd more time in chitwan- janakpur and lumbini-- may be 3 days each city- it covers pilgrimage and cultural aspect-|||Others have already suggested you some places to visit, so I just want to give you one important piece of advice. I have a relative who works as a travel agent, and he told me that many agents and shopkeepers tend to focus more on foreign tourists than on Indians, because they believe they can overcharge them easily. So, bro, be careful  there are many thugs and dishonest agents who might try to charge you extra. **Bargaining is the key.**  In almost every corner, if a hotel recommends you a place or a service, remember that the hotel usually gets a commission from it. The entire system in tourist areas like Thamel often runs on commission-based deals. So it’s always better to ask genuine locals for suggestions rather than agents pretending to be locals. In Thamel, you’ll find many such people who act friendly but are just trying to make money off tourists.  If you have Nepali friends, you can travel cheaply and safely otherwise, just be a bit cautious and smart while dealing with people. To be honest, a few uneducated people here may dislike Indian tourists, and that’s an unfortunate reality. But overall, we Nepalese are known to be **very hospitable, kind, and friendly**, and most people will treat you with respect and warmth. Just stay alert, bargain wisely, and you’ll have a wonderful time in Nepal.|||Bro, timi Darjeeling bata vayae taa, yo sabai Normal hola ni taa timro laagi taa?? 🤔|||where did u take that video bro? was it in pokhara?|||You skipped Bandipur en route Pokhara from Kathmandu.

Stop in Muktinath, assuming you are Hindus as you are from India. It holds quite religious significance.  Did you go for paddleboating in pokhara? Not for your parents but you can also try bungee.  Go to Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, during some seasons the plains are beautiful.  A lot of beef is going with Indian tourists so be on your best behavior. Do not litter, and ask your fellow friends not to do so if they are planning to visit. People are welcoming as long as they don't feel that you are destroying their homes. People including me felt that Indians were good excluding our government and policies aside but nowsays I am not sure.  I don't mean to end with a rude tone so you are welcome to visit again.|||Have a great time here, enjoy it and after you go back to your home just think is it fair to take land of the country who provided you with such great hospitality?|||[deleted]",

We depend without limits upon food grains, vegetables, medicines, fuel, vehicles, appliances that same polluting India creates.

Buses and vans could be restricted to the ring road and every bus stop along the ring road could have designated autos and rickshaws to drop passengers to their destinations at the same fare.

The land already belongs to a government body, in this case, TU, it made things easy.  But elsewhere in larger projects, main reason this is difficult is because of people. For example, the nagdhunga project was stalled for 6 months because of local demands of alternative water supply, compensation money, jobs for the locals, etc. Without this, it would have already been completed last year.  Now, significant amount of taxpayer money in infrastructure projects are spent in land acquisition. The only way for Nepal to develop fast is i. stop people needlessly stopping projects and either ii. significant land reform, or complete land price collapse and people to stop seeing land as investment.|||This was a dream for cricket fan like me!!

I'm no expert but I  do come with a few facts . The actual knowledge I feel like I know it better than anyone here. Not bragging .  So take it as a means of education. I'm no scholar of political science - I mean what the fuck is even political science?   Communism and capitalism are just some words, no country is free from it. Every country harbors some element of it but at a different proportion. There really wasn't a necessity to name a political party after it, as even opposition party have some part of communism adopted into their administrative policy.   Yes , ideally everyone would think of Karl Marx as the ideology behind modern communism with his book the communist manifesto. But he did not form any political party nor he was any political leader. He was deeply concerned about the political shift after we overthrow totalarian governing bodies like kings and his feudal governing bodies. Karl Marx was deeply influenced by the French Revolution - the revolution that overthrew monarchy and there was violent civil movements throughout the country while establishing a new system of power. While we may not like the word communism but his book has influenced positively in modern capitalist society. Take for instances, the Intel corporation ,  a private publicly traded company , which has been spiralling down in recent years. Until the US government recently backed it  up  with  over 50 billion USD , and now they are again in a break through with their new fabrication plan. This saves the US company, jobs and US economy as a whole. Government put trust  it with it's taxpayers money.   Every country has some sort of welfare system, making policies and building up infrastructure. We trust the nation with the tax hoping the country makes better use of it. Capitalism and communism don't antagonises each other. They coexist in a healthy modern economy.|||Ask a regular min wage worker in the US if capitalism is working for them.

            "heading": "A Night in Kathmandu — The Unexpected Bar Scam Experience",
            "body": "After completing our last destination in Kathmandu, our Nepal trip was almost coming to an end. We had planned to spend the evening shopping around local markets before heading back home.  But as luck would have it, the weather had other plans. It started raining heavily, and most of us decided to cancel the shopping plan and stay inside the bus, waiting for the rain to stop.  While we were sitting there, a Nepali guy — sort of an agent — climbed onto the bus. He started chatting with my friend, talking about dance bars, attractive girls, and fun nightlife in Kathmandu. My friends, curious and excited to explore something different, agreed to check it out. So, we went along with him from Gaushala Chowk.  ⸻  The Arrival  We reached around 7 PM. The place looked more like a small pub or lounge — dim lights, loud music, and barely anyone inside. There were just two Indian guys with a few Nepali girls, sitting at a corner table, smoking hukka and drinking.  We were a group of 12 people, so we took two tables (6 on each). I sat on the other table, while two Nepali girls from the bar joined my friends’ table. They were friendly, laughing, and talking in Hindi — chit chat, masti, jokes — sab Hindi mein.  After a few minutes, the girls said they wanted to have a drink. The same agent who brought us there told my friend, “Sir, bas 400 Rs ka juice hai.” They wrote the order on a small paper chit, took my friend’s signature, and soon two juices were served.  That’s how their system worked — write on paper, take a sign, and serve the order.  We also ordered 4 beers for ourselves. Out of 12, only 4 were drinking — the rest were just watching the dance show.  ⸻  The Show Begins  Soon, Nepali girls started dancing on Hindi songs, followed by a couple of male dancers and another girl joining the floor. The vibe felt okay at first — typical dance bar scene, music, lights, drinks.  But after the girls finished their drinks, a waiter brought a hukka pot to our table without even asking. We immediately told him to take it away. The girls got off from our table soon after that.  ⸻  Something Felt Off  After finishing the beer, me and my friend went to the washroom. There we saw those same two Indian guys who were sitting earlier — looked like North Indians (maybe Delhi or Haryana). They seemed tense, arguing with the bar staff.  Out of curiosity, I asked one of them, “Bhai kya hua?” He said, “Dekho na bhai, kuch khaya nahi, thoda piya sirf — aur bill 32,000 Nepali bana diya!”  That one line was enough to send chills down my spine.  I quickly went back to my table and told my friend what had happened. We immediately asked for our bill — but the damage was already done.  ⸻  The Shocking Bill  The bill came in Nepali currency: \t•\t4 Beers = 4000 \t•\t2 Drinks for girls = 8000 \t•\t23% Service charge = 2760 Total = 14,760 NRS (≈ 9,840 INR)  My friend was shocked. He said, “Ladies drink price to 400 bola tha,” but by then, the agent who brought us there had vanished.  There was no point arguing — the staff was large in number, and the situation didn’t look safe. Finally, we settled the bill for 9,500 INR and left the place quietly.  ⸻  What Happened Next  As we were leaving, I noticed those two Indian guys being locked in a small office, surrounded by bar staff demanding they hand over their mobiles or belongings to pay off the bill.  I felt genuinely bad for them — and guilty for not sitting at my friend’s table earlier, or checking the price list before signing that paper chit.  But at the same time, I was thankful that we escaped early — with just a 4-beer loss instead of a full-blown scam.  ⸻  The Reality Behind the Glamour  While we were stepping out, a few more Nepali guys entered, and immediately all the bar girls — including those who had been at our table — went to join them, smoking hukka and ordering drinks.  Just watching that, I could only think: “Isko to aaj 40,000–50,000 ka chuna lagne wala hai.”  ⸻  Final Thoughts  Our Nepal trip overall was beautiful — from Pokhara’s serenity to the spiritual vibe of Pashupatinath. But this one Kathmandu nightlife experience was a reminder that not everything that glitters is gold.  If you ever plan to explore nightlife in Kathmandu, be cautious: \t•\tNever sign anything you don’t understand. \t•\tAlways ask for the price upfront. \t•\tAnd if something feels shady — walk away.  This experience became a story to remember — not for the fun, but for the lesson it taught us.",

She recently had a baby, so I was genuinely happy to visit her and meet her newborn. I was meeting her in person after 2 years.  We cooked together, washed the dishes, gossiped a lot, and I came home with a full heart.  Then at the dinner table, my parents asked what caste she is. I told them… and they immediately started talking about caste differences and how I shouldn’t visit her house for meals, and how she shouldn’t come to ours. Hearing them talk about her caste that way absolutely broke my heart. I couldn’t control my tears, and my mom said, “kina yesto chitta dukhako. Pitri farak farak hunxa, manxe yeutai matra vayerw hunna. Hamlai ni aaru le yesto garxan, hamle ni garnu parxa. Paxi tha pauxau, etc etc.”  We never had serious caste conversations before. In fact, I remember them teaching us that these things shouldn’t exist, that we’re all equal. And they’ve never shown this kind of behavior toward others who visit our home or toward our tenants who are the same caste as my friend?

Our parents grew up in a time where extreme casteism was normal. They didn’t create it, but they were raised inside that system, taught to follow it, and warned about the consequences of not doing so. Education shapes the mind, and the education they received reinforced these beliefs regardless of religion, culture, or society. So they’re not entirely wrong, and we’re not entirely right either.  The real problem is that we often fail to understand the environment they grew up in and the fears they carried. Instead of trying to see their side, we sometimes blame them or play the victim because it’s the easier option. But change takes understanding from both generations—not just criticism. 🙏|||This will just go with this generation or maybe next or next but you just forget what they said and forget about the cast system as well and just focus on people's behavior and if nobody talks about it next generation is not even going to know such a thing and it will just go away. But if we keep saying we're all equal frequently children are going to think they are saying this because  we're all not equal. Indirectly they'll learn that cast is a big deal. that's my point of view. And forget my English as well ☺|||This is really heartbreaking. It’s painful when people who taught us about equality show a different side. Caste ideas came through shared history and influence from India, but we don’t have to carry them forward.

His work is visible, but he is corrupt.  Balen is the only person whom I can say with confidence is not corrupt, yet. But he is no politician, and I don't think he will ever be. It is also very hard for him to open party with individual who is not involved in any scandal, and keep his non-corrupt image intact.  Rabi has his own problems. However, he is the only person at the moment who is a politician, and not involved with old goons. Only his party could have defeated the old goons, but since he is in jail, RSP will not get majority seats this time.  So, the new alternative forces combined will still not have majority in present scenario. Only way the alternative forces can have majority is if Balen and Kulman would have join RSP with Rabi still as head of RSP. But this scenario was simply not possible from start. Balen cannot associate himself with people with scandals, and Kulman is not really an alternative force, but rather the produce of the old goons who is not as bad as the old goons.|||Chup machikney tyo purano vanda yei thiq , reddit ma aayera na vuk|||One thing I will suggest if new party is contesting In some constituency just don't contest in that area. The same tactic Congress did with maobadi during election. After winning form an alliance which is the best thing to do. For that rpp rsp and new parties should agree on this.

Unlike traditional parties, anyone with potentiality can join and compete in elections.  If Rabi Lamichane had wanted, he could have pushed Kulman Ghising as face of RSP for PM.

From your iPhone / iPad:  Open Find My → Devices → tap your Mac.  Options: Play Sound, Directions (if location available), Mark as Lost (Lock), Erase This Device.   From any browser:  Sign in to iCloud.com with your Apple ID → Find iPhone → select your Mac from All Devices and use the same options.   What each option does:  Play Sound — helps if it’s nearby.  Mark as Lost / Lock — remotely locks the Mac with a passcode and shows your message/phone number on screen. It also disables Apple Pay.  Erase Mac — wipes data. Use only if you’re sure you can’t get it back; after erasing you can no longer track it.   2) If Find My was not enabled  Tracking is much harder. Still:  Check your Google account (if Chrome was signed in) for recent device activity.  Check services you used (Dropbox, Microsoft, email) for recent logins — they sometimes reveal IP/location.  Look at any linked accounts for device lists under your Apple ID (appleid.apple.com → Devices) — it shows serial numbers and last seen info.   3) Gather identifying info (do this now)  Serial number of the Mac (found on original box/receipt, Apple invoice, or appleid.apple.com under your devices).

I used to work for a Nepali Marwari owner here in the US who had around 30 stores under one of the biggest wireless companies in the country. Dude was loaded the brand name itself brought in enough business to make him filthy rich.  But man, the micromanagement was on another level. He believed employees should always be under pressure. Two minutes late? You’d get sent home with 2–3 follow-up emails. He had cameras everywhere and watched every move if you touched your phone for even a second, you’d get an email warning.  We had to message the group chat every time we clocked in, went on break, and clocked out while doing same in an app. It was ridiculous. The managers around him were total yes-men with no real management skills or education, just doing whatever the boss said.  Most of us employees were Nepali, Indian, or other South Asians, and we just tolerated it. But eventually, they started pulling the same nonsense with the white employees constant monitoring, weird punishments, and micromanaging everything. Those folks didn’t stay quiet.  When they complained, he retaliated by transferring them to faraway locations (which, by the way, is illegal in the US I didn’t even know that back then). They ended up suing the company.  After months of legal battles, the owner lost big time. He had to settle for almost $1 million, and worst of all, he lost his business licenses. Now, he can’t make any major business decisions without approval from the state attorney.

Tech adaptations are wide and quick, but regulation and accountability are close to non-existent. There is also a steep decline in the quality and camaraderie of the developer community.   Ultimately, the possibility and goal of earning well compared to other professions is and has been the motivation for lots of young graduates getting into software/product development/design. With the field now getting more complex and overwhelming to start as a beginner, and the unstable tech-job market, it puts more pressure on newcomers to integrate.  For these kinds of companies (mostly newly started, providing services as consultants for foreign companies), there's a low probability of growing to the scale of other established tech companies in Nepal. But I'm not trying to undermine and paint a negative image here. Rather, it can be the best opportunity and environment for a motivated individual to learn and grow together with team members.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So, here are a couple of points I'd like to suggest to newcomers/students getting into this profession:  * **GROWTH**: Always keep your individual growth as the main motivator. Keep it as a core \"essence\" of being a developer. Comparing yourself with your own past self will help you a lot in the long run. Secondly, a good payslip is always great to have as a +motivator. * **Incremental & Iterative**: Anything you'll learn or want to improve upon will take time. You'll need to make mistakes/errors, analyse why and how they occurred, and do it again with the correction. * **EMPATHY**: It's what most people lack in every field, and I like to believe that people can change. An empathetic co-worker makes the working environment more pleasant just by being in the office. They will see their team members as a collaborator in their work rather than their 'juniors' or just 'people who work under their command'.  If the 'co-worker' or 'supervisor', who'll be involved with your onboarding/daily tasks, lacks any understanding of these aspects, then I believe they're not quite fit for a LEADERSHIP role, despite their years of experience and how much BETTER of a developer they are.  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|||[deleted]|||\\#CompanyProfiling   noted!|||This is exactly what happens abroad lol.",

If there had been a high-voltage surge, then **all devices connected at the same time should have been affected**, including my colleagues’ laptops and chargers — but none of them faced any issue.

You can easily check online by searching your laptop model to find out if it supports SSD upgrades and the maximum RAM capacity.

            "body": "As an Computer Engineering/IT graduate in Nepal, there are various pathways.  Option A) You stay in Nepal  Option B) You move abroad   Let's discuss about Option A first.  There are two realistic pathways you could take if you stayed in Nepal.  - work at private  - work at government   I have tried working at private. But the amount of discrimination being done in private companies really blew me up. As someone who was also preparing for government jobs, I had noticed lots of underprivileged folks participating in government jobs exam(for computer engineer as well). I used to ponder what made them do this since this is not a very lucrative job compared to what a \"certain community\" person makes at private or \"certain community\" person grows at private job. But later realized that private companies are not interested to hire these \"underprivileged\" folks.   Lots of people might argue (although they know it is not true) private jobs hire on merit. No they do not do so in Nepal. It is completely based off connections. It does not matter your knowledge. It is about who you know 100%. I am not ignorant that this might be the case outside, but I swear to god everyday, esto garera USA ma jasto innovative companies cha tyo ta pakkai hudainthyo..   The reason for such favoritism is mainly because the work they do is so shit. Leaving few companies who developer softwares that Nepalese use on daily basis(Not ludo), other jobs are not very interesting to do either. It is the same low quality menial job with meagre pay.   The companies who have a business are handful already. Investor ko money burn garne jasto nepal ma kei hudaina as there are no investors. So you see these bitchy ass companies hiring full stack developer every day for the salary of an intern.     I could not really be bothered with working under someone and taking all nonsense blames for 30,000 per month on hand. With no future and no growth and dismissing my self esteem. My aviman is and was huge.   The second pathway is to work at government corporations. I looked at the salary of computer engineer at Nepal Army, Nijamati and it is decent. But the upwards mobility is just not there. What I mean by that is salary is not growing when you grow your experience. Aba ta government employee specially nijamati lai dekhne bittikai yo bhrastachari raicha bhanne lagcha. Kinaki bhrastachar nagari ta khana basnai napugne. Pradhan Sena Pati ko talab cha 67000. Social security benefits cha good and all but cash in hand ni aileko market rate anusar ta dinu paryo ni. 67000 ma kam garne pradhansenapati le ghus nakhaye k garera palne? lol.  I looked at corporations salary. And it seems that if you manage to get a handle at a corporation(Sansthans), you can make be sure to make average of 60-70 thousands per month even as a 6th level officer. At this point of my career, this seems fair enough. But it will not be enough after 5 years, if my increment is just 1 thousand per year.    A huge reform is required in government services. Government services (specially nijamati) are the core to how people feel about the government. If we cannot make it attractive and lucrative, it does not matter how rich we are saving on their salary.  Next option is moving abroad.  Aba ko market ma abroad ma PR paune/GC paune biswas ta chaina. Unless you do the jobs that Americans do not want to do (or foreigners) like teaching for 60k/year, nursing old people etc.  15 years bidesh ma basna jane. Kam garne and coming back to Nepal. It seems the most plausible way forward. Nepal ma ayepachi k garne bhanne hunasakcha however.  The countries in option to stay for so long are Japan, India. Do not want to surrender my passport to Dubai sheikh. Also middle east is terror and war prone so do not want to end up there.   Europe tira padna gaye matra ho. It seems bleak for immigrants nowadays. And I do not think they earn that much in Europe (for someone planning to return back to Nepal and not stay there). Teta nabasne bhayepachi social security ko teti matlab bhayena.   How about USA? USA seems fine and all. but I do not think getting a work permit after Masters degree is going to be easy. Or that you are going to make big bucks and save big bucks as an immigrant in this economy. Since PR/GC is not guaranteed, you are basically playing a zero sum game. The experience that you get in abroad and education bla bla is huge investment however.",

            "body": "Hi everyone👋 I’m 23, living in Nepal, only a high-school degree, and I’m broke (only have 100 dollars in savings rn). I want to build a real career in IT so I can eventually work remotely or move abroad. I want something realistic that I can learn in about a year and turn into a stable, good-paying job.  Honestly, I’m not interested in freelancing or full-stack because (personally) it feels oversaturated and too creative (for each project) and portfolio-heavy, but I’m still open if I’m wrong. I don’t wanna sound picky, and desperate, like “I only want X, not Y.” Please don't get me wrong. I'm willing to learn and work. I’m flexible - I just want something that's worth my time and effort.

Coz, I don't wanna end up being homeless. Seriously, I am so sick of my current lifestyle, I wanna make a change and take some right action that will lead me to my goal. I literally don't care if it's hard or impossible, coz now it's a necessity.. I am ready to sacrifice my time. I wanna invest in myself (my skills).  So, please, I need your help to choose the right direction.  I’d really appreciate any honest suggestions, roadmaps, or personal stories from people who started in a similar place.  Thanks a lot.",

            "comments": "timle vaneko anusar networking best hola. ccna chai garnu paryo. paxi bistarai ccnp gare vayo|||f I were 23, broke, living in Nepal, and trying to start an IT career without a degree, I would choose one of three realistic paths: QA testing, IT support, or cybersecurity. QA is the easiest and fastest way to get a job because it’s not too saturated, Nepal hires many freshers, and you don’t need a portfolio or degree. IT support is the most stable long-term option because it’s beginner friendly, companies always need support staff, and it naturally leads to higher-paying roles like SysAdmin or Cloud Engineer. Cybersecurity is the most future-proof, global, and high-demand field, but it requires more effort in the first few months.  Things like frontend, full-stack, and freelancing are not the best starting point when you’re broke and need stability fast; they take longer and require portfolios or creativity. A simple one-year plan would look like this: for QA, learn manual testing first, then SQL/API testing, and later basic automation. For IT support, learn computer basics, networking, and ticketing tools, then move towards cloud platforms. For cybersecurity, start with networking and Linux, then learn security basics and practice SOC labs.  If you want something fast, choose QA. If you want something stable and practical, go for IT support. If you want long-term growth and international opportunities, choose cybersecurity. Any of these three can realistically change your life within a year if you stay focused|||You’re only 23, so you have time on your side. While I understand you want quick results, consider exploring online degree programs. Many are flexible and work-friendly. A degree can make a huge difference when applying for jobs abroad and competing for better positions - it might be worth the investment alongside building your skills. 🙂🙂|||If I were you, I’d start with IT support → networking → cloud. It’s cheap to learn, beginner-friendly, hires freshers in South Asia, and leads to real stable jobs. Once you get basic support skills, aim for CCNA, then AWS. It’s the most realistic path to a solid career without a degree.|||look for QA, devrel, dev advocate, project manager, sre/devops etc. what's the tech skill that u already know? |||Garo nai cha aile ko situation ma ta.

I worked as Software Engineer in one MNC in Kathmandu. Were all of my classmates able to get similar jobs / salary? No. Were few earning even more than me? Yes.    In the hindsight, I think my best decision was to stay here for bachelors degree & get that skill and work-experience in Nepal. Now, I'm in USA and working with one of the top fortune 100 companies as software engineer. My journey to here was much easier than other students who came for bachelors.      I know that my suggestion can be truly biased on what I faced after my bachelors degree here, but if you are planning to study computer related field, and can work hard on your skills, then there are good paying MNCs here. One of my friends is supposedly earning 3lakhs+ monthly salary in Nepal.       TL:DR; I'd suggest at least study bachelors here and gain few years of professional experience before going abroad. You'll 100% not regret it.|||My story: Stayed in nepal.. got into a foreign uni affiliated college, and doing remote job at a foreign country.    My suggestion: If you are willing to pull this off, then stay.. else leave🙂. I am just lucky enough to be in the top 5% or even 1% ig. But looking at the situation of my friends and even myself when i was jobless for a while earlier, i wouldn't recommend staying here after +2.   Answering your other questions.. (In my POV)   Fees: private colleges ko 10 - 20 lakhs xa fees mostly. Aba scholarships paye sasto hola ig.   Quality: ja padhe ni mostly basics nai ho. Job lai chahine skills, experience / internships, self learning le matra badhxa.   Job opportunities: xa tara thorai xa and competition dherai with respect to opportunities.   Salary: depends. Ramro company mah ramrai xa. aru mah normally bare minimum bata nai suru bhairaxa. Private mah time mah nauune, increment nahune chai dherai suninxa and bhogya ni xu. Yo answer garho xa. All depends on your skills, YOE, job, company etc. Dherai factors hunxa.   Part time jobs: koi chinya manxey bata pasal, dept stores, basic accounting, part time paid intern or delivery, pathao, Indrive matra dimag mah auuxa.

I think its a huge mistake personally. I know there are many people who have done great in their lives. but I feel like (in the context of Japan) its a huge mistake to move after +2 because the cultural and language barrier is so high that even people with masters degree are working in convenient stores and other low paying jobs that need no academics. after +2 you just are so young and confused that you don't even know what you want in life and what are your options. at least after Bachelor's I'd guess you get what you should expect from life in general. also after Bachelor's its far easier to apply and get approved as opposed to after +2. also Bachelor's is very cheap compared to bidesh. Leaving the country as a teenager and growing up throughout my early 20s in bides has had me plant a doubt of growth in me. i feel like i have wasted my potential in Japan. I did 2 years of language and 4 years of graphic design and am currently studying 3d designing (1st year) as soon as i complete my study i wanna try and leave this country for good.   but I can also give a reason why you should move. 1. exposure at a young age. you get to experience things for the first time which is a doorway to learn many things about yourself and everything else. you see things that you have never even imagined. different languages and different cultures are important to live outside the bubble and see the world a little differently   2. privacy. in Nepal we have zero privacy. you do get total privacy and you can enjoy your alone time in solitude. this also comes with loneliness so be prepared to live a lonely life for the most part. loneliness also comes with anxiety and depression so try to keep yourself busy and in a circle.   3. life lessons. you start earning and learn to budget your expenses. you realize earning is easy and how much your parents had to sacrifice for you to be where you are. you also start getting very confident because now you are king of your own decisions.  4. You understand where you and your country lacks and how you can improve it. In Nepal there are many areas where change is necessary and if you never see it from others POV you will never know that it needs fixing. for example, i never cooked while i was in Nepal because mom did it all the time. but after coming here i have learned to cook some good food and also learned communication skills because of my work. also you see what exactly is not good in nepal and get the idea how you can fix it. for example lines in hospitals and other businesses like ward offices and banks. this can easily be fixed with a simple token and display. also supermarket like bhat bhateni can be improved with better staff training for efficiency  5.You can finally buy the things you couldn't afford as a kid. and you can buy the gifts for your family without having to worry about money so much. the face they make when you hand them the gifts is just priceless.  6. quality of life increases because you learn to keep yourself healthy and hygienic all the time. wearing nice clothes and with better styles uplifts your life by folds.   7. BAD SIDE  : you might also start drinking and smoking very often leading to sickness in the future when you are in your 30s and 40s|||I think it's the personal choice.

But this doesn't mean we should use society as an excuse to avoid personal accountability. Every man is still responsible for unlearning harmful behavior and trying to be a better person.

You will get trap for unnecessary drama both for men as well as women and never ending fight. Better is to not marry than marry someone whom you don't like.|||There are more men than women. Also, if men don't get married, women automatically don't get married too.|||This is why I believe in dowry concept it might sound rude but this is what it is. Since, most of the people have their past life and multiple relationships even before marriage these days. And that relation sometimes seems so so deeply rooted that it becomes difficult to forget. Some are involved in extramarital affairs as well. Then there's bitterness in the present married life and relations with family of husband. Now assume if her husband was single till the marriage for a perfect wife but what he got? Nothing but mental tension afterwards.   The psychological impact a normal people can't even bear. And sometimes girls even planned to marry a rich guy just for money and then divorce and get alimony which she'll spend with her lover. Sometimes, she even plans to kill her husband to get out of that thing. This is freaking crazy how people are thinking this way. I'm not justifying that she's the only culprit here but also her ex cum present hidden lover is equally involved.   Now in this situation it's better to live unmarried or take a grand amount as collateral if you are doing an arranged marriage. So that it will be easier for alimony.   You might call me bias but the thing is different. If we alternate the situation like a groom will have to leave his home and settle with bride forever, and if alimony should be paid by the bride after getting divorced, yeah a groom should have to give dowry as the collateral.   Fun fact: Love marriages crash faster than arranged ones. It’s like 1 v 1 versus many v many, so too many players in the latter provide team support 😅 during clashes. Honestly, better to stay single… or marry someone who doesn’t try to wrestle your ego.

Most men would rather call it \"hating on men\" or talk badly about women instead of rising to the occassion and actually trying to do and be better. It's not just a Nepal thing, though. The same thing is happening everywhere. Marriage isn't a means for money or safety anymore as it used to be. Women now are independent and can handle their own finances It's not even about social standing anymore, the patriarchal lines of hierarchy are slowly but surely getting blurred.   Nowadays, marriage is about partnership, trust, companionship, love and respect. Most men haven't understood that and would rather blame women as being \"gold diggers\" than realize that it's not the money (or the lack thereof) that influences the attitudes of women towards them.

            "body": "Hello everyone,  I never thought I’d be writing this again. I wish our situation had gotten better since my last post… but reality has been harsher than I ever imagined.  My father is battling Stage 3 Gall Bladder Cancer, and his treatment at RGCI, Delhi is ongoing. We somehow managed to complete 5 chemo cycles , by selling whatever little we had, taking loans, borrowing from friends and relatives, and emptying every bit of savings. But now, we are completely drained .. emotionally, mentally, and financially.  The doctors say the next few chemo cycles are critical . If we stop now, everything we’ve fought for so far might go in vain. But the treatment cost has now gone beyond ₹20 lakhs, and we have nothing left to continue.  My father is a simple, hardworking man a small farmer and shopkeeper from a middle-class family. He spent his entire life making sure we never felt our struggles,have some good education. Only now do I truly see how much he silently sacrificed for us. I’m still in college, trying to study, trying to stay strong, but watching him in pain and feeling helpless is tearing me apart. i feel cancer is the worst thing you can ever deal with .  I’ve seen my mother cry silently in the corner every night, and my sisters trying to smile despite knowing how close we are to losing everything. I keep telling them we’ll make it that I’ll find a way but right now, I don’t know how much longer we can hold on without help.  In my last post, so many kind souls came forward. I’m truly, deeply grateful — we managed to raise about ₹1.5 lakh, which helped us cover chemotherapy and hospital bills. Every rupee meant the world to us. 🙏  But the journey is far from over. We still need around ₹20 lakhs more to continue his treatment and give him a real chance at life.  If you’re reading this please, help us if you can. Even a small amount, even a share, even a prayer it all counts.   I’m not asking for sympathy; I’m asking for humanity.

Even those who visit India often are treated as if we’re some kind of threat to the country. Sometimes, I feel it’s because of our weak passport and the way they perceive our country. I’ve heard many disrespectful remarks directed at fellow Nepali travelers, even for the smallest mistakes like something as simple as pressing a thumb incorrectly.|||Mad because they were colonised and we didn't|||Man this is infuriating.

Every time, he was singled out, even though he traveled two to three times a year. They would ask about his visa, his job on the cruise, and why he was carrying money, if any. It seemed like they had never seen a Nepalese carrying dollars for travel expenses. After working on cruises for nearly 35 years and traveling extensively across the USA and Europe, he only faced this treatment at Indian airports. As a result, he now completely avoids traveling to or through India.|||Bangladesh airports are worse and their service is shit, but the it is still better.|||Very unfortunate and sorry this happened to you, traveling through India is definitely a terrible experience and I myself have experienced the worst experience of traveling through India for a NRN but just to play devils advocate, Indian government is probably trying to stop any underground routes to US and lot of people travel through South America to US, either way they should be clear on communicating to you why they stopped you and what their process are because they can’t stop someone without proper documentation of why they are stopping someone at the airport.|||Doesn't matter the whole world hates India. I live in Aus and these days the hate sentiments against Indian is too much. Sometimes even I feel bad for them. |||I heard this from my relative; they went to India. It wasn't first time. They knew a hotel used to stay there because it was known. But few weeks ago when they went there, they were told that government has said don't allow any Nepali to stay at any government hotel or lodge!

No, yet most nations frown or ban them from being raised for slaughter.  The same is true here. Cows are important part of their religious or cultural identity for most Nepalese people. So, I don't think such legalization will work or be treated positively.  Do I personally think Cows, or even dogs or cats should be banned? No, frankly I don't care as long as it does not impact humans or the species themselves on a conservation scale.  But I don't think this can or should be implemented nation wide.

We are Hindu majority. Nepalese of all religion are already normalized to not consuming beef, this will start a conflict amongst our own majority. Us not consuming beef has kept Muslims and Christians in low numbers- they are major consumers of beef and send missionaries everywhere to increase their numbers. If there are two similarly sized groups with different people- that will create political conflict and add to our issues. We already see this play out in western countries- they have major political issues around Muslims and recently Indians (who they associate with Hinduism which they've already begun to hate in Canada, and if you a brown Nepali- you are Indian to them) Don't make moves that will drive your own group's numbers low. We have to keep the status quo in regards to issues like this.   Not eating cow has not created any issue that is worth our attention. Focus on tackling actual issues like further eradicating this baun, chettri nonsense which is the bane of Hinduism- we can and are doing it while keeping our culture, traditions and identity.|||just say chamal ko bora ta paako this , visa ni paaulas ni and move on|||So much for a secular nation|||lets eat beef guys",

She is also the daughter of Nischal Nath Pandey, who served as a government employee during ramesh nath pandey’s long ministerial run. Look at this damn lifestyle. How is it possible to afford all of this when the family has nothing except civil service for the past 50 years?  Supriya Bohora, granddaughter of Deepak Bohora, former member of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and the House of Representatives, has recently come under the spotlight. Deepak Bohora was known for his strong hand in the Panchayat system and his unwavering support for the monarchy. His political journey is remembered not only for his allegiance to authoritarian structures but also for allegations of corruption. One of the most prominent accusations linked to Deepak Bohora is the illegal consumption of land where the Fun Park ice rink in Bhadrakali Road now stands. What was once a symbol of political maneuvering and alleged misappropriation of public assets is now being flaunted by his granddaughter as a mark of achievement, raising questions about how the spoils of corruption are normalized across generations.

Actually what these officer do is they heavily launder money and budgets which comes to their department . They practice “milijuli khane” . They also take funds from criminals to manage cases. Then they use these funds to bribe politicians for getting higher post like dsp to dig , from DIG to IG and so on . They conduct massive weddings and ceremonies spending crore of rupees. this is same with army generals as well.  `-`  **TLDR - REGISTER AND CONVINCE YOUR FRIENDS, COUSINS IF THEY STILL HAVE NOT MADE VOTER ID**  Read an interesting blog on this. Hamro lato politician le k bujhla esto. Chorra chorri lai instagram delete garna chai layo dhanna teti chai buddhi raicha.  >The corrupt ruling elites of the Third World, who used to steal everything, destroy economies, and create hell for their own populations, have now added one more thing: they openly allow their children to flaunt the spoils of corruption on Instagram, right in front of their starving people. Something previous generations never witnessed.  >The new rich have never gone through a revolution so they don't understand not to flaunt their wealth like the old bourgeoisie who have witnessed multiple revolutions throughout history. It's ironic that the Maoists instigated a revolution yet the children of said Maoists are now living the luxurious lives posting everything not knowing whats simmering in society. It looks like at least the kids have understood not to flaunt their stolen wealth to avoid angering the masses.  >In any ways what happened in Nepal highlights a trend I’ve discussed on here before, which is how Instagram utterly radicalizes youth heavy developing societies.  >Suddenly you as a poor but striving young man or woman have full visibility to how the elite/upper class of your country + diaspora live, but you have little access or hope of ever living the same for the most part. The impact of this on mental health, societal stability, and also fertility rates cannot be underestimated.  >Imagine going from a society with five state channels and a few cable options in the 2000s to Instagram in just five years. That’s what happened to all of South Asia + Africa + a lot of Latin America.  These guys were being exposed to the lifestyles of the baddie daughters and Chad sons of the fucktards ruling their country,  >You see their trip to Japan and London for the summer. See their parties at their elite mansions in the most posh suburbs and neighborhoods and you realize you’re just fucked and not getting there ever, your country simply does not have the mechanism to enable that for you, you’re unemployed even despite a college degree.  >**Upward mobility is like a pressure valve. Nepal never had that. The elites taxed people, slapped tariffs on imports & ignored building institutions that foster upward mobility. Instead, they assumed that sending their populace to the Middle East would be sufficient.**  >What’s surprising is how the corrupt politicians allow their kids to flaunt stolen wealth so brazenly. Kids of politicians in developing countries flaunting their extravagant lifestyles on public Instagram accounts is so foolhardy. Exposure to social media and bragging about your luxurious lifestyle risks fuelling resentment and envy.  >It's how uprisings have always been. Old bourgeoisie don't show off their wealth like those Nepali elites did. This behavior is what got both the iranian and russian noble families killed. This also happened in Mongolia earlier this year, although less dramatically. The Prime Minister had to step down due to protests that kicked off because his son was showing off his luxury holidays and clothes too much on Instagram.",

Trendy: they're brainwashed, selfish, came for masubhat  Reality: UML has strong foundation and institutions in every sectors, from education to workers, farmers, employees, businesses.   These organizations/institutions although have bad reputations, have done some apprecianle deeds too. From volunteering, blood donations, scholarship schemes etc. For eg. UML's student union was the first one to reach to Kalapani and put Nepal's flag on the land.   What we're doing is just bashing them on the internet with mostly baseless accusations. (Mostly, not all). That's not how you defeat an established and strong organization.

People romanticize going abroad, but they don’t realize it’s a full reset! Your last name, your family status, your struggles back home, none of it matters. What counts is how disciplined and valuable you are in that new system.  I’d add, learn to manage your emotions too. It’s not just physical or financial survival — it’s mental. You’ll feel lonely, rejected, homesick, but those who turn that into fuel grow faster than anyone else. Also, you don’t have to be the smartest person, but be reliable.

I’m truly grateful. Recently during an interview, I shared my personal political standpoint. I mentioned that I do not personally recognize K.P. Oli as a leader whose ideology I align with. I say this not out of disrespect, but from a place of accountability and responsibility toward our nation. After the recent Gen Z protests, I believe many of us expected honest conversations, acknowledgment of public concerns, and accountability for the injustices that occurred under his administration where many lives were lost. When leadership is unable to take responsibility for such serious matters, it becomes difficult for me to support or follow their ideology. My intention is not to attack individuals, but to stand for truth, transparency, and a future where leaders are answerable to the people. I believe Nepal deserves leadership that listens, learns, and upholds justice for every citizen. Thank you once again to everyone who resonated with my thoughts. Let’s continue pushing for a better and more responsible political culture together.|||So many Incel chicks in comment, are we even safe?|||Nepal is literally full of chutiyas like these, logic fact kei chaina 😂 .

At the end of the day, even though I scored 3.97 GPA, In the Kathmandu Metro Scholarship exam, I choked. I barely made it onto the second nomination list and ended up in a college that’s just “okay.” But honestly, I don’t blame the college I blame myself. There were others who got into better colleges than me, even though they had lower grades. So, I can’t say grades don’t matter, but the first term really showed me how tough things can get. I know I need to improve, and I’m determined to do so. I got an A+ in Computer Science, even though I didn’t study as much as I should have. I love Computer Science and building a lot of skills in the field. Right now, though, I’ve decided to take a break from everything every extracurricular activity, including learning JavaScript, React, and other things. I know I probably shouldn’t, but I feel like it’s necessary for now. Starting today, I’ll be locking my phone and using my laptop strictly for studying. I need to focus on my second terminal exams, and it’s time to set boundaries.If I’ve said anything wrong, I apologize. I don’t blame anyone or anything but myself, even though I studied harder than I ever have. My lack of proper note-taking has cost me. Right now, I’m just looking for advice from seniors who have gone through this and come back stronger, getting good results in the end.",

But it turned out none of it actually mattered.   Last year I gave CEE exams for MBBS ug , I couldn't get a scholarship and it felt like the end of the world especially because people expected a lot from me. I used to avoid talking to anyone. But I am ok now. Ek barsa drop liye and gave entrance exams again, BHOLI results aaudai chha and I feel positive about the results.  I honestly believe 11 ko results le kei matter gardaina.

I understand it looks a lot worse to you (and maybe your guardians) coming from 3.97 to 3.10 and your feelings are very valid. I have seen toppers with dead end jobs and barely first class pass having a stellar careers. I'm somewhat middle of the lot myself.  You've got a lot going for you, you got a 4.0 in the subject you love and sounds like you're pretty proactive with it and fairly competent too. All the B's and B+'s  could have been A's with a little discipline and bit of a good luck, and most of all hopefully this has given you a wake up call.  You got a great career and life ahead of you, so take a long breath and carry on!|||mero 3.07 aako 2 baarsa vayo, I'm still alive so this might not be the end. 😅|||From experience, just be happy you didn't fail. I being a metro scholar failed real bad my terminals. It shook all the confidence within me, had me go through lots of bad mouthing from my own parents. So all I'd like to say is you can improve and reach greater heights much easily than me. Took me lots of hardwork to get back on track. You can put in half the efforts but improve further than me, don't be sad your marks degraded rather try improvising new study methods to help you improve.|||You do realize that there are ppl who will absolutely kill for your current grade right?|||Bro mero ni SEE ma 3.9 aako thiyo ani 11 ko first term ma 2.9 muskil le (I was from sci background) pachi 12 ma balla talla push garera 3.65 lyauna safal bhaye|||SAT is the only thing that can save you my sister/brother|||mero 11 ma 3.7 ani  12 ma 2.62 xa|||listen   you have got a+ IN COMPUTER   looks like you will do very good in tech  do tech degree bachelors ma   just my suggestion !|||ye sab moh maya hai Balak.|||This guy thinks getting 3.10 GPA is the end of the world🤣🤣🤣|||what do you mean its the END ? have you learned to give up this easy ? tetro SEE ma 3.97 lyayeko aba aayera yesari easily ta give up dont do brother. you got it myan its not the end   bharkhar ta suru bhayo lmao   still have time to improve   Goodluck|||good enough gpa for terminal exam mero 3.08 aako thyo 11 ko first term ma 12 ko boards ma got 3.79|||🤣🤣 don't overthink, this happens to everyone.|||Dw at all.

Shortening. SS = 2SC; -SS=2CS; CC = 2CC; -CC = 2SS;   3. Now find pattern in the shortening if you want to make the memory stronger. i.e. sin huda bived xa. Cos sablaii barabar xa. + huda first terms same hunxa. - huda first term farak hunxa.  Now you remember it.  Second Technique: Do it hundred of times.

So you could do arithematics or geometry or whatever. just write  Third Technique. Learn where these formulas come from. and generalize from there.

It was like life coming together. Arkai section with amazing vibe.

So guys it does get better in 12 and just keep going yo 2 barsa will pass by quickly tara one of the most impactful years ever hunxa.

Everything is so rapid and it's hard to grasp everything.      The bitter part for me is teachers and even classmates to some extent are strangers. I love how in school everyone knew and had different connection with every other teacher but here they just yap and go. The bond with classmates isn't great yet but I hope I will make some lifelong buddies out there.  The course is kinda hard as well and the competition is crazy asf. Einsteins here and there. Never failed an exam but for the first time in my life I think I am gonna be just-pass in Physics, man I hope I won't fail. Gotta grind my ass from now on.|||Exactly for me it happened the same time passed very fast. There were many obstacles and I felt the course was really different than school levels.|||time really flies so fast. feels like yesterday i got into the 11 and now i just have 6 months left for the boards. during this period got to realize that not every classmates are friends. course is hard as hell and cant be covered just by reading one day before exams. if i were to rate this 2 year then probably 5/10 maybe|||I completed by 12 this year AND OH BOY THOSE TWO YEARS WERE HARD. i took bio science ani kei ni aaudeina thiyo😭😭😭|||It was yesterday I joined +2 and today I'm worrying about my boards.

Around a year worth of income of an average Nepalese just for a 2 years of teen's study.  My experience with Kavya was that my mom went there just to check it out (ofcourse it was out of our budget) and sadly she entered her number in some survey they had.      The number of calls those nggas made during 2 whole weeks, fk. We kept on declining and blocking their numbers but everytime it was a new number lmao. When we first asked for discount, they declined for even a rupee but later on they started giving offers themselves, despo times for them ig.

            "heading": "Time-Travelling to the 90s with Notepad 😭",
            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I’ve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I’m revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I’ll share the publication’s name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I’m not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don’t even know how to open or save files and that’s completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn’t include topics that match today’s trends. What’s relevant now? AI, isn’t it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we’ve been studying since grade 6. I’m now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn’t be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren’t even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad 😭. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that’s how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn’t even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor 😭 since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly “Yeah i  already know html it's something i’ve learned many times before and i don’t use Notepad anymore(for webdev😭)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects” then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like “<” and “/”. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today’s topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1–h6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn’t say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later 😅 By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don’t know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

My point is if you want to take a drop then, you should be able to sacrifice your comfort level. Dedicate urself wholly. I hope u get scholarship in bsc nursing. Good luck.|||[deleted]",

Watch khan academy for general concepts. Use Perplexity AI or something like that for personal guidance. I got away with a 3.8+ GPA with only these resources. Perplexity really helped me understand the topics I was really struggling with. Also take full advantage of your school library. I used different books to get my concepts clear. For example: Use Fundamental Physics by Resnick and Halliday to understand the concepts in Physics, Thomas calculus for calculus, also most of the math is covered in BC Bajracharya's Basic of Mathematics. Even if you study an hour a day using these resources, that would be enough (Considering you pay attention in class).|||How much is the fee|||Too bad youtube ma free ma xa 😢|||Don't take online tuition class myannn|||fee?? |||You can easily access any topics from any elite professors for FREE .

Ya and i got an overall 3.8  and ya forgot to mention, If u dont understand a topic than u have youtube .To be frankly honest,i used to watch a lecture from youtube everytime a topic or concept or terms even if its subtle.
