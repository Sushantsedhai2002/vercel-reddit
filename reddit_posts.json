They never talk about the process and directly jumped into the conclusion. They never gave us the **blueprint** of how to increase the economy but always talks about development. Is it really difficult to increase the GDP growth rate of the country? I think with right policy and right steps in right time, it's not that hard to increase the growth rate to 8 to 10%.

            "body": "One another question. Am I the bad daughter?   In 2013 (I was 10) my parents, my brother and I immigrated to Australia. My dad never wanted to come but my mother convinced him  When we arrived, I was homesick until 2018. Same for my dad My bro is 9 years younger than me so he not care.  Now it‚Äôs 2025 and my father still really wants to go back to Nepal  Deeply.  Me? I love it here now. Yes racism sucks but except for that I‚Äôm happy here and I still studying. My father has sacrificed soo much for me  He‚Äôs an amazing father, and would do anything to make me happy. He loves me unconditionally, and would put me above himself. Even if he doesn‚Äôt benefit from it.  My father isn‚Äôt happy here  It‚Äôs been over 10 years and he‚Äôd say that if I said I wanna go back he‚Äôll book in ticket immediately. But he never forced me to go back or stay there. He did say that once my brother is old enough to take care of himself he will go back to Nepal and visit every 6 months or so.  However. My grandmother (mom side) told me the conversation between her and my dad.  Everyone in my family knows my dad hates it here.  So my grandma is like (sweet polite tone) ‚ÄúTell your father this. ‚ÄòDad, if I go to Nepal with you are you gonna come with me as well?‚Äô If you say this your father will be the happiest person on earth. He‚Äôs here because of you. He wants to go back to Nepal. I even told him ‚Äîjust him to leave you guys and come back. But he refused as he doesn‚Äôt want to leave his family here‚Äù  I then said ‚Äúdad‚Äôs gonna go back on the ten years anyway. That‚Äôs what he said‚Äù  Grandma ‚Äúhe said to test you. Just come live in Nepal, for  this country you‚Äôre always gonna be an immigrant. Your dad will be happy. Your mother is too stubborn‚Äù   Me ‚Äúbut, I like it here‚Äù  Grandma  ‚ÄúDo you love your dad or not? He‚Äôs done so much for you. He works 12 hours everyday. He‚Äôs 53 now. Come to Nepal. I‚Äôve got money to pay for your school fees‚Äù  That‚Äôs when the guilt hit me. Yes dad works over 10 hours  And yes it‚Äôs especially hard in the hot son as he‚Äôs an engineer.  Yes my dad doesn‚Äôt like it heere and he‚Äôs much happier everytime we‚Äôre in Nepal.  My dad did say ‚Äúwe should‚Äôve gone to Nepal when my daughter (me) was still homesick‚Äù But I‚Äôm 23 now  And I don‚Äôt wanna go back to Nepal. But I love my father. He‚Äôs an amazing person who‚Äôs gone through so much.  But I see my future here. Knowing my dad, he cannot live without me and if I say ‚ÄúI want to go back to Nepal‚Äù he‚Äôll happily book a ticket and go. So it seems like I got the ‚Äúpower‚Äù but I hate it. I feel like a horriable person and failed as a daughter. On one hand I see my future here and I like it here. On the other hand I wanna see my father happy  I told my cousin about this and here‚Äôs what she said ‚ÄúYour dad is 50 now. He‚Äôs been sacrificing you for your whole life. Don‚Äôt let me stop you but if I was in your place, I‚Äôd come to Nepal for your father. It is your duty as the oldest child to make sure he has the safe retirement Once your father is here you can go back. Finish your bachelors‚Äù  I hate it.

Also, move to Nepal and do what? You grew up in Australia.. you're more in touch with Australia than you are with Nepal...   Its a parent's job to provide for their children... they're not doing you as a favor, that's literally their responsibility.  Maybe once he's older then sure, if you want to take care of him go ahead. But he's a fully capable man, fully capable of living on his own.

I know you love him tara at the end of the day it is your life. If you don‚Äôt like it in Nepal you will never forgive your dad coz you will feel like he caused that misery and maybe your relationship with him will also go down hill. You need to have a proper conversation with him and let him choose. He can‚Äôt have both haath ma laddu, you plus his want to go back to Nepal.

My friend family leave USA for good because his parents wanna go back to Nepal. They purchase land and properties and lived for 3 years in Nepal but they‚Äôre back again in US after selling their house and land.   They can‚Äôt live without their kids. And their kids basically grown up in US. They love and know US more then they know about Nepal.|||You father will not want to destroy your life and career and come to Nepal. Stay there make a good living come back 10 yrs later retire early.|||Don‚Äôt feel anything bad about yourself. Its his decision and not yours.   Years ago he was coerced by your mom and now your grandma wants you to coerce him back to Nepal. I don‚Äôt know what it is with the ladies of your household but I think he has to make his own decision   Every parent makes  sacrifices and if you become one you will too. And what if father you go back what about your brother ? It is what it is . If he wanted to leave he should have done years ago. Complete your studies first and than think what you should do? And don‚Äôt feel guilty about anything, this situation isn‚Äôt of your making and you shouldn‚Äôt sacrifice your studies or career for this. Your father will never be able to forgive himself.|||It is hard to deal with manipulation from adult family as we get older. As children our adult family are our guides and heroes. When we grow we start to learn they are flawed people just like everyone. But learning to handle their manipulation will make you stronger.

Is he involved with the nepali community? Maybe he can do a hobby or a sport? Enjoy some day trips on the weekend to parks or gardens|||Don't let your dad's sacrifice go to vain. He endured to give you the opportunity, don't let it go to waste.|||Looking at your replies to other comments, it seems like you have already made up your mind. Are you just here looking for validation that you are right?|||I'm kind of in the same situation as you, same age but male in Canada. Both of my parents are pushing 50 and want to go back to Nepal and take me with them, but I've chosen to live here and let them go back to Nepal when my little brother is grown up. The reason is very simple, there is absolutely no future for me in Nepal and recent events merely strengthen my resolve to stay in a developed country.   I know my parents have worked hard for many years to raise me and my brother, but I know that if I choose to leave my career and life here for Nepal, I will have to work just as hard in a country that does not reward hard work and dedication like a developed country like Canada or Australia does.

I might be completely wrong.|||I talked with my mother recently about their early life in Australia and she struggled with the adjustment, especially since she is the social one of my parents. Only after 10-15 years in Australia did her feelings adjust and after 25 years of living here has she shifted her preference for country of retirement.   Nepal has had so many changes that the environment they are nostalgic about doesn't exist. They've taken so much time to assimilate as NRN Australians that they don't want to do it again if they were permanently returning to Nepal.   Anyway, Asian cultures have a history of intergenerational trauma and Nepal is no exception. Obviously there is a deep rooted Nepali culture that carries through generations as well and something you should recognise is that the culture of taking care of your parents is not just being experienced by you but by your father as well.  If you ask me, your father is feeling responsible for taking care of the ageing parents in Nepal but he is split because he must also take care of his family (ie, you and bhai).   One of my dad's close friends returned to Nepal for this exact reason in his 60's and left his kids in the US because they have the capacity to be independent. My parents have said that they will follow us because we are the next generation and they will become the grandparents.",

But I've also heard from some being asked for one by the immigration officers. I'd say, if you can make it, get one. If not, don't worry much.   Option 1: Tell the immigration officer politely but confidently that you never made one for your undergrad, too, as it wasn't asked by your university. Tell them to get to know about it now, so next time you'll make sure to make one.  Option 2: Carry the undergrad one and tell the officer you were here for just a few days as someone in your fam was unwell and did not get time to create one.

And even if it did, it would still remain heavily dependent on India, both geographically and economically. India essentially does Nepal huge favors through things like free trade access and the currency peg. Without that, if NPR was a floating currency, most realistic outcome I see is it drowning.  I would not say movements in other South Asian countries have truly been successful yet. Many of them are still unstable, facing their own cycles of corruption, political roller coaster, and institutional weakness. The difference is mostly in momentum and governance, not necessarily in the depth of reform.  Recently read Why Nations Fall and it mentions the root of national prosperity is not resources or geography, but institutions. Inclusive institutions give people incentives to innovate, while extractive ones keep power concentrated in the hands of a few, suppressing growth. Nepal‚Äôs political system has historically been extractive, where power circulates among the same elite networks and there is little incentive for accountability or innovation.  So while protests like the Gen Z movement show that people want change, it is hard to transform a system that is structurally built to resist it. Without institutional reform, we will likely keep repeating the same cycle, with moments of energy followed by stagnation.|||It‚Äôs difficult because there isn‚Äôt an internal infrastructure developed for mass production.

My journey in ICT (Information and Communications Technology) began with curiosity and has since become a story of growth, learning, and discovery. When I first started learning ICT, everything seemed complicated. I remember struggling to understand how computers worked, what software and hardware meant, and how to use basic tools like spreadsheets and presentations. But as I explored more, I realized that ICT wasn‚Äôt just about using a computer ‚Äî it was about understanding how technology shapes our daily lives and how we can use it creatively and responsibly. Throughout my journey, I learned various skills such as creating documents, designing simple graphics, coding basic programs, and using online platforms for communication and collaboration. Each activity helped me improve my problem-solving skills and develop digital literacy, which is essential in today‚Äôs modern world. One of my favorite experiences was working on projects that combined creativity and technology ‚Äî making presentations, editing videos, and designing posters. These tasks showed me that ICT is not just technical, but also artistic and expressive. It‚Äôs a bridge between imagination and innovation. Of course, my journey wasn‚Äôt always easy. There were moments of frustration, especially when programs didn‚Äôt work or when I couldn‚Äôt understand a new concept. But every challenge taught me patience, perseverance, and the value of asking questions and seeking help. Now, I can proudly say that ICT has become one of my favorite subjects. It has opened my eyes to the endless possibilities of technology ‚Äî from helping others through digital tools to exploring careers in tech. My ICT journey continues, and I‚Äôm excited to keep learning, exploring, and growing in this ever-evolving digital world.",

            "body": "So I bought the ultima boost 20k ultra around last year and it was working fine until it reached around month 9. I know the battery drains and the capacity lowers the more u use it but it literally went from charging my phone 3 times a day to not even charging it upto 25% in a couple of days. They only give u 6 months of warranty too but still I reached out and complained and they said I should visit their baneshwor branch in which they told me that my powerbank was one of the first batches which was deployed with problematic boards and needed to be replaced. But, they didn't have the board at the time so they told me to contact them the next month. The power bank was completely useless at this point cuz it wouldn't even charge my phone upto 5% and it would drain really quickly and turn off after 75%. I tried to reach the customer support but they just keep delaying and are very hard to communicate with. Once i told them \"huh\" and they replied \"Okay sir\" like wth. It's outrageous cuz I paid 4k for this thing and it stops working in mere 9 months. I would've opted for xiaomi or other brands instead.  TLDR: Ultima powerbanks are ass so is their customer support.",

Here‚Äôs where it gets worse:   I contacted customer care, and they told me to wait 24 hours for the balance to be updated. Even after 2 days, nothing happened. After following up again, they finally asked for my bank statement and transaction details. Only then was the missing amount credited to my eSewa account.  Now imagine someone in an emergency tries to load money, and the first attempt fails, but the amount is deducted. Naturally, they try again. The second attempt works, and the money is credited. But the first deducted amount remains unaccounted for unless the user remembers and takes the time to go through the whole complaint process.  This is unacceptable.

They are shaken and, surely, scared as well.  But as time passes, they will find their strength.  There was a time when they had low days when Maoists came to the mainstream politics after 2063 jana-aandolan. But the inflated balloon, as described by KP, popped soon.  The effect of this movement will last even shorter because this was all based on hate(deservedly so). Hate works as a great catalyst to bring change, but what makes the change last is leadership and direction. You need a political compass that sets the direction of the country. You cannot have a functioning country with 500 different conflicting opinions and no one with vision and the ability to set a direction and inspire the masses. You cannot have a country where just one generation holds all the power. You cannot have a country where there is no consistency in how the rule and law is exercised. People will soon be frustrated by this and will want to see the situation change.|||They ain‚Äôt getting that much vote. But you are abhorrently wrong to single out UML. It means NC might gain seats and Maoist might gain seats. Thus, there won‚Äôt be second party but a large first Party with Nepali Congress emerging victorious. NC is the OG of Nepali corruption. This means Gen Z Anndolan became Anti UML Pro NC movement strengthens the old NC like Deuba and Gagan. If you want NC back in power, well Played Gen Z. If it was anti corruption, not targeting NC the largest party and forgetting Maoist is biggest Blunder or maybe that‚Äôs your desire. I don‚Äôt know you. You might be Nepali Congress jhole by just signaling out UML.   So , are you against corruption and full support of Gen Z or just elimination of UML is enough for you . Please show your pledge as I don‚Äôt see NC and MC being targeted.   What is your opinion on Deuba? What is your opinion on Prachanda ?",

A part of me feels like motherhood is something truly beautiful, the idea of creating a life inside you, giving birth, and raising your own little humans into kind and beautiful souls. What draws me most is the thought of giving my kids the love and understanding I wished I had, of fulfilling the dreams my parents couldn‚Äôt, even though they tried. Maybe it‚Äôs my way of healing myself and soothing my inner child.  I want to be a mom to two daughters, protecting them, and helping them bloom into who they‚Äôre meant to be. But then there are moments when I look at the world, how exhausting and uncertain it can be, and I wonder if choosing to be childfree might actually be the more responsible and loving choice.  Maybe one day, with the right partner, I‚Äôll know for sure. For now, I‚Äôm letting both feelings exist.|||because I absolutely hate all my cousins and don't want to leave any of my money to them lol. so it's either kids or spending everything in my old age|||Kids are the most beautiful creatures, I believe. Look, there isn't an exact meaning of life, right?

Also the idea, process, the feeling, the life of having kids seems like a most beautiful & soul touching moment ever. The beauty of Parenthood is something that can't be replicated through any other means. I believe that good parenting can solve 99% of issue that exists today among parents. Like, i don't know. Kids are just pure of heart. Growing up I've seen couple of kids grow up. My own brother, from a tiny whiny doll to, full of cheerful beautiful toddler, watching him learn, speak, communicate & now has grown up to an incredible hulk. The process is just tooo beautiful, nothing compares. Kids are beautiful. I know it's a challenge as year goes by, and i think this is where most parents fail to be the right parent for their kids. But I will be a best & right parent in everystep & I will only marry someone who's capable. Can't risk my babies Future. They say you'll get a strong biological force at time to be parent, and then a subsequent lifetime depression if you don't. I don't how true is this, you'll never know the feeling unless you experience it first. and that's about it.   I too believe stupid people shouldn't be parents. Nature should withdraw fertility from possible future parents who will give their kids a ipad to distract or shut them down. This type of irresponsible people should never be parents.|||That's your biological life goal as a living being haha, but I think for me its because your kid is like a version of you so that's how you remain eternal lol.

Where you have not won the capitalism  What‚Äôs your reason re omg ü§£|||If we put aside the economic barrier and chaotic nature of the current times, it has got to be one of the most fulfilling experiences in life.   It's an opportunity to have a greater purpose, a very pure expression of love, it gives more reasons to live a more stable life. You finally have a greater priority than yourself. Even if you don't love yourself enough or don't have the motivation to work hard, you will work hard for your kids. You have an opportunity to create an ideal human who won't have the flaws you have or make the mistakes you make. A better version, a beacon of light in society. Some schools of thought suggest that Your parents have worked hard to nurture you, that debt can only be paid off after you nurture your own.   Those are in ideal conditions though. Today the economy is f*cked, both parents have to work full time to sustain, meaning someone else is gonna raise the kids: nannies, in laws and the prison-like schools. So many people even in our generation have been victims of this. It's a traumatizing world out there and having kids has become near impractical in our times.|||To make generational wealth and make sure my future generations will thank me everyday üòù|||I'm handsome and I'on want my genes to be wasted.

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can‚Äôt get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

The funding that has been availed through Carbon Purchase as well as NGOs and INGOs have also played a critical role. I don't remember exactly, but UNDP or something published a really great report on the success of community forests and improvement of forested areas in Nepal.   Actually Nepal despite everything and has had excellent metrics when it comes to nature and biodiversity conservation.|||Folks who grew up in the 90s may remember efforts put into forest conservation through media.

Impressionable ads like an old woman carrying doko vari ko daura and wondering ‚ÄúAja lai ta taryo voli k garne?‚Äù We have done a lot in the field of forest and wildlife conservation. Amidst all the negative things lets commend ourselves on this for once. Hamro Community based Forest Preservation program (Samudayik Bann) is a leading example in the world.|||\"Hariyo ban Nepal ko dhan\" massive initiative is Main reason. This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it. You can hear the news for development work and of NEA cannot cut down the trees easily, yup that is because of same strong protective law.|||It‚Äôs because of movement of people and reliance on gas, concrete instead of timber.|||No , it‚Äôs a result of migration of people from hills to concentrated cities and Terai .

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts. So, yeah definitely a result of afforestation but there is more to this and would be a great topic to delve deep into.|||what about terai ko char koshe jhadi?|||It‚Äôs meant to highlight the loss of ice and glaciers.

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.  I just hope this changes with the new government.|||i thought hamas was fighting gaza right after they kill him i think they just sick isreal PM both are shit they just want control people.. fucking hate hamas|||Sad|||I'm Israeli, sadly his DNA was diagnosed and was believed to die in the first months of the war R.I.P Bipin|||Vayo vayo pugyo,  He is dead, confirmed by Israel and hamas both.

So yeah some part of India be similar to you. Not whole india cause there's no universal culture in India.|||It just shows how little you know about India.  India is one of the most diverse countries in the world.   The culture of Uttarakhand is indistinguishable from the culture of Sudurpaschim and adjacent regions.   Same goes with culture of Sikkhim, Bengal and Eastern Nepal.   Your definition of Nepal is very narrow and shows that you only think of Terai and Madesh as different while the rest of Nepal as a monolith.|||lol the differences that you are talking about can be seen from one Indian state to another, India itself does not have one common way of celebrating Dashain or Tihar, common social values, food tradition, etc. No matter how much we try to differentiate ourselves from Indians that's the most similar we are to any other country.|||Why do you think only Madesh has similar culutre to India? We all celebrate Dashain and Tihar(dfferent reason and rituals). Our family values are similar when it comes to education, marriage and relatives and elders. Our spending patterns are similar. Our language in structure are also similar. (Compare nepali to chinese or english that would be different).    India itself is a diverse country which makes it impossible to generalise it. So comparing nepal to one part of India is a statistical error. As Nepal borders with Tibet, its influence is observed in our culture and becasue Northern Nepal is hilly contrast to plains in south, lifestyle changes to adapt to it. But it is again similar to people in Uttarakhand or Northeast India.|||Depends on what part of India you are referring to? India is extremely diverse and Nepali culture - as it is - is more similar to Indian Culture than culture can be between different parts of India. Remember, the India we think of today is British India, but before that Nepal was no different than any other kingdom in the Indian subcontinent. Our festivals, rituals and customs are the same with superficial regional differences. Buddha and Sita both associated with India were Nepali. We are the same people, same broad culture just different nationalities.|||Compared to everyone else like west, China, Pakistan and stuff. Our culture is more similar. Maybe that is the reason.|||Because Nepalese copies indians and indian culture, it's that simple. Just like India people here are also brainrot. While india politics divide people by religion and here also politicians divide people based on parties and biasness. South Asia is Backwards Comparing other. Literacy rate is down, people are divided, education is crime here, Leaders are Clown and People are slaves|||Because India itself is extremely diverse. People from Punjab, Tamil Nadu, & Manipur are drastically different from each other yet they‚Äôre all considered Indian. Nepal also largely under that broader umbrella of Indian cultural variation.|||because we share almost same religion, culture, languages, foods, festivals, etc and etc... plus an open border with zero security and surveillance  because the so called Nepalese hate Madheshi due to these sharing characters   because most of the politicians did their Alma Mater from Indian universities   because we enjoy Indian movies   because we lack civic sense like as Indian  because Nepal does its business mostly from India  etc  etc|||To everyone else not in India and Nepal, you are exactly the same.||| Because we are? If you were to choose one culture that we are most similar with, which one would you choose?   The areas near India will have cultural ties with Indian states that are near Nepal; thats how most countries work. Would you not say Korean or Japanese culture is similar to Chinese?   Iswtg most of these sentiments come from insecurity. Just be proud of being Nepalese.|||I am from Terai, only those who are from Mithila and Bhojpuri culture share similarity and that too only with the Mithila and other similar cultures of the India, not to the entirety of India.  Plus, why do most Nepalese think that Madhesi are entirely of Terai region?? ü§¶ü§¶|||People often compare castes and culture on internet but the real world is totally different i believe 99% of such posts are meant for mindless timepass.    I noticed something similar where in a post i mentioned Diwali somewhere instead of Tihar and one guy came up saying why did I used the term Diwali and not Tihar. This shows how stupid and sensitive some people with their views for opposite cultures and caste.  Total Bullshit|||I'm from Saptari and my mom thinks people from Siraha have a different culture and mindset and therefore nothing alike. /s|||I believe you should first learn about the diversity before drawing any conclusions on your own|||roti beti ka rishta|||Yeah, it‚Äôs a bit different. I don‚Äôt know why even me. I am also trying to figure it out.|||Indian culture is also different broh iniharu ko Gujrat ko culture Bengal vanda dherai different xha like Gujrat don't eat fish and consider it to be a sin but bengalis offer fish to God, it's the same culture with local touch on it. But does it mean that Gujrat is following Hinduism and Bengal is not following Hinduism? No, it's just local touch. As for the civic sense, well we need to thank British for that where did the concept of Bharata as a country in the form of independence first appear it was in Bihar today's poor state and all the intellectuals of Hindu culture all came from Bihar but British somehow managed to reverse the culture and thus you've this result. We just got lucky we could say|||You described Nepal like we were people that have our own unique culture and way of life etc etc  But then tied to to tibetan culture like it was a major contributor  I don't believe that at all, as mentioned above I think we nepali have our own way   Speaking of influence, indian influence is def higher than tibetan cultureüòÇ|||But nepali people make reels with hindi songs|||Dashain = Dusshera (for the most part - origin of the festival is same - how it is celebrated is a bit different)  Tihar = Diwali (same as above)  Social values are similar, no that different. We are all dharmic societies. Families are similar. Food traditions are similar (daal, bhaat, tarkari is common across the subcontinent). Flavors changes but that changes even between families living 2 houses apart. Such is the diversity.  Architecture is similar. Pahadi architecture is shared across India/Nepal, Plain area architecture is also shared across both countries.  Ofcourse we are more influenced to tibetan culture compared to India as a whole. But pahadi states of India are as much influenced by tibetan culture due to close proximity.   In general Nepali are calmer than Indians. But I have found that Pahadi people of India are calmer still and south indians (had lived in Karnataka for education) are also calmer. Only hot heads were in the northern plains of India.  \\*\\*Nepal is different to India only and only due to its Nationalism\\*\\*. Kind of like Germany and Switzerland.  So, let Indians think we are similar because we are. But that does not mean Nepal = India.|||anything to justify greater Indiaüôè",

My dad never wanted to come but my mother convinced him  When we arrived, I was homesick until 2018. Same for my dad My bro is 9 years younger than me so he not care.  Now it‚Äôs 2025 and my father still really wants to go back to Nepal  Deeply.  Me? I love it here now. Yes racism sucks but except for that I‚Äôm happy here and I still studying. My father has sacrificed soo much for me  He‚Äôs an amazing father, and would do anything to make me happy. He loves me unconditionally, and would put me above himself. Even if he doesn‚Äôt benefit from it.  My father isn‚Äôt happy here  It‚Äôs been over 10 years and he‚Äôd say that if I said I wanna go back he‚Äôll book in ticket immediately. But he never forced me to go back or stay there. He did say that once my brother is old enough to take care of himself he will go back to Nepal and visit every 6 months or so.  However. My grandmother (mom side) told me the conversation between her and my dad.  Everyone in my family knows my dad hates it here.  So my grandma is like (sweet polite tone) ‚ÄúTell your father this. ‚ÄòDad, if I go to Nepal with you are you gonna come with me as well?‚Äô If you say this your father will be the happiest person on earth. He‚Äôs here because of you. He wants to go back to Nepal. I even told him ‚Äîjust him to leave you guys and come back. But he refused as he doesn‚Äôt want to leave his family here‚Äù  I then said ‚Äúdad‚Äôs gonna go back on the ten years anyway. That‚Äôs what he said‚Äù  Grandma ‚Äúhe said to test you. Just come live in Nepal, for  this country you‚Äôre always gonna be an immigrant. Your dad will be happy. Your mother is too stubborn‚Äù   Me ‚Äúbut, I like it here‚Äù  Grandma  ‚ÄúDo you love your dad or not? He‚Äôs done so much for you. He works 12 hours everyday. He‚Äôs 53 now. Come to Nepal. I‚Äôve got money to pay for your school fees‚Äù  That‚Äôs when the guilt hit me. Yes dad works over 10 hours  And yes it‚Äôs especially hard in the hot son as he‚Äôs an engineer.  Yes my dad doesn‚Äôt like it heere and he‚Äôs much happier everytime we‚Äôre in Nepal.  My dad did say ‚Äúwe should‚Äôve gone to Nepal when my daughter (me) was still homesick‚Äù But I‚Äôm 23 now  And I don‚Äôt wanna go back to Nepal. But I love my father. He‚Äôs an amazing person who‚Äôs gone through so much.  But I see my future here. Knowing my dad, he cannot live without me and if I say ‚ÄúI want to go back to Nepal‚Äù he‚Äôll happily book a ticket and go. So it seems like I got the ‚Äúpower‚Äù but I hate it. I feel like a horriable person and failed as a daughter. On one hand I see my future here and I like it here. On the other hand I wanna see my father happy  I told my cousin about this and here‚Äôs what she said ‚ÄúYour dad is 50 now. He‚Äôs been sacrificing you for your whole life.

The reason is very simple, there is absolutely no future for me in Nepal and recent events merely strengthen my resolve to stay in a developed country.   I know my parents have worked hard for many years to raise me and my brother, but I know that if I choose to leave my career and life here for Nepal, I will have to work just as hard in a country that does not reward hard work and dedication like a developed country like Canada or Australia does.

I might be completely wrong.|||I talked with my mother recently about their early life in Australia and she struggled with the adjustment, especially since she is the social one of my parents. Only after 10-15 years in Australia did her feelings adjust and after 25 years of living here has she shifted her preference for country of retirement.   Nepal has had so many changes that the environment they are nostalgic about doesn't exist. They've taken so much time to assimilate as NRN Australians that they don't want to do it again if they were permanently returning to Nepal.   Anyway, Asian cultures have a history of intergenerational trauma and Nepal is no exception. Obviously there is a deep rooted Nepali culture that carries through generations as well and something you should recognise is that the culture of taking care of your parents is not just being experienced by you but by your father as well.  If you ask me, your father is feeling responsible for taking care of the ageing parents in Nepal but he is split because he must also take care of his family (ie, you and bhai).   One of my dad's close friends returned to Nepal for this exact reason in his 60's and left his kids in the US because they have the capacity to be independent. My parents have said that they will follow us because we are the next generation and they will become the grandparents.",

They are trying to take over the world, and after a thousand years of that, Jesus will come back. Which is also how Christianity was used to justify imperialism back in the day.

There is also a popular \"prosperity gospel\" which is a distortion of the bible and has given Christianity a bad reputation.   Onto the 'why, what benefit would the normal christians get from me converting to Christianity': The fundamental reason is that the bible says we all have sinned against God (Romans 3:23), doing the things we knew were evil. Now, compared to Hinduism which has a karma system, Christianity has a justice-grace system that is more tied to how courts work, which requires for punishment of sins/crimes and makes the sacrifice of Jesus necessary.¬† Thus, those who believe it to be true want to make it known to others for belief that it will save their souls.",

Not only math, but other subject like graphics or anything that needs numbers|||I see people recommending beginners start with low level languages. Honestly, that's only realistic if you have insane discipline. Those suggesting it are forgetting what it's like to be a complete beginner, they're just projecting their current knowledge onto you.  In a world full of distraction like now, starting with something boring takes extraordinary discipline and I wouldn't trust myself with that.  Start with high level languages instead, especially something visual like web development. Learn html, css, js,  you'll actually see what you're building, which is much more fun.  Once you've got the basics down, set up a proper dev environment. Your desk, theme, and editor actually matter. There are phases where coding gets boring sometimes and having a setup you love makes it easier to show up. When you need a break, customize your theme or tweak your workspace. Then jump back into coding. Repeat this cycle forever.|||would have done Law instead.|||First year: Take C programming very seriously, learn web basics like html,css,js Second year: Do leetcode exercises while studying DSA so that I actually get what I study, learn FE frameworks basics like React.

Learn cloud, containerization, application monitoring.  Btw, if you are disciplined enough, don't waste 4 yrs of cs,    you can learn the above stuffs in around 1.5-2yrs if you push yourself reguraly,   you probably won't be able to follow through all the stuffs i've mentioned due to time/energy constraint while doing cs stuff. 80-90% cs stuff is absolute bullshit(outdated, non-marketable, non-comprehensible, trivial), you'll regret joining cs after couple of years,   bookmark this comment.|||There is no perfect roadmap  Explore gara.

Then proceed to ML with some Python programming.|||I saw many comments with their take on starting with low level programming, and some argue against it. But I think it really depends on what programming means to you. If you feel cs is just writing code in a company or making aandha paisa, then definitely you should learn those things that will land you a job faster, and a high level is the best way there. But if you are a person who loves to scratch things and is very enthusiastic about this domain, and you like to explore more, then I would suggest going with low level ( i.e., C programming). I also saw someone saying C feels boring, but that's not the case if you are actually interested and want to learn, not for the sake of others or to find a job, but because you want to have strong fundamentals in computer science. I learned C as my first programming language, and I didn't learn it in school; I didn't learn the way that schools teach C. If you learn the way school teaches, then it's definitely boring, and you never get to know how deep yet simple the language is, and how fun it can be. The most interesting and fun days of my programming career were those when I was doing low level programming. I am not saying you can't have fun solving problems in high-level languages, but i feel when you move towards the corporate world or you do something you love as a career/work for others, then I don't think it still sparks in your face. I am not saying you can't enjoy it, many people do actually enjoy it very much, but I find it draining, and THAT'S A PERSONAL VIEW|||First of all, what is your goal? Cs can be broad.   My suggestion is just as I would have done it if I could go back in the past. My main focus would be to clarify my goal and work my way up from there. Since I read your other comments and I am assuming that you want to be a developer and you are completely fresh:  1. My first priority would be to understand the database. This is where it all starts and ends. If you understand the in and out of database you will have an easier time developing a software.  2. I would study every major aspect of OOP + file handling. My go to language would be C/C++. No need to worry about which one to choose. You're less likely to use it in your development career unless you're a software engineer or a game developer.  3. I would learn javascript and css by heart. I would not listen to anyone saying otherwise. This has been a lifesaver for me for more than I can count my fingers in my hands. 4. As soon as I understand OOP, I would jump into studying python  (you can choose your own backend coding).  5. Finally, I would start with my small full stack project. My focus would be on how to connect the database to the business logic. (For example a personal finance tracker, music tracker, all in one basic tool I keep searching for online otherwise etc.) In this process I would study the logic, crud, api (ajax, hook etc), token, session, cookies etc.  6. Create a fine documentation of all the steps I took to create my personal project including mistakes and solutions.  7. A proper manual of my software. (Start now because you will need to be best at it if you want to market your software later in your life.) 8. I would keep in my mind that there are best of the best out there and keep my ego in check. Go back to basics as many times as I require. I wouldn't look down on others or stop learning from them. 7. Last but not the least, I would take care of my health. Especially my brain, back and eyes. If you want to become smart, you need to learn to give yourself a break.   I can't go into more details here but I hope it helps. Happy learning and best of luck!  Edit: git! Forgot to add it. Study from early on.|||Lean AI & ML.

I managed to grow an Instagram page in the entertainment and infotainment niche to over 55K followers, and even built a small SaaS website for my audience. I was really excited to try something new, but after losing $10 on a domain, I had to pause it for now. Still, it was a fun project and I learned a lot from it.  As a content creator, I don‚Äôt think I wasted my time at all. I got hands-on experience with Canva, video editing, and engaging with my audience. I even collaborated with an app (though I didn‚Äôt get paid), but it helped me understand how brand deals work. Later, I built and deployed a subscription-based website but never launched it because I doubted if anyone would actually pay for it.  I also tried posting on Facebook as i was eligible for monetization, but things didn‚Äôt go as expected. None of my 25‚Äì30 posts or reels even crossed 100 views, and more than half got copyright claims. It was a bit frustrating, especially since I was used to getting 8‚Äì53 million monthly views on Instagram.  Now I‚Äôm just looking for a job where I can use the skills I‚Äôve learned: content creation, photo and video editing, Canva, social media growth, content strategy, and web development. I‚Äôve learned how to understand audience behavior, spot trends early, and manage online communities, and I‚Äôm excited to bring all that experience into a real job.",

Yes this is ai generated for proper english and summarization.     Google **discovered** my pages but **wouldn‚Äôt index** them. After some digging, here‚Äôs what I found and how I fixed it.    # üí• The Problems  1. **404s on deep links** ‚Äì `/blog/post` returns 404 because GitHub Pages only serves static files. 2. **Empty HTML for crawlers** ‚Äì SPA loads `<div id=\"root\"></div>` first, no content. 3. **Bad meta tags** ‚Äì my build still used `localhost` URLs.  # üß© My Solution  Couldn‚Äôt use `react-snap` (React 19 issues), so I wrote a custom pre-rendering pipeline.  **Stack:** React 19 + Vite 7 + Puppeteer 24 + GitHub Pages  **Key steps**  * **404.html redirect hack:** custom file that redirects `/blog/post` ‚Üí `/?redirect=/blog/post`, React then restores the route with `history.replaceState`. * **Puppeteer pre-rendering:** after build, launches a headless browser, visits each route, waits for render, saves full HTML to `dist/blog/{slug}/index.html`. * **Auto sitemap:** built from my blog data array.  **Build pipeline:**      npm run deploy     ‚Üí vite build     ‚Üí puppeteer pre-render (13 routes ‚âà30 s)     ‚Üí generate sitemap     ‚Üí gh-pages -d dist       # ‚úÖ Results  * Every page now has full HTML before hydration * Google shows ‚ÄúPage can be indexed‚Äù * Deep links work (no 404s) * Correct canonical + OG tags * 13 routes built in \\~30 s  # üîç What I‚Äôm Asking  1. **Scaling:** Pre-render is sequential (2‚Äì3 s / route). Ideas for parallel or incremental builds? 2. **Content storage:** Posts currently in one JS array ‚Äî split JSON per post or use a CMS? 3. **Approach:** Is Puppeteer pre-rendering worth it vs moving to Next.js / Remix? 4. **SEO:** What else should I add beyond sitemap + OG + canonical + JSON-LD?",

Until equality starts at home, culture is just convenient for men.|||*labour playing*  The world runs on women's unpaid labour. We women have grown up seeing our mom, grandmother do endless domestic, emotional labour---all normalized, all unknowledged. Unpaid Labour has been institutionalized in ways that exploit women in the name of love, duty and family. Our mothers really deserved better. And yes marriage is a scam for women. I call marriage a sexist propaganda. And ofc, not all marriages are oppressive today, but the institutional structure and history of marriage remains deeply patriarchal.|||It is not only in Nepal.

The demand is at its peak at these times from wives and children. Designer bag, expensive shoes and clothes, jewellery, gifts, dakchina, among other stuff that almost feels unnecessary. Now don't come at me saying, \"it doesn't happen in my family\". Sure some families may be an exception (my own is an exception but then my home also divides work before major events to keep it manageable) but I have yet to see such  other families where women put the money upfront for anything required for home, especially the expensive ones before complaining about their work they have to put into their own home for their own family.

I don‚Äôt know the exact philosophy of the religion or the teachings of the Quran, but based on what I see in many Islamic countries and among some Muslim communities, Islam is the most violent and intolerant religion in the world. Muslims struggle to coexist peacefully with other religions and never accept religious diversity (The same case with the Nepali Converted Chsitian, they cannot accept the Hindus and Hindus festival whereas those Foreigner who have been practicing Christianity since Century do no have any Obligation to celebrate and take part in different festival and celebration of different religion)**  In many non-Muslim majority countries, Islam is allowed to grow and Muslims are free to practice their religion. But in many Islamic-majority countries, the population of other religions often declines over time, sometimes due to violence, forced conversions, or systemic discrimination. For example, just look at the religious demographics of Pakistan 40‚Äì50 years ago compared to today.  In Europe and North America, Muslims frequently protest and express their views against the Ruling people and religion too, often quite aggressively. But can you imagine Hindus, Christians, or Buddhists openly protesting against Islamic leaders or Islamic policies in Islamic countries? It would likely result in severe consequences or violence.  In Nepal too, while Muslims may seem peaceful now, it‚Äôs worth noting that the long-settled Muslim communities (who have been here since the time of Prithvi Narayan Shah, when they were brought in for weapon-making and other skilled work) have generally coexisted peacefully. However, the more recent or growing Muslim population seems peaceful possibly only because they are still a very small minority.¬† Lets jus see if their population ever reaches 10‚Äì15%, there could be a rise in communal tensions or violence.  **This is not a hate-filled statement, just an observation based on patterns seen in various parts of the world. I am expressing what I see and fear, based on history and current events.**|||Finally someone makes sense.  RESITANCE DOESN'T MEAN KILLING INNOCENT PEOPLE. Islamists will only play the victim card in a place where they are in the minority. Look at the situation of minorites in Pakistan and Bangladesh and you'll know why Indians are afraid of the rapid influx of illegal Muslims .

Kids who didn't chose to be Muslim. Noone is born religious without it being labeled or forced. They have done nothing wrong. Women are tormented and suppressed by religion.

That doesn't surprise me at all though especially because of the covert (and sometimes even overt) backing - financially, logistically, militarily, intelligence, etc. - those terrorist groups receive from some nations - especially (but certainly not limited to) the US and Israel.  In short, the lack of coverage isn‚Äôt just neglect, it‚Äôs structural. It reflects editorial priorities shaped by political alliances, audience demand, and the need to protect state narratives.|||Well, I am a straight right leaning Christian. What Isreal's government has been doing to Palestinians since 2020, is objectively a genocide, and we Americans are tired of funding their war efforts, heck we don't feed the impoverished and homeless here in the states, but we can fund a stupid war? Both sides are wrong, Hamas and Isreal's government. Both should be brought to justice, and both need to give us our damn money back.   Listen up, over 50k innocent Palestanians have died, mainly women and children, they didn't deserve that. The people on Oct 7 didn't deserve that either. Screw Hamas, and screw Netanyanhu.

One advice that always resounded to me by a friend was \"So you think life's unfair? There's people that haven't been a kilometer within to a chau chau wrapper. So next time you resort to it, learn to put your head down, and look for that light in the end of the tunnel\". I'm afraid I'm in no position to type in devnagiri, but it sounded even more rousing in Nepali.  Your mileage may vary. But acknowledging you have a chance to make something out of yourself is concrete, palpable, and actionable.  Make no mistake, I hate mincing words: when depressed, remember all the lives that are designated to a mere existence, not the ones that thrive. It'll remind you to be motivated enough to put yourself out of that circumstance.  Here's an advice: Get to a point where you're able to self sustain. Sure, the few years are going to suck, but you'll be happier. Move out of there asap.|||There are people who actually read it all. Leave it be such comments. Rant here often and vent it out , take advice  If it's the environment that's toxic to you , you have no option but to have acceptance of it being such and then changing the very environment is the only way you can thrive again in life .  You have to find the way out . Make the change . Be determined.  The darkness and spiral of depressive mind will try to bring things down but you have to be stronger than that. There is no other way .

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can‚Äôt get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it. You can hear the news for development work and of NEA cannot cut down the trees easily, yup that is because of same strong protective law.|||It‚Äôs because of movement of people and reliance on gas, concrete instead of timber.|||No , it‚Äôs a result of migration of people from hills to concentrated cities and Terai .

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts. So, yeah definitely a result of afforestation but there is more to this and would be a great topic to delve deep into.|||what about terai ko char koshe jhadi?|||It‚Äôs meant to highlight the loss of ice and glaciers.

No confirmed sighting.   No verified proof of life.   No closure.      Two years have passed; two years of waiting, diplomatic efforts, and hope refusing to fade.      Today, reports have emerged suggesting he may no longer be alive.   But even now, there is no definitive evidence; only assessments, assumptions, and silence.      His family still holds on.   Nepal still waits.   And many of us wonder: how different might things have been?      If Bipin were from a more powerful nation, would the world have moved faster?   If he held a different passport, would there be answers by now?   If every life were valued equal, would this post even need to exist?      Bipin‚Äôs story is not just one of tragedy.

They called the ‚Äúearn and learn‚Äù program an internship, likely just to bypass foreign employment laws. In reality, it was pure exploitation. From what I‚Äôve read, students were made to work five days a week in questionable conditions and study only one. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.  I just hope this changes with the new government.|||i thought hamas was fighting gaza right after they kill him i think they just sick isreal PM both are shit they just want control people.. fucking hate hamas|||Sad|||I'm Israeli, sadly his DNA was diagnosed and was believed to die in the first months of the war R.I.P Bipin|||Vayo vayo pugyo,  He is dead, confirmed by Israel and hamas both.

In very rare, exceptional cases, NTC may have options for extremely large accidental top-ups, though the taxes already paid to the government make a full reversal highly complex. * **Attempt a formal complaint through the digital wallet:**¬†If they used a digital wallet like eSewa or Khalti, they should file a complaint with that wallet provider. These wallets can act as intermediaries and request a reversal from¬†[Nepal Telecom](https://www.ntc.net.np/), though ultimately, NTC controls the outcome.¬†  Long-term strategies for using the balance  Since a refund is almost certainly not an option, the best approach is to recover the value over time by converting the credit back into cash.  * **Offer balance transfers to friends and family:**¬†The¬†Reddit user¬†can offer to transfer balance to friends and family in exchange for cash. This is a common and reliable method of liquidating NTC balance.    * **Balance transfer limits:**¬†NTC allows up to 20 transfers per day, with a maximum of Rs. 500 per transfer.    * **Execution:**¬†They can use the NTC mobile app or the USSD code¬†`*422*SecurityCode*RecipientNumber*Amount#`¬†to initiate transfers. * **Offer mobile top-ups in the local community:**¬†For people who prefer cash transactions, the user can act as an unofficial recharge agent. They can offer to top up people's phones in exchange for cash, perhaps at a small discount to incentivize the transaction. * **Bundle and sell discounted packages:**¬†The user can purchase various voice, data, and SMS packs offered by NTC and resell them to others at a discounted rate. For example, they could buy a large 28-day data pack with a market value of Rs. 999 and sell it to someone for a reduced cash price. * **Use the balance for services and bills:**¬†The user can offer to pay for other people's utility bills that can be settled via an NTC number and accept cash in return. This could include things like landline or internet service bills if NTC provides them.¬†  Warning for the Reddit user  * **Scams:**¬†Advise the user to be very cautious about offers from strangers promising to buy the balance or provide a refund. They should only perform transactions with people they know and trust to avoid losing the balance without getting paid. * **Security code:**¬†The NTC security code for balance transfers is like a bank PIN and should never be shared with anyone. The user must perform all transfers themselves.¬†|||Chora chori thula vayinjel samma balance halna parena aba..üòù|||1xbet money.|||I have seen such thing alot of times I don't think now they did it mistakenly.

You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can‚Äôt get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

            "comments": "my suggestion would be that stop expecting everything from teachers in 11 and 12 and figure out what way of study suits you the best because if you are reliant on your teachers for every study resources then you'll get in trouble in bachelors or forward because here teachers  dont even give a shit if there sound is audible let alone good lectures i left relying on teachers in my 11 12 days because all of our clz teachers were shit and had to self study every chapter. if you are in 11 theres a high chance that you are yet to figure out your true study method. for me reading book line by line worked the best and i reckon this is the most optimal way to study as it not only helps you cover everything on your sylbs but also prepares you for high intensity study environment which is very essential for higher level studies..and if you're not understanding mechanics then there's a high chance that you're not willing to learn mechanics because it is the portion of  physics where you can follow everything intuitively and is most interesting one so try to learn it conceptually relating it to real life stuffs. as for yt channel ig physics wallah will be good but there will be a lot of things which are not in our course.. however you can try and learn yourself by reading books and if you dont understand any sentence then you can use chat gpt to crack it down ..and a free tip., understand derivations very effectively like every line and term, why and how they are there because if you do so you'll be able to solve every numerical, and also solve as much mcqs and numericals as you can|||Royera|||do past papers|||Hello u/Swiss_16, thank you for contributing to r/NepalPlusTwo.

The funding that has been availed through Carbon Purchase as well as NGOs and INGOs have also played a critical role. I don't remember exactly, but UNDP or something published a really great report on the success of community forests and improvement of forested areas in Nepal.   Actually Nepal despite everything and has had excellent metrics when it comes to nature and biodiversity conservation.|||Folks who grew up in the 90s may remember efforts put into forest conservation through media.

Impressionable ads like an old woman carrying doko vari ko daura and wondering ‚ÄúAja lai ta taryo voli k garne?‚Äù We have done a lot in the field of forest and wildlife conservation.

Hamro Community based Forest Preservation program (Samudayik Bann) is a leading example in the world.|||\"Hariyo ban Nepal ko dhan\" massive initiative is Main reason. This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it. You can hear the news for development work and of NEA cannot cut down the trees easily, yup that is because of same strong protective law.|||It‚Äôs because of movement of people and reliance on gas, concrete instead of timber.|||No , it‚Äôs a result of migration of people from hills to concentrated cities and Terai .

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts. So, yeah definitely a result of afforestation but there is more to this and would be a great topic to delve deep into.|||what about terai ko char koshe jhadi?|||It‚Äôs meant to highlight the loss of ice and glaciers.

I searched some more on YouTube and this man has been actively saying nothing but 'my home village' and 'my country Nepal'.  His love for this nation is second to none. Even after how he has been treated by everyone including myself. Even I never bother to search online about him.  Everyone in Nepal like me need to apologize to Dr.Mahabir Pun.  His quote,\"There comes a difficult time, unusual situation that people usually don't need to go through. In that situation it is necessary to have uncommon faith and uncommon approaches to face the uncommon odds of human life.\" from the same video of graduation speech. It will never leave my brain. This man said those words on 2007 and lived by it. His uncommon faith and uncommon approaches has definitely made huge impact on me today. And hoping Nepal will follow his will of uncommon faith and uncommon approaches to face the uncommon odds of human life.

            "body": "My house was vandalized in the name of \"Gen z protest.\" My dad is a civil servant, and we live in a humble 3 story house (the third story was only recently built). It was a small house when we moved in, which was 17 years ago‚Äî few months after I was born.   After working for over 25+ years for the government, this country, and its public, my dad still has a very clear history. No bribery, no corruption, no money laundering‚Äî nothing. Rising high in status and the post, he is recognized for his diligent work and highly stable work ethic.  Now, back to the present. The protestors had reached our house. I had once thought, why would anyone target our house? It's a civil servant, not some minister or anything of that sort. My father rose high due to his hard work and competitiveness, not any connection or bribery. We can all see from how my parents lived rental first (he was already a civil servant then). Only after a few months of me being born did they buy a house, not without taking loans.  I don't know why it happened because our house was aba and definitely not supposed to be a part of whatever that was. The protestors were going to burn our house, but because of it being attached to other houses, the neighbours finally calmed them down into not burning our house. Instead, they burned our bikes, went into our house, and threw things out to burn them. What's worse? When the protestors left, all the people living nearby, went in and out for 2 days straight‚Äî morning, day and night, pickng whatever things they liked amd taking it home with them as if our house was some kind of thrift store giving away our stuff for free.  We were at our relative's house, and when we saw all the black smoke coming from the direction of our house, we were devastated. \"Our house got burnt.\" That's what we thought. As i was the oldest child in the family, i couldn't let myself break down. I can still hear those devastating gut-wrenching cries and sobs from my mom, haunting me like a ghost every time i close my eyes.   I am a college student. My uniform is gone, and so are my books and copies. My sister is in middle school. Her uniform and books and copies are nowhere to be found as well.   Our money and jewelries, of course, are gone too. The same money my father earned and mind you, a civil servant's earnings isn't much. Only enough to label us as a middle-class family. The same money my sister sent us, her hard-working money(which was in dollars at that).  Our clothes, bags, and even utensils are gone, and so are our food storage(stuff). My mom is someone who saves money. However, she can just like my dad because she knows she has experienced the hardships with my dad. Because they know. Because they have experienced hardships and complications in their life. Because they have faced obstacles.  We have never wore any designers, no luxury fashion brand. All are affordable and comfortable. The only designer my mom and dad ever even had is when my big sister from abroad visited us and surprised us with some designer bags (which she also got scolded for spending so much because she is still studying and working in between only).  Our guests'clothes, laptops, phones, everything is gone. Me and my sisters' savings and my mom's little spending for managing our household‚Äî nothing is left. Not even our puja ko thaan(a small place we had to worship and pray gods).   We have tons of debts. I am old enough to learn that by now. Now that our house was totally and utterly robbed and vandalized while my dad kept on working for the same public, we have nowhere to sleep on. No clothes to wear. There is no place to shower or bathe.  We had to hide away from our own house we once called home to keep ourselves alive. My father was lucky enough to be safe because if it was even a few seconds late, it would have all been over. We were fortunate to be alive, even though we had done nothing wrong to people.  Morality? Humanity? Conscience? Guilt? Remorse? None. The same people, the same public, that my dad is working so hard to serve with his whole heart, has done this to him, to his family.  Gen z, huh? Protest against corruption, huh? My dad, having the cleanest history‚Äî no corruption, bribery, connection, whatsoever. So why our house? Why? What had we ever done to them? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.   I have no hope left. None for this country, none for the people of this country. This is now a country full of robbers and thieves. Humans are jealous. Humans are greedy. People are full of themselves, full of greediness and selfishness. In my heart, humans are creatures who have ruined any hope for more in me and my family. My father, who once poured his heart for this country and the people in this country, is on the verge of giving up on it.  You people, opportunists, and robbers who call yourselves voice of justice‚Äî I'll be watching, watching who you are going to tame to pull this country back together. People like my dad who are so wronged will be out of all this mess soon, Who are you going to pull to patch this broken country? I'll be watching. I'll be happily watching everything crumble and fall apart with your \"justice.\" You have given the opportunists a sense of win. You've let them think anything is possible, and now, everything will fall apart while you watch everything crumble in front of your eyes.  Lastly, I'd like to be a little vulgar and uncensored. If you are uncomfortable, scroll away.  Whoever has participated in vandalizing my house and robbing it empty‚Äî You are going to see hell and worse. I hope you feel yourself rotting away. I hope you don't think it's over now because whatever you stole, it will haunt you for the rest of your life and afterwards. I will forever haunt you, even in your dreams, converting it into a disastrous nightmare. You'll see hell. You are going to suffer.  [Edit: I never expected this post to gain so many views. I‚Äôm very grateful to those who are wishing me and my family well, thank you very much for that. And I also understand those who might raise an eyebrow on this post and not believe in my words. It‚Äôs up to you, whether you want to believe me or not. I have no intention of forcing it on you.   I‚Äôd also like to request anyone who knows me through this post to maintain my privacy and not reveal anything about me or my family on the internet(please refrain any stalker behavior). I have never gone public like this and I also don‚Äôt like the attention this is getting(makes me uncomfortable) but I‚Äôm going to keep this post so other people who have experienced something like this can be open about it here. Let this be a safe space for those to speak up.]",

We are still finger pointing everyone we hate.   We still haven't learnt anything. There are thousands of civil servants, like your dad, working tirelessly behind the scenes to make this country great. Hats off to your dad.   We, Nepali, are greedy, anyone succeeds in life or does something for themselves we accuse them of shady things all the sudden.   Hopefully the future won't be dark like the few weeks for you was. ü´°|||I know this will be an unpopular opinion, but I feel the Gen Z protest got out of control.  While this was an absolutely needed protest and it did bring much-needed attention and change, we also can‚Äôt deny the darker side of it. While the deaths of innocent people rightfully shook everyone and fueled the anger, more innocent lives were lost in the chaos that followed.  Gen Z cannot ignore the fact that others died in fires, or that people were looted and harmed during the unrest. It‚Äôs easy to say the movement was hijacked by goons, but the videos and reports show some protesters themselves vandalizing property and stealing from people who had nothing to do with the issue. Ironically, those who stood up against corruption ended up damaging the lives and livelihoods of ordinary citizens.   Those responsible should be held accountable for it!!!   My heart goes out to you for your loss. Please know you and your family are welcome to stay with us until you find a place to rebuild. Destiny will open new doors for you. Your family will rise again and rebuild everything you‚Äôve lost. Wishing you strength, courage, and healingüôè|||Any CCTV footage? Do you know who started it?

The moment I condemn their brutality, they rush to label me as ‚Äújholay,‚Äù as if that insult could erase their own guilt. Their selective outrage is sickening.

They are just normal people who don't want to see more unemployment and rising prices due to an influx of people. The blame, however, should go directly to the bureaucrats and the big businesses of Australia who are exploiting the immigrants and its laws by hiring cheap wages.|||I am Australian and play tennis with some wonderful Nepalis. They are lovely people and one, a Sherpa from Salleri, has become a good friend.

Do visit when free.|||Thankyou so much(x5) for your kind and warm words. Do visit Nepal, it's beautiful and safe <333.  Much love to you all Aussies too.|||Appreciate it mate|||Thanks for your kind appreciation. Let me tell you our Nepalese perspective.  As a Nepalese, it's really tough for us to enter Australia, first you must pass at least high school with good marks, then get a really good English test score, then you must show a significant bank balance, so your immigration policy is already filtering only the best people from other countries.   I am a Engineer myself, it's relatively easy for someone like me to immegrate to Australia, but for students of other field, you're immigration policy already make sure only the best students come in your country, and it should be that way to be honest.   Regarding your immigration issue, well I believe any country should only allow immigration if there is net positive for the country, you don't want a bunch of liabilities to come in your country, right??  So, just look at the data, you can very easily find out what communities are contributing to Australia, and what communities are hampering the country, and simply adjust the policies that way, it's really that simple.   Regarding recent protests against Immigration, well I think that's just the coverup done by the rich and elites to brainwash common Aussies so that the blame is shifted towards immigration when in fact Australia has the best immigration compared to many Western countries.   My cousin recently returned back to Nepal, they lived in Melbourne for almost 10 years, they shared the economy isn't doing great compared to past years, and the blame is being shifted solely towards immigration.|||U will be welcomed here in Nepal.

Always up for a good yarn whenever I bump into someone from Nepal.  I know we‚Äôve had a few grumpy old conservatives carrying on about immigration lately, but honestly, most young Aussies don‚Äôt reckon like that at all. From my point of view ‚Äì and from any fair-dinkum Aussie ‚Äì you‚Äôre more than welcome here. Nepalese folks add heaps of value to this country, and I hope that continues.  One day I‚Äôd love to visit Nepal once things settle down there. And mate, your food ‚Äì wow! I could eat momos every day, no worries.|||Can y'all please recommend your fav momo place?

But to be in the situation is already a failure. We already failed when there was a situation to choose between life and property. The situation shouldn't have arisen at the first place. And the army doesn't have all the blame to take. Lord knows what security council was busy in. What purpose does a security council serve if it cannot hold a meeting in emergency. Nepal army was already very cautious by what happened in 23rd and also long while back during maoist insurgency. It was a huge security failure to not be able to mobilise the army at the right time, which the army cannot do on its own.

And avoid eating food with garlic, onion like lot ... mild amount won't be cause body odour.

This affectes every country in south Asia including Nepal. That's a problem we should solve. IT's gradually under control I guess.|||Google Bangladesh. And let me know if you found the answer|||Don‚Äôt look up bangladesh/australia. Nepal has average population density.|||Population in SE Asia seems to be quite high in general. I think regarding your question about where the population is concentrated, you will find that the population is scattered throughout the country - everywhere minus above 3000m up the himalayas. Then if you do a deep assessment what % of Perus Land actually has people vs % of Nepal where people reside, you may find the two land sizes may not be off by a magnitude like now when you compare the full size of the country. For eg UK has a landmass of 250k but has a population of 69 mil. That's 2x population of Peru in 1/5th of land. In the other hand australia has a population of 27mil in 7.7mil km2. Russia has 143mil people in 17mil km2 (4x Pop of Peru in 16x land area).  You are also looking at the mercader projection which further makes Nepal look more visually small in the map. Not that it should have any basis when you talk about numbers.   I suppose what I am trying to say is the population may still be high in Nepal but it may not be as high as you think when you factor in livable land in the country. Total land mass alone is not a great indicator.|||Fertile land, fertile people, most are on terai belt. Look at india and bangladesh, how densely populated they all are.

It calculated on a flat, two-dimensional plane, not by measuring the surface area of its mountains, hills, and valleys. The total land area of a country is determined by projecting its borders onto a standardized reference surface, typically an ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the Earth.      Nepal is roughly a \\~1000 km long, and 150 km wide and so the approximate area of 150 sq km.   Now if you count the mountains and valleys that covers like 70% of that 2D area, the actual habitable space is order of magnitide larger. maybe even 50x.   So the actual living space is quite a lot for mountainous country like Nepal. I would imagine same for Peru.|||You know about canada?|||You should have started with Bangladesh and it's population density.  Regardless, depends on how fertile and navigable the lands are.

With all due respect to Sumana, she's a much needed breath of fresh air in Nepali politics, I have to disagree with her on one major thing.  She says Rabi needs to step down as RSP leader because she thinks that the best interest of the party and that's what people/youths want. That's where I think she's misunderstood and wrong.  From genZ upto the aged ones, most of them want Rabi in the leadership. That's why he got the highest number of votes among all leaders in the last election.  What I think is that Sumana saw many youth social media activists, who doesn't know politics and are misinformed and those who doesn't represent the overall youths of Nepal at all, they made video saying \"we don't want Rabi\", \"he's same old, corrupt\" which led to Sumana thinking Rabi isn't wanted by current youths and she need to get out of that party to be the voice of the youths.|||Good going on",

There is an all time high chances of happening **Civil War in Nepal** now. Prachandra is the master mind in this game. He knows how to do these games by collecting all political parties.

It's our duty to keep ourselves informed and not to falls for all the bullshit. Remember the cost paid before and during the revolution and be vigilant. Most of all, register and VOTE.|||No, we should be thankful that we have overcome the first step of political crisis. Yes, at the time constitution's word by word wasn't matched for forming government. But President did form the govt and dissolve by abiding with the constitution. And not anybody was appointed. The former Chief Justice was appointed, who , even by the position, is supposed to be the most learned of the laws worldwide and Nepal. The only bad is that we have an interim government, but the election date has been fixed and we should in anyway possible make the election successful, even if the interim government fails to do any other thing beside that. Cuz having a parliament is very very necessary brother. Good governance, Corruption control and investigation, all can come in time being, but the democratic, free, and sovereign country do need parliament. We may not like the members and representatives there, but for our democracy and peoples sovereignty, parliament must be there. That is the reason, the upper house National Assembly is still there.  I just read the news in BBC that Taliban government shut down all the internet in Afghanistan. And the people have nothing to say there. Already they had girls education completely removed from the country. And in Sudan there is a terrible civil war ongoing, even worse than Ukraine and Gaza, merely because multiple factions within the army and political groups want executive power for themselves. The condition is pathetic there. Just so so sad.  I know Nepali are frustrated with the government. But let's understand one thing, in Nepal our Parliament and legislative is supposed to be more powerful than the other two bodies. If government fails to do as expected, we should elect better party in the Parliament. Moreover, the development is not just duty of Prime Minister and council of ministers. The administration of Nepal also called the permanent government is there to carry out the tasks for governance and development. The political structure, that is PM and council of Ministers are primarily to make the administrative structures accountable and focused to the citizens' need, demand and aspirations.  So, let's not be too emotional and aggressive to the point that we focus too much on executive and not the legislative and parliament. Laws, Constitution, System can only be changed through Parliament only , and that should always be. So please, dear fellow Nepali brothers and sisters, let's help the interim government to function as best as it possibly can and soon have the parliament, and fully constitutionally functioning all three organs of the state: Legislative, Executive, and Judiciary. Let's participate in the election with joy and hope, and elect the best, if not, the best among the worst, and bring the country into running and stability. Please. This is not the time to fight amongst each other. We need to be united as one Nepali in this so vulnerable time. We will not have a country man, if we keep on fighting and not helping the interim government. Let's elect our representatives in Falgun 21, and do fighting then after. Making the representatives accountable, pressuring them to amend as per our choice through peaceful protest, signature campaign. But for the few coming months till election, let's be optimistic and help each other in family, friends, and communities to participate and be excited for election. We will only have a country, if we can keep it. A country needs the parliament. It is the soul. Executive helps develop, provide security. But the source of our sovereignty, our say in the nation, is through our representative in parliament. How much we want to fight now, let's fight in the parliament. Parliament is literally a place to hear each other, discuss and debate. Let's be fully focused in electing our favored representative and , in bad case best amongst worst, for now please guyss.|||The cleanest and the only way GenZ can get out of this is to win the election by a massive landslide  Parties haru khatisakey.

In very rare, exceptional cases, NTC may have options for extremely large accidental top-ups, though the taxes already paid to the government make a full reversal highly complex. * **Attempt a formal complaint through the digital wallet:**¬†If they used a digital wallet like eSewa or Khalti, they should file a complaint with that wallet provider. These wallets can act as intermediaries and request a reversal from¬†[Nepal Telecom](https://www.ntc.net.np/), though ultimately, NTC controls the outcome.¬†  Long-term strategies for using the balance  Since a refund is almost certainly not an option, the best approach is to recover the value over time by converting the credit back into cash.  * **Offer balance transfers to friends and family:**¬†The¬†Reddit user¬†can offer to transfer balance to friends and family in exchange for cash. This is a common and reliable method of liquidating NTC balance.    * **Balance transfer limits:**¬†NTC allows up to 20 transfers per day, with a maximum of Rs. 500 per transfer.    * **Execution:**¬†They can use the NTC mobile app or the USSD code¬†`*422*SecurityCode*RecipientNumber*Amount#`¬†to initiate transfers. * **Offer mobile top-ups in the local community:**¬†For people who prefer cash transactions, the user can act as an unofficial recharge agent. They can offer to top up people's phones in exchange for cash, perhaps at a small discount to incentivize the transaction. * **Bundle and sell discounted packages:**¬†The user can purchase various voice, data, and SMS packs offered by NTC and resell them to others at a discounted rate. For example, they could buy a large 28-day data pack with a market value of Rs. 999 and sell it to someone for a reduced cash price. * **Use the balance for services and bills:**¬†The user can offer to pay for other people's utility bills that can be settled via an NTC number and accept cash in return. This could include things like landline or internet service bills if NTC provides them.¬†  Warning for the Reddit user  * **Scams:**¬†Advise the user to be very cautious about offers from strangers promising to buy the balance or provide a refund. They should only perform transactions with people they know and trust to avoid losing the balance without getting paid. * **Security code:**¬†The NTC security code for balance transfers is like a bank PIN and should never be shared with anyone. The user must perform all transfers themselves.¬†|||Chora chori thula vayinjel samma balance halna parena aba..üòù|||1xbet money.|||I have seen such thing alot of times I don't think now they did it mistakenly.

            "body": "We all know most ISP here lock the router and dont give any access to the web management. As a devops practitioner and someone who is very invested in homelabbing and selfhosting, locked router was my biggest achilles heels.   Requirement: A secondary router, you main router will stop working and secondary router will only work through LAN1 port.   Solution: All you have to do is create a ticket on vianet app stating \"Turn the router into bridge/modem only mode\". Someone will call you back, just ask them username and password for PPPOE and use your secondary router to configure through PPPOE instead of DHCP. Tada!!! you now have full control over your router.   Bonus 1: You can flash openwrt with Luci web interface and you will be able to configure anything you can think of. extra advantage is you can configure mesh routing without needing a special router. I have managed to easily flash it on my Mi router and a old tp link router, search for guides depending on your model or ask Claude or Gpt to search specifically for your router model.   Bonus 2: Vianet gives you globally accessible IPV6. That means you are free from CGNAT. Use this to access your home services without needing any relay like Cloudflare Tunnel or Tailscale VPN. Direct connection means no extra latency and maxed bandwidth and you can use this to host online game servers to play with your friends!! But for some reason Worldlink doesnt connect sometimes. Ncell and ClassicTech seems to have no problem tho. I am not sure if NTC offers IPV6.  Bonus 3: Host a adguard DNS server and configure your openwrt to use it as your default DNS server. This way you will have adblocking for your whole network. Your parents and old grannies wont have to see ads no more (wont work with Youtube app - use revance) and it keeps them safe from online phishing and malwares. You can also set some static ip and adguard to block some websites like gambling and pornography if there are minors in your household.   Disadvantage: The only downside of this is your main router will turn pretty much useless. Internet wont work through wireless and extra ports. So dont forget the vianet tech support to turn off the DHCP and wireless on the main router. Since my secondary router also has 2 ports only I had to invest some money on extra gigabyte switch.   I know some of you will appreciate this so this is my appreciation and giving back to this community. enjoy and have fun!! Happy Dashain!!!

This isn't just about a bad interview, it feels like a deliberate strategy to exploit job seekers for free labor.  I went through **multiple** rounds of interviews over several weeks. Everything seemed promising. The conversations were positive, and they talked about a great fit for their team. Then came the \"final\" task: to design a comprehensive digital marketing campaign.  I spent days on this. I researched their brands, analysed their competitors, and built out a full strategy, complete with campaign ideas, target audiences, content plans, and performance metrics. I treated it like a real, paid project because I genuinely wanted the job and to show my capabilities.  I submitted the work, feeling confident. Then... nothing. Total radio silence. I followed up, but no response. The most infuriating part? The reason given was a flimsy, nonsensical excuse that had nothing to do with the work I submitted.  This isn't an isolated incident. I've heard from others who have gone through the exact same process with them. They get you to design a full campaign, which they can then use or adapt, and then they ghost you or reject you on some silly pretext. It's a blatant exploitation of job seekers' time and skills.  If you're a digital marketer in Nepal and you're considering applying to IMS Group, be warned. This is not a legitimate hiring process. It's a fishing expedition for free campaign ideas. Save your time and your work for a company that respects candidates and values their professional effort.  They were still hiring 2 days ago and I gave the interview 3 months ago.",

I absolutely hate the Google calendar app on my phone. If you need some contributions for the app I can donate via PayPal or direct bank transfer if you are in Nepal.

Wth|||works offline once loaded. that was a great feature.|||atleast has no ads and does not refresh when changing month  unlike hamropatro  W|||Amazing ! Just replaced it with hamro patro. The widget of nepali date is what sold me. The UI looks clean. I like that i can see the previous month and calendar years back but it would be cool if instead of the drop-down it was something else as the drop-down blocks the view of the current calendar and i feel it looks like the design aesthetic with the rest of the app design.   I hope you keep improving and adding new features !|||Tried it. Looks good.   One thing that i felt redundant was the popup layout when seeking other dates. Like when i want to see what is on 3rd Kartik, it opens up a popup therefore blocking the calendar entirely. I have to then close the popup  to seek through the next date. I feel that you could just update the info below the calendar for the selected date instead of the popup.   Makes it easier to seek through the dates.|||whats smarter in this calendar?|||Best!

It‚Äôs really smooth on my iOS. It feels like above 90, probably 120. Also, when adding reminders, can you make it show nepali date as well? I often have to hop between two apps to confirm the Nepali date while adding reminders.  And, can you make the widget also switch between light/dark mode based on my device theme?|||Well the best part of the app is it's minimilastic. Thanks.. üòä|||Loved the widgets more. Less bloat.

Make everyone accountable. Ask questions.|||might be your app lock trying to get your facial data try turning it off|||It seems more like the app is checking for permissions that might be needed in the app, namely to scan QR.|||I just tried logging in mero ma chai bhayena just dashain dhun played|||Ios ma chai photo leko xaina hai just checked|||Qr wala permission ho but this is shady af anyways.|||That's spying mf.

Qr scan garda matra aaune ho, coz teti bella camera use huncha.|||Temporary solution: revoke camera and mic permission and set ask every time.|||Let me explain this from a developer‚Äôs perspective. Every time you run an app, the system checks which permissions have already been granted. The same happens when you open the NIC Asia app. Now, why would NIC Asia need access to your camera? The answer is QR payments. The camera icon you see is most likely a UI feature indicating which hardware or system components (like the camera, location, etc.) are being accessed. iOS has a similar feature, so your phone may show it too.|||Same, just checked (in android)|||Ig that biometric verification is causing that hurdle|||Khichdaina nih bruh|||Proposal chai aba currency digital banaunu khojiraxan..|||Mobile banking applications checks for the permission of the camera on login for biometrics authentication and QR scan function.

Aru bank ko ma dekhayena, nic ma dekhayo|||No worries, I‚Äôve already tested this, nothing is sent to the backend. It has to be tied to the QR feature, because once the app is logged in the whole page is swipe-gesture based. When you swipe left, the camera view for QR is triggered, so it looks like a photo is being taken but it‚Äôs not. They likely initialize and tear down the camera process in the background to speed up access.|||SBL does that too|||Samsung OneUI 7.0 ma ni xina hai yo problem, maybe device specific ho ki.|||They keep logs for the fraud detection, yes almost all the banking systems keep the camera logs while logging in to the account.|||aru ma no yasto hunxa camera ko permission on bhayara ho|||Same thing used to happen in kumari and prime bank mobile app, I noticed as I used to turn off camera from the software so any app that needs camera would ask first, but for some reason as soon as I logged in those 2 apps asked to open camera and mic settings, but as of recently it seems to be fixed|||Your account might be hacked!!many of peoples' don't know shit..which is why iphone is too good for protection of ur account..if yu using Android then for sure you are on watch..

In the case absent such a request, the festival expense shall be provided at the time of Dashain festival every year.  37(3): A labor who has not completed one year of service period on or before the day of payment of the festival expense shall be entitled to such expense in proportion to the period of service he or she has completed.   ‡§¶‡§´‡§æ ‡•©‡•≠: ‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§°‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ ‡§ñ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ö ‡§™‡§æ‡§â‡§®‡•á  ‡•©‡•≠(‡•ß): ‡§Ü‡§´‡•ç‡§®‡•ã ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ, ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§ø ‡§§‡§•‡§æ ‡§™‡§∞‡§Æ‡•ç‡§™‡§∞‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å‡§∏‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡§®‡§æ‡§á‡§®‡•á ‡§ö‡§æ‡§°‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§≤‡§æ‡§ó‡§ø ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§ï ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡§ø‡§ï‡§≤‡•á ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§à‡§™‡§æ‡§à ‡§Ü‡§è‡§ï‡•ã ‡§è‡§ï ‡§Æ‡§π‡§ø‡§®‡§æ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§Ü‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§ ‡§™‡§æ‡§∞‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡§ø‡§ï ‡§¨‡§∞‡§æ‡§¨‡§∞‡§ï‡•ã ‡§∞‡§ï‡§Æ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§ï ‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§∑ ‡§ö‡§æ‡§°‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ ‡§ñ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ö‡§ï‡•ã ‡§∞‡•Ç‡§™‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§™‡§æ‡§â‡§®‡•á‡§õ ‡•§  ‡•©‡•≠(‡•®): ‡§â‡§™‡§¶‡§´‡§æ (‡•ß) ‡§¨‡§Æ‡•ã‡§ú‡§ø‡§Æ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ö‡§æ‡§°‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ ‡§ñ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ö ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡§ø‡§ï‡§≤‡•á ‡§è‡§ï ‡§Ü‡§∞‡•ç‡§•‡§ø‡§ï ‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§∑‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§è‡§ï‡§™‡§ü‡§ï ‡§Ü‡§´‡•ç‡§®‡•ã ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ, ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§ø, ‡§™‡§∞‡§Æ‡•ç‡§™‡§∞‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å‡§∏‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡§®‡§æ‡§á‡§®‡•á ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ñ‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§ö‡§æ‡§°‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§Ö‡§µ‡§∏‡§∞‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§≠‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä ‡§≤‡§ø‡§® ‡§∞‡•ã‡§ú‡§ó‡§æ‡§∞‡§¶‡§æ‡§§‡§æ ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑ ‡§≤‡§ø‡§ñ‡§ø‡§§ ‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å‡§∞‡•ã‡§ß ‡§ó‡§∞‡•ç‡§® ‡§∏‡§ï‡•ç‡§®‡•á‡§õ ‡•§ ‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•ã ‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å‡§∞‡•ã‡§ß ‡§®‡§ó‡§∞‡•á‡§ï‡•ã ‡§Ö‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§æ‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§ï ‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§∑‡§ï‡•ã ‡§¨‡§°‡§æ‡§¶‡§∂‡•à‡§Ç‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§ö‡§æ‡§°‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ ‡§ñ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ö ‡§≠‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä ‡§¶‡§ø‡§®‡•Å ‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§®‡•á‡§õ ‡•§  ‡•©‡•≠(‡•©): ‡§ö‡§æ‡§°‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ ‡§ñ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ö ‡§≠‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä ‡§¶‡§ø‡§á‡§®‡•á ‡§¶‡§ø‡§®‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Æ‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§è‡§ï ‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§∑ ‡§∏‡•á‡§µ‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§µ‡§ß‡§ø ‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡§æ ‡§®‡§≠‡§è‡§ï‡•ã ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡§ø‡§ï‡§≤‡•á ‡§®‡§ø‡§ú‡§≤‡•á ‡§ó‡§∞‡•á‡§ï‡•ã ‡§∏‡•á‡§µ‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§µ‡§ß‡§ø‡§ï‡•ã ‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å‡§™‡§æ‡§§‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§ö‡§æ‡§°‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ ‡§ñ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ö ‡§™‡§æ‡§â‡§®‡•á‡§õ ‡•§|||Yes it should be but muji conpany le regular monthy salary nai deko chaina.

Company/employee performance base ma chai company profit bonus ho dine which is not mandatory and depends on the prodfit.|||Even if you haven‚Äôt completed full year, the company should give as per the months you have worked well at least the companies I worked for used to give tesari but Nepal ko companies haru ali chor cha so na dina ni ber chaina|||Hamro ma chai 1 year complete vaye pachi matra paucha 1 month ko basic salary|||Yes it's mandatory as per Nepal Labor Act. All organizations must follow this rule else they will be fined and held liable. If your organization or others are not providing festival bonus, you can file a official complaint. Not sure how to do that but I am sure you can get that info very easily.|||It's not a bonus, it's an allowance. Bonus is dependent on company performance, allowance is not. All employees are entitled to the festival allowance. It's not specific to just Dashain and not even called Dashain allowance. If you are not a Hindu or do not celebrate Dashain you can ask the company to provide you the allowance at other times of the year.|||Practically chai  The rationality of giving Dashain bonus is not on projection of years you will work, rather than its on the duration you have worked, so if you have resigned from company and your last day is after festival disbursement, you are eligible to bonus. But if you have your last day before disbursement, sad but company usually don't provide you bonus, this might be due to legal hassle of disbursing after employee is no longer company's employee but anyways it saves company money so they won't. Whereas performance bonus or company bonus or project bonus is different, mostly they are used in reference to each other for disbursement calculation. eg. your performance can be used for calculating how much company's profit bonus you will get, or even for project bonus.  Yes, company do give festival allowance, but they do manage it in optimal way, instead of calling it bonus, they do 13 months of pay coz bonus will deduct flat tax (maybe 25%). With 13 months of pay, you will get it along your yearly tax bracket.  But things might change when employee worked less than 1 year, some company require you to work at least 6 months for any bonus eligibility, some based on number of months worked, some just gives you bonus despite your working month, or some of you can negotiate in advance to get bonus while joining which will override any rule otherwise. So, before you join, make sure you clear this eligibility as this is more based on company.  And some company does this bonus calculation based on basic salary rather than your regular salary, this also needs to be cleared in advance.  My experience so far has been good, it was either based on number of months or full bonus but never had calculation done based on basic salary rather than on regular salary, which I cleared it prior to joining. Also on one company, I did join 3 months prior to Dashain and asked for full bonus during negotiation which they agreed and received accordingly. The reason I put forward was, as I was eligible to Dashain bonus on company which I was leaving, I would either have joining date after Dashain or join earlier and receive bonus.|||Is this only for Nepali companies or foreign branches Nepali company too?|||Yess, dinai parchha.

It's mentioned in Labor Law or something else.  Tech companies (or at least the ones I worked at) usually provide a base salary and a bonus salary. The keep the base salary to the minimum allowable by law (last time it was Rs 12,000 per month) The dashain allowance only applies to this base salary.  Yes, you get prorated amount. x/12*your monthly salary.",

But without any credible information just blatantly labelling it exploitative and child abuse will do more harm than good.|||True, the Kumari tradition is precious but it needs to be modified so culture thrives without harming the child.|||  Wait till the local Newar finds out that someone has spoken a fact here. üòÇ|||Hi all I am a Newar, and i don‚Äôt oppose the tradition.  The child will have access to education and almost everything another child can ask for. We have belief that the child carries spirit of Taleju Bhawani, which gives the child immense power. Again, in an age where we have lost our belief, I cannot prove it.  The kumaris I have visited emit strong aura (i may have been brainwashed to feel this). But she does have to be disciplined (i dont mean someone disciplines her). The child is treated with utmost respect by the best people in a homely environment.   Aba before age of 15 16, Manang Mustang ghumna khasai koi jaadaina hola (only speaking for myself) After she is no longer a Kumari, she can go whereever she wants to.

Jay Desh|||We should support female pope in Vatican gender equality let's goooo!!!|||What about the rights of Nuns... We should talk about this also|||Kumaris: A common doll for everyone.   A 3 year old child has no idea what she is getting into. She cannot grasp what a normal childhood is, what is right and what is wrong. The only thing she knows and does is based on her likes and dislikes, which is heavily depended upon how her parents/surrounding elders dictates.   Ani about 'No complains' from past Kumaris:   Newari culture is super sensitive. You cannot say anything against their culture. Otherwise, you'll have to face \"Tom n Jerry\" like people. I think, every ex Kumaris understands this at some point. With this much pressure along with the grooming done from a very young age, I don't think anyone dares to speak up. Which basically means none of us know what they really feel inside.    Well, of course, keeping in mind how they're thrown away once they reach a certain age or goes through ü©∏. At least, a life time opportunity to be a Kumari where they could renounce their position if they don't feel like it should be a way.   They don't preach, they don't teach, they only show up during jatras. I've never seen Kumaris actively participating in rituals or any sort of activities. Yestai ho vane, why not create a statue of a Kumari for the rest of our lives and stay quiet???|||Also it adds to the stereotype that period blood is impure|||Yeah the 1sttime ever I saw Kumari it was not aww like I hoped but pity to the \"Living Goddess\" she had the look of not a girl her age but of an \"ice princess\" in anime.

The only thing you should feel bad about is her parents who now have to be her full time care takers probably having to leave their jobs and careers and move into the kumari house with her.|||I used to extremely religious before and used to glorify ts But realising Kumari tradition is cruel was my first step towards atheism|||As a Newar, I understand the cultural side of it. But living in the US and having global exposure, I also see it as more of a pageant. If you‚Äôve seen Little Miss Sunshine, you‚Äôll get the context.||| The Living Goddess tradition of Nepal is a complex institution rooted in centuries of culture. While modern concerns about child rights are valid, the practice is governed by strict rituals and has evolved to address contemporary welfare standards. Here are the key facts:  1. The Selection is Meticulous and Considered an Honor:  ¬∑ A Kumari is chosen from the specific Shakya clan of the Newari community, a Buddhist goldsmith caste. ¬∑ The selection process is incredibly rigorous. Candidates must meet 32 strict physical perfection requirements (e.g., eye shape, voice quality, hair color) and demonstrate a fearless and serene demeanor (e.g., by not crying during a ceremony in a room of 108 ritually sacrificed animal heads). ¬∑ For the family and community, her selection is not a punishment but the highest spiritual honor.  2. The Role is Central to National Culture and Unity:  ¬∑ The Kumari is not just a religious figure but a national symbol. ¬∑ Her most important public duty is during the Indra Jatra festival, where she blesses the President of Nepal, providing divine legitimacy to the state in a ceremony that blends Hindu and Buddhist traditions. This is a key event for national identity.  3. Significant Reforms and Safeguards Have Been Implemented:  ¬∑ Education: By law, the Kumari now receives a formal education from private tutors within her residence. The government provides a monthly stipend specifically for this purpose. ¬∑ Family Presence: Contrary to isolation claims, her family (typically her mother) lives with her throughout her tenure. ¬∑ Financial Security: Upon retiring at puberty, the state grants her a lifetime pension. As of recent years, this is approximately NPR 10,000 per month (roughly $75 USD), along with a lump sum of NPR 1 million (roughly $7,500 USD) to support her transition. ¬∑ Successful Reintegration: Former Kumaris like Dr. Chanira Bajracharya, who served until 14, have publicly spoken about their positive experiences, pursued higher education, and built successful careers, demonstrating that life after the role is viable.  The Kumari tradition is a deeply embedded socio-religious institution. It is factually inaccurate to frame it simply as the \"isolation\" of a child. It is a state-sanctioned, culturally sacred role with defined rituals, significant community support, and legally mandated provisions for the girl's education, family life, and long-term financial security. The debate around it highlights the global tension between cultural preservation and evolving child rights, but the practice itself has demonstrably adapted to modern norms.|||I ain't newar but also I think aaba yesto kura chai parents haru le vhaneko ramro hami third party le vhannu vhanda pani . look if kumari ko parents le chahanu hudaina vhani tyo kumari ko candidate mai na leraunu parni ho . so parents lai kehi problem xaina , kumari le as a normal human being ni basna paunu hunxa after completion so I think we are no one to question sodhna lai|||What about the tradition of marrying off daughters into the inlaws house?|||After giving this some thought question is of a philosophical one. What freedom does a child have?  What life does a child choose? Isn‚Äôt everyone forced and fed their parent‚Äôs beliefs?   Also, can you give some evidence of abuse?

I asked myself the same question and the answer is not much.   I disagree with your claim that the Kumari‚Äôs are discarded. They are always welcome. What it shows is the core principle of Buddhism that nothing is permanent. All things, even being revered as the living goddess, comes to an end.

Khaire ko documentary haru herera brainrot kura nagara na. Not everyone is privileged to become kumari and nor they are selected randomly. The family members themself have to fill the form and there's a long running selection process. Only a certain clan of newar can become Kumari. There are lots of inhuman and child abusive traditions going on all over. In case of kumari they get highest level of love and respect. They can live with their parents, they can play, they can watch TV, they can even play video games. It would be better if you watch podcasts of ex kumaris it's really helpful. I used to think same like everyone calling this inhuman before but they are living the normal life as you and me. And the fact that you can't speak up being kumari is totally false, yes you can't but only in jatras and other religious ceremonies, do you speak up during sharad and other pujas(it's prohibited to talk during sharad if you don't know). Go visit sudurpaschim hundreds of girls are being raped during their chhaupadi bas. Go visit terai Muslim villages girls at the age of 15 are getting married and at the age of 21 they are booned with 3 childs. Ex Kumaris themself enjoy being kumari and love to live their that phase again. If they are fine, their parents are fine no need to talk about that. Now the rules and prohibitions are amended.

To those insisting Kumaris are always ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù or dismissing criticism by belittling others, few things we can reflect on:   1. How much do we actually know about child psychology and development, especially at such a young age when experiences shape a lifetime? 2. Yes, a Kumari is worshipped as a goddess now but when her time ends, how does a goddess step back into an ordinary life? How do peers treat her? How does she even make friends? 3. With isolation and the constant expectation to suppress emotions, what happens to her social, communication, and interpersonal skills? Who helps her navigate that later? 4. Does she ever get space to express her own feelings and thoughts or is silence part of the job description? 5. We‚Äôve all seen videos of new Kumari, some barely three years old, literally asleep in full dress during rituals. How on earth can a toddler be burdened with divine expectations when they can barely stay awake through it? 6. As Nepalis, many of us defend dal bhat tarkari because it‚Äôs what we grew up with it feels untouchable. (I know it‚Äôs not the same but for reference) For a Kumari, this role is all she has ever known. So how would she even recognise or articulate what she‚Äôs missed out on, when she never had the chance to experience it? 7. And let‚Äôs be honest do we really believe someone put on a pedestal that high, surrounded by cultural pressure, guilt, and shame, would openly talk about the negatives of being Kumari? Yes, things have changed there‚Äôs more education, some family contact,but none of that cancels out the developmental and human rights concerns we‚Äôre talking about.  And honestly, the comments here kind of prove the point: we were never really taught to think critically. Instead of having an actual discussion, people are throwing around ‚Äúbahun,‚Äù ‚ÄúChristian,‚Äù or ‚Äúother cultures‚Äù like that somehow answers the question. When we turn conversation into belittling, blaming, or name-calling, we‚Äôre not defending culture but normalising this behaviour.

Goodness flows through Kumari.  She is worshipped for being the medium of taleju bhawani. They are taught that they as an individual are not god, but the goodness that flows through her is what makes her worshipped.  And calling Kumari as a \"virgin goddess\" is stupid and a complete disregard of religious belief. It's a literal translation not a literary translation.   A lot of misconceptions have already been debunked.  Therefore they are able to integrate back into society well. They have good societal support . They are mentored, taught and are well taken care of. They themselves have immence respect for their religion and tradition.  If you think being a Kumari is wrong, you simply look at other practices in other religions. Nuns are not allowed to marry or consummate. Denying the right to marry and consummate can be considered as an oppressive practices denying one from their human desires. In radical Islam, burka, multiple marriages, denial of human rights for wemen.  While such petty comparisons are stupid themselves, what I want to say is we are worshipping female power. We are actually looking at females as devine. Not simply blind worship.   Nothing about today's childhood is normal.  You see young boys and girls sent off to boarding schools as normal? It's more isolating depressing. Parents just sticking their child to an iPad, or a hyperactive parent forcing their child through multiple activities (music class, sports, extra activities) even when their child may not want to to them, and pushing their child to extremes, putting their child through ridiculously high expectations, so that they can fulfill own ego( yes I've seen it happen).  A lot is not normal in so called modern normal childhood.   A lot of narratives and propogandas have infiltrated our thinking. Be water and explore into the culture. A lot has been written about Kumari from a propogandist and religious infiltration viewpoint.  A lot has been written to criticize our culture and ostracize ourselves from our religion and culture.

But let‚Äôs be real: he‚Äôs the only king after Prithvi Narayan Shah who actually did something that mattered for the survival of Nepal.    Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus ‚Äî with nine governments in ten years. That wasn‚Äôt democracy, it was chaos. Leaders were busy stabbing each other in the back while the nation stayed dirt poor, uneducated, and vulnerable. Tell me, what ‚Äústable democracy‚Äù exists when governments collapse every year? None. Mahendra saw this and did what no one else had the guts to do: he hit reset.    Yes, he dissolved parliament. Yes, he banned parties. And you know what? He was right to. Without stability, Nepal was on track to become India‚Äôs backyard project or another pawn in the Cold War. Mahendra‚Äôs Panchayat system gave the country one thing it desperately lacked: stability.    And let‚Äôs talk achievements:    He balanced India and China like a chess master. Without him, we‚Äôd have been swallowed by one side decades ago.    He pushed Nepal onto the global stage ‚Äî Non-Aligned Movement, a stronger UN presence, and an independent foreign policy.    He jump-started modernisation: roads, schools, universities, tourism. These are things no king before him, and very few leaders after him, have been able to deliver at that scale.    But historians? They love to cry about ‚Äúdemocracy dying in 1960.‚Äù These same historians never admit that the so-called ‚Äúdemocrats‚Äù of the 50s were busy running the country into the ground. It‚Äôs easy to glorify B.P. Koirala in hindsight, but Mahendra was the one cleaning up the mess in real time.    Here‚Äôs the hard truth: Mahendra was the only king who actually acted like a king ‚Äî a protector of sovereignty. Everyone after him either coasted on his legacy or failed miserably. Without him, Nepal might not even exist as the independent state it is today.    Call him authoritarian all you want, but facts don‚Äôt lie. After Prithvi Narayan Shah, King Mahendra was the only true king Nepal ever had.",

He saved Nepal from being a puppet of foreign countries. He was a gem.|||Its not an unpopular opinion though. Those who know history know how Progressive Mahendra was. One thing though, his rapid advancements did over heat a fledgling Nepalese economy which is why we needed to privatize our industries. But the privatization was a joke,   they privatized it too quickly and privatization advocates in Nepal did admit they made a huge mistake later on.|||Mahendra is a complicated figure. On one hand, he did keep Nepal intact at a time when regional instability and internal divisions could have easily spiraled out of control.  On the other, his coup dismantled the first democratic experiment and concentrated power in the monarchy, which created long-term issues that Nepal is still untangling today.   It‚Äôs less that historians hate admitting he saved Nepal, and more that they frame it as a tradeoff between short-term stability and long-term democratic development.|||Popular opinion. It's because of Prithvi Narayan Shah and King Mahendra that modern day Nepal even exists as a separate country in its current form. Otherwise there would not have even been an independent country known as Nepal.|||His authoritarian enforcement of the Nepali language and Hindu traditions on a diverse population that wanted nothing to do with them was one of the causes of the civil war that would follow.  He killed democracy in its crib and pulled us back into medieval institutions. Even if I were to hypothetically accept that he was a good ruler for the sake of argument, there is no guarantee and his heirs and his heirs‚Äô heirs would have been good rulers, which is why absolute monarchy fails. Any good that he might have done during his reign is negated by the fact that long term institutions are more important than charismatic rulers, and he ruined the institution of democracy. All the instability that we have faced since 2008- would have happened in the 1950s and we could have been a prosperous democracy by the present. This guy pulled us decades back.  It‚Äôs easy to look back at the past with rose tinted glasses and romanticize it, that is the first step on the road to fascism, but the truth of life, prosperity and happiness is in the future and progressive institutions.|||The problem with Monarchy in Nepal and everywhere else is that there are few good apples in 1 crore ropani orchard.  Except PN Shah, Mahendra and maybe Birendra (many sources call him spineless but I don't know), no one else were fit to rule. The country fell into Ranas dictatorship  because of Monrachy system failure.  So here we are, dealing with generational political trauma.|||A quick ChatGPT will give you some real perspective:  Most historians and political analysts agree that King Mahendra‚Äôs reasons were more of a pretext to consolidate royal power rather than genuine democratic concerns. Here‚Äôs why:  1. Political instability was exaggerated  Nepal‚Äôs first elected government (1959‚Äì1960) under B. P. Koirala had been in office for only 18 months.  While there were some administrative problems, it wasn‚Äôt long enough to judge the parliamentary system a failure.  Corruption and inefficiency existed, but not at the level Mahendra claimed.   2. Fear of losing monarchical dominance  The 1959 elections gave the Nepali Congress a clear majority.  Koirala‚Äôs government was popular and gaining legitimacy, which posed a direct threat to the king‚Äôs absolute authority.  Mahendra feared the monarchy would become a ceremonial institution like in India or Britain.   3. Foreign policy pretext  Koirala pursued a relatively independent foreign policy, maintaining balance between India and China.  Mahendra accused him of endangering Nepal‚Äôs sovereignty, but in reality, the king wanted direct control over diplomacy, which was vital for aid and recognition.   4. Use of \"underdeveloped society\" argument  Mahendra claimed that Nepalese people weren‚Äôt ‚Äúready‚Äù for democracy due to illiteracy and lack of experience.  This was partly true, but instead of strengthening democratic institutions, he abolished parties and built a system where only the king‚Äôs will mattered.   5. The Panchayat system benefited him most  Under Panchayat, all political power flowed through the king.  It created the image of \"guided democracy,\" but in practice, it was royal autocracy with no accountability.   üìå Conclusion: Mahendra used the excuses of instability, corruption, and national unity to justify a royal coup. The deeper reason was to preserve absolute monarchy and prevent Nepal from transitioning into a genuine parliamentary democracy.|||Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus, with nine governments in ten years. That wasn‚Äôt democracy, it was chaos.  LOL. The King chose PM. He was the one responsible.|||Yes man agreed. He is the guy who defined Nepal and Nepali people. He did a lot of great works for the country. But many people and our school books consider him as a dictator telling about how he banned political parties and not mention about the reforms and development made by him for the country. One of the greatest leader of our country King Mahendra!!|||Ali history paddam, 1959 ma first election vako ho tyo vanda aagadi sab PM king le choose garya ho, 1st election ko 1.5 years ma coup vako ho.|||But his policies are disastrous for Nepal till this day  He opened Nepal's border with India, opened free trade with India, allowed India to build its Army base in Lipulekh Limpiyadhura Kalapani since then these territories are occupied by India  He also forced Khas culture on Newaris and Janjatis which influenced them to become Communists|||Agreed!|||Will not let anyone discredit the blood of 17k Nepali|||We wouldn't have been swallowed by any side. Non-alignment was the default policy from the beggining, and B.P koirala would have continued that policy. Nepal would have 'modernized' without an iron-fisted dictatorship.|||Matrika literally wanted to suck cock of india..   He was puppet of India...while BP was good...Matrika and BP's power struggle caused mahendra to step in...and take all the powers..   Thats my unpopular opinion too.|||I agree with most of your points. But your point about 10 governments in nine years doesn't show the instability created by parties but by the monarchs. The monarchs were the ones that were making them unstable. The one time it seemed to be stable, he couped the government. That doesn't diminish the fact thought, that his rule saw probably the most balanced foreign policy of Nepal, where Nepal truly stood out as a sovereign nature. I still believe that had Mahendra controlled a bit of his authoritarian ways and worked together with B.P. Koirala, Nepal would have been in a much better position that it is currently. Both of them are the best leaders Nepal had post P.N. Shah. It might be an unpopular opinion but I think P.N. Shah might be more important historically, but these two are probably the best leaders Nepal got, even better than P.N. Shah.|||Unpopular hoina, brain-dead opinion.

Ani jabo dui tukra road pitch garyo bhandai ma khusi hune??|||sovereignty? of who? Mahendra model of nation-building was \"one religion, one custom, one language.\" Hindu orthodoxy was enforced as state ideology, treating non-Hindu communities as second-class. Nepali was imposed as the only legitimate language, sidelining rich traditions like Maithili, Newar, Tharu, Tamang, Limbu, etc. This wasn't genuine unity - it was control through forced uniformity. What looked like stability was in fact suppression. That brittle foundation is why today's Nepal wrestles with federalism, ethnic assertion, and identity politics: democracy didn't invent division, it revealed what had long been silenced.  The Koiralas, born and educated in Banaras, were accused of being \"too Indian.\" But Nepal had no universities, no political freedom, no space for intellectual growth - precisely because the tyrants had closed those doors. Should they be condemned for seeking ideas in India, or credited for importing the democratic imagination Nepal lacked?  So the paradox is clear:  Mahendra centralized the state but weakened society.|||First question, why was Nepal unstable during those years? And second more important question, if stability was the most important thing for us, why did he take over from a parliament that had a 2/3 majority and the government was led by THE BP Koirala? There was a little chance that the Koirala govt would have toppled and was doing good work..  Yes, there were some long term projects under him that were very good for Nepal. There‚Äôs no denying that and kudos to him. But he was authoritarian, there is no denying that either.

This also coincidentally occurred around the time F1 decided to move its office to Pulchowk, adjacent to M&S Tower, which is basically Sirohiya's Den. It was only recently that F1 changed its office address to the F1 Building, before which it was M&S Tower.   The ban was all about control. Let's ask ourselves, who benefits the most from this control? Who was suffering from not having control?   Media? Politicians? Oligarchs?   To everyone wondering about the extent of the control.

A plot, put in place to achieve total control to serve Mission 2084.  The elections might have been scheduled for 2084, but the election campaigns would have launched months ahead. Imagine them having total control of social media going into 2084?   Even though we've ridiculed them for being 8th standard, they had an ambition- that is total control under the cloak of democracy.

And, not all the projects are carried out using shramdan, projects that require technical expertise are obviously given to companies.

Even I don't like him and criticize him all the time because of how critical and straight forward he keeps himself all the time. It's idiotic. But the criticism is more of a constructive one to keep him in check. But these jholeys with all sorts of anonymous names claiming to be dharanis have similar patterns. They are completely dismissive of sampang. So it's not difficult to know that they are politically motivated.

The situation remains uncertain. Several media outlets have only reported that his name is missing from the list of 20 hostages confirmed to be alive, yet some are hastily jumping to conclusions without verified information. Such speculation is irresponsible, especially when the facts are still unclear. These pages are so immaturely jumping to conclusions in a state where things are uncertain.|||Bipin looked fine in that released video dated November 2023. It means that either Bipin died during the strikes or Hamas' foul play. Our foreign policy is also to be blamed. How could they detain Nepalese who had no association with Israel?

This cease fire is a win for then.|||https://preview.redd.it/ceus40waktuf1.png?width=1286&format=png&auto=webp&s=72a16b17c85993ea6e147deac0acc96858a1434e  from [https://www.setopati.com/politics/371509](https://www.setopati.com/politics/371509)|||Is the news of his death confirmed?

Eleven of our sons, including Bipin Joshi, who arrived in Israel just 25 days before Hamas‚Äôs October 7, 2023, bloodbath, were brutally murdered. Four days ago, 48 hostages clung to life; now, only 20 survive. Hamas‚Äôs ‚Äújustified‚Äù slaughter, draped in twisted dogma, mocks humanity. Two years of torment, dangling hope of Bipin‚Äôs survival, only to end in his cold-blooded killing by these bloody cowards. At home, Gen Z‚Äôs September ‚Äúuprising‚Äù killed 51, including kids, burning Kathmandu, freeing 12,500 criminals to prop up corrupt elites‚Äô spoiled brats. Our nation‚Äôs credibility is trashed, a global joke. Hamas and their ilk, like Jamkash, happily point fingers at Jews and Hindus for every woe, but when it‚Äôs time to face their own kind, they scatter like roaches, spineless. Yet we let their hate-preaching ideology fester in our hills, unchecked. No more. Deport their firebrand clerics, cut off their dirty foreign cash. We must back our own against Hamas, demand international recognition to flex Nepal‚Äôs strength, resilience, and power. This must never happen again. Israel‚Äôs crushing these terrorists, shutting up the bloody liberals whining ‚Äúcontext‚Äù over our dead. Nepal, rise, reject this death cult, or lose more Bipins. #NepalStands #HateKills #GenZFails|||also euta kura sachhauna mann lagyo yo Rest in peace vanne sabda christain haru ko ho , they do not believe in re-incarnation so they say that rest in peace so that they won‚Äôt come back but hamro hindu sanskar ma we believe in next janma and we say ‚Äú Hardik shradhhanjali ‚Äú|||[deleted]|||Bro what|||We had hope.

Every other Indian city from Delhi to Bangalore organizes Garba nights during Nauratha, and people participate regardless of their background. They just want to have fun. And honestly, this whole debate reflects how we treat culture in Nepal as well where Bahun Chhetri traditions and Nepali language are promoted as the ‚Äòreal‚Äô identity, while 100+ other languages and ethnic cultures are pushed aside.  And culture is never static. Its constantly influenced by a lot of things like art, cinema, migration, globalization, internet, exchange and influence as well. The same people who happily pay to watch Bollywood movies in movie theaters, worship actors like Salman and Shahrukh and just hoot loudly when they come on screen at theaters, and listen to, sing & dance to Hindi songs without thinking twice suddenly get offended if someone enjoys Garba. That selective outrage is nothing but hypocrisy.|||I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a problem at all. You need to be inclusive to all religions and culture.

Don‚Äôt get too attached to it.|||Just by criticizing everything doesn't make you intellectual.|||Cultures and traditions naturally spread over time, and this spread is accelerated by influence. Media is the most powerful driver of that influence, and that‚Äôs why our local culture feels as though it is being overshadowed. The problem is not that people no longer value their own culture, but that our media presence is extremely weak compared to others.  Think about how Indian culture has spread in Nepal: through movies, songs, TV serials, and now online content. (migration, political connection and cultural proximity are other factors but in this case, the primary driver is media). The same is true for Western cultures, especially American culture, which influences our everyday lives, from what we eat and wear to the way we think. The recent Garba incident may be one example, but it represents a much broader pattern: cultural identity travels and takes root primarily through media.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, since cultures have always spread, adapted, and reshaped themselves over time. (I mean we'll definitely feel good if a foreigner adopts nepali culture). But preserving one‚Äôs own culture is equally important, because it forms a core pillar of identity. And preservation in today‚Äôs world is only possible through strengthening our own media i.e. by producing movies, songs, and online content that reflect and celebrate our traditions. And they need to be good, not some low effort cash converter sold in the name of patriotism.  And just for context: Garba is not only celebrated in Gujarat, but across India. (showing spread of a culture).|||I dont really see how this would affect op or anyone else for that matter enough to create this discord. And where do you draw the line?

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. üò≠üò≠2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye üò≠|||[deleted]|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

They are simple and have generally easy solutions that most if not all can understand. But they ask questions that often require you to interpret the asked topic in a different way. Thwy might twist a simple concept like vector addition and join it with irl examples. If one has core understanding of the subject and knows how to manage time with good handwriting, it isnt difficult to score 70+. You will need to be consistent though.|||Maile ni 2 barsa almost every exam ma 85 katako ho tei pani 2L jati ta tirnai paryo so its kinda hard tara ali mehenat garyo bhane chai sakchau easily 85% just math lastai dami banaunu paryo ani aru ma decent bhayepani katcha|||Hello u/Technical_Cat6948, thank you for contributing to r/NepalPlusTwo.

Because there was no one to guide me, i failed this year's neb board.   so from someone who learned from his own experience, my best advice is that you don't depend only on teachers from your school. there are tons of videos on youtube and tons of notes and  straight up answers in the internet.   if you do not understand and get anything at all, then only focus on the questions that are asked many times or repeated i.e only imp questions.   you have to make sure that you atleast passing marks, so look focus on the chapters you understand and master them first then only focus on others.   You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can‚Äôt get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

This is my Personal expression.  I loved it. The 9k fees per month was extremely worth it .|||I am a graduate of 2014 from Trinity. The best ever decision, as i spent the best 2 yrs of my life there.

It's not due to lack of knowledge from his side that makes it hard for us to grab the concepts, it's just the fact that he's shit at teaching and doesn't care about whether or not everyone understands. Regardless, I'm studying CS and want a good base in maths for the future. Mero first term aaudai cha, I tried to go through a few YouTube channels, some of them are alright but I already struggle with maths & physics so it's pretty difficult to understand *everything* I'd appreciate it if anyone could suggest any channels (or alternative platforms) which are good.   TLDR: Suggest a YouTube channel for physics mechanics, grade 11.",

            "comments": "my suggestion would be that stop expecting everything from teachers in 11 and 12 and figure out what way of study suits you the best because if you are reliant on your teachers for every study resources then you'll get in trouble in bachelors or forward because here teachers  dont even give a shit if there sound is audible let alone good lectures i left relying on teachers in my 11 12 days because all of our clz teachers were shit and had to self study every chapter. if you are in 11 theres a high chance that you are yet to figure out your true study method. for me reading book line by line worked the best and i reckon this is the most optimal way to study as it not only helps you cover everything on your sylbs but also prepares you for high intensity study environment which is very essential for higher level studies..and if you're not understanding mechanics then there's a high chance that you're not willing to learn mechanics because it is the portion of  physics where you can follow everything intuitively and is most interesting one so try to learn it conceptually relating it to real life stuffs. as for yt channel ig physics wallah will be good but there will be a lot of things which are not in our course.. however you can try and learn yourself by reading books and if you dont understand any sentence then you can use chat gpt to crack it down ..and a free tip., understand derivations very effectively like every line and term, why and how they are there because if you do so you'll be able to solve every numerical, and also solve as much mcqs and numericals as you can|||Royera|||do past papers|||Hello u/Swiss_16, thank you for contributing to r/NepalPlusTwo.
