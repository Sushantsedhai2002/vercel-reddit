Stay Consistent  My first page didn‚Äôt make me a single rupee for almost a year ‚Äî but I kept going with full passion. Eventually, I started receiving promotional offers. (The page was related to education.)  3. Build LinkedIn Connections  This one‚Äôs crucial. Right after finishing my +2 level, I created my LinkedIn profile and started sharing my skills, training experiences, and achievements. One of my LinkedIn connections ‚Äî from the USA ‚Äî is now one of my biggest clients.  4. Focus on Skills  Invest your time in learning in-demand skills like IT, FinTech, and Communications. In my case, my two strongest skills are FinTech and Startup Building ‚Äî and they‚Äôve played a major role in helping me reach this stage.   Lastly, stay grounded. Focus on solving real-world problems with your skills ‚Äî the money will follow naturally.  Thanks for reading till the end!",

Open border, growing Indian GDP and our heavy reliance on Indian corridors for incoming and outgoing mostly incoming goods and energy makes it a sensible decision.

I did some research online about scrub typhus ; its symptoms, tests, and diagnosis but I‚Äôm looking for ***more specific guidance on what to do next.***   Here are my main questions:  **1. Test Availability in Biratnagar:**   I‚Äôm not sure if the local hospital has the required kits to test typhus. My grandmother has government insurance, and we‚Äôre considering taking her to **Koshi Hospital (public)**. Does anyone know if they offer scrub typhus testing there, or do we need to go to private hospitals like **Nobel** or **Birat Teaching**?  **2. Medication & Treatment Process:**  What kind of treatment is typically given for scrub typhus? Are there any specific medications or protocols to follow? Is it the same in government and private hospitals? Any recommendations on what has worked for other people with this condition?  **3. Precautions to Follow:**  What should we do and avoid during this time? I‚Äôve read that avoiding certain foods and activities is important, but I‚Äôd love to hear from anyone with experience on what specifically helped their loved ones.  **4. Serious Complications to Watch Out For:**  Are there any serious complications from scrub typhus that I should be aware of? What are the warning signs that things are getting worse?  **5. Recovery Time:**  How long does it typically take for someone to fully recover from scrub typhus? I understand it varies, but any general advice or timeline would be helpful.  I‚Äôm really worried about her health, so any advice or tips would be appreciated!  *Thanks in advance!*",

            "body": "I‚Äôm looking to buy a new laptop and came across **Max IT** in Computer Bazar (near Star Mall). Their prices look *really* tempting ‚Äî like, noticeably cheaper than other stores.  For example, they‚Äôre listing an **MSI Raider GE68HX (i7-13700HX + RTX 4070, 32 GB RAM, 2 TB SSD)** for around **‚Ç® 2.07 lakh**, while most other Nepali sites still have the same model closer to **‚Ç® 3.7 lakh**. They said it‚Äôs a stock-clearance deal with only a couple of units left.  Has anyone here actually bought from **Max IT** recently?  * Were the laptops **sealed and genuine**, or could they be refurbished/open-box? * How‚Äôs their **warranty and after-sales support**? * Did the product you got **match the listed specs**?  Also, I noticed there‚Äôs a **Max International** in IT Plaza (Putalisadak) using what looks like the *same logo*, but they have different prices and locations. Are these two related or completely separate shops?  Any first-hand experiences would help a lot ‚Äî I just want to make sure it‚Äôs legit before dropping a big chunk of money. Thanks!",

            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I‚Äôve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I‚Äôm revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I‚Äôll share the publication‚Äôs name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I‚Äôm not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don‚Äôt even know how to open or save files and that‚Äôs completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn‚Äôt include topics that match today‚Äôs trends. What‚Äôs relevant now? AI, isn‚Äôt it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we‚Äôve been studying since grade 6. I‚Äôm now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn‚Äôt be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren‚Äôt even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad üò≠. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that‚Äôs how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn‚Äôt even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor üò≠ since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly ‚ÄúYeah i  already know html it's something i‚Äôve learned many times before and i don‚Äôt use Notepad anymore(for webdevüò≠)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects‚Äù then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like ‚Äú<‚Äù and ‚Äú/‚Äù. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today‚Äôs topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1‚Äìh6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn‚Äôt say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later üòÖ By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don‚Äôt know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

And to those public figures who stay silent or worse, enjoy it, you are part of the problem.  Sandeep, if your heart was truly pure, you would have intervened long ago. You could have told your followers to stop this bullying and personal attack. But your silence speaks volumes. A good heart does not take pleasure in someone else‚Äôs humiliation.  Today fans may be cheering for you. Tomorrow the same crowd can turn just like they did with others. Fame built on hate will always collapse on itself.

I hope they win, they probably will.  man, I'm burned out from Nepali politics. there is a high chance that, there will be more division and more instability. AAAAAA I don't want to think about this. all I know is few people in current interim government are the best that there is. beyond that, I don't have big faith in anyone. countless factions. many opportunists. I don't see the wisdom in many. and the selflessness needed to birth a capable and wise polity. only thing we can hope for is a good political party. and that's uncertain. one thing is for sure, there are more political parties. and more division.  I'm starting to believe that almost all people are incapable of deep reasoning and far from understanding what is needed for a successful government. and in upcoming elections. discourse will be hijacked by demagogues with those shallow stirring speeches. slanders of oppositions. hard to see political culture changing for better. and if individuals are like this. it's much harder to be an impressive unit with cohesion as a government. I don't feel like things will get much better. it really felt very hopeful a month back. let's see what happens in the next elections. it's too messy to predict stuff rn. and we can't do much, I think.|||First of all, I think Serbia is on the right path and I hope the best people will win the election.   Nepal is currently administrated by an interim government which is working to hold an election within the next 5 months. This interim government is doing just fine, not the best. But as the whole system is filled with corrupts, the government hasn't been able to deliver as per the high expectations. However, I think the corruption is almost nil right now because who would dare, right? The ministers we have currently have are definitely the best ones as compared to any of the ministers before. Especially the education minister is doing great imo.   But the main question is, what would happen after the new election. If the thrown out parties came back to power, we are doomed. We do have many leaders who are respected by most and not linked with the old big parties but don't know their exact plan for the election. They must be working on it, but a lot of confusion remains, and rightfully so, because nobody was prepared for this situation. I personally have big hopes and positive vibes for the coming election as people are now more aware about the politics, especially the younger ones.|||I was very positive after the revolution but I‚Äôm worried how things are going now especially with social media/individuals/YouTube putrukar are diverting to unnecessary issues. Everyone is divided and the main culprits behind all these issues are looking for an opportunity to rise again:  - everyone praised people/celebrities for joining the revolution but the same media/individuals are after them now for damaging public property( one media started and now everyone jumped on the bandwagon). I‚Äôm against any form of violence/damaging public property however all nalayak leaders are roaming free giving speech; here the main issue is diverted to unnecessary topic. investigation should be conducted and all the real culprits for damaging public/ individual property should be punished. Now is the time to punish real culprit for their fake hope, promises and looting country. They are responsible for harming our past, present and future generations.   - Fractions on Gen-Z groups: who were together during revolution are now divided and look like they are influenced by external groups who were looking for an opportunity to address their own demands. Obviously all the issues raised during the revolution should be addressed but need to prioritise main issue: stable governance, punishment to nalayaks and reformation to bureaucracy.  - Individuals/ journalists harassing Gen-Z with their questions (which is not bad) but unable to speak in the same way to those nalayak leaders. They should be barking at them then Gen-Z group/individuals.   - Durga prasai: after all the tragedy and destruction,how can he say that he will bring another storm of protest. How can he openly request general public to make stock of food and gas at home. Enough is enough.   -People: Jumping on the bandwagon: same group of individual who attended the revolution are now planning to attend Dura prasai‚Äôs protest. Same group of individual who shared hate speech to their nalayak leaders are now praising again, same group of individuals who appreciated what they did during the revolution are not against them.   We are everywhere. Now, this is the time to be clear what and who we truly support.  . I really appreciate what this government is doing with all the challenges. I‚Äôm still positive that they will work on to make peace and prosperity.  .

            "body": "Lee Kuan Yew once said, ‚ÄúIf Singapore is a nanny state, then I am proud to have fostered disciplined citizens.‚Äù Those words came from a leader who understood that progress is not built on chaos but on control, not on popularity but on principles. Singapore did not rise because of luck or slogans. It rose because its people accepted discipline, structure, and long-term vision, even when it was uncomfortable.  Nepal, sadly, seems to be heading in the opposite direction. We fought hard for democracy, for freedom, for rights. But somewhere along the way, we forgot that freedom without responsibility is self-destruction. Today, we can say anything, post anything, and do anything without consequence. What was once the voice of democracy has turned into the noise of disorder. We confuse outrage with awareness, and chaos with choice.  Look around and you will see it everywhere. People peeing on the streets, spitting in public, ignoring traffic lights, bribing officials to get their work done faster, and still blaming everything on ‚Äúbad leaders.‚Äù We fail to see that corruption is not only at the top; it begins within us. Giving a bribe is as much a crime as taking one. Our crisis is not just political; it is moral and cultural.  Freedom is beautiful, but when it comes without accountability, it breeds anarchy. Discipline is not a form of oppression it is the foundation on which a nation stands. The countries we admire today, such as Singapore, China, and even post-war South Korea, built their futures on order, not outrage. They accepted strong leadership and collective discipline, even when it meant individual discomfort. The result was growth, stability, and identity.  Nepal today, however, is driven by the wrong fuel. It is driven not by discipline but by social media, emotions, and narratives. We react to everything, think about nothing, and follow whoever shouts the loudest. Our national debates happen on TikTok and Facebook, not in classrooms or parliament. The danger is not that we will run out of freedom, but that we will drown in our own noise.  I fear that we are entering an era where the populist will triumph over the professional, where emotional speeches will defeat rational ideas. It is a sad truth, but Nepal has no Lee Kuan Yew. The closest we have is Harka Sampang a man with the heart of Lee Kuan Yew but without the mind/brain to match. He symbolizes our tragedy: passion without direction, courage without structure.  Meanwhile, many citizens are busy idolizing a so-called ‚Äúsuperhuman‚Äù sitting in jail, someone who has lived a life of controversy and even once renounced his Nepali identity. People follow him not for policy but for emotion, not for logic but for rebellion. This obsession with personalities over principles is the exact disease that destroys nations.  A country cannot be built on emotion alone. Emotions can ignite revolutions, but they cannot sustain them. Discipline, integrity, and intellect are what turn movements into nations. We need fewer loud heroes and more quiet builders people who repair roads before recording videos, who teach values before preaching patriotism, and who lead by example rather than outrage.  The truth is hard to accept, Nepal does not only lack leaders. It lacks disciplined citizens. A nation becomes strong not when its people defy the state but when both walk in balance. If citizens act responsibly and unite with shared purpose, they become more powerful than any government. But when citizens are divided by hate, driven by noise, and the state fears to enforce order, it becomes a failed one.  Unless we rediscover discipline, the very freedom we celebrate will keep destroying the nation we dream of building. Real freedom is not doing whatever we want. It is doing what is right, even when no one is watching. When looting becomes a proud moment and chaos a national celebration, it‚Äôs not freedom we‚Äôre living in; it‚Äôs decay disguised as democracy.",

I used to work for a Nepali Marwari owner here in the US who had around 30 stores under one of the biggest wireless companies in the country. Dude was loaded the brand name itself brought in enough business to make him filthy rich.  But man, the micromanagement was on another level. He believed employees should always be under pressure. Two minutes late? You‚Äôd get sent home with 2‚Äì3 follow-up emails. He had cameras everywhere and watched every move if you touched your phone for even a second, you‚Äôd get an email warning.  We had to message the group chat every time we clocked in, went on break, and clocked out while doing same in an app. It was ridiculous. The managers around him were total yes-men with no real management skills or education, just doing whatever the boss said.  Most of us employees were Nepali, Indian, or other South Asians, and we just tolerated it. But eventually, they started pulling the same nonsense with the white employees constant monitoring, weird punishments, and micromanaging everything. Those folks didn‚Äôt stay quiet.  When they complained, he retaliated by transferring them to faraway locations (which, by the way, is illegal in the US I didn‚Äôt even know that back then). They ended up suing the company.  After months of legal battles, the owner lost big time. He had to settle for almost $1 million, and worst of all, he lost his business licenses. Now, he can‚Äôt make any major business decisions without approval from the state attorney.

First of all, India has a 1bn population. Given the hostility between the US and china, most of the big tech have their satellite offices in India, and that gets so much of techs from India. Because, people see scope in tech, many Indians go for BTech, CS.  But - how much of tech innovation do you see from India vs China or the US?  There was a time once when you could hire 5 people in India with a budget for 1 in the US. Now that is slowly going away, so many of the tech companies are now expanding in Africa and Latin America.|||Lol I work with Indians in a US company, don't get me wrong there are a lot of quality indians software engineers but this premise about Indians being the only one who are crazy tech talented is a joke, if that was the case we'd see some innovative indian tech company comparable to the ones from China/US.|||'America Kya keheta tha' ?|||Bill Gates also said he would rather hire lazy people to his company because they would find an easier way to do difficult task.|||I once interned at one of the FAANG (now MAANG) companies, and from my experience, I can say without a doubt that Indians play a massive role in the top American tech firms. They‚Äôve become an inseparable part of the U.S. IT industry a huge portion of the real engineering work is done by them. These companies rely heavily on Indian talent, and because of that, Indian Americans have grown to become quite influential, even in U.S. politics. It‚Äôs no surprise that they‚Äôre now the highest-earning ethnic group in the entire country.  I remember one senior engineer I worked with a German once told me, *‚ÄúIndian Americans are the 21st-century Jews of America.‚Äù* That line stuck with me.  But it does make you wonder if Indians are so talented, why isn‚Äôt India as developed as the U.S.? The main issue is the lack of a strong support system and consistent government backing for innovation and startups. For a long time, India didn‚Äôt create the right environment to make full use of its skilled people.  Now, about whether India is catching up to China in tech not quite yet. Chinese engineers are incredibly skilled, and China still has a big edge in infrastructure, funding, and startup ecosystems. Right now, India sits at number three, behind the U.S. and China, in the global tech scene. But give it another 20‚Äì25 years, and India could very well take the second spot, right after China.  That said, India‚Äôs future looks bright. The liberalization policies and the country‚Äôs strong emphasis on education have built a solid foundation. Institutions like the IITs, AIIMS, and IIMs have produced some of the best minds in engineering, medicine, and business. These people are driving not just India‚Äôs growth but also global innovation. With an open economy, a thriving startup culture, and millions of ambitious young people, India is steadily moving toward becoming one of the leading technology and economic powers of the world behind China.|||Is there another Microsoft in China though?|||India chai haina China le chai banauxa arko MS    They are good at creating and that works too   India on other hand will send huge skilled resources tara banauna chai sakdaina hai   India ko IT market thulo xa    ani China ko le ta duniya nai chalya xa hai   reminded of some so called nepali techfluencers haru    Nepal lai IT hub banayera tech revolution lyaune    some dude from NASIT (shitty association of IT comanies of Nepal)|||Well Indians are great at tech that's a fact we can't deny that.

You will find Nepali, Iranian, Indian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, and others working in the US.  From my experience, I can tell you that the Chinese are the most competent ones. My advisor is Chinese, and she is so demanding and well-versed that I can't explain. Indians don't even come close to their skills and competence. So, to answer no, they aren't.|||‚ÄúPeople believe anything when it‚Äôs put between quotation marks.‚Äù   ‚Äî *Abraham Linkon*|||India's vaunted software industry has outsourced the least technologically demanding and most labor-intensive parts of the European and American software industries. The reality is that India lacks internet giants, nor does it have widely used software applications. Even the major software applications developed domestically are from the US. While you could argue that Indians participated in the development of these applications, it's still not Indian software. This isn't entirely bad, however. The internet industry is dominated by only two major players: the US and China. Even Europe and Japan have seen their internet industries and talent drained by the US. For example, in the electric vehicle industry, Chinese electric vehicle companies are internet giants, while German electric vehicle companies are industrial giants. Germany's lack of internet talent forces it to partner with Chinese companies for technology, whereas 30 years ago, China partnered with German automakers due to a lack of technology. Before his death, Henry Kissinger expressed concern about Europe's extreme lack of long-term strategic planning. Many Europeans still fail to grasp this reality, their thinking still mired in outdated Cold War thinking, which sees a Soviet Union as the scapegoat for all their mistakes. India and many other countries haven't fared any better than Europe.|||Bro been working with Indians for last 2 years. 90% of them are \"Kaam chorr\".|||1. Indians are indeed good at replicating pre-existing products. 2. With a population of 1.4 Billion - India has the market  for growth not just for tech companies but any international company looking to increase their revenues (CAGR and what not). 3. Microsoft's subscription model doesn't really suit the South Asian population.  But having said all this, Bill probably said it as a joke (if he indeed said it). I think his sense of humor is quiet terrible.|||No there won‚Äôt b another anything in india. Modt if the Indian in IT are mere code laborers.",

I earn in lakhs even with just a few years of experience, which I‚Äôm grateful for, but I can‚Äôt help wondering how long this will last.  Sure, I could aim for higher-paying roles or even start my own company, but honestly, that feels too risky right now. The market doesn‚Äôt seem very promising, and the uncertainty makes it hard to plan for the future.  At the same time, I know this routine: waking up early, going to work every day, coming home late, getting two days off won‚Äôt stay exciting forever. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm just running on autopilot.  Part of me envies people with government jobs.

Being able to build a website or a native app is great but IT is so much more than that. It‚Äôs about solving real problems and building something that impacts people.  Here in the U.S., even a simple GPT-based tool can quickly find users but in Nepal, it feels much harder to reach that same momentum.  Let me give you an example: the hospital where I worked as an intern had a big touch screen basically a TV installed in every pediatric  patient room for entertainment purpose. A Swiss company built it. They didn‚Äôt invent anything groundbreaking, but they solved a simple, practical problem. They took a regular TV, added an outer touch-sensitive layer, placed it on an aluminum frame, and turned it into a medical-grade interactive display. Each 32-inch unit cost over $4,000 and yet hospitals were happily paying for it because it worked and solved a need.  If you love software development and dream of starting a company, my advice is simple: focus on building something that solves a real problem first. Launch your product, find your audience  and let the company form around that.|||Before creating any software, validate first.   Make a fake product video, and show it to potential buyers.

I agree there is no venture captial, seed investment, taking risk in startup culture in Nepal but should we really stop ourselves from trying something blaming stuff we cannot control?|||Bhako factories haru bistarai close gardai xan.

But we are kind of slowly becoming the third party dumping ground,¬†|||Technology is like a tower with countless floors; you need to climb up one level at a time. The global average literacy rate is 86.3%, while Nepal's is 67.9%, India's is 74.4%, and sub-Saharan Africa's is 64.0%. I believe Nepal, India, and other countries should first strengthen basic education, then develop low-end manufacturing. Using the money raised from low-end manufacturing to cultivate talent is the only way to further develop high-tech. This is the same development path followed by East Asian countries like China, Japan, and South Korea. A country the size of Nepal can achieve significant development by focusing on just one technology tree. For example, Bangladesh has taken on a significant portion of China and Southeast Asia's textile industry, and its GDP growth has surpassed India's. I haven't seen such an industry in Nepal or Pakistan. India has software outsourcing, but it's far from sufficient for a country of its size. To play soccer well, one must first learn to run. If a player's running speed is the second-to-last in their class, and they constantly strive to be the third-to-last, I'm not optimistic about their future.|||Even Shark Tank US doesn't have much Tech/AI entries, not just Nepal. It isn't the show to seek funding for those products.  Shark Tank are for consumer-friendly products with a equity valuation that is set to provide quick returns for the investors.  Tech (especially AI intensive) companies in general quote an equity on a premium based on their \"future growth\". So a lot of R&D investment. It is not something that can be offered by an investor or 2. They seek Venture capital fundings for it.",

Or you could explore other options like ConnectIPS, Khalti, Bank cards, etc.  Regarding another question & concern about what problem does API solve?   \\- Assume you are running your business (selling products), as you have mentioned in the post, customers can just download the QR, pay and confirm via call or message (screenshot). For smaller scale this is feasible. But when it comes to scale, you won't be able to receive calls or verify payment screenshots of 100s of customers per day, you either need to hire more people or apply some automation. Another problem you will face is fake screenshots, order confusion, etc. Here's where APIs comes into play, once you integrate the API in your website, the API does the payment/verification part, your application (website) will connect the payment to the order, and flag the payment status as \"PAID\", you won't need to verify each and every payment. You can focus on the product and delivery.  TLDR; For small scale business, QR option with phone/message verification will work fine. For larger scale, API will help you a lot by automating the verification, and order status updates.|||Don't get it for 25k. It's negotiable.

I am interested in working with you people, i just want to learn something new, contribute stuffs that would benefit both me and the company somehow. i am not expecting any salary or any kind of payments. i want to work like an what you say; unpaid-intern for 1/1.5 months trying to adapt with the type of things you people do; and then we can think of upgrading after some assessment maybe later on. (katai maile kaam na payera yaa, job na vayera vanya chai haina haii; maile aaile samma katai kei apply garya xaina; i am just trying to gain some experience with some contributions)   I am not looking for the post, but small space to work and gain experience along with contribute things while learning.   I am also not bluffing stuffs, but i am very interested in learning things and just getting out of this web-dev space.   You don't have to worry about how will i learn and contribute.   Short background check (not trying to impress just what i know):  I have pretty much good foundations on things like OS, Networks and most of the projects i've done is in Node, in fact, i've just switched to Go (just to be little bit low haha). Also after being here for around 2/3 years, i am pretty sure that it wouldn't that hard for me to learn a new concept/things on the go.  So, i am just a very interested to work and gain experience, kaai kaam khojda khojda na paayera, unpaid garna khojeko haina, i am just trying to uplift my skills trying on real world scenerio. i hope you understand what i mean to actually say.  what's your take on this? it's only a request, if it's okey we can have a talk on my compatibility on the team.",

            "body": "I‚Äôve been working remotely at a small service-based Indian startup for the past two months, and I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôm not learning much.  When I joined, the CEO (who also interviewed me) mentioned there were about 10 people in the company. In reality, it‚Äôs just the two founders both working full-time elsewhere and two other interns (frontend and UI/UX).  On my very first day, I was given a task, completed it, got it reviewed, and my code was merged that same day. Since then, I‚Äôve been working on similar client projects: mostly small-scale eCommerce sites, matrimony platforms, restaurant/hotel websites, etc.  Here‚Äôs typically what I do for each project:  * Design and model the database * Set up the Django project (using pre-existing templates when available) * Build RESTful APIs with Django REST Framework * Integrate payment systems (Razorpay, Cashfree, etc.) * Implement WebSocket features if required * Document APIs and coordinate with the frontend intern * Assist with AWS deployment  I had prior experience building a single-vendor eCommerce project as a freelancer, so most of these tasks aren‚Äôt new to me. The only real learning I‚Äôve done so far is related to AWS deployment.  What‚Äôs bothering me is how *hands-off* the whole experience is, I rarely get any feedback or discussion around my code quality or architectural decisions. I just complete my tasks, push the code, and move on.  Is this normal for internships at small startups? Should I stick around for the experience on paper, or look for something that offers more mentorship and technical growth?",

I know it sounds like red pill bs, but women can use (arranged) marriage for upwards mobility, men can't.  The solution to that is workplace equality, but that's easier said than done. But a lot of women don't even want that. So arranged marriage is a compromise between women who don't wanna get involved in the workforce and the men OP described.

What they compromise on and how much depends on their partners.  This post is extremely one sided and not representative of reality because love marriages are almost as common as arranged marriage. Some communities have more, others less.   Also, if arranged marriages are removed from societies, women would need to get married to someone who's not yet settled in life.

Lower echelon men and women also date each other most of the time but lower echelon women also have higher chance of dating average men and women in comparison to lower echelon men.

Also, if men don't get married, women automatically don't get married too.|||This is why I believe in dowry concept it might sound rude but this is what it is. Since, most of the people have their past life and multiple relationships even before marriage these days. And that relation sometimes seems so so deeply rooted that it becomes difficult to forget. Some are involved in extramarital affairs as well. Then there's bitterness in the present married life and relations with family of husband. Now assume if her husband was single till the marriage for a perfect wife but what he got? Nothing but mental tension afterwards.   The psychological impact a normal people can't even bear. And sometimes girls even planned to marry a rich guy just for money and then divorce and get alimony which she'll spend with her lover. Sometimes, she even plans to kill her husband to get out of that thing. This is freaking crazy how people are thinking this way. I'm not justifying that she's the only culprit here but also her ex cum present hidden lover is equally involved.   Now in this situation it's better to live unmarried or take a grand amount as collateral if you are doing an arranged marriage. So that it will be easier for alimony.   You might call me bias but the thing is different. If we alternate the situation like a groom will have to leave his home and settle with bride forever, and if alimony should be paid by the bride after getting divorced, yeah a groom should have to give dowry as the collateral.   Fun fact: Love marriages crash faster than arranged ones. It‚Äôs like 1 v 1 versus many v many, so too many players in the latter provide team support üòÖ during clashes. Honestly, better to stay single‚Ä¶ or marry someone who doesn‚Äôt try to wrestle your ego.      Nepal and India(depending upon urbanization)   Arranged marriage divorce rate: <5%  Love marriage divorce rate: 35-50%|||You can't blame just men on this. Our society did not evolve to interact with women in that way. There were already a lot of segregation on men an women. Again, nothing could help if the person does not have charm.|||I hate gender war , just get some fuckin job.|||aafno teen and adult life ma matra ho...KT haru purai delusional hunchan like they can pull anyone vanera ..yes they can pull ( only to date ) but the reality is KTA lai vanda KT haru lai marriage ekdam garo parcha because they don't want to date average MEN always looking for above their level but the competition is too high.

Most men would rather call it \"hating on men\" or talk badly about women instead of rising to the occassion and actually trying to do and be better. It's not just a Nepal thing, though. The same thing is happening everywhere. Marriage isn't a means for money or safety anymore as it used to be. Women now are independent and can handle their own finances It's not even about social standing anymore, the patriarchal lines of hierarchy are slowly but surely getting blurred.   Nowadays, marriage is about partnership, trust, companionship, love and respect. Most men haven't understood that and would rather blame women as being \"gold diggers\" than realize that it's not the money (or the lack thereof) that influences the attitudes of women towards them.  Remember that we have an ever increasing **male loneliness epidemic** and it's not for no reason.|||The reason behind me not knowing how to approach woman is because of their parents who were mostly arrangely married and never allowed/encouraged their sons to do so|||Mate who gives a shit how people marry? let em marry arranged or by falling in love, as long as both parties consent who cares how good or bad they are at getting in a relationship|||Haha kta le matra bihe garne hora both party share equal part in this|||Girl has a lot of priorities.

When you cut off the expectations, you feel more happier and contained with yourself. You begin to prioritize, be selfish and learn more about people. I have the same situation. Accept that I left home 2 years back. First year was really difficult. This year also, I shifted in a new city. My aunty just bought me dry ass cookies and call it a day. I begin to hide my birthday and treat myself biryani,¬† ice cream and stuff. And why just birthday? I try to make my every moment special. I try to treat myself the most special person in this world. And people are getting attracted to me these days. But I don't care at all. I am just focused on my goals. People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within. And people don't understand that simple thing.ü§£ü§£ü§£|||Yesterday it was mine birthday too but same situation.|||Happy belated birthdayyyyy|||mero nii birthday aaudai xaa wish gara la mallai on  November 4 nai birse bro . anyways dhillo bhaye Pani wish gare haii Happy birthday dai/dd|||Happy Belated Birthday <3|||Meroni thyo hijo.

Each one of them tried to scam, trick, avoid and lie their way through various things.    I made connections with each and everyone of them and helped them establish understanding that things do not get handed to them.   The concept to the OP post is not far off. Get up, have a goal and be driven. However, do not lie, cheat, steal or ask for money. If you are kind - you will see kindness shown back.   Of the 3 boys - one is getting deported. IRCC is the least of your worries. Its the boarder patrol services you should be concerned about if you try anything illegal - even a small one once to a kind Canadain.   Im glad I didnt turn my back but im also glad that somes awareness is bringing to light.    P.s. Don't pretend to be gay either - thats fraudulent and also solictitaion of sex and goes against your agreement with going abroad. Be careful fellas.   also - why only is this post geared to boys ?

You don't need to dominate. You can also just aim for a comfortable life. If everyone is striving to dominate instead of collaborate, imagine how awful the world would be.   Be mentally tough re lol. Like mental toughness is something one can just learn. It comes with experience, dealing with hardships. It's not something you can just build at home. \"Read and learn every single day\" LOL.   Even in Nepal bills and rent don't wait. People don't feel sorry for you anywhere, even more so in Nepal where you are actually expected to spend so much on relatives and friends.   It's just a different country. Yes, it will be hard but it isn't a warzone.|||Boys and girls, Work hard and enjoy your life too while doing that.

Women get advice about Men from women. And VV for men. This is the reason why women try wearing the most bizzare outfits, just to keep the attention of their romantic interest, without the realization of how they and the Girl in the Dance bar are wearing the same clothes but in different crowds. No Offense to the Girls from dance bars... they figured out that seducing a man is easy with vulgarity.  For 1 moment imagine, If you dont get the ring after all the effort women put in for the guy they are trying to impress. And how is this person in 1 sentence discounting all the women that get arranged married. Are they getting love and the guy getting arranged alone???

While his toxic fans can be charged for their online hate and threat, so can be idiots who disregarding court's ruling call him rapist or someone who goes after minor.

Is that right and fair? No. From my perspective, any individual who weren't okay with the comments passed on them, whether a girl or a guy, has a right to express their dissatisfaction. And I think they should too. So that this won't be an issue in upcoming days, and anyone would think twice before commenting and degrading someone ON A PUBLIC PLATFORM.   Regarding Sandeep case, they used the name of Sandeep, and commented on him. A man of his public fame, you are bound to get the public reaction. If you say he is good, you might have gotten praises from the herd public, but you tried to say 'dark jokes' on his expense. He expressed his dissatisfaction and then came the HUGE public reaction.   I don't know why most are saying girls cannot choose who to date, or say I don't want to date him. I don't think this is the reason. **The comments passed regarding 'why', and the laughters were the reason.** If there were no such comments, I don't think such huge support would have garnered on his favor.   And I also saw those saying Sandeep should save those girls from online harassment, else he is worse. I kind of agree that he could, but he SHOULD? I don't know about that. Do I support such harassment or comments on them? NO. All of them saying 'violent' threats should be prosecuted. If the ladies want to, they can complaint, and express their dissatisfaction too. It is very valid, and I would be supportive of it too. But when you are okay with commenting about big personalities, I believe you should expect the wave of reactions you might get.

Similarly, reports of Chirayu Hospital show that he also suffers from asthma,\" the bench said.¬†The hospital has provided the prison with Malla‚Äôs medical diagnosis. Malla has been diagnosed with hypertension, severe depression with adjustment disorder, along with asthma, leading to blood pressure and oxygen saturation problems. However, doctors unaffiliated to Chirayu Hospital say that it is unlikely that Malla is suffering from all the problems stated in the diagnosis.  [https://nepalitimes.com/opinion/i-speak-nothing-but-the-truth-your-honour](https://nepalitimes.com/opinion/i-speak-nothing-but-the-truth-your-honour)  >For example, in the hit-and-run case of Prithvi Bahadur Malla, in the police interview, Malla confessed that as a result of partying and sleep deprivation he briefly dosed off while driving and ended up hitting the pedestrian. At court he stated that the steering wheel of his car locked and the vehicle swung into the wrong lane hitting the pedestrian. Judge Surya Prasad Adhikari admitted his testimony to the court (as opposed to the police) as evidence. When stories change so dramatically there is nothing a suspect will verify off of their own accord.¬†  The district court‚Äôs sentence was overturned by the High Court but still just a 4 year sentence for drunk driving homicide? No action has been taken against the judge who imposed a six month sentence. Shouldn‚Äôt that be grounds for disbarment? The High Court‚Äôs full judgment and charge sheet was never released.

They had been sitting in the hotel and having lunch and beer before the accident. They had left the hotel around 5:20 pm after having beer and lunch at the Admire Cafe in Biratnagar-5. The car was being driven by MP Karki's son Rabin Singh Karki.  >The police were investigating the incident where Karki had been driving under the influence of alcohol. The police submitted the investigation report to the government prosecutor's office that Karki, who had been drinking beer at the Admire Cafe in Biratnagar-5, had hit Das at the airport mode.  >However, the police did not conduct a physical examination of Karki, saying that Karki had fled immediately after the accident. Based on the statements given by Karki's friends and the hotel owner, the police concluded that Karki had also consumed alcohol. In fact, 4 other people had also fled immediately after the accident.  >Rabin surrendered himself to the police three days after the accident. Three days later, when Karki was arrested, a medical examination could not prove whether he had been drunk on the day of the accident. Although the medical report could not confirm the intoxication, the statements of the hotel owner and the people in the car indicated that Karki, who was driving the car, had admitted to being drunk.  >Cafe owner Pankaj Sah, in his statement to the police, said that Karki and his friends had consumed 16 beers.  >Sah wrote in the statement, \"...When Rabin Karki called me and asked me to give him beer, fish and meat, as well as cigarettes, I gave them a total of 16 Mustang beers, fish and meat, and other things they had ordered.\"  >Not only Sah, but Raman Adhikari, who was inside the car when the accident occurred, also admitted to being drunk. He said in his statement, \"While going to the car, we went to Admire Cafe after being advised by the sir to eat food. Richu Giri did not eat, we all ate food including fish and meat and beer.\"  >Based on the statements of Karki's friends and the hotel owner, the police concluded that Karki had also consumed alcohol. Despite the lack of a medical examination report, a case was registered at the Morang District Court, alleging that Karki had caused the accident by driving under the influence of alcohol, based on his statement.  >Based on the police report, the District Attorney's Office, Morang, filed a case in the Morang District Court on June 15, 2078, claiming that the accident occurred due to drunk driving.   The District Attorney's Office had demanded punishment for Karki under Section 161(2) of the Vehicle Act 2049 on the basis of drunk driving.  >According to Section 161(2) of the Vehicle Act, if someone dies within 21 days of the accident due to reckless driving, the driver will be imprisoned for 3 years to 10 years and fined between Rs 30,000 and Rs 100,000.  >The Government Attorney's Office had termed the accident as negligence because the accident occurred due to drunk driving. The next day after the case was filed, i.e. on June 16, a closed-door hearing was held in the District Court. The District Court ordered that Rabin Karki be sent to prison for remand.  >After Karki was sent to remand for remand, the hearing resumed in the Morang District Court on September 20. During the hearing, Karki's side claimed that the accident was not due to drunk driving but due to a burst tire. Senior advocate Suresh Lal Shrestha and advocate duo Bharat Bahadur Thapa and Hari Bahadur Shrestha tried to prove that the accident occurred due to a burst tire.  >However, the district court rejected the claim that the accident occurred due to a burst tire. Three months after Karki was sent to prison, on Asoj 13, the Morang District Court found Karki guilty. However, it did not determine the punishment.  >About a week after Karki was found guilty, on Asoj 19, District Judge Sudarshan Lamichhane sentenced Rabin Karki to 3 years in prison and a fine of 35,000. Judge Lamichhane sentenced him to 3 years in prison and a fine of 35,000 for causing death by driving under the influence of alcohol under Section 161(2) of the Vehicle Act 2049 BS.  >\"The facts and evidence clearly show that the defendant Rabin Singh Karki was driving a car at a high speed while under the influence of alcohol and hit Mukesh Sharma Das and Rajkumar Rajbanshi, who were walking on the roadside, due to which the car went out of control and crashed into Mukesh Sharma Das and Rajkumar Rajbanshi, who were walking on the roadside. Mukesh Sharma Das died from the same injuries and Ram Kumar Rajbanshi's left hand was broken and amputated. Therefore, it is held that the defendant Rabin Singh Karki committed the offense as per the prosecution's claim under Section 161, Sub-section 2 of the Vehicle and Transport Management Act 2049 and Sub-section 1 of 162 of the same Act,\" the verdict states.  >Karki was given only the minimum punishment for driving a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and causing death. The Morang District Court also explained the reason for imposing the minimum punishment. Karki is a social activist. The district court had clarified that the minimum punishment was imposed on Karki because he is a young man and does not have any other bad conduct.  >The Morang District Court was lenient towards Rabin Singh Karki and imposed only the minimum punishment. However, the Karki side was not satisfied with the district court's decision. They approached the Biratnagar High Court against the district court's decision.  >On 22 Kartik 2078, the Karki side approached the Biratnagar High Court against the district court's decision. The main purpose of the appeal was to confirm that the Karki side did not commit the offence.  >If it is possible to prove that the accident was caused by a technical fault and not by human error, then Sub-section 3 of Section 161 of the Road Traffic Act should be used. That is, if a person dies while driving without any negligence, there is a provision in Sub-section 3 that a maximum punishment of 1 year is imposed.  >The High Court, on the issue of the district causing the accident due to drunkenness, found that the accident occurred due to a burst tire. Based on that, the bench of Justices Krishna Kamal Adhikari and Jagat Narayan Pradhan of the High Court partially overturned the district court's decision, saying that the accident occurred due to a burst tire  >. 'It is natural for a vehicle that is on the verge of a sudden burst tire to shake and it can be easily assumed that an accident could occur in such a situation. Mukesh Das died because the vehicle went out of control after the tire burst and the accident occurred,' the High Court's decision, proving that the accident occurred due to a burst tire, wrote, 'The fact that the defendant was driving on his own side and caught the tire and caused the accident has been established.'  >Three months after the district court sentenced him to three years in prison, on 20 December 2078, the high court sentenced Karki to six months and 15 days in prison and a fine of Rs 2,000. The high court's decision states that Karki was not under the influence of alcohol while driving.  >**Karki obtained his license while he was in jail,**   but one thing was left out of these arguments and arguments of the two courts. The issue that the court did not consider was Karki's driving license. The police also emphasized only whether Karki had consumed alcohol or not during the investigation. The investigation regarding Karki's driving license was weak.  >Despite knowing that the person driving the vehicle was Rabin Singh Karki, the police were able to take Karki under control only after 3 days as a fugitive. That is, Karki, who was also an accused, had surrendered himself to the police office.  >It is not difficult to say that Karki surrendered to the police only after it could not be confirmed from a medical point of view that he had consumed alcohol. That is why the high court decided that the accident occurred due to a burst tire, not due to alcohol.  >Although Karki gave a statement confirming that he did not have a license, the investigating agency and the prosecuting government attorney's office did not inquire much about the driver's license.  >**How did the relevant agency fail to investigate the issue of not having a license?**  >In the statement given during the investigation, Rabin Singh Karki had said that he had obtained his motorcycle and car licenses from the Transport Management Office, Koshi. However, he had said that he did not remember his license number.  >In the District Court, Morang, he said, 'I have obtained A and B driver's licenses from the Transport Management Office, Koshi. I do not know the driver's license number at present.'  >Although he said that he had obtained the license from Koshi, Karki did not actually have a license. In fact, Karki obtained his license from the Ekantakuna License Office in Lalitpur, the federal capital, Kathmandu, that too when he was in jail due to an accident.  >Karki's mother, MP Bindiya Karki, arranged for her son, who was in jail, to get a driver's license.  >After getting the driver's license from the federal capital, Karki changed his statement. Initially, Karki stated that he had obtained the driver's license from the Koshi Zonal Transport Office, but later said that he had obtained the license from Bagmati.  >According to the Morang District Court's decision, MP Karki had submitted a photocopy of the government receipt showing that his son had obtained the driver's license in the court.  >After his mother obtained the driver's license from Bagmati, Karki changed his statement, saying, \"I mistakenly stated in question 9 of my previous statement that I had obtained the driver's license from the Transport Management Office, Koshi. I have obtained a Class B transport driver's license from the Transport Management Office, Bagmati. My Class B driver's license number is 01-06-00542589, and the date of issue is 2075.7.12.\"  >When the court asked him to produce the driver's license, Karki said that the license was lost. In his statement, he said, \"I lost the original copy of my driver's license about a year ago while coming home from Kathmandu to Biratnagar, and I have not been able to get it back because I have not been able to go to Kathmandu to get it back due to the coronavirus pandemic.\"  >However, Nepal Khabar's investigation has shown that Karki obtained the driver's license incorrectly. While Karki was in jail, a driver's license was issued in his name from a secluded corner of the Transport Management Office.  >Physical presence is required when filling out the license form. However, Karki's photo appears to be inconsistent in the details of the driver's license issued in Karki's name. The office's source said that there was a mistake in Karki's license.  >Karki had stated during his statement that he had obtained the driver's license on Kartik 12, 2075. That is, he had stated that he had obtained the license on October 29, 2018. According to the department's details, Karki's trial was held on April 13, 2018. And, the registration number of the application he submitted to the department was 67095432.  >However, this application was not in Karki's name, but in the name of Bhesh Bahadur Majhi. The computer details contained a driver's license in Karki's name, but in the other file, an application was found for Bhesh Bahadur Majhi.  >According to the department's details, Majhi had failed in his application for a driving license. However, it seems that Karki, who was made on the basis of the same application, got a driving license.  >'Amma, you're the one who got the license, man. This is a game of chance.'  >He tried to explain to me, 'Listen, sir, now I understand. Bhesh Bahadur Majhi had also failed. Someone created a license using the same failed ID in a two-digit way. In fact, this license may not be with anyone who has issued the license, but when necessary, it is shown in the name of the person who needs it.  >In fact, Bhesh Bahadur Majhi failed in the trial. His application was issued a driving license using the RID. However, after the High Court's decision, the same driving license in Karki's name appears in someone else's name.  >Initially, the driving license in Bhesh Bahadur's name reached Karki's name. After the High Court's decision, the license in Karki's name was found in the name of Sahadev Gajmer. The next day after the permit was received in Gajmer's name, it was returned to Karki's name. And, the photo previously placed in Karki's details was also changed.  >After confirming with the source, Nepal Khabar also confirmed this matter through the office. Using the Right to Information.  >'.....Since the court has made the details public along with the order, it is desirable to provide the information for journalistic purposes as per Article 27 of the Constitution of Nepal, the Right to Information Act 2064 and the Rules of the Act 2065.'  >The office then gave the information along with a copy of the transcript from the then trial. Where it is clearly written '...As per the attendance record of the examination and the experimental check list, the details seen in the name of Bhesh Bahadur Majhi are requested. Also, a certified copy of his check list and attendance is provided with this letter.'

The case made national headlines after the high-end car allegedly driven by the 17-year-old boy in an inebriated state mowed down motorcycle-borne IT professionals Anish Awadhiya and Ashwini Costa in the Kalyani Nagar area on May 19 last year.  >\"Last year‚Äôs Porsche car crash case sparked widespread discussions about Pune‚Äôs deteriorating social culture, alleged police corruption, and several other issues. Amid all the criticism, one positive aspect stood out: the case exposed systemic corruption.  >The boy who allegedly caused the accident was 17 years old, and he got relief and is out. But his mother was in jail for 14 months. His father has been in jail for the last 17-18 months. The doctors and staff of the Sassoon Hospital have also been in jail for 18 months.  >Many things were said:¬†Pune‚Äôs culture has been ruined, Pune police and society are corrupt, etc. But in all this criticism, one good thing emerged. Whatever systemic corruption was present there, it got exposed.‚Äù Kumar said the police investigation exposed the ‚Äúcomplete racket‚Äù that had changed the blood samples.  >The blood samples of the minor, collected at Sassoon General Hospital, were allegedly swapped with his mother‚Äôs to show that he was not drunk. The police arrested the minor‚Äôs parents, two doctors, and a hospital staff member for their involvement in the sample swapping.  >While it is true that the probe brought to light alleged cover-ups in the case, the police also not covered themselves in glory in the case. In fact, the conduct of police officers at the Yerwada police station, where the accused was taken after the accident, had also come under heavy fire at the time. The late collection of blood samples for alcohol testing, along with the involvement of then MLA Sunil Tingre, raised allegations of ‚ÄúVIP treatment‚Äù.",

Rather, in his essay, he defined ‚Äúhistory‚Äù in a broad sense: as a clash of ideological frameworks for how to legitimately govern societies.  >As Fukuyama noted, the 20th century saw immense change on this front. Democracies were rare at the start of the century, and fascism rose as an alternative model‚Äîembraced by regimes that later killed millions of people. World War II settled the democracy vs. fascism debate, for a time.  >Then, during the Cold War, communism challenged democracy, with the Soviet Union presenting a rival model for governance that was adopted by large swaths of the world. However, the Soviet Union collapsed, and the 1990s became a period of surging global democracy. In particular, much of Africa and Eastern Europe moved toward democracy.      >Fukuyama argued that the end of the Cold War‚Äîand the triumph of the democratic West‚Äîwould signal ‚ÄúThe End of History‚Äù in the sense that rival models to democracy had been defeated, relegated to the dust bin of history. Everyone, everywhere, would soon accept that democracy was the legitimate form of government.  >Was he right? The answer is more surprising than you might think. And it lies with a concept that I‚Äôve coined in my research, called *counterfeit democracy*.  > Most people think of democracy as a binary‚Äîyou‚Äôre either a democracy, or you‚Äôre a dictatorship (which political scientists sometimes call *autocracies*). In reality, regimes exist on a spectrum. On one end, you‚Äôve got the consolidated democracies, such as New Zealand, Japan, Denmark, Costa Rica, and Finland. On the other, you‚Äôve got the full-blown dictatorships, such as North Korea, Turkmenistan, and Equatorial Guinea.  >In recent years, global democracy has declined‚Äîin just about every index ‚Äîsince around 2006 (there‚Äôs nothing magical about this date; it‚Äôs just when more countries began lurching toward authoritarianism than the number of countries moving toward democracy on the spectrum).  >**Forgeries and Fake Democracy**  >But here‚Äôs the crucial shift: everyone *pretends* to be a democracy now, even the totalitarian dictators.  >Have you ever noticed that countries that are often awful regimes have *democratic* in their names? (The official name of North Korea is the *Democratic* People's Republic of Korea; East Germany was the German *Democratic* Republic; and the *Democratic* Republic of Congo is lying about two of the four words in its name). But those countries don‚Äôt/didn‚Äôt fool anyone. They‚Äôre straight up dictatorships, no matter the labels used.  >However, there has been a major rise in the number of in-between countries, those that have the trappings of democracy, but that, when push comes to shove, are authoritarian. I call these the *counterfeit democracies* and it‚Äôs a group that comprises, in my view, the majority of countries in the world. Within this group, you‚Äôve got countries like Hungary, Turkey, the Philippines, Madagascar, Tunisia, and countless others. They‚Äôre fake democracies, authoritarian wolves in the sheep‚Äôs clothing of democracy.  >**Many have wrongly condemned Fukuyama‚Äôs End of History argument as being naive and misguided, proven embarrassingly wrong by the** ***democratic backsliding*** **that has comprised recent global political history. How can Fukuyama be right if democracy is declining rather than surging? But his central claim‚Äîthat democracy would prevail as the consensus legitimate form of government globally‚Äîhas been proven correct by the rise of counterfeit democracies.**  >In the past, authoritarian regimes didn‚Äôt pretend to be democratic. Why bother masquerading? Now, almost all countries hold elections, and they pretend to have rule of law and other core institutions of democracy, hoping that everyone‚Äîincluding their citizens‚Äîwill be fooled by the forgery. For, like a counterfeit bank note, it only works insofar as some people believe it‚Äôs real.  >Some, such as Hungary‚Äôs Viktor Orb√°n, have tried to coin their own word, putting a positive spin on their embrace of authoritarianism. He calls it ‚Äúilliberal democracy,‚Äù which, like ‚Äúworking vacation,‚Äù is an oxymoron. If a country is illiberal‚Äîand it doesn‚Äôt have the core institutions of liberal democracy, such as a free press, rule of law, protections for minorities, and freedom of speech, religion, and assembly‚Äîthen it‚Äôs not a democracy. It‚Äôs that simple. After all, who cares if there are elections if they‚Äôre rigged, or if the winner of those elections doesn‚Äôt ever gain meaningful power?  >**Counterfeit Democracy in Action**  >How does counterfeit democracy work in practice? This dynamic is on display now in Thailand, a country that looks like it‚Äôs on the [precipice of a major upheaval](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Thai-election/Thailand-s-pro-democracy-coalition-mulls-next-steps-without-Pita) and significant volatility, even though it‚Äôs not being covered much in the Western press. I‚Äôve spent many months living in Thailand and researching its politics (it‚Äôs the most coup-prone country in the world over the last century). And the Thai pattern is one that is becoming familiar to counterfeit democracies, because they‚Äôre learning from each other.  >In Thailand, the story goes like this: a popular insurgent reformer takes on the establishment. Despite barriers put in place to stop them, they win an election, sometimes in a landslide. But then, the reformer tries to dismantle outdated structures of power, taking aim at the old guard. So, the old guard punches back, making sure that the reformer doesn‚Äôt reach power, or ends up being forced out of power in a military coup. This playbook has been used to exile, jail, disqualify‚Äîeven kill‚Äîdissidents who have taken on Thailand‚Äôs entrenched dinosaurs.  >In this instance, a young, reformist party called the Move Forward Party shocked Thailand watchers by winning the elections in May. The party‚Äôs leader, [Pita Limjaroenrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pita_Limjaroenrat), should have easily taken power as the prime minister.  >Instead, surprise, surprise, Thailand‚Äôs military junta had changed the constitution. Now, to become prime minister, you need to win over much of the Senate, which due to ‚Äúreforms‚Äù instituted under the military general-turned-prime minister who has been in charge since 2014, is directly appointed by Thailand‚Äôs military. The Senate just blocked Pita from taking power, and barred him from seeking the role again.  >**This is the** ***modus operandi*** **of counterfeit democracies: make changes that ensure that you can have elections without real democracy. Rig the elections if you must, or, better yet, make them meaningless. Just in case your rivals get into power, fill the courts with loyalists, who will strike down legislation they pass (this one hits a bit too close to home with the United States at the moment, though it‚Äôs far more severe in most countries). Intimidate the press, either by using violence‚Äîas in Russia and Turkey‚Äîor by demonizing them relentlessly.**  >This is why all the institutions that traditionally produce accountability‚Äîdissidents, the press, independent courts, and free and fair elections‚Äîare the first targets of would-be despots.|||Atti babbal research thank you|||Paul shah ko ne video halana yar kati Sandip ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ gareko hun|||Isn‚Äôt that same Sapna Pradhan Malla (close to UML) going to become the next chief justice in a few months?|||Irrelevant but If anyone here is gay/ bi man in Kathmandu hmu.

            "body": "So,today in our computer science class,our teacher started teaching HTML. I‚Äôve studied computer engineering-technical stream during grades 9 and 10. In those two years, I learned C, C++, PHP, DSA with C++, SQL, HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. Later on, I learned more about JavaScript, started exploring Node.js,Python, tried using Hugging Face, and even built a few projects with Node and Express for the backend. Now, having HTML in our grade 11 course honestly feels like I‚Äôm revisiting my grade 8 syllabus. I‚Äôll share the publication‚Äôs name later, but even back in grade 8, we covered quite a lot about HTML. In grade 9, we had a web development book too. Even my friends in the general stream who took computer as a subject learned HTML and CSS. I‚Äôm not trying to sound selfish or act like I know everything. I just happen to have gained more technical knowledge over the years. I have friends who are studying computer for the first time and some who don‚Äôt even know how to open or save files and that‚Äôs completely fine. Not everyone knows everything, and I fully understand that. Also, our current computer book doesn‚Äôt include topics that match today‚Äôs trends. What‚Äôs relevant now? AI, isn‚Äôt it? But the book still focuses heavily on history like the first to fifth generation of computers which we‚Äôve been studying since grade 6. I‚Äôm now in grade 11, and it feels like the curriculum developers have made a huge mistake. This is high school, not middle school anymore.  now, the real story begins:-  But when we talk about the majority, most of us have already studied HTML before. But....Yes, HTML should  be included in the syllabus, but it shouldn‚Äôt be given more time than CSS. In our book, CSS has only one titled topic! Since I started learning CSS, I realized that most of those old HTML attributes aren‚Äôt even relevant anymore once you know CSS, everything changes so fast and becomes much easier. Honestly, I felt like I was time-traveling to the 90s when they made us use Notepad üò≠. I understand that the course has to be suitable for everyone, but still, that‚Äôs how I felt. So, I downloaded VS Code becausebelieve it or not it wasn‚Äôt even installed on the school computers. After that, I worked on a few things there, but mostly I used W3Schools web-editor üò≠ since the lab teacher was walking around watching everyone. At first, I felt kind of bored, but later I thought calmly ‚ÄúYeah i  already know html it's something i‚Äôve learned many times before and i don‚Äôt use Notepad anymore(for webdevüò≠)but I chose computer science over biology because computer never stresses me out. I can stay chill and still get time for other subjects‚Äù then I looked around and saw my friend sitting next to me struggling to type simple symbols like ‚Äú<‚Äù and ‚Äú/‚Äù. I always help him in computer class, so I felt like I should again help him especially since today‚Äôs topic was something I knew perfectly. While the teacher was explaining headings (h1‚Äìh6) and other tags, I quickly opened W3Schools. It took me less than a minute to build a complete structure: headings from h1 to h6, a few other tags like subscript, superscript, marquee, and more just to help him understand better. I taught him step by step, and he actually learned faster than most others who were just copying from the board. Some students were getting scolded for not doing anything, but the teachers didn‚Äôt say a word to me probably because they knew I already had some knowledge and had seen me helping my friends before. They even ignored the fact that I downloaded VS Code and was using it later üòÖ By the end, I had helped a few more friends too helped them to understand the concept. BUt,idk how what started as a boring session with Notepad turned into a really fun two-hour lab where I got to teach and help others. I still don‚Äôt know how my mood shifted from feeling exhausted to genuinely enjoying it.",

The funding that has been availed through Carbon Purchase as well as NGOs and INGOs have also played a critical role. I don't remember exactly, but UNDP or something published a really great report on the success of community forests and improvement of forested areas in Nepal.   Actually Nepal despite everything and has had excellent metrics when it comes to nature and biodiversity conservation.|||Folks who grew up in the 90s may remember efforts put into forest conservation through media. Maha Jodi ko BannPale. Impressionable ads like an old woman carrying doko vari ko daura and wondering ‚ÄúAja lai ta taryo voli k garne?‚Äù We have done a lot in the field of forest and wildlife conservation. Amidst all the negative things lets commend ourselves on this for once. Hamro Community based Forest Preservation program (Samudayik Bann) is a leading example in the world.|||\"Hariyo ban Nepal ko dhan\" massive initiative is Main reason. This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it. You can hear the news for development work and of NEA cannot cut down the trees easily, yup that is because of same strong protective law.|||It‚Äôs because of movement of people and reliance on gas, concrete instead of timber.|||No , it‚Äôs a result of migration of people from hills to concentrated cities and Terai .

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts. So, yeah definitely a result of afforestation but there is more to this and would be a great topic to delve deep into.|||what about terai ko char koshe jhadi?|||It‚Äôs meant to highlight the loss of ice and glaciers.

The main issue is the lack of a strong support system and consistent government backing for innovation and startups. For a long time, India didn‚Äôt create the right environment to make full use of its skilled people.  Now, about whether India is catching up to China in tech not quite yet. Chinese engineers are incredibly skilled, and China still has a big edge in infrastructure, funding, and startup ecosystems. Right now, India sits at number three, behind the U.S. and China, in the global tech scene. But give it another 20‚Äì25 years, and India could very well take the second spot, right after China.  That said, India‚Äôs future looks bright. The liberalization policies and the country‚Äôs strong emphasis on education have built a solid foundation. Institutions like the IITs, AIIMS, and IIMs have produced some of the best minds in engineering, medicine, and business. These people are driving not just India‚Äôs growth but also global innovation. With an open economy, a thriving startup culture, and millions of ambitious young people, India is steadily moving toward becoming one of the leading technology and economic powers of the world behind China.|||Is there another Microsoft in China though?|||India chai haina China le chai banauxa arko MS    They are good at creating and that works too   India on other hand will send huge skilled resources tara banauna chai sakdaina hai   India ko IT market thulo xa    ani China ko le ta duniya nai chalya xa hai   reminded of some so called nepali techfluencers haru    Nepal lai IT hub banayera tech revolution lyaune    some dude from NASIT (shitty association of IT comanies of Nepal)|||Well Indians are great at tech that's a fact we can't deny that.

You will find Nepali, Iranian, Indian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, and others working in the US.  From my experience, I can tell you that the Chinese are the most competent ones. My advisor is Chinese, and she is so demanding and well-versed that I can't explain. Indians don't even come close to their skills and competence. So, to answer no, they aren't.|||‚ÄúPeople believe anything when it‚Äôs put between quotation marks.‚Äù   ‚Äî *Abraham Linkon*|||India's vaunted software industry has outsourced the least technologically demanding and most labor-intensive parts of the European and American software industries. The reality is that India lacks internet giants, nor does it have widely used software applications. Even the major software applications developed domestically are from the US. While you could argue that Indians participated in the development of these applications, it's still not Indian software. This isn't entirely bad, however. The internet industry is dominated by only two major players: the US and China. Even Europe and Japan have seen their internet industries and talent drained by the US. For example, in the electric vehicle industry, Chinese electric vehicle companies are internet giants, while German electric vehicle companies are industrial giants. Germany's lack of internet talent forces it to partner with Chinese companies for technology, whereas 30 years ago, China partnered with German automakers due to a lack of technology. Before his death, Henry Kissinger expressed concern about Europe's extreme lack of long-term strategic planning. Many Europeans still fail to grasp this reality, their thinking still mired in outdated Cold War thinking, which sees a Soviet Union as the scapegoat for all their mistakes. India and many other countries haven't fared any better than Europe.|||Bro been working with Indians for last 2 years. 90% of them are \"Kaam chorr\".|||1. Indians are indeed good at replicating pre-existing products. 2. With a population of 1.4 Billion - India has the market  for growth not just for tech companies but any international company looking to increase their revenues (CAGR and what not). 3.

I help with initial screening sometimes and I see intern resumes with 1-2 years of experience and seriously amazing projects these days and even those aren't getting ROs. The market is heavily skewed rn, like I saw a resume with 4 years experience,  lot of official blogs and solutions published applying for an associate level position.   I say keep grinding and work on GenAI projects. That's what the upper management wants to see these days. Referrals won't be that helpful if you're getting screened out before getting a call.|||[removed]|||FAANG?   get some hands on experience at real companies and projects.  It's competitive and everyone else is smarter than everyone else üôåüèΩ|||I think its better to communicate in indian sub Reddit|||Now I am thinking why do nepali youths are not into FAANG thing? Unlike Indians?   We are not competitive enough? OR We are not Intrested enough?|||2x summer intern in faang. Oh ur location is india.|||If you are talking about direct recruiting from Nepal,  I don't know so far, but one of my friend and senior from Nepal working at VISA with the level of pay that FAANG and all does. But we studied together at NITR, India.  The process in India itself is top, so it's real hard to get recruited from Nepalese colleges.|||Applying to FAANG from India is not worth it bro. First thing the competition is huge and second thing the pay for FAANG position in India is like what at max 1.5 to 2 Crore if you get lucky. And I seriously believe that the stress to compensation is not worth it.  If it was in the case of USA especially in the bay area, then I would say the grind was worth it because they pay ridiculously high, like even after all the tax cuts and expenses you can save around 100-150k easily in a year given your compensation is 350-400k USD per year and the position is at the bay area.  But competition is tough there too, you need PhDs and all.  But I think it's still better than India. In India nowadays almost like minimum 10 lakhs students have already mugged up at least 300-400 leetcode questions so, chances are slim there.  My advice is target for such positions where the competition is low, grind there for 3-4 years and apply as independent contractors for remote position, you can easily make above 100k if you are sharp.  Then move to Romania applying a digital nomad visa and pay only about flat 10-11% tax for your 100k plus income. Cost of living is also affordable in Romania, soon to be included into schengen and of course after 5 years apply for PR, get the passport and travel freely for vacation. (It's passport is in top ten strongest list)  And this is the most achievable goal and path for a Nepali IT specialist. Even if you get 60k USD remote job in Nepal, it's not worth it because the progressive tax system will make the effective tax to around 30-33% and all your tax for what? Into the belly of corrupt politicians.  Actually it's a bad idea to live in Nepal, the tax is too much. You pay 25% tax and 13% vat for almost everything. Forget about buying vehicles, the added cost is like price of Vehicle(100%) and 80% flat tax + 13% vat + 10-25% profit margin + extraa whatever. You pay more than double for any vehicles.  Bro I'm hoping that the new government will make Nepal similar to a tax haven nation, otherwise I'm leaving Nepal too in next couple of years myself.|||Almost all hiring in India happens through on campus placements. Look at what companies are coming to your campus and prepare for it. Thats why most people are obsessed over getting into good universities there. Off campus hiring, on the other hand, is extremely brutal. Leetcode probably won't be enough. If you're a first year/second year, I'd suggest to start doing Codeforces. You'll thank yourself later on. Don't fret over it, know that resume screening is largely arbitrary. Also, stating the obvious but apply outside of FAANG -- its not what it used to be.|||referral khasai aba work gardaina,tei level ko manche le gareko rahecha bhane work grcha on campus ma focus garaa FAANG target rakha tara oncampus placement focus gara , senior hru huna sakcha FAANG ma try to reach out senior hru le sure rply dinchaa,ma pani google ko 2ndround interview ma reject bhako ,mero sathihru chan FAANG ma opening rahecha bhane you can send me on dm i will send them they will refer you(resume impressive rahecha bhane ATS score 80+ aayeracha bhane)|||Where are you based at ?|||Use your .edu email to sign up in blind and ask for referral there.|||IK someone who is working as Customer Success Manager.

I agree with this.  Wanna hear something more controversial? If we are deconstructing societal values around marriage then women will have it harder than men because society today places implicit \"value\" in women. I know it sounds like red pill bs, but women can use (arranged) marriage for upwards mobility, men can't.  The solution to that is workplace equality, but that's easier said than done. But a lot of women don't even want that. So arranged marriage is a compromise between women who don't wanna get involved in the workforce and the men OP described.

What they compromise on and how much depends on their partners.  This post is extremely one sided and not representative of reality because love marriages are almost as common as arranged marriage. Some communities have more, others less.   Also, if arranged marriages are removed from societies, women would need to get married to someone who's not yet settled in life. If not, they'd have to marry someone who's much older or wait till they're in their late 20s - mid 30s.

Lower echelon men and women also date each other most of the time but lower echelon women also have higher chance of dating average men and women in comparison to lower echelon men.

Also, if men don't get married, women automatically don't get married too.|||This is why I believe in dowry concept it might sound rude but this is what it is. Since, most of the people have their past life and multiple relationships even before marriage these days. And that relation sometimes seems so so deeply rooted that it becomes difficult to forget. Some are involved in extramarital affairs as well. Then there's bitterness in the present married life and relations with family of husband. Now assume if her husband was single till the marriage for a perfect wife but what he got? Nothing but mental tension afterwards.   The psychological impact a normal people can't even bear. And sometimes girls even planned to marry a rich guy just for money and then divorce and get alimony which she'll spend with her lover. Sometimes, she even plans to kill her husband to get out of that thing. This is freaking crazy how people are thinking this way. I'm not justifying that she's the only culprit here but also her ex cum present hidden lover is equally involved.   Now in this situation it's better to live unmarried or take a grand amount as collateral if you are doing an arranged marriage. So that it will be easier for alimony.   You might call me bias but the thing is different. If we alternate the situation like a groom will have to leave his home and settle with bride forever, and if alimony should be paid by the bride after getting divorced, yeah a groom should have to give dowry as the collateral.   Fun fact: Love marriages crash faster than arranged ones. It‚Äôs like 1 v 1 versus many v many, so too many players in the latter provide team support üòÖ during clashes.

Tyo pani when you go through the whole thing, it is pretty easy to make it out that the girl was trying to mint money out of Sandeep. It was a honey trap Bhanera ta sabai lai tha cha.   I don‚Äôt know Sandeep personally and don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs arrogant or k k. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Because that‚Äôs not why he‚Äôs defamed.   Aba you‚Äôll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re. Harek din naya bayaan and naya kahaani. Kt party ko main intention nai was to get as much of compensation as possible rather than punishing Sandeep.   And brought shame to our cricketing fraternity rey? Yo statement batai it‚Äôs easy to assume ki yo post garne eauta kti ho, ki jindagi ma lukera basne kta ho or Bharkhar ko fucche ho.

Sandeep ko ta proper honeytrap thyo, Ronaldo had an actual case against him. But bail payo, where he still continued with his career. Unlike Sandeep, Ronaldo continued with his career. Pachi final verdict afnai favor ma payo.   So did he bring shame to Portugal? To Real Madrid? (at the time of the case) Ani Sandeep le chai kasari?   You put yourself in his shoes. You go out on a date with someone. Everything seems perfect, you guys kiss hug and spend an amazing time together. Belka you guys stay out ani make out. Bholi you drop her home. Then you go out for your work, ani bahira huda nai after a few weeks you find out that girl has filed a complaint for rape against you. What would you do?

When you cut off the expectations, you feel more happier and contained with yourself. You begin to prioritize, be selfish and learn more about people. I have the same situation. Accept that I left home 2 years back. First year was really difficult. This year also, I shifted in a new city. My aunty just bought me dry ass cookies and call it a day. I begin to hide my birthday and treat myself biryani,¬† ice cream and stuff. And why just birthday? I try to make my every moment special. I try to treat myself the most special person in this world. And people are getting attracted to me these days. But I don't care at all. I am just focused on my goals. People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within. And people don't understand that simple thing.ü§£ü§£ü§£|||Yesterday it was mine birthday too but same situation.|||Happy belated birthdayyyyy|||mero nii birthday aaudai xaa wish gara la mallai on  November 4 nai birse bro . anyways dhillo bhaye Pani wish gare haii Happy birthday dai/dd|||Happy Belated Birthday <3|||Meroni thyo hijo.

This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it. You can hear the news for development work and of NEA cannot cut down the trees easily, yup that is because of same strong protective law.|||It‚Äôs because of movement of people and reliance on gas, concrete instead of timber.|||No , it‚Äôs a result of migration of people from hills to concentrated cities and Terai .

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts. So, yeah definitely a result of afforestation but there is more to this and would be a great topic to delve deep into.|||what about terai ko char koshe jhadi?|||It‚Äôs meant to highlight the loss of ice and glaciers.

Nepal still waits.   And many of us wonder: how different might things have been?      If Bipin were from a more powerful nation, would the world have moved faster?   If he held a different passport, would there be answers by now?   If every life were valued equal, would this post even need to exist?      Bipin‚Äôs story is not just one of tragedy.

They called the ‚Äúearn and learn‚Äù program an internship, likely just to bypass foreign employment laws. In reality, it was pure exploitation.

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Nepalese officials and agents charged students exorbitant fees and even took commissions from Israel for these placements.  Amid all the tension and the ongoing hostage crisis, instead of creating real opportunities for students in Nepal or focusing on bringing our people home and supporting those who were released, the government rushed to restart these so-called internships for their own financial gain.

This affectes every country in south Asia including Nepal. That's a problem we should solve. IT's gradually under control I guess.|||Google Bangladesh. And let me know if you found the answer|||Don‚Äôt look up bangladesh/australia. Nepal has average population density.|||Population in SE Asia seems to be quite high in general. I think regarding your question about where the population is concentrated, you will find that the population is scattered throughout the country - everywhere minus above 3000m up the himalayas. Then if you do a deep assessment what % of Perus Land actually has people vs % of Nepal where people reside, you may find the two land sizes may not be off by a magnitude like now when you compare the full size of the country. For eg UK has a landmass of 250k but has a population of 69 mil. That's 2x population of Peru in 1/5th of land. In the other hand australia has a population of 27mil in 7.7mil km2. Russia has 143mil people in 17mil km2 (4x Pop of Peru in 16x land area).  You are also looking at the mercader projection which further makes Nepal look more visually small in the map. Not that it should have any basis when you talk about numbers.   I suppose what I am trying to say is the population may still be high in Nepal but it may not be as high as you think when you factor in livable land in the country. Total land mass alone is not a great indicator.|||Fertile land, fertile people, most are on terai belt. Look at india and bangladesh, how densely populated they all are.

Nepal ain't no heaven land but I would say the climate is very hospitable.|||Tokyo has 14 million people in 2,194 km ¬≤|||Such a great question. Most of the people are concentrated in the cities and in the low lands where theres lots of rivers and fertile land till 1990s people procreate and like crazy plus modern medicine less infant mortality and less knowledge of contraceptives. Also temperate climate.|||Time zones bro.|||Look at bangaldesh's area and population. You'll be shocked my guy|||The reported surface area of a country is always the 2D surface area. It calculated on a flat, two-dimensional plane, not by measuring the surface area of its mountains, hills, and valleys. The total land area of a country is determined by projecting its borders onto a standardized reference surface, typically an ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the Earth.      Nepal is roughly a \\~1000 km long, and 150 km wide and so the approximate area of 150 sq km.   Now if you count the mountains and valleys that covers like 70% of that 2D area, the actual habitable space is order of magnitide larger. maybe even 50x.   So the actual living space is quite a lot for mountainous country like Nepal. I would imagine same for Peru.|||You know about canada?|||You should have started with Bangladesh and it's population density.  Regardless, depends on how fertile and navigable the lands are.

In very rare, exceptional cases, NTC may have options for extremely large accidental top-ups, though the taxes already paid to the government make a full reversal highly complex. * **Attempt a formal complaint through the digital wallet:**¬†If they used a digital wallet like eSewa or Khalti, they should file a complaint with that wallet provider. These wallets can act as intermediaries and request a reversal from¬†[Nepal Telecom](https://www.ntc.net.np/), though ultimately, NTC controls the outcome.¬†  Long-term strategies for using the balance  Since a refund is almost certainly not an option, the best approach is to recover the value over time by converting the credit back into cash.  * **Offer balance transfers to friends and family:**¬†The¬†Reddit user¬†can offer to transfer balance to friends and family in exchange for cash. This is a common and reliable method of liquidating NTC balance.    * **Balance transfer limits:**¬†NTC allows up to 20 transfers per day, with a maximum of Rs. 500 per transfer.    * **Execution:**¬†They can use the NTC mobile app or the USSD code¬†`*422*SecurityCode*RecipientNumber*Amount#`¬†to initiate transfers. * **Offer mobile top-ups in the local community:**¬†For people who prefer cash transactions, the user can act as an unofficial recharge agent. They can offer to top up people's phones in exchange for cash, perhaps at a small discount to incentivize the transaction. * **Bundle and sell discounted packages:**¬†The user can purchase various voice, data, and SMS packs offered by NTC and resell them to others at a discounted rate. For example, they could buy a large 28-day data pack with a market value of Rs. 999 and sell it to someone for a reduced cash price. * **Use the balance for services and bills:**¬†The user can offer to pay for other people's utility bills that can be settled via an NTC number and accept cash in return. This could include things like landline or internet service bills if NTC provides them.¬†  Warning for the Reddit user  * **Scams:**¬†Advise the user to be very cautious about offers from strangers promising to buy the balance or provide a refund. They should only perform transactions with people they know and trust to avoid losing the balance without getting paid. * **Security code:**¬†The NTC security code for balance transfers is like a bank PIN and should never be shared with anyone. The user must perform all transfers themselves.¬†|||Chora chori thula vayinjel samma balance halna parena aba..üòù|||1xbet money.|||I have seen such thing alot of times I don't think now they did it mistakenly.

Try to dont play such scenarios in your head, I know its hard..  Yes, many animals experience severe distress due to fireworks and firecrackers, cows, dogs, cats etc. The smaller the animal, stronger the distress.   You can check statistics over the world, its a real issue. We humans dont respect the native habitants (animals) and this is just one of examples. Like, is the loud sound more important than a divine life (as all life is divine)?  Can that simbolism be expressed in a better way, by singing, instruments etc...  Luckily, as the world is slowly becoming aware of this, so the regulations starts to exist. In many countries there are now regulations that prohibit fireworks and firecrackers, exactly because of this reason (not to mention distress to some humans that exist too..).|||I am so so sorry.

I'm not trying to be rude or to devalue your loss. It must be sad for you, yes, but I feel worse for that rabbit who lost its life because you made it live with humans and could not accommodate its needs. Firecrackers didn't take his life.

But shouldn't the parent be accountable too?|||Is a rabbit more important than a chicken? Is the festival cultural practice of fireworks less important than rabbits life?

Two minutes late? You‚Äôd get sent home with 2‚Äì3 follow-up emails. He had cameras everywhere and watched every move if you touched your phone for even a second, you‚Äôd get an email warning.

They‚Äôve become an inseparable part of the U.S. IT industry a huge portion of the real engineering work is done by them.

For a long time, India didn‚Äôt create the right environment to make full use of its skilled people.  Now, about whether India is catching up to China in tech not quite yet. Chinese engineers are incredibly skilled, and China still has a big edge in infrastructure, funding, and startup ecosystems. Right now, India sits at number three, behind the U.S. and China, in the global tech scene. But give it another 20‚Äì25 years, and India could very well take the second spot, right after China.  That said, India‚Äôs future looks bright. The liberalization policies and the country‚Äôs strong emphasis on education have built a solid foundation. Institutions like the IITs, AIIMS, and IIMs have produced some of the best minds in engineering, medicine, and business. These people are driving not just India‚Äôs growth but also global innovation.

So, to answer no, they aren't.|||‚ÄúPeople believe anything when it‚Äôs put between quotation marks.‚Äù   ‚Äî *Abraham Linkon*|||India's vaunted software industry has outsourced the least technologically demanding and most labor-intensive parts of the European and American software industries. The reality is that India lacks internet giants, nor does it have widely used software applications. Even the major software applications developed domestically are from the US. While you could argue that Indians participated in the development of these applications, it's still not Indian software. This isn't entirely bad, however. The internet industry is dominated by only two major players: the US and China. Even Europe and Japan have seen their internet industries and talent drained by the US. For example, in the electric vehicle industry, Chinese electric vehicle companies are internet giants, while German electric vehicle companies are industrial giants. Germany's lack of internet talent forces it to partner with Chinese companies for technology, whereas 30 years ago, China partnered with German automakers due to a lack of technology. Before his death, Henry Kissinger expressed concern about Europe's extreme lack of long-term strategic planning. Many Europeans still fail to grasp this reality, their thinking still mired in outdated Cold War thinking, which sees a Soviet Union as the scapegoat for all their mistakes. India and many other countries haven't fared any better than Europe.|||Bro been working with Indians for last 2 years. 90% of them are \"Kaam chorr\".|||1. Indians are indeed good at replicating pre-existing products. 2. With a population of 1.4 Billion - India has the market  for growth not just for tech companies but any international company looking to increase their revenues (CAGR and what not). 3. Microsoft's subscription model doesn't really suit the South Asian population.  But having said all this, Bill probably said it as a joke (if he indeed said it).

            "comments": "SA at FAANG. First, hiring is very tight across the board. I help with initial screening sometimes and I see intern resumes with 1-2 years of experience and seriously amazing projects these days and even those aren't getting ROs. The market is heavily skewed rn, like I saw a resume with 4 years experience,  lot of official blogs and solutions published applying for an associate level position.   I say keep grinding and work on GenAI projects. That's what the upper management wants to see these days. Referrals won't be that helpful if you're getting screened out before getting a call.|||[removed]|||FAANG?   get some hands on experience at real companies and projects.  It's competitive and everyone else is smarter than everyone else üôåüèΩ|||I think its better to communicate in indian sub Reddit|||Now I am thinking why do nepali youths are not into FAANG thing? Unlike Indians?   We are not competitive enough? OR We are not Intrested enough?|||2x summer intern in faang. Oh ur location is india.|||If you are talking about direct recruiting from Nepal,  I don't know so far, but one of my friend and senior from Nepal working at VISA with the level of pay that FAANG and all does. But we studied together at NITR, India.  The process in India itself is top, so it's real hard to get recruited from Nepalese colleges.|||Applying to FAANG from India is not worth it bro. First thing the competition is huge and second thing the pay for FAANG position in India is like what at max 1.5 to 2 Crore if you get lucky. And I seriously believe that the stress to compensation is not worth it.  If it was in the case of USA especially in the bay area, then I would say the grind was worth it because they pay ridiculously high, like even after all the tax cuts and expenses you can save around 100-150k easily in a year given your compensation is 350-400k USD per year and the position is at the bay area.  But competition is tough there too, you need PhDs and all.  But I think it's still better than India. In India nowadays almost like minimum 10 lakhs students have already mugged up at least 300-400 leetcode questions so, chances are slim there.  My advice is target for such positions where the competition is low, grind there for 3-4 years and apply as independent contractors for remote position, you can easily make above 100k if you are sharp.  Then move to Romania applying a digital nomad visa and pay only about flat 10-11% tax for your 100k plus income. Cost of living is also affordable in Romania, soon to be included into schengen and of course after 5 years apply for PR, get the passport and travel freely for vacation. (It's passport is in top ten strongest list)  And this is the most achievable goal and path for a Nepali IT specialist. Even if you get 60k USD remote job in Nepal, it's not worth it because the progressive tax system will make the effective tax to around 30-33% and all your tax for what? Into the belly of corrupt politicians.  Actually it's a bad idea to live in Nepal, the tax is too much. You pay 25% tax and 13% vat for almost everything. Forget about buying vehicles, the added cost is like price of Vehicle(100%) and 80% flat tax + 13% vat + 10-25% profit margin + extraa whatever. You pay more than double for any vehicles.  Bro I'm hoping that the new government will make Nepal similar to a tax haven nation, otherwise I'm leaving Nepal too in next couple of years myself.|||Almost all hiring in India happens through on campus placements. Look at what companies are coming to your campus and prepare for it. Thats why most people are obsessed over getting into good universities there. Off campus hiring, on the other hand, is extremely brutal. Leetcode probably won't be enough. If you're a first year/second year, I'd suggest to start doing Codeforces. You'll thank yourself later on. Don't fret over it, know that resume screening is largely arbitrary. Also, stating the obvious but apply outside of FAANG -- its not what it used to be.|||referral khasai aba work gardaina,tei level ko manche le gareko rahecha bhane work grcha on campus ma focus garaa FAANG target rakha tara oncampus placement focus gara , senior hru huna sakcha FAANG ma try to reach out senior hru le sure rply dinchaa,ma pani google ko 2ndround interview ma reject bhako ,mero sathihru chan FAANG ma opening rahecha bhane you can send me on dm i will send them they will refer you(resume impressive rahecha bhane ATS score 80+ aayeracha bhane)|||Where are you based at ?|||Use your .edu email to sign up in blind and ask for referral there.|||IK someone who is working as Customer Success Manager.

Aafno aafno opinion lai fact jasari prove garna nakhojam.   Questioning the tradition is valid and should be done. That‚Äôs how we will get more information on the practice and then we can determine whether the tradition is actually jeopardising the child‚Äôs mental health or not.   But without any credible information just blatantly labelling it exploitative and child abuse will do more harm than good.|||True, the Kumari tradition is precious but it needs to be modified so culture thrives without harming the child.|||  Wait till the local Newar finds out that someone has spoken a fact here. üòÇ|||Hi all I am a Newar, and i don‚Äôt oppose the tradition.  The child will have access to education and almost everything another child can ask for. We have belief that the child carries spirit of Taleju Bhawani, which gives the child immense power. Again, in an age where we have lost our belief, I cannot prove it.  The kumaris I have visited emit strong aura (i may have been brainwashed to feel this). But she does have to be disciplined (i dont mean someone disciplines her). The child is treated with utmost respect by the best people in a homely environment.   Aba before age of 15 16, Manang Mustang ghumna khasai koi jaadaina hola (only speaking for myself) After she is no longer a Kumari, she can go whereever she wants to.   Anyways, I am open for a discussion and may be able to pose any questions to the people in the inner circle. I don‚Äôt know much myself but do have the connections if we want the facts so we can all stop conspiring.  Jay Desh|||We should support female pope in Vatican gender equality let's goooo!!!|||What about the rights of Nuns... We should talk about this also|||Kumaris: A common doll for everyone.   A 3 year old child has no idea what she is getting into. She cannot grasp what a normal childhood is, what is right and what is wrong. The only thing she knows and does is based on her likes and dislikes, which is heavily depended upon how her parents/surrounding elders dictates.   Ani about 'No complains' from past Kumaris:   Newari culture is super sensitive. You cannot say anything against their culture. Otherwise, you'll have to face \"Tom n Jerry\" like people. I think, every ex Kumaris understands this at some point. With this much pressure along with the grooming done from a very young age, I don't think anyone dares to speak up. Which basically means none of us know what they really feel inside.    Well, of course, keeping in mind how they're thrown away once they reach a certain age or goes through ü©∏. At least, a life time opportunity to be a Kumari where they could renounce their position if they don't feel like it should be a way.   They don't preach, they don't teach, they only show up during jatras. I've never seen Kumaris actively participating in rituals or any sort of activities. Yestai ho vane, why not create a statue of a Kumari for the rest of our lives and stay quiet???|||Also it adds to the stereotype that period blood is impure|||Yeah the 1sttime ever I saw Kumari it was not aww like I hoped but pity to the \"Living Goddess\" she had the look of not a girl her age but of an \"ice princess\" in anime. Like I have never seen such a sad expression ever probably cause she cant smile or cry.|||i think no newari person feels that being chosen as a kumari is a bad thing and they have ripped the kid of her most deserving childhood, she has a great life in kumari house fully taken care by her parents, she also gets educated within the kumari house, apart from her kumari duties, providing blessings to people which is a small time of her day and appearing in festivals she has a normal fun life.  The only thing you should feel bad about is her parents who now have to be her full time care takers probably having to leave their jobs and careers and move into the kumari house with her.|||I used to extremely religious before and used to glorify ts But realising Kumari tradition is cruel was my first step towards atheism|||As a Newar, I understand the cultural side of it. But living in the US and having global exposure, I also see it as more of a pageant. If you‚Äôve seen Little Miss Sunshine, you‚Äôll get the context.||| The Living Goddess tradition of Nepal is a complex institution rooted in centuries of culture. While modern concerns about child rights are valid, the practice is governed by strict rituals and has evolved to address contemporary welfare standards. Here are the key facts:  1. The Selection is Meticulous and Considered an Honor:  ¬∑ A Kumari is chosen from the specific Shakya clan of the Newari community, a Buddhist goldsmith caste. ¬∑ The selection process is incredibly rigorous. Candidates must meet 32 strict physical perfection requirements (e.g., eye shape, voice quality, hair color) and demonstrate a fearless and serene demeanor (e.g., by not crying during a ceremony in a room of 108 ritually sacrificed animal heads). ¬∑ For the family and community, her selection is not a punishment but the highest spiritual honor.  2. The Role is Central to National Culture and Unity:  ¬∑ The Kumari is not just a religious figure but a national symbol. ¬∑ Her most important public duty is during the Indra Jatra festival, where she blesses the President of Nepal, providing divine legitimacy to the state in a ceremony that blends Hindu and Buddhist traditions. This is a key event for national identity.  3. Significant Reforms and Safeguards Have Been Implemented:  ¬∑ Education: By law, the Kumari now receives a formal education from private tutors within her residence. The government provides a monthly stipend specifically for this purpose. ¬∑ Family Presence: Contrary to isolation claims, her family (typically her mother) lives with her throughout her tenure. ¬∑ Financial Security: Upon retiring at puberty, the state grants her a lifetime pension. As of recent years, this is approximately NPR 10,000 per month (roughly $75 USD), along with a lump sum of NPR 1 million (roughly $7,500 USD) to support her transition. ¬∑ Successful Reintegration: Former Kumaris like Dr. Chanira Bajracharya, who served until 14, have publicly spoken about their positive experiences, pursued higher education, and built successful careers, demonstrating that life after the role is viable.  The Kumari tradition is a deeply embedded socio-religious institution. It is factually inaccurate to frame it simply as the \"isolation\" of a child. It is a state-sanctioned, culturally sacred role with defined rituals, significant community support, and legally mandated provisions for the girl's education, family life, and long-term financial security. The debate around it highlights the global tension between cultural preservation and evolving child rights, but the practice itself has demonstrably adapted to modern norms.|||I ain't newar but also I think aaba yesto kura chai parents haru le vhaneko ramro hami third party le vhannu vhanda pani . look if kumari ko parents le chahanu hudaina vhani tyo kumari ko candidate mai na leraunu parni ho . so parents lai kehi problem xaina , kumari le as a normal human being ni basna paunu hunxa after completion so I think we are no one to question sodhna lai|||What about the tradition of marrying off daughters into the inlaws house?|||After giving this some thought question is of a philosophical one. What freedom does a child have?  What life does a child choose? Isn‚Äôt everyone forced and fed their parent‚Äôs beliefs?   Also, can you give some evidence of abuse? If not your post would be baseless and in attempt of defamation of our culture.  One Kumari‚Äôs time ended when she was just 12. How much do you remember of your life before you were 12? I asked myself the same question and the answer is not much.   I disagree with your claim that the Kumari‚Äôs are discarded. They are always welcome. What it shows is the core principle of Buddhism that nothing is permanent. All things, even being revered as the living goddess, comes to an end. It teaches humility, an art that is now lost in this modern time.

You‚Äôve engrained yourself with too much western influence and think that the culture needs to be reformed. Kumaris have friends, education, and the choice is with them and their families. Where do you think that is abusive? You are living in a bubble. It is a different culture and a tradition it doesnt mean that it is abusive. Kumaris have had a long history, have you ever heard one of them come out and say that it was traumatic? Stop your virtue signaling.|||I would like to hear it from past Kumaris, if they dont have a problem, who are we to stop this 1000 yr old practice|||As always kumari tradition is called as a child abusive and inhuman act again. Khaire ko documentary haru herera brainrot kura nagara na. Not everyone is privileged to become kumari and nor they are selected randomly. The family members themself have to fill the form and there's a long running selection process. Only a certain clan of newar can become Kumari. There are lots of inhuman and child abusive traditions going on all over. In case of kumari they get highest level of love and respect. They can live with their parents, they can play, they can watch TV, they can even play video games. It would be better if you watch podcasts of ex kumaris it's really helpful. I used to think same like everyone calling this inhuman before but they are living the normal life as you and me. And the fact that you can't speak up being kumari is totally false, yes you can't but only in jatras and other religious ceremonies, do you speak up during sharad and other pujas(it's prohibited to talk during sharad if you don't know). Go visit sudurpaschim hundreds of girls are being raped during their chhaupadi bas. Go visit terai Muslim villages girls at the age of 15 are getting married and at the age of 21 they are booned with 3 childs. Ex Kumaris themself enjoy being kumari and love to live their that phase again. If they are fine, their parents are fine no need to talk about that. Now the rules and prohibitions are amended. So please watch podcasts of ex kumaris. Btw I'm not Newar. I'm not from valley either.

To those insisting Kumaris are always ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù or dismissing criticism by belittling others, few things we can reflect on:   1. How much do we actually know about child psychology and development, especially at such a young age when experiences shape a lifetime? 2. Yes, a Kumari is worshipped as a goddess now but when her time ends, how does a goddess step back into an ordinary life? How do peers treat her? How does she even make friends? 3. With isolation and the constant expectation to suppress emotions, what happens to her social, communication, and interpersonal skills? Who helps her navigate that later? 4. Does she ever get space to express her own feelings and thoughts or is silence part of the job description? 5. We‚Äôve all seen videos of new Kumari, some barely three years old, literally asleep in full dress during rituals. How on earth can a toddler be burdened with divine expectations when they can barely stay awake through it? 6. As Nepalis, many of us defend dal bhat tarkari because it‚Äôs what we grew up with it feels untouchable. (I know it‚Äôs not the same but for reference) For a Kumari, this role is all she has ever known. So how would she even recognise or articulate what she‚Äôs missed out on, when she never had the chance to experience it? 7. And let‚Äôs be honest do we really believe someone put on a pedestal that high, surrounded by cultural pressure, guilt, and shame, would openly talk about the negatives of being Kumari? Yes, things have changed there‚Äôs more education, some family contact,but none of that cancels out the developmental and human rights concerns we‚Äôre talking about.  And honestly, the comments here kind of prove the point: we were never really taught to think critically. Instead of having an actual discussion, people are throwing around ‚Äúbahun,‚Äù ‚ÄúChristian,‚Äù or ‚Äúother cultures‚Äù like that somehow answers the question.

Goodness flows through Kumari.  She is worshipped for being the medium of taleju bhawani. They are taught that they as an individual are not god, but the goodness that flows through her is what makes her worshipped.  And calling Kumari as a \"virgin goddess\" is stupid and a complete disregard of religious belief. It's a literal translation not a literary translation.   A lot of misconceptions have already been debunked.  Therefore they are able to integrate back into society well. They have good societal support . They are mentored, taught and are well taken care of. They themselves have immence respect for their religion and tradition.  If you think being a Kumari is wrong, you simply look at other practices in other religions. Nuns are not allowed to marry or consummate. Denying the right to marry and consummate can be considered as an oppressive practices denying one from their human desires. In radical Islam, burka, multiple marriages, denial of human rights for wemen.  While such petty comparisons are stupid themselves, what I want to say is we are worshipping female power. We are actually looking at females as devine. Not simply blind worship.   Nothing about today's childhood is normal.  You see young boys and girls sent off to boarding schools as normal? It's more isolating depressing. Parents just sticking their child to an iPad, or a hyperactive parent forcing their child through multiple activities (music class, sports, extra activities) even when their child may not want to to them, and pushing their child to extremes, putting their child through ridiculously high expectations, so that they can fulfill own ego( yes I've seen it happen).  A lot is not normal in so called modern normal childhood.   A lot of narratives and propogandas have infiltrated our thinking. Be water and explore into the culture.

Also, if men don't get married, women automatically don't get married too.|||This is why I believe in dowry concept it might sound rude but this is what it is. Since, most of the people have their past life and multiple relationships even before marriage these days. And that relation sometimes seems so so deeply rooted that it becomes difficult to forget. Some are involved in extramarital affairs as well. Then there's bitterness in the present married life and relations with family of husband. Now assume if her husband was single till the marriage for a perfect wife but what he got? Nothing but mental tension afterwards.   The psychological impact a normal people can't even bear. And sometimes girls even planned to marry a rich guy just for money and then divorce and get alimony which she'll spend with her lover. Sometimes, she even plans to kill her husband to get out of that thing. This is freaking crazy how people are thinking this way. I'm not justifying that she's the only culprit here but also her ex cum present hidden lover is equally involved.   Now in this situation it's better to live unmarried or take a grand amount as collateral if you are doing an arranged marriage. So that it will be easier for alimony.   You might call me bias but the thing is different. If we alternate the situation like a groom will have to leave his home and settle with bride forever, and if alimony should be paid by the bride after getting divorced, yeah a groom should have to give dowry as the collateral.   Fun fact: Love marriages crash faster than arranged ones. It‚Äôs like 1 v 1 versus many v many, so too many players in the latter provide team support üòÖ during clashes. Honestly, better to stay single‚Ä¶ or marry someone who doesn‚Äôt try to wrestle your ego.

Most men would rather call it \"hating on men\" or talk badly about women instead of rising to the occassion and actually trying to do and be better. It's not just a Nepal thing, though. The same thing is happening everywhere. Marriage isn't a means for money or safety anymore as it used to be. Women now are independent and can handle their own finances It's not even about social standing anymore, the patriarchal lines of hierarchy are slowly but surely getting blurred.   Nowadays, marriage is about partnership, trust, companionship, love and respect. Most men haven't understood that and would rather blame women as being \"gold diggers\" than realize that it's not the money (or the lack thereof) that influences the attitudes of women towards them.

We are facing a same scenario here. Firstly the case was approached from a minor consent. And as far i believe the age couldn't be proven to be under 18. So this might have been a consensual sex.|||Maile timilai euta kunai case lagaidiye vane timi criminal vayou?

The day that couple spent the night together, next day aayera afnai room mate sanga ekdum excited bhayera Kura gareko cha. A few weeks later gayera case haleko cha. Usko roommate ko statement sunnu paila.   First ma statutory rape bhanyo, which was a massive one. Tyo case ho Bhane Sandeep should rot in jail. Tara that wasn‚Äôt the case, ani age ta 18 above cha raicha Bhanera tha paye pachi case chai rape ko ma change bhayo. Tyo pani when you go through the whole thing, it is pretty easy to make it out that the girl was trying to mint money out of Sandeep. It was a honey trap Bhanera ta sabai lai tha cha.   I don‚Äôt know Sandeep personally and don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs arrogant or k k. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Because that‚Äôs not why he‚Äôs defamed.   Aba you‚Äôll ask me for my source haina? His lawyer was my college ko business law lecturer. He clearly stated that the other party changed their statement time and again. Case nai ulat pulat gareko thiyo re. Harek din naya bayaan and naya kahaani. Kt party ko main intention nai was to get as much of compensation as possible rather than punishing Sandeep.   And brought shame to our cricketing fraternity rey? Yo statement batai it‚Äôs easy to assume ki yo post garne eauta kti ho, ki jindagi ma lukera basne kta ho or Bharkhar ko fucche ho.  Even Cristiano Ronaldo was accused of rape numerous times. Eauta case ta it‚Äôs ekdummai severe. That girl immediately told her friends and filed lawsuit walla. Sandeep ko ta proper honeytrap thyo, Ronaldo had an actual case against him. But bail payo, where he still continued with his career. Unlike Sandeep, Ronaldo continued with his career. Pachi final verdict afnai favor ma payo.   So did he bring shame to Portugal? To Real Madrid? (at the time of the case) Ani Sandeep le chai kasari?   You put yourself in his shoes. You go out on a date with someone. Everything seems perfect, you guys kiss hug and spend an amazing time together. Belka you guys stay out ani make out. Bholi you drop her home.

When you cut off the expectations, you feel more happier and contained with yourself. You begin to prioritize, be selfish and learn more about people. I have the same situation. Accept that I left home 2 years back. First year was really difficult. This year also, I shifted in a new city. My aunty just bought me dry ass cookies and call it a day. I begin to hide my birthday and treat myself biryani,¬† ice cream and stuff. And why just birthday? I try to make my every moment special. I try to treat myself the most special person in this world. And people are getting attracted to me these days. But I don't care at all. I am just focused on my goals. People try to take peace out of me and say stuffs like \"oh you should spend time with people, be close to them\". I am like no thank you. I learned to say no and learned to not be happy on bare minimum. That is the standard I set for myself and if people want to do something for me they have to match my standards. This year I didn't had money but I learned how to bake, and next year m gonna buy a nice dress, bake a cake and make feast for myself, maybe get a whine and enjoy... that is what I do in festivals too, I cook feast. When someone invites me over by seeing me alone and stuff, I'll be like no thank you. Because now I genuinely enjoy my own company and like being cozy with myself. And people thinks that I am hiding some secret. They will be curious that I am being mysterious. But it's nothing but just self care, gratitude towards god and myself and attaining peace within. And people don't understand that simple thing.ü§£ü§£ü§£|||Yesterday it was mine birthday too but same situation.|||Happy belated birthdayyyyy|||mero nii birthday aaudai xaa wish gara la mallai on  November 4 nai birse bro . anyways dhillo bhaye Pani wish gare haii Happy birthday dai/dd|||Happy Belated Birthday <3|||Meroni thyo hijo.

Don‚Äôt get too attached to it.|||Just by criticizing everything doesn't make you intellectual.|||Cultures and traditions naturally spread over time, and this spread is accelerated by influence. Media is the most powerful driver of that influence, and that‚Äôs why our local culture feels as though it is being overshadowed. The problem is not that people no longer value their own culture, but that our media presence is extremely weak compared to others.  Think about how Indian culture has spread in Nepal: through movies, songs, TV serials, and now online content. (migration, political connection and cultural proximity are other factors but in this case, the primary driver is media). The same is true for Western cultures, especially American culture, which influences our everyday lives, from what we eat and wear to the way we think. The recent Garba incident may be one example, but it represents a much broader pattern: cultural identity travels and takes root primarily through media.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, since cultures have always spread, adapted, and reshaped themselves over time. (I mean we'll definitely feel good if a foreigner adopts nepali culture). But preserving one‚Äôs own culture is equally important, because it forms a core pillar of identity. And preservation in today‚Äôs world is only possible through strengthening our own media i.e. by producing movies, songs, and online content that reflect and celebrate our traditions. And they need to be good, not some low effort cash converter sold in the name of patriotism.  And just for context: Garba is not only celebrated in Gujarat, but across India. (showing spread of a culture).|||I dont really see how this would affect op or anyone else for that matter enough to create this discord. And where do you draw the line?

I wouldn't be surprised if you're the type that think \"‡§∏‡§§‡§ø ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§•‡§æ\" should have continued because it's \"nepali culture\".

It's just logic.  We can enjoy and celebrate our cultural practices, examine them, and update them.    Our ancestors not only created new traditions but also stopped the ones they didn't like. We can do the same.|||It is important to think about culture and traditions critically. Eg: Sati pratha was perpetuated in the name of culture, but it IS abuse. Not everyone who criticizes traditions are westernized. That is gross oversimplification that prevents healthy discourse.   As for shivling, the whole world is obsessed with phallic structures. Not every criticism needs to be taken seriously. Think for yourself, argue against it if you believe otherwise, and modify the practices based on reasonable critiques. It really isn‚Äôt that deep. Religion and faith are deeply personal matters anyway.|||Most of the religious practices are enforced by men and misogynistic, to control women and children.

Therefore, don't intervene into respective private cultural spaces. We can live peacefully, if we became aware of our limits as a Nepali. The notion of being Nepali is a political concept, it's not a homogenous entity. Within it, every community exist as different distinctive individual entity different from each other.  For Newar, the girl who becomes a Kumari is continuation of their identity. She is more than a child girl, a divine goddess. Therefore, as a Nepali, and a non-newari I can only respect and react from distance, without being vociferous about it in public.  Maintenance of distance should be constitutional duty of every citizen. In reddit, we can see a different caste and ethnicity taking shots at other caste ethnicity. It's better that Chettri shouldn't be inferring in Gurung's culture and lifestyle. SImilarl, Limbu shouldn't be talking and critiquing Bahuns way of doing things. Same respective cultural practices should be carried out by other caste ethnicities.|||Secularism isn‚Äôt westernization. It‚Äôs modernization.|||>Nepali culture is not perfect, but it is ours. Reform must come from us  You said it yourself. It is not perfect and they might need reform.  >orchestrated online campaigns that want us to be ashamed of who we are  I have seen various posts claiming the same thing. What is the basis for that? Is it because many people are parroting *Kumari* culture as \"child abuse\" in social media, just like you are parroting it as \"orchestrated online campaign\"?  I don't think it's orchestrated campaign. It's just because many people don't have their own opinion and get easily swayed by people, posts and opinions that are controversial, that can drive engagement in social media. I'm somewhat victim of that myself, in a sense that, before the \"child abuse\" posts surfaced, I hadn't really given it much thought even if I always felt similar way. Some people like me might have realized it after seeing those posts, some might just be using it as engagement bait (because they are attention whores), or some are just trolling.  >They evolve, adapt, and reform, but from within the community, not by outsiders branding them as abuse to fit their narrative.  Isn't this coming from within the community? Where else is this coming from? I really have no idea. I haven't seen it being criticized or ridiculed by anyone else from international communities.  >We are debating in Western language, wearing Western dress, using Western devices, and posting on Western platforms. Naturally these spaces are full of hate against Nepali culture, because the ecosystem itself is designed to amplify Western values while mocking our own.  How ironic! You could have at least posted this in Nepali then. I don't think most people's goal is to mock our culture, it's more of constructive criticism, at least, from my point of view. Well I do have criticism about lots of aspects of many western cultures as well. But if I make a post or comment pertaining to that then lots of people like you would probably just accuse me of emphasizing western culture too much. I criticize Nepali culture and tradition because I grew up on them and I know them well and it's part of my lifestyle as well. My philosophy is, criticize the part of things you love but find problematic, don't just accept them as they are.|||Not every but u need to understand some of them trully are , Its good to follow tradition but with time we also should improvise , child abuse is a thing people need to consider seriously , I am not only talking about Kumari pratha , also putting children in dungeons during menstrual cycle should be taken seriously.

            "body": "My perspective on the Kumari tradition is entirely based on what former Kumaris think.  If we asked 100 ex-Kumaris about their experiences and whether they felt exploited or saw it as a privilege, I‚Äôm confident most would say they didn‚Äôt feel abused, contrary to what many internet activists claim.  To better understand the reality, I‚Äôll share links to interviews and articles featuring former Royal Kumaris, published by BBC and ABC.  Yes, isolating a child from her parents, friends, education, or the outside world isn‚Äôt right, but those conditions don‚Äôt exist in the Kumari house as critics portray.   The tradition has evolved significantly. Kumaris can regularly meet their parents, who often care for them, receive personal tutoring for education, play outside with friends, and enjoy movies like other children.   And after retiring as a Kumari, she will be 100 per cent normal Nepali girl who is free to do anything and she'll get a monthly pension of Rs 16k for the rest of her life. (as per 2019 article)  So, don‚Äôt let disconnected keyboard warriors, who are influenced by Western lifestyles and detached from our cultural roots, misrepresent our beautiful tradition as a story of abuse or exploitation. Those are the same type of people who romanticize about foreign practices like child beauty contests or halloween but sh!t on our culture.

The respect and reverence given to the Kumari is not only religious but also a reflection of Nepal‚Äôs rich history and traditions. These people just find way to get away from traditions. Even the kings would receive her blessings before important events, military campaigns, or other significant state matters. The divine grace of the Kumari was thought to ensure his prosperity and the kingdom‚Äôs peace and stability.|||Yep, I've talked to an exKumari myself and she said she felt honored about being chosen. Shes married and working now. I don't see anything wrong with the tradition as it exists. In the past there were some issues about schooling and prejudice against marrying exKumari but there have been lots of reforms and cultural mindset changes now, led by exKumaris themselves. If you don't believe in Kumari or are an atheist, noone is forcing you to visit her or seek blessing. Kumari culture, since it does not really harm anyone, comes under freedom of religion and is protected by Nepal's constitution as well as international law.|||If the child says she doesn‚Äôt want to be a Kumari will they find another girl?|||>My perspective on the Kumari tradition is entirely based on what former Kumaris think.  Classic case of Stockholm syndrome. If a little girl is institutionalized for almost a decade and brainwashed every single day, it's almost certain that she will develop a positive affinity towards this barbaric practice.  Why do you people need this practice at all? Are your superstitious beliefs and culture more important than the childhood of an innocent little girl? You people are willing to sacrifice her entire childhood just to appease your stupid traditions.  >who are influenced by Western lifestyles and detached from our cultural roots  Criticism ayo ki western influenced vandyo, INGO ko paisa khako vandyo, dollarey vandyo, chamaley vandyo.

Of course, certain restrictions are there but just as a child who goes to a monastery or a person going to church has to follow certain rules, she has to as well. We can question some of these rules, but not without understanding the context and significance behind it.   While people are quick to dismiss cultural practices like this in the name of modernization and woke values, they easily forget that tantric traditions are very much alive and thriving in Nepal. Better not mess with those. If you are a non-believer, move on for your own good I would say.|||Not beautiful, it's an ass culture.

The facts, based on local Nepali voices and government policies, paint a very different, much more nuanced picture that overwhelmingly supports the continuation of this vital cultural practice, proving it is not exploitative in nature.    The Reality of the Living Goddess: A Cultural Privilege üá≥üáµ  Not Isolated, But Tutored and Connected: The claim of \"isolation from family\" is a common critique. In reality, Kumaris receive personal tutoring, maintain regular parental contact (daily visits), and enjoy activities like playing outside and watching movies. This setup is often compared by defenders to a modern, high-standard boarding school experience, not harmful captivity. \\[2\\]\\[3\\]\\[7\\]  Lifelong Financial and Educational Support: Critics claim the girls are \"abandoned\" after their tenure ends at puberty. This is demonstrably false. Upon retirement, former Kumaris receive a substantial monthly pension and educational scholarships from the government, ensuring their successful reintegration and personal development as regular Nepali citizens. \\[6\\]\\[4\\]\\[5\\]\\[8\\]  The Voices of Former Kumaris: Structured interviews and public testimonials from ex-Kumaris and their families show that the vast majority view the tradition as a privilege and a source of cultural pride, not abuse or trauma. They have actively and publicly refuted Western stereotypes about mental strain or deprivation, emphasizing their positive experiences and agency. \\[9\\]\\[3\\]\\[5\\]  Modern Safeguards and Evolution: The tradition is not static. It has evolved significantly to include increased government oversight, modern educational facilities, and legal provisions for the girls' welfare. This illustrates the community's commitment to protecting the Kumaris and balancing ancient spiritual significance with contemporary child welfare values. \\[5\\]\\[10\\]\\[4\\]  The Kumari tradition is seen by its community as the veneration of feminine power and an integral part of Nepal's spiritual and social cohesion. To dismiss it as \"superstition\" while normalizing practices like sending children to high-end Western boarding schools highlights a clear double standard in criticism. The factual evidence, supported by Nepali citizens and former goddesses, establishes that the Kumari tradition is a source of cultural pride and empowerment, not the exploitation depicted by disconnected critics.|||The thing is people think it‚Äôs either right or wrong ; why not keep the perspective open.|||You are forcing a minor to give up the most magical years of her life for something that she has no choice over.

If you don't like it, be silent. Live respectfully separately. Peacefully.|||when someone grows up fully immersed in a tradition, they often won‚Äôt criticize it because it‚Äôs tied to their identity and sense of pride. That doesn‚Äôt make their perspective wrong, but it also doesn‚Äôt mean the practice has no problems.  For example, if you ask people who grew up in strict boarding schools, many will say it made them disciplined and strong, while others will point out the trauma from isolation and harsh rules. Both experiences are valid, but focusing only on the positive voices gives a one-sided picture.  The same goes for the Kumari tradition. Former Kumaris may genuinely feel privileged and respected, but that doesn‚Äôt erase the fact that historically there were strict restrictions and isolation from normal childhood experiences. Even if those conditions have improved today, that improvement only came because people did question the system.|||This was much needed!

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. üò≠üò≠2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye üò≠|||[deleted]|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

They are simple and have generally easy solutions that most if not all can understand. But they ask questions that often require you to interpret the asked topic in a different way. Thwy might twist a simple concept like vector addition and join it with irl examples.

You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

            "body": "If you can be genuine, go through it. Or else you are free to scroll.    I recently passed my high-school. I got an A+. And i was supposed to prepare for the CEE exam.  I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can‚Äôt get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",
