Why this post: Wanna escape of off current role.   Could you share more details: Yeah, Why not? My current role mostly involves aggressively punching the keyboard with minimal brain engagement. The pay isn’t great either: CTC is around 50k per month. I’m in my late twenties and would really like my life to level up both financially and intellectually. In my spare time (a.k.a. when I question my life choices), I’ve learned advanced Excel, worked on a few projects at my job, and even received an award. Right now, I’m learning DAX for Power Query.  I want to move into an analytics role where I can actually use both my finance background and technical skills, instead of just exercising my fingers. What are some rewarding career paths that make sense for someone like me: both in terms of brain usage and income? I’ve considered moving to another department within the bank, like treasury, but that door seems half-closed and crowded with very qualified elbows. My interests keep bouncing between data analytics, financial risk management, actuarial work, by giving the relevant exams, and related fields.  I’m looking for genuine, realistic guidance that’s relevant to Nepal. For those earning north of 1 lakh per month: what skills do you have, what’s your background, and how did you get there without a time machine?",

My point is he has been able to do good works since he has no attachment to any political parties,have no voters to please and know the technicalities as former jobholder.

            "body": "If you notice, whenever someone does something good, people immediately say, “Tapai ta Rajniti ma aaunu parcha” to that person. The good work doesn’t even have to be groundbreaking. No matter the scale, people instantly start supporting them and boosting their ego by asking them to run for politics. I’ve been seeing posts about this since a long time, and it made me think a lot.  Maybe the intention is innocent, but what I feel is that many Nepali people believe that all we need is one person who can act like the hero in the movie Nayak and magically solve all our problems. That’s what people seem to be looking for.  Since the talk of the subreddit right now is Ashika Tamang, let’s talk about her as well. Yes, she is doing good work. I have seen videos of her helping people, which is genuinely commendable. She calls herself a social worker, and that’s fair, she is helping those who need help. Not that I support her in everything, she is helping needy people, which is praisworthy. But based on that alone, people started supporting her and telling her to run for politics. I’m not entirely sure, but until some time ago, it didn’t even seem like she had an interest in joining politics. Now, even she said thar she will run for election.  My question is: why not support her as a social worker and help her excel in that field instead of pushing her toward politics? To be honest, she isn’t likely to win anyway, so why not be rational for once? Yes, it’s a democracy and anyone can run, but people should also think before blindly encouraging it.  I’m not saying I’m right. Opinions differ, and this is just my perspective. But I’ve noticed this trend repeatedly. Take Dr. Sanduk Ruit, he is a great doctor, yet people constantly tell him to run for election. He doesn’t want to, and rightly so. That’s not his field of expertise. Let him remain a doctor and excel in that field. Look at the current case of Mahabir Pun as well. He keeps saying that a ministerial position is not for him, and that he only accepted it because it was critical. He has openly said his head already hurts and that he just wants the election to happen so he can leave and work where he is actually needed.  And even if such people win elections, realistically, they will mostly work as MPs. Ashika Tamang’s work might become less visible once she becomes an MP compared to her current social work. Then what? Because if you notice, the same people who support someone today will immediately turn against them the moment they make a mistake.  This post is not only about Ashika Tamang. Since her topic was trending in this sub, I used her as an example. But this applies to anyone. Nepali people are very good at boosting egos on social media, and ironically, it’s often the people least suited for politics who end up being pushed toward it.  So yeah, support people in what they are good at. Help them grow and excel in that field. Not everyone has to become a politician to bring change. We need people who are knowledgeable, genuinely interested, and capable of planning, not just people driven by rage and social media popularity.",

In my previous classes, I was always a topper—I ranked first from Grade 9 to Grade 10 in the pre-board exams. However, in the final results, I ended up in third place. That experience made me realize something important about my surroundings and about people: even if you dominate at the beginning, once you lose at the end, people start to ignore your past efforts.  I also did not pass the entrance exams that I appeared for earlier, and that felt like my **first real failure in life**. After that, I slowly began losing confidence in academics and started feeling uncertain about my future and what lies ahead.  I am mainly more interested in other areas. Instead of forcing myself to follow a purely academic path, I feel more motivated to **learn practical skills and become truly good at them**.  Some people say that this is the time to focus only on studies, and in some cases, they may be right. However, my family’s financial condition is not very strong.

It’s strange that I was in a very similar situation, but I came out of it pretty well. I ranked second in my SLC exam, although I always topped the internal exams. My 11th was so much worse than that, partially because I steered away from my studies. I had only scored 70% in my 11th board exams. Financially, I only had my mom to support me, and that too based on the buffalo milk we used to sell. I lost my full scholarship in the +2 college because of bad marks in my 11th. Thankfully, I still had the Mahatma Gandhi scholarship.  However, since then, I have turned my life around 180 degrees. I started to put in more effort in my studies and, as a result, scored 83/84% in my 12th. I kind of redeemed myself a little bit. Later I got into IOE wrc campus for civil engineering. But still left it, self-prepared for the SAT, and got into a top American college (in the Gulf) with full funding. Now it’s been a few years since I graduated. I earn more than I ever thought I would and my family and I both lead comfortable lives. I’m studying more and putting in further effort into developing skills and seeing where else life can take me.|||We both have same age , same story, and same situation",

            "body": "Namaste r/technepal,  We are a small team of students from Kathmandu University.  We’ve spent the last few months sleeplessly coding KUPID, a social connection app exclusively for KU students.  **The Problem:** Dating apps right now are broken. Tinder minimizes people to playing cards. Bumble is just a paywall. And specifically at KU, we noticed everyone stays in their own \"department bubbles.\" Engineering sticks with Engineering, Management with Management. It’s unexpectedly lonely.  **Our Solution (The Logic):** We didn't want to build another generic wrapper. We wanted to solve specific problems we faced on campus using code.  1. **Anti-Doomscrolling (\"Slow Down\" Algo):** We hardcoded a cap of 12 profiles per day. The logic is simple: scarcity creates value. We want you to actually read the bio, not just dopamine-swipe left and right. 2. **\"Valuable Comment\" > Swipe:** Our algorithm penalizes mindless swiping. A generic right swipe is cheap data. We built a contextual interaction system (similar to Hinge). You don't just \"like\" a person; you like a specific part of them, their \"Hot Take\" prompt or their travel photo. Adding a comment boosts your visibility in their stack significantly more than a silent like. We mathematically value effort. 3. **Zero Paywalls:** We are students; we’re broke. There is no \"Gold\" or \"Premium\". Usage is free. We actually show you who liked you without asking for a credit card. 4. **Exam Mode:** We built a toggle that pauses your profile in the discovery queue but keeps your existing chats active. It shows a \"Focusing\" badge to your matches. Helping you save your GPA was a functionality requirement. 5. **Breaking Silos:** We tweaked the recommendation engine. On Saturdays, the algorithm flips the bias to boost profiles from other schools (e.g., if you're Science, you see more Arts/Management). 6. **Real Privacy (E2EE):** Privacy was our biggest paranoia. We implemented End-to-End Encryption using Sodium. Your chats are encrypted on your device and only decrypted on the receiver's device. Even we (the devs) strictly cannot read your messages in the database. 7. **Hide Classmates:** Paranoid about seeing your ex? You can \"hide\" names from your specific program using fuzzy matching. It’s bidirectional, they won’t see you either.  **The Tech Stack (For the Nerds):** We didn't just spin up a Firebase instance.  * **Backend:** Node.js / Express (strict TypeScript). * **Database (PostgreSQL):** We use **recursive graph queries** to handle \"Trust Chains\" (seeing who vouched for whom) and atomic transactions to prevent race conditions. * **Caching & Concurrency (Redis):**    * **Mutex Locks:** We use Redis distributed locks to prevent \"Thundering Herd\" issues during daily stack generation.    * **Deterministic Shuffling:** User stacks are shuffled using a seeded PRNG for consistency. * **Security:** HMAC signing for cache keys and  Idempotency keys for critical actions.  **Current Status:** We are currently in Beta, rolling out to KUSMS and KUSOM first to stress test the servers before the main Dhulikhel campus load hits.  **Why I'm posting here:** To be honest, we want to learn. I know r/technepal has some of the sharpest engineers and designers in the country. We aren't looking for pats on the back; we want you to test our limits.  * **Roast our UX:** Does the \"Saturday Mode\" feel intuitive or gimmicky? * **Challenge our Architecture:** We are manually traversing the social graph in Node (10 iterations) for Trust Chains instead of using Recursive CTEs in Postgres. Is this naive for scalability? * **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, but we aren't using its graph features (Recursive CTEs) yet. Roast us for doing graph traversal in the application layer. * **Suggest Features:** What’s that one feature you wish existed when you were in uni?  We are serious about making this a world class product coming out of Nepal, and we can only get there with brutal, technical feedback.  Link: [**kupid.app**](https://kupid.app)  Feedback (brutal or otherwise) is super appreciated!

            "body": "Has anyone here noticed that there are no upvotes in comments anymore?  Over the past few months, there has been a huge surge in new users on Reddit, and they are very active in Reddit Nepal communities, and these users are changing the way things operate here, in some instances they are changing it in a wrong way.  I have noticed that users just don't use upvote or downvote buttons anymore. I believe they carried this habit here from Instagram or Facebook where they watch a content, read a comment enjoy it but don't engage by liking, unliking or making a comment. You know how they keep a distance from directly engaging.   Hundreds of views on a post and comment but no replies, no upvotes or even downvotes. Of the 1000 people who saw a comment, no one found anything in that comment? You saw a comment and you felt no opinion to it?  The core idea of Reddit is discussions. There is no algorithm that pushes a content or comment here. Upvote and downvote buttona are the primary markers which decide what kind of content, comment and discussion you want to see here.   The problem isn't in this subreddit only, but perists on entire Nepali Reddit communities.  This isn't Instagram where you'll get to see your favorite type of content, comment and discussion even without you liking the video, because algorithm is tracking your habits behind.   This is Reddit, you are the one who decides what you see here.  So if you see a post and a comment you like, is interesting, is helpful even not to you but others, is educational and informative, give an upvote so that you appreciate the comment, you appreciate the user who made the comment, you push it up which shares it to other users, you vote your opinion to the mods and the community that you want to see more of such content and comment.   Or you downvote, to discourage bad comments, posts and behavior, to make it known that certain content and behavior aren't appreciated.   Go to other subreddits or the front page, you will see awesome content and comments because someone made an effort to make the post or write the comment, and the community upvoted it to appreciate it and pushed it up.   Paisa lagdaina, upvote downvote garau, don't make reddit Facebook or Instagram because there is no algorithm running 24/7 manufacturing a feed for you.

Radio Jockey and TV personality - focused more on criticizing other than coming up with solution 4. Ambuguity ( what laws he will act upon that will help speed up Nepal growth rate - heard none yet) 5. Questionable moral integrity( employee suicide case, personal life, escaping jail) 6. Reactive - will quickly switch to whatever becomes flavor of the year Pros: Populist (democracy at the end of day works on populism) , charismatic 3. Reactive - (will listen more to mass, for ex he might have unbanned social media immediately if he was in that position)  4. Might create a good momentum against laggard old politicians even though he is only out in bail VS kulman -> 1. No active court cases in Nepal or outside Nepal ( pretty sure he has earned tons of enemies - rich enemies, atleast they haven’t unearthed anything substantial yet 2. Engineer ( Nepal needs more engineer in gov) with an MBA 3. Has clear ideas about Nepal strength and weaknesses - green economy, Forest laws, labor laws 4. Good leader (however you look at it, he gave new life to moribund institution) - led an institution with more employees than KMC 5. Experience - splendid work on chilime project - watershed moment for hydro dev in Nepal from profit sharing to organization growth) Cons - 1 straight talker ( probably not a strength in nepali politics) 2. Egoistical ( could have dealt hitendra situation better ) 3. Average Public speaker ( pretty sure this is most important for any politician, he is not good at it)  These are my personal observations which could be biased and could be wrong but still I think we need a technocrat to run this country not a sweet talker. We will find fault even if we get Gautam Buddha today, but still I hope whoever comes top do good for our nation.|||Huda huda kulman lai suddha gaali garna thalisakey, ye bhai politics ho bhai, bholi Rabi le KP sanga sarkar bhayo bhane GenZ lai gaali garne ho?|||Stop praising and demoralizing the one who are already in a position.

I grew up watching my siblings and cousins most of them are 8–15 years older than me have long-term relationships that eventually turned into happy marriages. Almost everyone in my family had love marriages. They dated  grew together and then got married.  My own sister, who is 7 years older than me, dated my brother-in-law (same age as her) for 5 years, and now they’re happily married. That kind of relationship always felt normal to me. I genuinely thought my life would follow a similar path.  But dating in my generation feels completely different.  The guys I meet want to date. They want love. They treat you well, act serious  and invest emotionally but when it comes to marriage or long-term commitment they suddenly panic or back out.  I’m not saying  “Let’s date today and get married tomorrow.” I understand that marriage is a big decision. I’m financially independent, emotionally aware  and believe relationships should be built mutually over time. I’m ready to grow with someone.  So why does commitment scare so many men now? What changed between generations? Why do they want everything except responsibility?  I know everyone has their own struggles, fears, and pressures but I genuinely want to understand why commitment feels like such a threat today.  Would really love to hear different perspectives.",

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NepalSocial) if you have any questions or concerns.*|||Personally, Commitment scares me because of my past relationship and married couples around me, these things have convinced me to go all solo for the whole life.|||Look, here's the thing most guys won't admit out loud:  We do want what you want. A real partner, someone to come home to, building an actual life together. But there's this weird disconnect between *wanting* that someday and feeling like we can actually *do* that right now.  And honestly? A lot of us feel like we're not enough yet. When you tell me you've got your life together. Good job, emotionally sorted, know what you want, part of me thinks \"that's incredible,\" but another part panics like \"shit, can I even match that energy?\"  What if I'm not as put-together as you need me to be? What if I commit and then realize I can't keep up? What if you're ready to build something and I'm still figuring out how to build myself? It sounds dramatic, but that fear is real.  Sometimes when a guy backs out, it's not because he doesn't care about you. It's because he's convinced he's going to disappoint you eventually. So in his head, he's thinking \"why drag this out if I'm just going to let her down anyway?\"  I know how that sounds like an excuse, like we're being cowards. And maybe we are. But it's not that we don't want commitment. We're just terrified we're going to promise you something we can't deliver. We're scared of messing up something good because we're not ready to be what you deserve.  That fear of not being good enough, of failing you, of making promises we can't keep it's what makes a lot of guys run even when they don't really want to.  I know I have taken these from AI but, these are the concerns that I feel which is causing me to avoid commitment and marriage.|||For women marriage is a fairy tale coming true. Its their big day as they say. For men its a huge huge huge responsibility. Especially in this economy getting married is  too expensive and you can't trust women lately. Look at the cheating, divorce, alimony, hooeing, feminism stuffs going on lately. So many things can be turned against men very easily. Marriage almost feels like a suicide attempt.|||I have seen girls with commitment issues too. I am kinda settled person but my recent partner said there will always be a better one.

This allows people to take their time and weigh their options. What would have been date for a few months / a year or two and get married default is not default anymore.  Men (and partially women) simply need more time to find their footing in personal life and career these days which makes making a bold decision to get married more difficult than in the past.  More prominent dating culture also brings cheating, abuse, and other misadventures which creates a sense of unease in people committing to a marriage. Add to that the coverage divorce (alimony and custody battles, legal nightmares, tarnished reputations, and most of all years of wasted life) and the decision becomes even more difficult.  Expectations of women (And their famillies) for an eligible groom has shot through the roof, especially for men who are trying to make a living in Nepal.  These and more socioeconomic reasons put immense pressure on men to the point where they start doubting their decision to get married, postpone it or in some cases abandon it altogether.|||It does feel like a pessimism, but in today's economy nobody want to be financial responsible for others. And in the conservative society like ours, it is just given that a male is the provider to the female in the marriage. This is the vital factor that a guy has to mull over before tieing a knot. And if the guy is not sure if his partner will be financial responsible one (helping save money or even better contribute in all expenses, not only sometimes), then it is not worth getting involved in the partnership where the laws are more inclined to make him lose his peace and money in case the marriage don't work. So, the fact that our economy is such a rough condition, you either have to be really special to the man or you need to carry your financial weight in the marriage to even make a guy comfortable with the idea of the future partnership with you.|||As a male, an ideal relationship imo is living together without marriage. All benefits of marriage without risk.|||For me, ‘uncertainty about the future’ is the big deal. I learned that the hard way in my previous relationship. When things didn’t work out despite genuine effort, it made me more cautious about committing again. It’s not about lack of feelings but it’s about being realistic and protecting myself from repeating the same mistakes.|||Ngl I'm a girl and I'm deathly afraid of commitment and marriage too. It's not just the guys hehe|||Men - women ko xutai narrative chaldai xa, growing apart rather than together. Koi casual xan, someone as of your age guys prolly are looking to reach a certain point in life and then get married.   Female lai marriage lai push garinxa, male lai get established.|||Read/heard somewhere \"Men these days are worried more about the divorce than the marriage itself\".|||I’m a 23-year-old single guy and I really understand where you’re coming from. From my perspective, commitment feels harder for a lot of men our age for a few reasons. Many of us grew up seeing relationships fall apart whether that’s family, friends, or just endless stories online. Even if some people had great examples of love, others saw divorce, cheating, or couples staying together unhappily, and it made commitment feel risky instead of safe. On top of that, life timing has changed. Earlier generations felt stable in their early twenties, but today most guys are still trying to figure out careers, move cities, manage money, as a reference I myself grinding here in foreign and yeah I am also not looking for will it work or not relationship which is quite common here. I also have same thought as you mentioned before like I am ready to be committed but will she ? As a matter of fact, not all guys are afraid of commitment and marriage cause there are maybe boys like me who wants only one relationship that will lasts until death separate one of us, is what I think.|||26YO Male   I dont see myself marrying anytime soon, Mens risk in marriage has increased lately. And I can guarantee its gonna get worse as the older generation passes.|||If you can give in writing that everything will be 50/50 post marriage and No-fault divorce (if no one cheated). The perhaps!   Otherwise, you’ll have to wait until he becomes financially comfortable enough to do a 30/70 commitment/ marriage.|||Its because of arrange marriage, first guy will use and throw and they will anyway find a good girl through arrange marriage so that’s a common trend in our community|||May be they're not sure if they've found the one vanera also since marriage is long term so suru mai vanna garo hunxa its a big life decision so time lina parcha.  Me personally I only continue stuff if I see us getting married if things go well like there shouldn't be a lot of roadblocks if not I end things early. If you're not dating to marry you're dating for a heartbreak is how I see things.  Commitment is not an issue from what I've seen but the thing is Nepal ma people don't date they kind of settle with people they find so testo case ma they might want to explore more or aren't sure if they're the one vanera.  Else if a guy feels you're good enough there should be no commitment issues tbh.|||Marriage comes with responsibilities which we arenot ready for…i can say for myself that i amnot where i want to be in life which makes me incapable of thinking about marriage in the near future….|||Time aaudai xa na aatiu balla vetdai xeau tme le ramro manxe|||This is one thing that can't be generalized. People have their own reasons.|||Yeah kids these days are hopeless. Hami ni 5 years date garera bihe gariyo and we were committed from day one. Mero ni euta Bhai xa bihe nai gardina vanxa.|||Teita our generation are afraid of commitment and marriage. I believe there are many reasons to it. When you're committed and married to someone there is a huge responsibilities which many think of it as s burden. There're financial reasons too. For some they prioritize education, career growth and personal development. And i believe one of the big reason is the desire for freedom.|||>So why does commitment scare so many men now? What changed between generations? Why do they want everything except responsibility?  In older generations, girls used to withhold sex and other physical interactions until a guy either actually marries them, or at least meets parents or at least consistently promises to marry them. Nowadays, those physical interactions are easy to come and even if you withhold it from them, somebody else will provide it for them. And that leads to non-commitment. If they can get things without being committed, they dont see a reason to commit or marry. Think: if they can get someone to emotionally care for them, fulfill the physical needs, why do they want the stress of commitment and marriage?|||For people who say “because feminism”, what do y’all think feminism is?",

I warned the RSP supporters here about kulman being a commie. I didn't want RSP to turn into another communist party, libtard party. Its good for RSP that kulman has left. If not now, he'd have left later.   Kulman is good at management , I won't question that; at least better than most civil servants. But on policy level he'll be disaster. When he was minister, he took big decisions that could be costly for nation.

There is a free program called Flavortown run by Hack Club in collaboration with GitHub for high school students ages 13–18. Students build and ship open source projects on GitHub and earn points for the time they spend.  Those points can be exchanged for real prizes like a MacBook Air, iPad Air, Quest 3, Nothing headphones, and more. It is not a competition and there is no cost to join.  Seems like a good way to encourage younger students to actually build projects instead of just following tutorials. Worth sharing with younger siblings or any high schoolers interested in coding.

So, plan was made to meet in the evening, I go home, put my bags, tell them I am going to meet this friend, they are angry tell me not to go, I contemplate for a while, but I do want to go so I go to meet them because I don't want to get out of my house on sat which is the only rest day for me. I reach to restaurant, my mother video calls me to show her the \"proof\" that I am meeting this friend. I show her the \"proof\". I am quite angry and disappointed that she doesn't trust. I reach home at around 9pm and now both my parents give me silent treatment, like they don't shout at me but give me silent treatment which I think is even worse... well I think this IS normal in nepali household I just wanted to vent",

But I didn’t give in. Every time I didn’t, it felt like a small win.  Honestly, quitting smoking is the best decision I’ve ever made.  If you’re young or just getting into it, QUIT NOW.

After long hours of searching through junlges and residental areas, we finally found the friend on the highway while he was walking his way to ktm from butwal. he was running away from us. The thing is, something inside his brain snapped. maybe life happened. we wanted to take him to sudhar kendra.  After finally catching him up, i tried to have a normal convo with him. there were only two of us who found and caught him at that time. we were waiting for others to come. my another friend went out to bring water for him. Suddenly, he leveraged the situation to run away from me. I got injured in my head and hand  Then i tried chasing him. The only thing in my mind was, dude it took so long and effort to finally find him. He was attempting to harm himself at times. So, we couldn't let him get away.

As I grew older I started to accept that it is completely okay and even necessary to do the things I enjoy and love and just hang out with the people I like, and that I don't have to try so hard to fit in. Only by pursuing what I myself wanted to do (and not getting involved in things I didn't really) did I start feeling like my authentic self, who I had kept suppressed inside me. It helped that I'm abroad now and also seeing a therapist occasionally to talk through such trauma.  Push yourself to do the things you want and don't judge yourself so harshly.

That is a natural progression to what you’re feeling. You did not grow in a social environment, of course it won’t feel natural to socialise.   On one hand you will begin to improve in socialising if you keep doing it and also realise that socialising is a two way street. On the other hand, what you learned in your childhood will stick with you for a long time. You will always be hyperaware of your surroundings. Specially the people.   Don’t forget to realise a few facts every once a while. This is the loneliest generation there’s ever been. Everybody is afraid to make the first move. We didn’t deserve to be burdened with the pile of shit they received from someone else but such is life. Let’s get on with it.

I had the exact same environment and I'm just starting to see how it's so deeply rooted in me now in my early twenties. I can't voice my feelings out or express what I want without feeling like my throat is tied with barbed wires bro.  Everytime I try and speak my emotions or feelings, even basic ones that don't seem like much to other people, I start getting tears in my eyes and I automatically shut down. Can't get a word of my opinion out. Don't even get me started on fights, misunderstandings and disagreements. They feel like hell to me even though I know it's nothing big.  It might feel like there's nothing you can do about it but trust me, it will go away even if it takes a lot of sacrificing your comfort zones. Don't cancel plans when your friends ask to hangout, start letting them in your heart, relationships require sacrifices too, you gotta do things that you don't really wanna do and instead just sit in your room alone. Get out of this loop, go for a short hangout with people that you feel comfortable with, start investing in friendships and I'm sure it's gonna start feeling better.  There's times where I feel like I'd be better off alone in this world, I don't need people at all, and that friends are just intervening my life. That happens so often. You don't need to push these feelings away, let it come but then let it go. Humans do need people after all. So please get out and make changes, even if you have to fake it. It will get you going.  Also the most important part, let your parents be disappointed, as controversial as this may sound, that's the only way you can brace your heart and start doing what you want. Parents do get worried and that's valid but as a saying goes \"ships are safe in the harbor but ships are made to sail\", yes you are comfortable and safe and away from your parents nagging in that room, but how long will you let that keep you lonely?|||You have my sympathy.|||It's same for rebel too.....I'm very rebellious but the amount of energy u drain is crazy.......so to restore it I stay back at home most of the time..........|||Rebelling is the key  I just entered adulthood, and I rebel a lot and eventually they'll give up (hopefully)|||Just believe in ‘teleology’ instead of ‘aetiology’.

The few times I hung out with Nepalis I realized they're basically living in Nepal with Nepali mentality while abroad.

For most young people: -   Most Nepali come here to work on a student visa, not for study. They enroll in a cheap college which is mostly populated with Nepali or foreigners from south asian countries.   Then, they need to find work, since they can’t work more than 20 hours legally, they need to find work in cash, so they need to network with Nepali people who work in cash to bypass the work hour requirements.   Then, they need to find a cheap place to stay. Probably 2-4 people crammed in a single room sleeping in bunk beds. Guess who is willing to do that ? Other Nepali or south asians.   For married couples :  They don’t live in crammed rooms but navigating lives and work pressures help them better relate with eachother than foreigners of that land.  ——————————  It is not a nepali trait or south asian trait. It is a socio-economic trait.   Nepali students who actually can afford their tuition without working illegally having a partner just to make ends meet live a completely different life.   They have the luxury to go out after college to socialize, visit new places with friends, participate in clubs and events. Become members of universities bodies, a representative or host in Universities, and many other involvement where they make connections with people of all backgrounds. They explore leadership opportunities and develop their social skills.  All this while most Nepali students don’t have enough time to sleep cus they have to earn, pay for tuition and send money back home. God bless them, they are so tough. I could have never been able to do that.   ———————  I was lucky enough not to worry about money and my tuition. So i had a lot of free time. There was a point where I knew almost everyone in my Uni ( literally speaking ) and i used to host weekly events in uni. I have got friends from all over the globe. I knew just 2 nepali people from my uni, just 2 ( one was a girl i dated, if i wasn’t dating her, I don’t think we would have spent any time together ). I tried to find more but i never bumped into nepali people in any in places i found myself in.   Not a single Nepali person besides me, in my entire college degree, across all courses. Not a single Nepali person in any events I attended. I was the only Nepali in the first two jobs i did.   Unless i went to nepali events, i was not around Nepali people. I go to Nepali events just to meet Nepali people so i can make more Nepali friends because almost none of my friends are Nepali.   ———————  So yeah, there are some language and cultural barriers but these are insignificant. I think the socioeconomic barrier is the biggest reason why Nepali people stick together. Although for some people the cultural barriers might hold more weight|||Most People are naturally attracted to people  similar to them|||It really depends on Where you're located and type of Community you in.

I also feel that if you move abroad for education, you’re more likely to meet many Nepali friends.

Did we really cross ethnic lines in Nepal or did we stay comfortably within our own circles? Did a Pahadi genuinely sit, eat, celebrate, and struggle alongside a Madhesi and vice versa? How many close friends did we truly have from so called lower castes not just as acquaintances but as people we regularly hung out with, defended, and learned from? How many of us who ask this question actually learned Maithili, Bhojpuri, Newari, Tamang, Gurung, or Tharu by choice and not because we had to?  If we did not assimilate in a country as diverse as Nepal, why do we expect people to suddenly become global citizens the moment they cross a border?  Isn’t it human nature to seek familiarity when everything else language, culture, food, accent is unfamiliar? When someone is already navigating visas, racism, homesickness, and identity struggles, is it really surprising that they hold on to the one space where they do not have to explain themselves?  And when Nepalis abroad spend time with other Nepalis, is it exclusion or survival? Is posting vlogs and photos with familiar faces a rejection of the world or simply documenting comfort? Do we ask the same questions about Italians Chinese or Mexicans abroad or do we reserve this criticism only for Nepalis?  Maybe the real question is not why they do not explore but why we romanticize exploration abroad while ignoring the lack of it at home.  If we could not fully embrace diversity in Nepal a country with dozens of languages countless cultures and everyday diversity, what makes us think a plane ticket alone changes that?|||1) Just because you want to hang out with them doesn’t necessarily mean they also wanna do the same. Lot of White colored people do want to hangout with other white people only. Lot of white people only want to date white people. It doesn’t have to be racism and could just be of choice. Whats happening in the US today isn’t happening because of 1 person disliking non white population, there are many as such. So yea, for 1 they also do not like to hangout with non white people so thats kinda why Nepali are seen hanging out with their own.  2) Its also not very easy to hangout with different cultures. The reason nepali people gets along with Indians is due to commonality between our culture the way we are brought up. That just makes it easy to communicate and of course functions and religion bring us together. Sometimes our upbringing makes it so difficult to hangout with white culture. Something Thats very basic or normal to us might be offending to them.   These are some basic reasons why nepali are seen hanging out with other nepali or just desi community. Even our struggles are similar, so it’s out of convenience and commonalities.|||Why do Nepali people abroad only eat Nepali food?? There are so many better options|||I avoid Nepalis like the plague",

Or is it a tactical move to reach specific \"pockets\" of voters that have been traditionally overlooked? I’m particularly interested in:  ​The Newar script: It’s such a powerful cultural statement to see it in a public, political space.  ​The Urdu/Tibetan choice: These feel like very specific demographic \"nods.\" Is this happening more frequently in certain districts?  ​I’d love to hear from anyone who lives in these areas or knows more about the political strategy behind this.

Good income, modern work, flexibility on paper but something felt missing.   So during breaks and holidays, I started asking myself a serious question:  What kind of work actually leads to a happy life?  I began researching different sectors and talking to people. Eventually, I kept coming back to agriculture.  I started visiting farms and speaking with farmers. I asked almost every one of them a simple question: \"Are you happy with your life?”  Almost all of them said yes  without hesitation.  And that surprised me.  These weren’t people living in luxury. Some of them had loans. Some worked long hours. Some didn’t own fancy things. But they had something that felt rare:  * They controlled their time * They worked with their hands and the land * They lived close to their families * They saw the direct result of their effort every day  Meanwhile, I noticed something else. In places like the USA and Australia, many people spend 30 years paying off homes and farmland. On paper, they are “successful.” But many of them barely see their families, live under stress, and don’t feel free.  So what actually makes someone happy?  It doesn’t seem to be money, or job title, or how modern your work is. It seems to be perception, freedom, purpose, and family.  Farmers may not be rich in the way society defines it but many of them are rich in time, peace, and connection. And those are things money can’t easily buy.  This made me rethink everything I was chasing.  Maybe happiness isn’t about climbing higher.   Maybe it’s about standing somewhere that feels right.  I ask everyone what happiness define you ?",

Will he be happy when his children blame him for not being able to give them good schooling and a stable income source?   Your analysis of happiness is valid if the farmer earns well enough for basic needs+emergencies. Even if we forget other luxuries.

Case 2: Deuba and old parties are instructed to hold on to power by India and China.  Why?- Lets look in Europe. Lookup Victoria Nuland: she is high level US diplomat (probably retired now)believed to be the mastermind behind election of Zelensky in Ukraine and probably pushing for the war (there are leaked audio clips too probably available in internet.).  A coincidence that she happened to have visited Nepal and Bangladesh in 2023.   A coincidence that most of the emerging Gen-Z leaders happen to have ties to US and Europe supported leadership programs. For instance Rakshya Bam was part of it back in 2021-22 or something like that. Let us not forget that that Late King Birendra was killed in one of the most secured places in Nepal. Something about police shooting young people all of sudden doesn’t make sense at all.   A coincidence that she is closely linked with Gagan Thapa who coincidently happens to have the biggest voice for MCC and has close ties with US embassy. Could be a ploy to weaken existing parties to bring RSP to power. With RSP in power you get a government and youngsters who grew up hating neighbours (india and china-probably china not as much)which can now be easily manipulated and controlled.  Why again? India and China are aligning with Russia and in process of formation of alliance to stand up against US. Lookup BRICS. Not to forget their rise and rising dominance in global trade while US is sinking in debt.  Nepal, bangladesh, pakistan are going to be nerves which US and Europe would like to press every now and then to pressure India and China.   Could it be that Nepal is just a battleground for war being fought somewhere else? Very likely.   I would not be surprised if Nepal turns into a battleground in next 5-10 years, where madesh, free Tibet and gorkhaland issues start to resurface.  Interesting and dark times could be ahead. Probably not the best times to godify western taught youth leaders to align and take command of Nepal. Tada ko deuta vanda najik ko bhoot thik. Probably need organic nepali politicians to lead. Best case scenario for Nepal could be the return of king or have pro-china or pro-india gov. Gagan is probably not the best person. Possibly why Deuba could be backed by India and KP and PKD by china.  Chances are there are bigger things at play. See what happens.",

If in lalitpur, st.xavier or rato bangla is your best bet.|||kaasthamandap is a safe option|||Hiya, Ive seen some concerns abt St. Xavier's and as a student who studied there from 1 to 12 in both the Jawalakhel and Maitighar campus i can assure you that religion or pushing christianity down your throat is like the least concerning part of the school. Most teachers aren't christians, similarly with the students. Its non existent. The most christian part of the school is that they can provide catechism classes to some Christian students if they want it and they have mass or smthing (i was never went/had to go).   I'm an atheist and grew up in a Buddhist family so i can say that much. Other than that, the school is pretty good, not as modern as other schools since the fee is def at the lower end of the spectrum for good schools. The school campus is nice but the classrooms are meh at best. They have pretty nice clubs and has the whole traditional english house system like in hogwarts with a head girl/boy situation. The A levels dept in maitighar defo got the most funding. Also the +2 dept in maitighar is def one of if not the best in ktm. Like people prep for the entrance exams to study there but personally it's more the students that are good. Also your child needs to pass an entrance exam to even get into grade 1 actually, i forgot abt that.|||I come from a diplomat family so we move places often.

For individuals who are confident, capable, and motivated to do more in life, there are many alternative paths and platforms that allow one to build a meaningful career by investing in personal growth, skills, and long-term goals rather than primarily emphasizing appearance and short-term recognition.

Edward was the one who i’d say bought optiver to iit Hyderabad and scored a job there, he is also the advisor for iicpc, you can search his linkedin to see what all he does. The main thing that i think can land you a good job is to be able to find patterns in questions and staying in network with what ever sector you have passion in and applying those concepts finding ways to improve already built systems makes companies understand that you have what it takes to improve what they’ve already built just blind dsa wont get you far but it will help you in starting your career.

Essentially doing a drill over and over until you're fairly confident to take on almost any curve ball interview question.  Whilst you wouldn't be asked to invert a binary tree on your interview, it'd help you understand in a broader sense how to break down a problem and solve it.  Not to mention NPath, Cyclomatic, Coupling, and time complexity. These are things you need to absolutely nail down when working with anything beyond a basic crud app, which can be vibe coded easily these days.  So how'd that set you apart? Well, essentially, it'd enable you to be a quick thinker. If you don't need to get stuck when programming on the basics, you are able to instead divert your faculties to actual problems that require your energy.|||That is not leetcode, that is codeforces which is a much higher level than leetcode.

However, I've recently realized that this isn't the case in Nepali government institutions.

Aren’t all universities in Nepal considered similar?  I did get the equivalence, but it says it’s equivalent to a “relevant subject,” and the Army told me it’s not enough to proceed with the application. They essentially said that unless I have a certificate specifically stating that my course is equivalent to Computer Engineering, there’s no point in continuing. (They suggested I should show up for the bearing and physical tests, but couldn’t confirm whether I’d even get the opportunity. So, I decided to drop out of that path.)  Now, after seeing the NEA vacancy announcement, I noticed they also specifically require a Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering.

As a final-year CSIT student, I didn't have a corporate budget, so I had to be strategic with free and low-cost resources.  I see a lot of people asking if 1 month is enough. It is, but I studied **6 hours a day** strictly. Here is exactly how I did it.  **The Timeline (30 Days)**  * **Days 1-12:** Watched the FreeCodeCamp AWS course (Andrew Brown) on YouTube. I didn't just watch; I took notes on *everything*. * **Days 13-20:** Deep dive into **Tutorials Dojo Cheatsheets**. This was a lifesaver for confusing topics like VPC peering vs. Transit Gateway. * **Days 21-29:** The Grind. I used **ExamPrepper** and went through **1,019 practice questions**. * **Day 30:** Rest & Light review.  **The Resources:**  1. **FreeCodeCamp (YouTube):** Best free resource to understand the basics. 2. **Tutorials Dojo (Cheatsheets):** Mandatory for understanding the small differences between services. 3. **ExamPrepper:** I did 1,000+ questions. This helped me build speed and learn to spot \"distractor\" answers.  **Exam Experience:** The questions were wordy. Managing time was harder than I thought. Because I practiced so many questions beforehand, I could quickly identify keywords (e.g., \"highly available\" vs \"cost-optimized\").  Happy to answer any questions about the exam or my schedule!",

It will just give incentive for the employers to not pay us.    2nd thing: Any decent company which actually has decent employees and is actually willing to grow their interns will ALWAYS PAY YOU in 99% of the cases. The ones who do not pay are the worst ones. I have seen this happening with my friends. The company is completely unstructured, they do not guide the interns. They just expect them to work for free without providing any help.    3rd thing: Now that you have been rejected so many times, maybe bro it's time that you reflect on your SKILL set.

She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

            "body": "I've been tempted to write this for a long time.       I was in a relationship with a popular male influencer for a long time. We broke up 2 years ago. During our 3+ year-long relationship, I got to be in his inner circle and hung out with Sisan and gang (and Shrinkhala too, before she went to Harvard). We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective. Just like Shrinkhala shamelessly posted those yellow highlighted Excel Sheets as her proof of innocence which had no third party audit or any verification.|||I have never watched Sisan Baniya, but I didn't feel that he ever portrayed himself as self made or coming from a humble background. He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Yeah, Sisan isn't 'dudh ka dhula' as he shows himself to be, he might be even worse. But honestly, I can't tell if you're being genuine or just doing PR for Shrinkhala.|||Are you Mr. foodie's ex gf ?

And look at this babal store, restaurants and so on within a year or so and that too in very prime area.  That guy is fully loaded.|||Well..

Before he was viral. Even mod a subreddit for his work. And I do understand separating between the art and the artists. This all sounds very true and feels consistent with his person out of his art (videos)  It’s funny to see Sisan’s Simp Boys here, not even ready to listen to a different perspective. And they give such an Incel vibe, hating up on a woman.  I really hope they are all kids who will grow out of this someday and realize how lame they were.  Sisan 500% milked his breakup while Shrinkhala and was so out of character for the graceful guy character he tries to build up in vlogs.|||The day when he was targeting his ex.

Always good guy, never saying anything is ever bad. No negative reviews, ever. That is not a normal human behaviour. People are allowed to dislike things. Tesaile I knew his vlogs were heavily scripted or edited to discount the bad parts, meaning not the real thing.|||Never liked Sisan. All the hype building around him. Never watched his Vlog. I also dont like Shrinkhala though.|||[deleted]|||Source-trust me bro|||Haha. I thought people saw through Baniya.

I think i know who you are. I also worked and hung out with and around Sisan Shrinkhala a lot. So after the breakup, the way he acted like a kicked dog and gained public sympathy from incels licking on his balls and slut shaming Shrinkhala was so insane. And the way he spoke up about the Miss Nepal funds k k when the hate for her was at an all time high. Personally I have no sympathy or love for Shrinkhala so I am not saying this to defend her.   But everyone who has been around Sisan knows how opportunistic he is. Dhunga faalera haat lukaune khaalko manche ho. And everyone talks about it too in our circle.|||Well, the tea was fantastic.

What an absolute joke. Absolute witch hunting behaviour. She was cool until she was relateable to most women but once you marry rich thats the end of it for women. Take away every thing that she has ever achieved and yeah jump on the hate train wagon.Most people who know sisan personally know that he is absolute shit head. Absolute narc. I know some of them and they all say that he didnt pay half of his saff well. Always made them work extra hours with out paying them well. And those who know them up and close know that the rumour about shrinkhala putting an extra effort on the relationship is true. I have even heard that Shrinkhala was ready to marry him but he kind of side lined and said he is not ready or something. He was always a snob dont know what took people so long to recognise. When he was in relationship with shrinkhala he would always put thumbnail of her in every video he posted to cash in the view and any body can tell he did the same thing after they broke up, used  every opportunity to capitalise her name, when we all know she was quite for the longest time.

I used to watch his vlog in 2019 and haven't been following him for a long time. The way he portrays himself, his Paradygm TV nonsense, I never liked that. And the way he helped to intensify hate and misinformation about Shrinkhala during that difficult time for her, shows the true character of the person.  It was (still is) unpopular to support Shrinkhala and criticize Sisan but we should never hesitate to tell the truth. Plus anybody whose father owns a house in Kathmandu is never struggling. I don't ever believe that nonsense.|||Sharing your personal experience is fine. But why are you referring to his ex as 'Buddhist girl'?

The circumstances favored him because she then went on to date the business family heir shortly after.   But I've heard many narratives of both of them, some on reddit, some from friends in the media etc. And again reading this post has really led me to believe that BOTH are snakes. So so very capable of taking advantage of another person or situation for personal gains.   While I welcome reddit posts like these because it reminds people like us that each story has two sides and we need to Stop idolizing celebs/influencers, it is also important for us not to dive too much into these things and debate over 'what or who' is correct.

He seems the most capable guy among all the fkin leaders, including balen and rabi. When he speaks , he always seems calm even when he is provoked, unlike balen. He does not have an ongoing corruption case like that of rabi. He is an engineer who studied at the most prestigious university of our country and also studied at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. he went as a Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar to study water science, policy, and management. This is different from most engineering degrees  because he isn't just an engineer who can build a hydropower or dam. He has knowledge of policies and understands the economics and geopolitics of water—Nepal's most valuable resource. Has worked in developing countries in Africa. Seems like he has some political knowledge. Also, rabi and balen were celebrity figures, but he wasn't and dared to challenge one of the biggest political figures in a less urban or even rural city(dadeldhura). In a time where every nepalese wants to leave the country, a guy from oxford who could have easily left the country, not only staying but wants change in his country, shows bravery and patriotism. He hasn't been in power, so we can't gauge him, but we can gauge him based on what we have seen so far - a calm, educated, brave and exceptionally brilliant young guy, and i would definitely prefer him over any politican i have witnessed so far.|||\"Oxford padheko bhandai ma should be a leader\"  Can see the mindset of OP here.

Renu has made a name for herself in Bharatpur but this will be an election for parliament and not mayor. Last election chitwan had a rabi effect where people in other constituencies voted for him because he was contesting from chitwan and his influence was so immense even the constituency in the neighbouring district were effected. Nawalpur which was considered a stronghold of NC nearly lost to RSP in 2079. Also, chitwan - 3 was won by RPP and previously by prachanda. Even though renu had influence in the constituency, they did not risk prachanda. After what happened in sept 23/24, i don't think people are going to vote for individual and would rather vote for a party other than the big 3. Expect to see rabi campaigning aggressively in chitwan -3 than chitwan - 2|||from being chitwan 3 I see it very unlikely Renu would lose this election. Despite she being Prachanda's daughter, she has made a name for herself as a mayor here. If Rabi was going against her, then this would've been a tight competition imo. Yes, ghanti gang do be making noise in chitwan but deep down we all know Renu has brought visible and tangible change on the ground level. I do not support the way she won her last election (a can of worms there) but I do have to acknowledge the work she has done.|||Renu will not lose in Chitwan immovable object|||Media trial, if she runs from chitwan -3, rsp is sacrificing such a gem.

RSP know this, probably trying to sacrifice her or its some ninjutsu we dont know.   But no way RSP winning Renu dahal.

Thats his birthplace right?   Its also better for RSP to get control over Madesh province. Let Sobita contest from here.|||Balen should go and contest against Renu in her own backyard or KP or prachanda or anyone of those big names.

She has done wonders for bharatpur people|||Bikram Pandey laughing from Chitwan 3|||Haha balen lai Mayor re party ko upa sabhapti bhnnera kina nabhneko hol|||RSP can sweep chitwan 3. First, rsp has a good base there. Second, Renu has done some works, but more manipulation of media people and influencers to brand her as developmentalist. She has been surrounded by few controversies. One example: dumping of waste in narayani river. Third, prachanda ran away from chitwan-3 last election thinking ravi will contest from chitwan-3. Ravi´s craze is even more now with balen and kulman joining rsp. A strong rsp candidate can be victorious. Fourth, there is a decline in craze of uml and congress among under 35 people of chitwan. I myself interacted with few people from different wards of bharatpur and madi and barring few, all said they won`t vote for big 3 and bikram pandey and are looking for new political force.  P.S.- Personally, I do not think shobita will contest from chitwan -3 against renu. Her businessman husband is super close with prachanda and even shobita has become close with prachanda due to family matters. Plus she won kathmandu-2 last time just because of ravi craze at that moment. Not even 500 people from kathmandu-2 heard about her before. She is indeed a good orator and law student. i have known her since AYON days when she lost a election in ayon. Besides good oration in parliament, she has literally not done anything for kathmandu -2. ( You can ask any voter of kathmandu 2, like tinkune, sinamangal area, pepsocola what she has done for kathmandu-2 ) I hope rsp will bring some local candidate from chitwan with clean image. If rsp brings shobita, she will definitely cut vote of other candidates and any unpredictable result can come. She can grab good votes, but not enough to win the election.   - And i m not Rsp member or fan, just a curious youth following nepali politics 😀|||Balen mulla KP oli ko against ma uthne bhanera ufrirathiyo ta",

I remember a similar situation involving one of my friends. At the time, he was married and had a child, and there was a significant age difference between him and a relative of his wife who was living with them. One evening, during a casual conversation, my friend shared that over time he noticed the person trying to become emotionally closer to him. He said that although he initially had no such intentions, she later expressed a desire for a secret relationship, emphasising that it was not about emotions or commitment.|||Xya kasto disgusting..man ta man vayi halyo (not excuse but ghero se kya umeed) Tara afnei buini testi??

Don’t treat us with respect we leave and find someone better. That’s just the way it is.   If she had treated him better, he would not have gotten close to her sister. It just shows that she is a toxic person that doesn’t care for that man. Not talking for 1-2 months over a small argument is just not it. Especially after pregnancy (meaning he’s not getting laid). A man has needs. Intimacy and Respect.  Good on him for finding someone better when he didn’t get what he want from his partner.

            "body": "This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

But let's not sympathize with these cronies and corrupt politicians. For decades, the real victims have been the everyday citizens of our country. Our Parliament, the Supreme Court, and Singha Durbar getting burned down is a bigger tragedy than some 5-star hotel or supermarket chain. We have been screwed over by these politicians and their business counterparts for so long that on that day, the entire country became a rage room.

I don’t think Nepali youth burning down this hotel or Bangladeshi youth burning down/breaking during the uprising in both countries have anything to do with extremism or religion for that matter. When you are going to protest against a bad government, practically I don’t think anyone have religion, race, color or anything of that sort in the back of their mind, the adrenaline is so high you are only focused on one thing.   During protests, when you see protesters burning down or breaking down anything, it is usually because that structure represent something significant. I know a lot of structures were burned, broken because they represented the tyranny under fascism. A significant driver behind Nepali uprising was corruption from what I understand, and I’m pretty sure this hotel was owned/majority stakeholder by some Nepali politicians, if so, then I see them burning a symbol of rampant corruption rather than a hotel.  That’s their perspective I suppose, nonetheless, I think it’s foolish to do things like this, and I’m sure some of them will look back and realize maybe it was foolish.|||You witnessed a freaking big-ass revolution, not some child-play games.

            "body": "It’s 2026 now, and we’re still having to deal with this.  A few days ago, early in the morning, I was on the street and saw a public bus with people literally hanging from the door. It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

This problem needs to be adressed and public transportation should be well organized and planned.|||Finally, someone spoke about this. This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this. This issue really needs more attention and more noise.|||KTM has enough budget with 40 percent going unused. these transportation comes under metropolitan ko authority. ask Mayor balen.

Stood for political, social and economic justice throughout his life and didn't compromise for anything.    He took most of the responsibility and he did make mistakes (and he has accepted them gracefully in is biography).      You see, the problem with our generation is we read too less to judge a person and almost fail to account the then social and political scenario of the country. So, my suggestion would be you read yourself and don't judge him based on my opinion or other few incidents or stories mentioned in the comments.   Personally, He gave me the definition of democracy. Here is one story of his conversation with his nephew Naresh Koirala.   *Naresh himself had been puzzled by his uncle’s decision to accept the result. On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP. Mahendra and Birendra believed themselves to be the savior of common \"*naive\"* Nepali.    While BP simply believed that Nepali people irrespective of their education, culture, caste, religion, sex or whatsoever are capable to choose their leaders themselves and make them responsible.|||One of the greatest writers, Nepal has ever produced.|||This guy high moral values unlike present  Congress.

Private sector should be let to invest and create jobs, while government regulates effectively.  Also, they should be very wise while speaking about international relations.

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.  I (21M) and my sibling (15F) are taking care of our parents during the day and our cousins help at night. Because of this, we’ve missed months of classes but we don’t really have a choice right now.  If anyone is able to help even a small amount, it would mean a lot to us.  I’ve verified the case with two of the mods and I’ll be posting medical reports in the comments as well.  Please DM or comment if you can help in any way. Even sharing this post would really help.",

            "heading": "AMA : I have been using menstrual cups for ~8 years. Ask me anything.",
            "body": "**Disclaimer** : this is not an Ad. I have been using menstrual cups for around 8 years and have recommended it to many women in my life. All have loved it and have made the switch from pads/tampons. So i decided to spread the word here.   **Tldr**: Menstrual cups will change your life. it will give you much more freedom and flexibility than period products like pads or tampons.   First of all, what is a Menstrual cup?   A menstrual cup is a reusable, flexible silicone cup inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual fluid. It can be worn up to 12 hours and can be used for several years with proper care.   I have made a list of pro and cons that i have faced in these years. You are welcome to ask more questions. I will answer as many as i can. Serious questions only please!   **PRO**:   1. To start with the basics, menstrual flow is more than just liquid blood. it has many semi-solid/solid things like mucus and blood vessels. So a pad or tampons just cannot ‘absorb’ them. these things just lay there on the surface making you feel slimy and uncomfortable. Instead the cup ‘collects’ it so it doesn’t have this issue.  2. You dont have to worry about a pad shifting from its place. you know the feeling, when the pad is too far back or too far on one side. Also, you dont feel the blood flow ‘out’ like when you laugh or sneeze or stand up. Menstrual cup catches the blood before it gets out.  3. Its an upfront investment but one that will be much cheaper in the long run. You wont have to cash out hundreds of rupees each month on period products.  4. Its better for the environment as it creates little to no waste.  5. Its better when you are out, for example, at other people’s place. you dont have to worry about where to dump your used period products.  6. You dont feel it at all once its inside. you can just live your normal day and forget about it. then only at the end of the day you empty, clean and put it back on. (if its a heavy flow day then i empty it once in the middle of the day too)  7. No issues with friction / rashes on the inner thighs.   **CON** :   1. It has a slightly steep learning curve. I know a lot of people have anxiety of putting it in and getting it out. i did too. but once you have done it a couple of times, you will get a hang of it. There are many tutorials available online for this. I personally fold the cup in a C shape and put it in and then to be sure its secure, I check for suction by pulling/rotating it a bit. Getting it out can feel a bit scary at first. When getting it out, i hold the cup on its body and not just the tip to be sure that the tip doesn’t break. But like i said, once you have done it a few times, it will feel normal.  2. I find it most comfortable to empty the cup in a toilet that has a basin inside it. so I can empty it in the basin, clean the cup and put it in again. it can be done in a toilet stall (without basin) too but you have to be a bit more careful and you will need some tissues to clean the blood off your hands before coming out of the stall.  3. it requires a bit of investment in the beginning even to try (but it will pay off long term if it works out)  4. It can leak, very rarely but sometimes. The leakage is usually minimal so for this, you can use something light like panty liners or period panties. You can try out your options here.   **Recommendations**:   1. When first trying it out, you can try it for a couple of hours at a time when you are not having heavy flow and when you are staying home. This way you will also have an idea of how much blood comes out (spoiler alert: its much less than what you would expect) and how frequently you need to empty the cup.  2. always clean your hands with soap before and after putting/removing the cup.  3. hold the cup by its body (base of the cup) and not just its tip when pulling it out.  4. There are a lot of tutorials, feedback, helpful materials available online. Please be brave and give it a try. you will thank me later :)  —————————————————————————-  **Edit 1**: some people are asking about which brands to use. If someone is a new user of Menstrual cups, could you please let us know about your experience with it and which brand you are using?",

Kulman was getting a lot of hate even here, let's not even talk about Balen. I wake up, and there's half a million likes on this simple photo without any details . Now everyone is fully behind Balen as the PM while Rabi will be the party man .. it's a great thing , probably the best news to come out for our contry in a while but I fear people will turn on them sooner than later. Single man, single constituency Ra executive elections and legislative elections are very different things, to run an organisation of over half a million supporters is a HUGE HUGE task . People didn't even look at what terms they agreed on .. no policies no vision just the news that they came together was enough and it will more than likely be enough to win the elections but the real problems will come after that. People who are with them are also Nepali people , the same people who were once close to the old parties , not all but most of them. And they will have their flaws , there will be problems related to distribution of power but all this comes in the later phases when there will be many winners and many leaders . I just hope Rabi becomes more grounded in terms of his promises and Balen starts interacting with the public and media .. sadhai Facebook ma status matra halera ta hudaina these people will make fake news and assumptions because He doesn't ever talk to the media and provide regular press releases . Citizens of Nepal, please support whoever you want to support but support them for thier vision and policies not for their fiery speeches and just because they are against Congress UMl and Maoists .

There is a saying if it acts like a duck and quacks like a duck it is a duck. Basically new parties old methods. Bhagbanda ko rajniti, nothing more.  But what I don't understand is why RSP needed to have this agreement? RSP is capable of getting good election result and Rabi is well loved by people so he is as strong a candidate for PM as Balen. I smell something fishy! Balen basically built the current government with his man as Home Minister. There is a good chance Rabi was given a way out of prision for agreeing to this bullshit arrangement.

I remember when he talked about doing this in his free time.|||This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

Most of the teachers in school and college all of the are pedophiles.|||I'm not aware of the definition - is it like somebody who's grooming girls under 18? Are you using the term loosely?  It's an individual-thing and not a profession-thing. Girls sending DMs to get referred (when they have no skills) is also more common than you think. I get many DMs asking for free help (refactors)/ referrals (barely know them/ barely seen their code) and I just ignore them. I help many people (m/f) on a daily basis, and I've never met most of them. I know many of my 'male' senior friends (no female senior dev friends) do the same.  You should clear your exams first. Last bullet point sounds like a good plan.  Most people here will be happy to review 1-2 projects for free. I'll jump in if it's Python/ Next.js/ ML. Just post your github repo on some relevant community and they'll do free reviews.   Edit: I dont do free mentorships, happy to review repos/ coding practices.|||In my experience, Girls seem to help girl only when they are on some “female tech organization” and it’s rarely a technical mentorship.

Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

Also, the *cost of vehicles* in Nepal is much higher than in India. Cars that cost ₹7–10 L in India often cost 2–3× more in Nepal (sometimes even higher when taxes + import duties are added), and this is widely reported.  This means:  1. The same car/automobile can cost roughly 2–3 times more in Nepal because of heavy import taxes and logistics costs. 2. Almost everything (especially cars, electronics, imported goods) is more expensive in Nepal, except for some basic categories like food and rent, which are generally cheaper compared to big Indian cities.",

When you know exactly what to do it's pretty easy to write the code for it. The hardest part of IT is trying to find out what the right questions to ask is so that you have a semblance on what exactly to code. It's trying to understand what the users of your software want.

You dont get to decide who is a fool|||with the increase in AI expect to get shitty codes delivered faster than we have ever seen. Shitty code, more bugs and more opportunities for IT devs. Not every company can afford AI that is going to cost fortune in long run. Mid-level devs would collapse, there would be junior then senior. Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||[deleted]|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||Skill issue.

Don't get me wrong - vibe coding and low code/no code methods are getting popular with some LLM coders (Claude, Gemini) becoming absolute beasts, but, the real need of a human is in problem solving and building scalable systems. My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.  The problem is people jumping on the bandwagon which is creating a terrible environment for business owners, recruiters and stakeholders.  I hope you do well in your career my friend.

She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective. Just like Shrinkhala shamelessly posted those yellow highlighted Excel Sheets as her proof of innocence which had no third party audit or any verification.|||I have never watched Sisan Baniya, but I didn't feel that he ever portrayed himself as self made or coming from a humble background. He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Yeah, Sisan isn't 'dudh ka dhula' as he shows himself to be, he might be even worse. But honestly, I can't tell if you're being genuine or just doing PR for Shrinkhala.|||Are you Mr. foodie's ex gf ?

One of the client where I used to work said his dad has a huge business and big house for office, they sell medals, trophies with custom carving and expensive compared to others but you can get anything you asked for (like design, customization and more).   And look at this babal store, restaurants and so on within a year or so and that too in very prime area.  That guy is fully loaded.|||Well..

Before he was viral. Even mod a subreddit for his work. And I do understand separating between the art and the artists. This all sounds very true and feels consistent with his person out of his art (videos)  It’s funny to see Sisan’s Simp Boys here, not even ready to listen to a different perspective. And they give such an Incel vibe, hating up on a woman.  I really hope they are all kids who will grow out of this someday and realize how lame they were.  Sisan 500% milked his breakup while Shrinkhala and was so out of character for the graceful guy character he tries to build up in vlogs.|||The day when he was targeting his ex.

Always good guy, never saying anything is ever bad. No negative reviews, ever. That is not a normal human behaviour. People are allowed to dislike things. Tesaile I knew his vlogs were heavily scripted or edited to discount the bad parts, meaning not the real thing.|||Never liked Sisan. All the hype building around him. Never watched his Vlog. I also dont like Shrinkhala though.|||[deleted]|||Source-trust me bro|||Haha. I thought people saw through Baniya.

I think i know who you are. I also worked and hung out with and around Sisan Shrinkhala a lot. So after the breakup, the way he acted like a kicked dog and gained public sympathy from incels licking on his balls and slut shaming Shrinkhala was so insane. And the way he spoke up about the Miss Nepal funds k k when the hate for her was at an all time high. Personally I have no sympathy or love for Shrinkhala so I am not saying this to defend her.   But everyone who has been around Sisan knows how opportunistic he is. Dhunga faalera haat lukaune khaalko manche ho. And everyone talks about it too in our circle.|||Well, the tea was fantastic.

What an absolute joke. Absolute witch hunting behaviour. She was cool until she was relateable to most women but once you marry rich thats the end of it for women. Take away every thing that she has ever achieved and yeah jump on the hate train wagon.Most people who know sisan personally know that he is absolute shit head. Absolute narc. I know some of them and they all say that he didnt pay half of his saff well. Always made them work extra hours with out paying them well. And those who know them up and close know that the rumour about shrinkhala putting an extra effort on the relationship is true. I have even heard that Shrinkhala was ready to marry him but he kind of side lined and said he is not ready or something. He was always a snob dont know what took people so long to recognise. When he was in relationship with shrinkhala he would always put thumbnail of her in every video he posted to cash in the view and any body can tell he did the same thing after they broke up, used  every opportunity to capitalise her name, when we all know she was quite for the longest time.

I used to watch his vlog in 2019 and haven't been following him for a long time. The way he portrays himself, his Paradygm TV nonsense, I never liked that. And the way he helped to intensify hate and misinformation about Shrinkhala during that difficult time for her, shows the true character of the person.  It was (still is) unpopular to support Shrinkhala and criticize Sisan but we should never hesitate to tell the truth. Plus anybody whose father owns a house in Kathmandu is never struggling. I don't ever believe that nonsense.|||Sharing your personal experience is fine. But why are you referring to his ex as 'Buddhist girl'?

The circumstances favored him because she then went on to date the business family heir shortly after.   But I've heard many narratives of both of them, some on reddit, some from friends in the media etc. And again reading this post has really led me to believe that BOTH are snakes. So so very capable of taking advantage of another person or situation for personal gains.   While I welcome reddit posts like these because it reminds people like us that each story has two sides and we need to Stop idolizing celebs/influencers, it is also important for us not to dive too much into these things and debate over 'what or who' is correct.

He seems the most capable guy among all the fkin leaders, including balen and rabi. When he speaks , he always seems calm even when he is provoked, unlike balen. He does not have an ongoing corruption case like that of rabi. He is an engineer who studied at the most prestigious university of our country and also studied at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. he went as a Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar to study water science, policy, and management. This is different from most engineering degrees  because he isn't just an engineer who can build a hydropower or dam. He has knowledge of policies and understands the economics and geopolitics of water—Nepal's most valuable resource. Has worked in developing countries in Africa. Seems like he has some political knowledge. Also, rabi and balen were celebrity figures, but he wasn't and dared to challenge one of the biggest political figures in a less urban or even rural city(dadeldhura). In a time where every nepalese wants to leave the country, a guy from oxford who could have easily left the country, not only staying but wants change in his country, shows bravery and patriotism. He hasn't been in power, so we can't gauge him, but we can gauge him based on what we have seen so far - a calm, educated, brave and exceptionally brilliant young guy, and i would definitely prefer him over any politican i have witnessed so far.|||\"Oxford padheko bhandai ma should be a leader\"  Can see the mindset of OP here.

            "body": "This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

I don’t think Nepali youth burning down this hotel or Bangladeshi youth burning down/breaking during the uprising in both countries have anything to do with extremism or religion for that matter. When you are going to protest against a bad government, practically I don’t think anyone have religion, race, color or anything of that sort in the back of their mind, the adrenaline is so high you are only focused on one thing.   During protests, when you see protesters burning down or breaking down anything, it is usually because that structure represent something significant. I know a lot of structures were burned, broken because they represented the tyranny under fascism. A significant driver behind Nepali uprising was corruption from what I understand, and I’m pretty sure this hotel was owned/majority stakeholder by some Nepali politicians, if so, then I see them burning a symbol of rampant corruption rather than a hotel.  That’s their perspective I suppose, nonetheless, I think it’s foolish to do things like this, and I’m sure some of them will look back and realize maybe it was foolish.|||You witnessed a freaking big-ass revolution, not some child-play games.

            "body": "It’s 2026 now, and we’re still having to deal with this.  A few days ago, early in the morning, I was on the street and saw a public bus with people literally hanging from the door. It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this. This issue really needs more attention and more noise.|||KTM has enough budget with 40 percent going unused. these transportation comes under metropolitan ko authority. ask Mayor balen.

Stood for political, social and economic justice throughout his life and didn't compromise for anything.    He took most of the responsibility and he did make mistakes (and he has accepted them gracefully in is biography).      You see, the problem with our generation is we read too less to judge a person and almost fail to account the then social and political scenario of the country. So, my suggestion would be you read yourself and don't judge him based on my opinion or other few incidents or stories mentioned in the comments.   Personally, He gave me the definition of democracy. Here is one story of his conversation with his nephew Naresh Koirala.   *Naresh himself had been puzzled by his uncle’s decision to accept the result. On that balcony that day, he broached the touchy subject: perhaps Nepal was not yet ready for a western parliamentary style democracy – maybe only the literate and those with college degrees should be allowed to vote, he asked.*  *BP had a sharp and quick response: “That is exactly how tyrants think. That the common citizen knows nothing while the dictator himself, being all-knowing, holds all authority over the people’s choices and rights. That is exactly the type of thinking that gave rise to Hitlers and Stalins. Link:* [*https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala*](https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/last-days-with-bp-koirala)  In short, this very much describes the difference between the leaders of Panchayat and BP. Mahendra and Birendra believed themselves to be the savior of common \"*naive\"* Nepali.    While BP simply believed that Nepali people irrespective of their education, culture, caste, religion, sex or whatsoever are capable to choose their leaders themselves and make them responsible.|||One of the greatest writers, Nepal has ever produced.|||This guy high moral values unlike present  Congress.

We can advocate for legal reforms to ensure excessive security isn't granted to those without genuine threats or controversies. However, for the sake of national security and peace, such measures remain essential for VVIPs. Whether we like them or not, an attack on a high profile figure can disrupt our national peace and damage our international reputation for years to come.  ​We can never be certain who might be planning an attack on a VVIP or for what purpose. These individuals hold their status for a reason, and they will have followers regardless of whether we perceive their character as good or bad. There will always be those who fight for their \"masters\" or those who have something to gain from these VVIPs, for them, personal interests and loyalty will always take priority over the country’s wellbeing. If an attack occurs, our country’s stability can derail overnight and Western media and racists in west love to make fun of \"third world countries\" to feel superior regardless of fact that they have been through worse. The global protocols built over centuries of human experience teach us that it is not worth risking national peace over the minor, occasional inconveniences caused by VVIP convoys.|||What if it was not a politician, but someone special like an Army Chief, Police Chief, Nobel Peace Prize winner, international delegate, or the Dalai Lama himself ?

When partners don’t witness the birth of their child or see the physical and emotional pain a mother goes through, it’s hard for them to truly understand how difficult motherhood really is. Seeing it firsthand creates empathy, respect, and a deeper appreciation for what women endure to bring a life into this world.  Maybe this is one way men can finally begin to understand a woman’s journey to motherhood.

            "body": "As it says, I recently got this and was hoping for some help, especially on the markings. There isn’t a ton of info on these in English so I figured I’d do to the source. My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6. This is probably the longest shot of them all, but any ideas what species of critter might have eaten up the stock at one point? I put a picture of it on picture 2, I was thinking some type of termite or wood worm.",

Key Manufacturing Factories  The Ranas established several sites for arms and ammunition production, primarily centered in the Kathmandu Valley and some regional hubs:   Nakkhu (Lalitpur): Notable for producing copies of the Martini-Henry rifle, specifically the \"De-Rifle\" in the late 1880s.  Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.  Jangi Megjin: Originally founded in 1793, it continued to function during the Rana period as a government foundry for manufacturing cannons and military equipment.|||You need someone from the Hanuman Dhoka Museum in Kathmandu.

It just means that rather than keeping a person in prison while waiting for their trial (so they don't escape), they are set free for the time being.

If they run away, the court keeps the cash and sends the police to find them.

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.

            "heading": "AMA : I have been using menstrual cups for ~8 years. Ask me anything.",
            "body": "**Disclaimer** : this is not an Ad. I have been using menstrual cups for around 8 years and have recommended it to many women in my life. All have loved it and have made the switch from pads/tampons. So i decided to spread the word here.   **Tldr**: Menstrual cups will change your life. it will give you much more freedom and flexibility than period products like pads or tampons.   First of all, what is a Menstrual cup?   A menstrual cup is a reusable, flexible silicone cup inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual fluid. It can be worn up to 12 hours and can be used for several years with proper care.   I have made a list of pro and cons that i have faced in these years. You are welcome to ask more questions. I will answer as many as i can. Serious questions only please!   **PRO**:   1. To start with the basics, menstrual flow is more than just liquid blood. it has many semi-solid/solid things like mucus and blood vessels. So a pad or tampons just cannot ‘absorb’ them. these things just lay there on the surface making you feel slimy and uncomfortable. Instead the cup ‘collects’ it so it doesn’t have this issue.  2. You dont have to worry about a pad shifting from its place. you know the feeling, when the pad is too far back or too far on one side. Also, you dont feel the blood flow ‘out’ like when you laugh or sneeze or stand up. Menstrual cup catches the blood before it gets out.  3. Its an upfront investment but one that will be much cheaper in the long run. You wont have to cash out hundreds of rupees each month on period products.  4. Its better for the environment as it creates little to no waste.  5. Its better when you are out, for example, at other people’s place. you dont have to worry about where to dump your used period products.  6. You dont feel it at all once its inside. you can just live your normal day and forget about it. then only at the end of the day you empty, clean and put it back on. (if its a heavy flow day then i empty it once in the middle of the day too)  7. No issues with friction / rashes on the inner thighs.   **CON** :   1. It has a slightly steep learning curve. I know a lot of people have anxiety of putting it in and getting it out. i did too. but once you have done it a couple of times, you will get a hang of it. There are many tutorials available online for this. I personally fold the cup in a C shape and put it in and then to be sure its secure, I check for suction by pulling/rotating it a bit. Getting it out can feel a bit scary at first. When getting it out, i hold the cup on its body and not just the tip to be sure that the tip doesn’t break. But like i said, once you have done it a few times, it will feel normal.  2. I find it most comfortable to empty the cup in a toilet that has a basin inside it. so I can empty it in the basin, clean the cup and put it in again. it can be done in a toilet stall (without basin) too but you have to be a bit more careful and you will need some tissues to clean the blood off your hands before coming out of the stall.  3. it requires a bit of investment in the beginning even to try (but it will pay off long term if it works out)  4. It can leak, very rarely but sometimes. The leakage is usually minimal so for this, you can use something light like panty liners or period panties. You can try out your options here.   **Recommendations**:   1. When first trying it out, you can try it for a couple of hours at a time when you are not having heavy flow and when you are staying home. This way you will also have an idea of how much blood comes out (spoiler alert: its much less than what you would expect) and how frequently you need to empty the cup.  2. always clean your hands with soap before and after putting/removing the cup.  3. hold the cup by its body (base of the cup) and not just its tip when pulling it out.  4. There are a lot of tutorials, feedback, helpful materials available online. Please be brave and give it a try. you will thank me later :)  —————————————————————————-  **Edit 1**: some people are asking about which brands to use. If someone is a new user of Menstrual cups, could you please let us know about your experience with it and which brand you are using?",

Single man, single constituency Ra executive elections and legislative elections are very different things, to run an organisation of over half a million supporters is a HUGE HUGE task . People didn't even look at what terms they agreed on .. no policies no vision just the news that they came together was enough and it will more than likely be enough to win the elections but the real problems will come after that.

Esto kaam ekdum kam huncha hamro desh ma|||Kudos to subham vai. I remember when he talked about doing this in his free time.|||This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

Most of the teachers in school and college all of the are pedophiles.|||I'm not aware of the definition - is it like somebody who's grooming girls under 18? Are you using the term loosely?  It's an individual-thing and not a profession-thing. Girls sending DMs to get referred (when they have no skills) is also more common than you think. I get many DMs asking for free help (refactors)/ referrals (barely know them/ barely seen their code) and I just ignore them. I help many people (m/f) on a daily basis, and I've never met most of them. I know many of my 'male' senior friends (no female senior dev friends) do the same.  You should clear your exams first. Last bullet point sounds like a good plan.  Most people here will be happy to review 1-2 projects for free. I'll jump in if it's Python/ Next.js/ ML. Just post your github repo on some relevant community and they'll do free reviews.   Edit: I dont do free mentorships, happy to review repos/ coding practices.|||In my experience, Girls seem to help girl only when they are on some “female tech organization” and it’s rarely a technical mentorship. They should be helpful without such aids too. I am sorry that you had to deal with these. that’s extremely disgusting.  Still there are bunch of female led tech groups - they have ties with it company - approach them.|||I get what you r saying but the term pedo applies to people who r way older and trying to groom n trap minors (under 18). The person u r referring r called blackmailers or gooners (in current terms i think)|||Other side - back in Nepal I used to work for a compant that paid well and had better reputation. A young girl in her early 20s reached out to me for a referall for associate engineer. I hesitated a bit seeing her technical knowledge. She offered sex plus 1 months of her salary if I referred and she got hired. Was a weird encounter. I am still not sure if she qas serious or not. But I immediately got off connection.|||Dark side is on both side ! If male posted this not a single person would have asked i have connection i can refer vanera !! Sorry you had to go through that.

I thought it wouldn't be that difficult since I have decent projects and a year of experience, but I remain jobless for next three months. It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||I came to Nepal and saw Indians rob more then whole Nepal while accepting that we can and we will rob , sorry as Indian u guys also suffer ing  I am unemployed but go by android developer  I know some contract/online marketing companies|||Female HRs lae send grne ho.

            "body": "I’ve been holding this inside for a long time, and I just want to let it out.  I wasn’t a “smart kid” in school. I never understood things as fast as my friends did. I struggled even to read a paragraph and find the right answer, even in class 10. I used to feel dumb every single day. Some of my friends got things so quickly, but I didn’t. I still feel cringe thinking about it.  I also had tics. I don’t know if it was Tourette’s or something else, because I never checked. When I get excited or angry, my eyes blink hard and my back twists. It was embarrassing, and it distracted me so much in school. I used to wish I could just be “normal.”  But after my S.E.E., something changed. That 3-month break gave me a new life. I had my “aha” moment. Somehow, I finally started understanding things. Maybe it was the silence, maybe it was being away from all the noise, maybe it was just loneliness giving me space to think. But everything shifted.  I taught myself how to code. I got a job as a software developer. I didn’t finish my degree because my college wouldn’t let me work while studying, so I said “forget it” and focused on work. It was well paid, and nobody asked for a degree anyway. So yeah, I’m a dropout who made it this far.  I’m still not “super smart,” but I’m definitely smarter than the version of me back then. I still have tics, they still distract me sometimes, but I’m living with it.  I just needed to get this off my chest. I’ve kept it inside for too long.  **And to anyone reading this who feels like they’re slow, or not smart, or different:**   I hope you find your moment too. I hope you realize that you’re not broken. Sometimes loneliness or silence gives you a new life. You grow in ways you don’t even notice at first. You don’t have to be a genius to make it. You just have to keep going. If I can do it, anyone can.  Stay strong. You’ll get your moment too.      ***Note: Yes, I did use ChatGPT to improve this text, mainly to fix grammar mistakes.

Also, the *cost of vehicles* in Nepal is much higher than in India. Cars that cost ₹7–10 L in India often cost 2–3× more in Nepal (sometimes even higher when taxes + import duties are added), and this is widely reported.  This means:  1. The same car/automobile can cost roughly 2–3 times more in Nepal because of heavy import taxes and logistics costs. 2. Almost everything (especially cars, electronics, imported goods) is more expensive in Nepal, except for some basic categories like food and rent, which are generally cheaper compared to big Indian cities.",

Shitty code, more bugs and more opportunities for IT devs. Not every company can afford AI that is going to cost fortune in long run. Mid-level devs would collapse, there would be junior then senior. Senior getting paid well, jr not so much. If everybody relies on AI then it is bound to happen. So, IT job is relevant and those who can persevere would be the winner in long run. If you can adapt to AI workflow, it is going to be much more easier and benefit to upskill.|||Now AI writes your code. Before stackoverflow used to write your code. So why you think its drastically different now?|||skill issue|||If all you do is stitch code/ copy-paste, it's only a matter of time before you'll be replaced. I'd guess you're approaching mid-senior by the yoe. Some would enter a leadership/management role by this time, so your tasks would look more like system design/ managing projects. Maybe harder for juniors but seniors not impacted.  I'd argue video editing is more lucrative than dev jobs and more rewarding. If we're talking economies at scale, it's those who provide exceptional value that have the potential to earn the most. Not those who switch careers for pay, or try to pursue domains that are reserved for passionate folks. The bar for entry in tech is getting higher, and it's still very hard to get to senior roles (I don't mean seniority by yoe - that's a terrible metric). I'd argue it's actually less competitive for us (at least above mid-level positions) because most beginners are relying on AI to code for themselves, and have very little idea of what's happening under the hood. If you don't put in effort to understand auths, you won't understand it. It's a huge problem.   I've also seen many relying on AI to write their ML code and papers. It's a problem when AI/ML folks don't understand if the output layer should be a batchnorm or a softmax. More common than you think. If you're not landing MLE roles, it's less about models taking over and more about you being less valuable to the company than you think.  Another example: you switching to a career in cybersec for the pay vs somebody who has actively looked for bugs, reads and analyzes open-source, enjoys finding flaws in auth in their free time, attends any event that says security, and is passionate. To be frank, you'd have no chance against somebody who actually enjoys cybersec.   I'm actually more confused by you trying to prepare for three separate domains - DevOps, CyberSec and health.|||[deleted]|||![gif](giphy|ji6zzUZwNIuLS)  IT!|||Skill issue.

Don't get me wrong - vibe coding and low code/no code methods are getting popular with some LLM coders (Claude, Gemini) becoming absolute beasts, but, the real need of a human is in problem solving and building scalable systems. My team, including developers spend hours and hours talking to customer to figure out problems and recommending solutions. Legacy systems and architectures are a blackbox with not much information out there. Talking to those system, understanding limitations, figuring out customized modules along with their purpose is a whole different ball game.  Yes - AI helps. A lot. But will it replace my Level 1 Developer with a year of experiences? No. But will it help him get better and improve speed to market? Absolutely. Not everyone can get the AI to work well. Now my team doesn't stay stuck in one issue and we can deliver multiple products in fewer days compared to what was happening before.  AI can code but they dont do well when it comes to scalable, practical and tailored solutions. They do what they are told to do, unlike developers and real engineers who are working towards not only building but making sure it can be customized, enhanced and upgraded.  I understand at 4 YoE, there could be some perspective you see. I worked in health care for a long time (still do consultation on MIR systems) and the demand has gone up with pay ranges hitting unreal heights. A Junior Dev in a very good company used to barely make 25-30k and I just hired a guy with a year of Python experience for 500$/month.  The problem is people jumping on the bandwagon which is creating a terrible environment for business owners, recruiters and stakeholders.  I hope you do well in your career my friend.

I did some research on XYZ company, and I think it is a good fit for me. I would like to provide you with 2 weeks of unpaid probation, no strings attached.

            "body": "I’ve been thinking about this for a while. It feels like in Nepal, we have tons of programmers and tech talent, people who can build apps, websites, AI stuff, you name it. But when it comes to GTM, growth, marketing, or just figuring out how to actually sell and scale a product… there’s a huge gap.  Most startups here are run by tech engineers, and naturally, the focus is on building the product perfectly. That’s great, but then things like growth strategy, customer acquisition, positioning, and distribution get ignored. People just assume if you build it, users will come. Spoiler: they don’t.  Most of the startups here in Nepal fail less because the product is bad, but instead because the distribution/game-plan is weak.   Here in Nepal, GTM skills aren’t really taught, nor are they considered “cool” compared to coding. Most people in IT industrychase programming jobs, freelancing gigs, or outsourcing contracts because that’s a safer bet financially.  I think this is actually a huge opportunity. Someone who can master GTM skis here like: user research, acquisition channels, funnel optimization, sales psychology could easily dominate the startup scene.   Instead of just learning yet another JS framework, you should also learn GTM skills.   What do you guys think?",

They can launch their business and products, get real feedback from the users who are interested in those categories, it will help them to understand if the customer will like it or not, if it will solve real problems or will it be just another project.  2. It can also help in marketing where thousand of user are looking for something, and they can get what they actually want surfing through that category.   3. Since the users who are there and checking out the coming technology and products in the market, they can tell you if that will work out or not. It will help them sell their product and services and one mouth to another mouth, the words will be out and it will scale automatically.  4. things like growth strategy, customer acquisition, positioning, and distribution, the real data from users will help them to figure things out.|||Jaba samma nepal ma pulchowk campus xa innovation will be alive|||agree distribution is the gap, focusing on gtm helps a lot.

Anyone who used to follow him during his Sidha Kura janta sanga time can never hate him. He faced so much trouble just bcz he was courageous and not afraid to oppose the old parties. Me myself am a genZ and also love Balen but I used to follow Rabi since I was in class 4 , so for me he would always be my hero either during his journalism days or during his political career . Finally, Rabi dai has managed to merge all three popular parts together . Hope we would be seeing the better Nepal soon.

I am a Hindu living in India. I saw this and was shocked. It's not just about Hindus, he was a human first. No one deserves this. The islamic countries here in Asia are being sponsored by various other countries to spread violence. The islamic crowd needs to understand that they are not made for religion, religion is made for them. Religion is for your inner peace and it does not need anything from the people. Executing people just because they said something against religion is not acceptable.

In the protest you guys killed and the burned the politician and beated them on road to death. You guys destroyed public property and also the government property made by your own tax money. Stealing from malls and local shops,  those who were stealing they were all educated people, you guys are corrupt yourself and what better can we expect from government. I saw videos of Indian youths crying in pokhara for help when some group of protesters came to beat them because they were indians. Now I guess after doing all this Nepal will surpass india and germany, china, japan etc right? A politicians wife was burnt alive in her house and she died while going to the hospital.  I am not blaming the people who did nothing like this, and if you didn't then congrats 👏🏻 you hold a special place in my heart. My comment is for those who did these things not for those who didn't.  ![gif](giphy|iNPNqI81MvDQ4D4n6D)  Don't be a fool, I know truth is harsh and you can't accept it.  For some people let me clear that; I belong to a Hindu family but I am an atheist so I can see from logic, I don't support Bangladesh nor what happened in this video. But the irony of the protesters is hilarious.|||It's not muslims the problem but the hanafi, wahabism and Deubandi school of thought which makes them radical. Look at Indonesia it follows Sufism mixed with agakhani sect do we hear minorities being treated badly? No. Mostly it's the south Asian Muslims who are radical because they follow a very strict islam of deubandi and wahabism school of thought which has caused problem historically it's moderate example would be creation of Taliban and extreme example is creation of Pakztan. Now contrary to that you've Indonesia which is also a majority Muslim nation but follows Sufism school of thought which is why they are much more liberal. They're okay with currency having Ganesha, okay with garuda being national symbol(coat of arms), and even okay with naming kids from Sanskrit derived names like majority of their head of the states have Sanskrit origin names there will be some ups and downs in writing because Indonesia didn't follow devanagari it followed the Brahmi script earlier, in that way it's still preserving the culture. But if you tell this to a MUSLIM.from south Asia he will say it's shirk/haram in islam and that being associated with polytheism is bad and that they are a lost tribe of Turks and Arabs who had invaded our land. So, wahabism and Deubandi unless remained will not allow for inclusivity among the people islam factor will be there no matter what|||Can't decide which is the worst religion - Islam or Hinduism.

If that is not the case here, then it's wrong and us Indians should accept that. 3. Nepal is a beautiful country. People have more civic sense and overall better sense of community and cohesion from what I have seen.  4. What Nepali people have to understand is India is a big country 1.4 billion people is a lot. So, of all the counties in the world, India is probably the only one you should never generalize. 6. Both Nepali and Indian people can have good relationship with each other, just learn to talk properly and not take things to ego. 6. Yes, India is a bigger economy, and has more resources, but it is not in competition with Nepal. Nepal has it's own strengths that it should not forget.  7. Open border has it's pros and cons. Yes, many Nepali are in India, do they get to build a life, yes. Do they get discriminated, yes, and so are Indians from other states. And Nepali also discriminate against Indian tourists and workers. 8. Always remember, most average Indians will probably only have good will towards Nepal and no hate.  9.

She said, “La thik cha, aba dekhi ma aafai aauxu, I understand,” and ended the call. About 15–20 minutes later, she blocked me. I knew I wasn’t wrong, so I didn’t text or apologize. Today I didn’t go to college and went to Nagarkot with my friends instead—I just wanted a peaceful day. Around 1 PM, she called and told me to come to XYZ café immediately because we “needed to talk.” We decided to meet at 4:30. I reached at 4:15, and she was already there. She said that if I couldn’t do some “basic things,” we shouldn’t be together. I didn’t expect that. After thinking for about five minutes, I said “okay” and left. She acted completely normal when I walked out. While I was on my way to my friend’s place, she called again (big mistake picking up). She said she didn’t expect that reply from me and that I’m “like other boys.” After that, five of her friends called me and said the same stuff. But anyway, there’s always light after the dark. I’m free now—no more Pathao shit. We’re in the same class, so I’ll see her every day, but that’s fine. Congratulations to me, I guess.

            "body": "I've been tempted to write this for a long time.       I was in a relationship with a popular male influencer for a long time. We broke up 2 years ago. During our 3+ year-long relationship, I got to be in his inner circle and hung out with Sisan and gang (and Shrinkhala too, before she went to Harvard). We basically hung out every day at Paradigm office in Tahachal. Sisan had a floor where he lived, a floor for Paradygm office, and a common kitchen/dining/terrace floor where we all mostly hungout. Many people don't know, but Sisan comes from a rich family; his father owns the 7/8 floor building where Paradym's original office is. Plus, they have another 6/7 floor building in the same compound and across Sitapaila, they live in a lavish bungalow- anyone in the neighborhood recognizes their house with at least 4/5 cars, many dirt bikes, and whatnot. I was personally shocked to see how well off he was (compared to the public image that shows him as completely self-made). He literally lived and had his office in his dad's house, drove around in his dad's Tucson. How many of us can casually start an office without worrying about rent or electricity bills? Travelling across Nepal in Daddy's fancy car, making vlogs? Anyways, I always felt his dishonesty in his not mentioning his very privileged childhood and always claiming that he struggled for his first camera or his first professional gig, and whatnot. Dude literally went to school where bideshi kids from embassies went to- with that childhood and connections its a pity that he has to act like a tapori to gain the public's validation.    I found out that Sisan dated another Buddhist girl for more than 8 years (they dated since his Apex days) and brutally left her to date Shrinkhala. He was known to cheat on his ex-girlfriend a lot. My ex said that Sisan shuffled through women at night like it was nothing, even while he was in a long-term relationship with this Buddhist girl. He used to say that he had sort of changed after starting to date Shrinkhala, but I don't trust it, as I saw him with another girl while Shrinkhala was in the US  (I will get back to this later).   The group casually talked about \"side chicks.\", his cousin and partner, Baneed, at that time was openly dating 2 girls at once (lying to each). I only knew about the other girl Baneed was dating much later, and was shocked by how the guys at paradygm including Sisan, never objected to Baneed for it. His whole group (except Ajay and Binayak) were gross at the way they talked and objectified women.   Anyways, the way this guy comes forward as a feminist, and the way he portrays himself is so opposite of this ghinlagdo misogynist he is. The way he capitalised on his breakup with Shrinkhala for fame while sleeping around with multiple women lost all my respect for him. I caught him red-handed with a girl (probably a fling, as I never saw this girl again) on his lap in a very compromised position at Paradygm when I went to pick up my jacket later in the evening (his building is always open as it's also his dad's office and the guards let me in as they knew me.)  I left as if I didn't see anything. ).  Shrinkhala was in the US back then. I should have told her- I lived with the guilt of not telling her, but my ex kept saying that I shouldn't interfere in other's relatonship.     1 month later, he went to Mexico. They broke up, I think, right after he got back. I don't know what caused their breakup, but the rumour was that Sisan had commitment issues, and Shrinkhala finally caught up to it.    After their breakup, I really felt bad for the way the public treated Shrinkhala and sympathised with Sisan as if he were a victim. He was heartbroken after the breakup thats for sure, but I think he had it coming. Shrinkhala and Sisan never had an equal relationship. I never saw what Shrinkhala saw in the guy. The love always looked one-sided from her side only.    There is so much more I wanted to write, but I am tired lol. This is turning out to be a full essay.",

Interesting read but without proof it's just one perspective. Just like Shrinkhala shamelessly posted those yellow highlighted Excel Sheets as her proof of innocence which had no third party audit or any verification.|||I have never watched Sisan Baniya, but I didn't feel that he ever portrayed himself as self made or coming from a humble background. He always came across as a fake snob, at least to me. That fake accent and wanna be cool persona was enough for me not to ever click his videos.  Though I won't use his family background and privileges against him. He came from a rich family and used his privileges and resources to build himself. Don't think it's a problem, we would have done the same, we are doing the same one way or another.   But I hate how he used his fame to turn the public against Srinkhala. He behaved like a heartbroken nibba teenager despite being a grown up. He went around low key attacking her and mocking her on videos and podcasts, and portrayed her as this evil person who left him for money and fame. And the entire public suddenly turned against her which climaxed during the GenZ where they burned her house.|||Shrinkhala’s cyber sena 🙋‍♂️|||Yeah, Sisan isn't 'dudh ka dhula' as he shows himself to be, he might be even worse.

He seems the most capable guy among all the fkin leaders, including balen and rabi. When he speaks , he always seems calm even when he is provoked, unlike balen. He does not have an ongoing corruption case like that of rabi. He is an engineer who studied at the most prestigious university of our country and also studied at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. he went as a Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholar to study water science, policy, and management. This is different from most engineering degrees  because he isn't just an engineer who can build a hydropower or dam. He has knowledge of policies and understands the economics and geopolitics of water—Nepal's most valuable resource. Has worked in developing countries in Africa. Seems like he has some political knowledge. Also, rabi and balen were celebrity figures, but he wasn't and dared to challenge one of the biggest political figures in a less urban or even rural city(dadeldhura). In a time where every nepalese wants to leave the country, a guy from oxford who could have easily left the country, not only staying but wants change in his country, shows bravery and patriotism. He hasn't been in power, so we can't gauge him, but we can gauge him based on what we have seen so far - a calm, educated, brave and exceptionally brilliant young guy, and i would definitely prefer him over any politican i have witnessed so far.|||\"Oxford padheko bhandai ma should be a leader\"  Can see the mindset of OP here.

Nothing fancy, just the most budget friendly one I could find. There were a couple of people in the lobby and they greeted me nicely and asked for my ID. I showed them my passport and their faces instantly changed after seeing my Nepali passport. The guy said oh you’re from Nepal. I said yes and the another man said, this doesn’t work, we need to see an Indian ID. They weren’t smiling anymore and were giving me very skeptical looks. I tried not to overthink it. He kept insisting for an Indian ID and I explained to him that I am not from India, it’s my first time here so it’s not possible for me to have an Indian ID. Then they asked me for my contact number and I gave my phone number (didn’t have Indian number). Once again, they kept on asking for an Indian number. I was really surprised seeing their hospitality instantly changed after learning about my identity. Not sure if they did that because I was a foreigner to them or because I was specifically a Nepali guy.   While I was exploring the local market, I went to buy some souvenirs. One shop guy asked me where I was from and I said Nepal. He then started lecturing me saying don’t be close with China. They will do the same to you what Pakistan is doing to us. He kept yapping about how Nepal is a small part of India and that we should be grateful that we have a “bada bhai” like India. I left the shop without saying anything.    I wanted to travel by train but had absolutely zero idea about it. The people weren’t helpful there either. I was asking the various staff in the train station saying I wanna go here where can I find a ticket. They just vaguely pointed go there, it’s over there. Finally one guy at the ticket counter helped me get tickets after nearly couple of hours of running frantically here and there. I told him I’m not from India, traveling by train for the first time. The counter guy gave me a ticket saying this is for general class, it’s not safe to travel there..very crowded and chaotic, after your train arrives, meet the ticket guy and ask him to upgrade to AC compartment. I thanked him and went to the platform. There was a police officer whom I asked about upgrading the ticket. He too said the same thing i.e. meet the ticket guy once your train arrives and he will help you.   I still had about 3-4 hours before my train arrived. I just stayed in the platform watching movie. After the train arrived, I was frantically searching for the ticket guy. One police officer came near me charging with his baton. I was shit scared. He almost charged me saying why are you in the AC compartment with a general ticket in your hand. I was literally shaking at this point and with a shaky voice, I explained him my situation. He said haven’t you been in a train before where are you from. I said I’m from Nepal and he laughed saying oh you guys don’t even have trains there haha. Are you really from Nepal, your eyes don’t look like Nepalese. (I think he was referring to Mongolian eyes). I saw the ticket guy and went to him. He said me go to this seat and I’ll come. Later, he came to me and upgraded my ticket. The journey was a little over an hour long. And I was constantly replaying the entire experience from the hotel to the local market to the train station police guy.    Not sure if I just happened to meet all the wrong people or that everyone is the same there. Either way, I’m not going back to India for a long time. And I haven’t even mentioned the kids constantly following you begging for money, the dirt and litter everywhere, people peeing and even pooping in the open, unnecessary horns, air pollution.   PS: not trying to spread hate— just sharing my personal experience.",

Which cities did you visit, by the way? and as far as I know, many hotels in India especially smaller ones usually avoid foreigners because of paperwork and FRRO/police registration requirements. It’s better to stay at big hotels or resorts while traveling. I personally mostly stay at resorts, especially Club Mahindra ones they’re quite good, with solid service.  Also, try to do everything online in India train bookings, hotels, cabs. That way you’re much less likely to get scammed or harsh treated. Offline train ticket booking is honestly very hectic, even for Indians, so always book train tickets online. Use the official IRCTC website or authorized partners like MakeMyTrip, ConfirmTkt, or Paytm then you won’t face these problems.  And if you remember the time, location, duration, or the office name, you can also register a complaint on the Rail Madad portal or app. Lastly, there’s a huge generation gap in India you’ll mostly hear such racist things from older people or those in the 30–40 age group, but the younger generation is usually nicer and more helpful .You can even see this generation gap while speaking English. If you start speaking English in front of older people, they often treat you like some different person almost a ‘raja sahab’ type. But with the younger generation, it usually doesn’t make much of a difference. Anyway, I hope your journey was safe.|||Fake story|||Mods, how much racial abuse is tolerated here?

You feel lost in those reactions and might even get out of your mind just looking at them. But listen to the tale, the story of how learning really happens. I don't know if you play games like Free Fire, PUBG, Royale, or something else. Ask yourself how you remembered all the gun names, location names, and the different things in them. How you remembered a whole 3-hour-long story you watched years ago? Treat these things the same way. Connect with them. Practice writing out the reaction yourself. Guess how they could pair up and react to give products. In the beginning, you will make mistakes, but slowly you will get used to it.

Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.
