They‚Äôre genuinely good people, but they‚Äôre also quite traditional and have beliefs that don‚Äôt really align with how I see the world.  Before I moved here, my mother-in-law used to tell me things like not to wear my father‚Äôs or husband‚Äôs clothes, not to do certain things on certain days, and that I should always wear a red tika on my forehead.

I think the sasu / buhari hierarchical Nepali system is irreconcilable with modern egalitarian views.

They will try to understand where you stand on everything and actually be more accommodating. You need to get into your head that these in-laws will try to manipulate the both of you. Especially your husband. So make sure that there will always be understanding on your husband that he will always defend you if they start to start up anything. Plus this is 2082, living away from parents is possible for guys as well.

The only option for you is to talk it through by not offending anyone. Husband's role is very important in this. Almost all household dispute between parents and daughter-in-law start because husband inability to manage/diffuse situation. A man should love and criticize their parents and wife where its needed.    You still have option to stay separately from in-laws if things goes south. But parents do bring a lot to table and you will realize this the most in time of difficulty. Its typical human nature to not appreciate things until time of despair.   And just remember \"Money solve almost all problem if played right\".  People should hire household helper if things gets difficult.   Compromising where its needed is a must. You & your in-laws are not always right. As long as you both understand this, thing will be must easier than you imagine.|||Jeez ppl are so dumb. Pmo. Ima educate these mfs on what patriarchy means.  **Patriarchy:** \"a social system where men hold primary power and authority, typically in family structures and society as a whole, including politics, economics, and culture\"  for eg: man makes decisions while women are disregarded. Yes, women having to live in man's house is patriarchy too(cuz women make sacrifices here and men don't)  What isn't patriarchy: when your mother tells you. You shouldn't wear men's clothes. When she tells you, women look better or sanskari with tika on. It would be patriarchy if a man said it and was forcefull. But this doesn't give men power in expense of women. It's just an opinion of an old woman. Like it's and opinion of my gf, when she likes me with my beard trim and she doesn't like it when i put on a skirt.  Oh wait, it's mother in law. It's your husband's/\"man\" mother. Thus patriarchy. Still, it's an overstretch. Because,  it doesn't give men anything in expense of a woman. She didn't say anything that goes against the said person or her family or against women. It doesn't put men in authority or give them power. Neither does her opinion emboldens a system that does that.  Using words where it doesn't fit. Takes away value from actual meaning of the word. Also takes away from the validness of the argument.|||How is it a patriarchy if it's your mother in law trying to impose her values on you|||Husband timro side ma completely xa bhane tension lina pardaina.|||Too complex world but i am afraid with this post!

Every industry ma revolution chaieko cha Nepal ma.|||I studied in an international school in Nepal up until I was 16.I managed to do 1 year gcse in UK. Two years Alevels and 4 years uni in pharmacy. The background I had academically from Nepal was fine. I‚Äôm 33 of age now. My school and parents were quite strict on me so I pushed myself hard academically but I would say I wasn‚Äôt able to develop well in other skills. However there are plenty of people who are able to gain those skills in Nepal.   School was very toxic with physical and emotional abuse, discrimination, zero freedom and not very nurturing apart from just bullying you to study. I found in UK there are other opportunities, if you didn‚Äôt want to go the uni route. I also like they try to prepare you for work experience and building other hard and soft skills.  I do feel there is some change in Nepal now hopefully as I can see many young people trying different routes and perspective seem to be shifting.    I am also thinking of soft retiring and trying my luck in Nepal. Pay is definitely not comparable but the cushion you have from your savings in Uk may go a long way. I believe the pay is very basic in healthcare if you don‚Äôt own your business but may be enough to sustain yourself  I have heard of consultant doctors getting paid 50k to only 1 lakh but there is less restrictions in Nepal. It not very regulated like in Uk and a lot less rules to follow. Maybe testing it out for 6 months might give you a feel of what it‚Äôs like ? It will also depend a lot on your personality. I stayed in Nepal for 6 months and hardly missed UK but some of other friends would hate it.   Lastly, My parents managed to retire in Nepal for the last 7 years and they love it in Ktm.|||Try for Aus, Ireland or other countries first, stash 300-500k and then retire in Nepal; I know easier said than done but that's my plan as well. Nepal is absolutely the place to retire, raise kids and for people who've grown up there, there's nothing quite like it, but poverty sucks as well. So I highly recommend stashing away atleast a 100k before returning to Nepal. 100k will earn you 8-10k of interest a year which is enough for basic expenses and a job that pays 50 thousand rupees a month would be a good supplement. By retire I mean mid 30's to at most 40. If you wait any longer to return to Nepal, I feel like you've missed a good chunk of life. I know its a tall order but try to save as much as you can in the next 5-10 years and it will really enhance the QOL back home.|||Heyy , I know 2 of my friends who were born and brought up in US and UK and have shifted to Nepal permanently.   One from US use to work as a lawer there , she left states because she was not happy with her life style and just like u said she use to work 10 hours a day and was still not satisfied with finance and other facilities. She runs an INGO here . My second friend from UK kinda stays both the places , she shuffle between London and chitwan , she shifted here after she completed her studies , she is into technology business here .   About me . I was also born and brought up in India (not like western countries but still not Nepal ), I also shifted here some 15 years ago after I completed my graduation, my Nepali was not that fluent back then . I did face few challenges here and there in the beginning but honestly every one here is so lovely and cooperative that u will never realise the hard ship.

I‚Äôm set on being childless so may as well financially support his upbringing. My parents have been here since 2000 and 2003 (laure/military dependant route) and have been working ever since.

I'll try and be as objective as possible.  - The work culture is different. You're expected to kowtow to your seniors and to management. There is little concern for your well-being. You can say it's not very different from the UK, but the frustration will set in when you have to make a case for every sick leave, when your performance reviews etc are decided on the basis of who you know/connect with rather than on merit. - Work-life balance is pretty much non-existent, unless you find a kind manager/supervisor. You're expected to put work before family.  - Purchasing power is obviously better and you can buy services, i.e get someone to do your chores for you, if you're so inclined.  -  Less freedom of movement. You can probably go to a seaside town or on a long drive in the UK on a day off. Good luck buying a car for transport with a nurse's salary in Nepal. If you chose to take public transport, good luck with that too. Unfortunately, you also have to watch out for yourself if you're a woman. You'll have to be more conscious of what you wear and where you go.  - International travel? Fancy a weekend trip to a different country, perhaps? Good luck! - what i found the most frustrating was the (lack of) basics and how you are expected to get along without them. Power cuts, water problems sometimes, hot showers are a luxury. Things we don't have to think twice about while living in the developed world.  - basic cleanliness. Can't enter a public restroom without coming close to puking. Even the nicest restaurants have stinky as toilets. Roads are lined with litter. You have to watch every step while walking on the roads and if it rains, the entire city/town becomes a mudpit.  - you mentioned rising racism where you are. Nepal does have a plus there- you won't be treated like a second class citizen. - i also love traveling around Nepal. It calms me and it's definitely a profound experience. But it's a lot easier to do when you are earning in dollars/pounds and travel while on paid leaves, as opposed to when you're earning in rupees.  I can go on forever, but the decision is obviously yours and your experience might be very different from mine. You might find it all rewarding and decide it was worth it in the future, once you get past the initial frustration.  Good luck with whatever you do!|||I suggest you to do masters, have some back up and then take a break. Spend some time in Nepal.

            "body": "There comes a moment when you stop reaching, stop chasing, and simply let life flow  and that‚Äôs when the universe quietly delivers what‚Äôs meant for you.   Today, I‚Äôm filled with a deep sense of gratitude. I‚Äôve learned that everything unfolds with perfect timing, neither too early nor too late. What you seek is already seeking you. I was once lost in my own chaos, desperate for answers, but now everything feels beautifully aligned. ‚Äú‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡•Ä‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§æ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§´‡§≤ ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§†‡•ã ‡§π‡•Å‡§®‡•ç‡§õ‚Äù and I tasted that truth today.   So, what happened?  I received something I never imagined, an iPhone, gifted by my sister (‡§´‡•Å‡§™‡•Ç‡§ï‡•ã ‡§õ‡•ã‡§∞‡•Ä  ). It was completely unexpected. We hadn‚Äôt talked for months. I had never asked her for anything, not even a phone. Out of nowhere, she called and asked me to pick her up from the airport. I didn‚Äôt even know she was arriving that day. When she saw me, she smiled and said, ‚ÄúGuess kaanxa lai k lyaideko xu?‚Äù I thought it might be chocolates or a small gadget. But then ‚Äî she pulled out an iPhone. I was speechless.  To understand how special that moment was, you need to know a bit of the backstory.  Earlier this year, in Jestha, I lost my Redmi 11 Pro,barely three months old. Since then, I‚Äôd been using a temporary phone with a broken display, lagging performance, and weak speakers. I needed a proper phone for my online classes, but I couldn‚Äôt ask my dad for another one right after losing that expensive phone. So, I managed with what I had.  Eventually, I accepted the situation. That‚Äôs when I decided to go on a social media detox. My phone became little more than a device for calls. Ironically, that period turned out to be a blessing,I started studying harder, focusing better, and growing mentally stronger. I began to hate the phone, or maybe just the distractions it brought.  And just when I didn‚Äôt need one anymore, life handed me a brand-new iPhone.  It struck me deeply. As Bhaitika approaches tomorrow, I feel a mix of gratitude and reflection. I‚Äôm planning to gift her something special in return,  not just because of the iPhone, but because of the lesson it carried.  Life teaches you in quiet ways: When you desperately need something, it slips away. But when you‚Äôve learned to live without it. it comes back to you effortlessly.  It's crazy; Once a desire, now just a thing. How time changes what we value, Isn't it?",

Maybe you can leverage your dad. But at the end of the day you need to stay strong. There are some things in life that are beyond your control. Besides, its only once or twice a year that you have to bite this bullet. Just stay strong and plow on. Be successful, do great things in life.

He's always talked about his instance on corruption, called for investigation all the cases regardless of which party the alleged politicians belong to. He's always talked about how the top three leaders have ruined democracy and has established themselves as face of this system that has made people hate this system. He's said same thing in this interview too, and suddenly people are back to supporting him? So they actually never watched his interviews and just hopped in 'gagan hate club' or what?  If he hadn't been fighting against status quo (deuba gang) inside Nepali Congress, Gagan would've have been minister more than 6-7 times for sure. He actually should've done that in my opinion. his only executive role ever was a 9-10 month as health minister as far as I know.  Also, I might be called jholey as there are many RSP supporters here, and blame gagan for rabi being jailed which is so funny to me. you think the district courts, the high court and supreme court (which denied his habeas corpus writ) were bought? not one , not two but all three tier of courts? I don't buy that rabi is being kept in custody without any proof. Also, why did rabi not investigate Gagan for his bakhra chor case while he was home minister?",

Why couldn't he speak about that with the same audacity he spoke with while accusing rabi? Contrastingly, Rabi and RSP had suspended and later fired Dakha Prasad (former RSP member) when he was proven guilty of corruption.  Why don't we trust Gagan? That's because he still belongs to Nepali Congress. If he is to gain any of our trust, he'll have to rebrand himself with a new party. That's the least he could do.  What's the problem with Nepali Congress, the party? See, we all agree to the fact that the deep rooted curruption is the main single reason why our country is still undeveloped. It's not one single person or few. It's the ecosystem of corruption from govt colleges to hospitals, peon to the dean, the studens, different organs of government CIIA, judiciary you name it, basically everywhere and this is really concerning. (I'm not ranting only on Nepali Congress but all the other 2 as well). We need new faces who don't have their jholeys in these different organs and offices of government. Do you really think Gagan will disregard NSU in an attempt to eradicate student politics? Do you really think he'll file an investigation against Deuba or Lekhak? We don't. We simply don't.|||I'm sure he won't be elected in the coming election|||People are bheda bhanne wxample yo pani ho. Mass public has a short memory and are always behind whats in hype.

Many Nepalis seem to believe almost anything shown on TikTok especially if it‚Äôs emotional or dramatic. Hardly anyone asks for proof; we just react, get angry, and spew hatred.  The scary part is that TikTok‚Äôs algorithm rewards this behavior. The more outrage and comments a video gets, the more it spreads. So people keep posting half-truths and conspiracy theories just to go viral.  It feels like TikTok is quietly shaping how we think not through facts, but through feelings. And honestly, that‚Äôs dangerous.  Has anyone else noticed this happening in Nepal? How do you deal with misinformation on TikTok?",

I‚Äôm not expecting anything from anyone anymore. I just want to appreciate the people around me. Even those who‚Äôve hurt me in the past. I don‚Äôt hold anything against them now. Everybody around me seems so helpful. I wish I could stay in this enlightened state every day.  A bit of behind the scene:  After the whole Gen Z  movement, I quit using social media; Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, even Discord. I only use Reddit now, mostly just for reading news and updates.  Just after: I started waking up early, built a consistent morning routine with workouts and yoga, and began eating healthy. I‚Äôm focusing more on my personal growth and learning ‚Äî I‚Äôve been exploring global markets, finance, and the stock market. My screen time on my phone is now barely an hour a day, and on my laptop, I‚Äôm mainly learning productive skills like basic Excel, Tally, QuickBooks, and more.  Why all this change?  Because a few months ago, it felt like my world had ended. I went through a really painful incident about four months back. For 2-3 months, I kept trying to move on, but it just got worse.  Before all this, I was a very talkative person, good at academics (not trying to brag). I had joined CA (Chartered Accountancy). Just a month into it, that incident hit me like a train  unexpected and brutal. I stopped going to regular classes. Life suddenly felt meaningless. I even fell physically sick for a week. I was completely overwhelmed ‚Äî personally, emotionally, academically. It hurt more because it all ended without any closure.  But now?  I think I‚Äôve finally come out the other side. I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôve got nothing to lose anymore. From here on, it's all about gaining. That‚Äôs the mindset I carry now.  What have I started doing?  I love helping people. And helping doesn‚Äôt always mean money. Sometimes, it‚Äôs just appreciating someone‚Äôs efforts. Sometimes, it‚Äôs being there for someone who‚Äôs lost, stressed about their future, or stuck in life. I want to be that small light in their darkness.  I‚Äôve even tried helping a few people here (and if you‚Äôre one of them, don‚Äôt feel awkward). I just want to say this: there‚Äôs so much more to life than just these things. You never know who out there just needs a little push, a little light.  Dui din ko jindagi ma marera laanu k nai xa rw.  Life is short, Live it fully. May God bless you!!!!!!!

How does your computer still retain movies and photos after you turn off your computer ? What is copying a file within a computer? How does the display work in a computer? What is RGB? What are servers? What are browsers? Why do we need them? How do light pulses help you move data?   Be curious and passionate about it. Work hard, build stuff, solve problems and you are set.

            "body": "The Patan High Court acquitted Sandeep Lamichhane on May 15, 2024, overturning the Kathmandu District Court's December 2023 conviction and January 2024 eight-year sentence.  The court's reasoning, centered on insufficient evidence to prove rape, the victim's adult status (**not a minor**), and contextual factors suggesting **consent** or ulterior motives rather than coercion. And she was 18 and he was 22 during the time of the incident.  Here are the details released by the court about the case:  1. Victim was 18+ and lied about her age 2. The girl checked into the room while Sandeep was parking, and they were holding hands leaving the hotel after the alleged rape based on CCTV evidence reviewed by the court. 3. The girl had a boyfriend and told her roommate she needed sponsorship from Sandeep 4. The accuser asked her roommate to lie to her boyfriend about her whereabouts.  5. While out with Sandeep, the roommate checked in; accuser said everything was going well, with no distress signals. 6. She lied to the roommate about returning home, saying Sandeep would drop her at a friend's place to hide spending the night. 7. The roommate testified that, upon returning the next morning, the victim appeared joyful and soon began enthusiastically following Lamichhane's cricket matches. 8. The roommate overheard the victim on a phone call post-fallout (after Lamichhane left for cricket abroad without fulfilling promises), discussing extracting \"at least 10-15 lakhs\" via a legal case. 9. The roommate (a key witness) provided the bulk of behavioral and motive evidence during appeal hearings. Combined with CCTV (demanding voluntary check-in/exit), social media logs (victim-initiated contact), and lack of physical proof of force, it led to the **clean acquittal.**  Plus, **fck Paradigm TV** and the brain rot content and 'influencers' that they promote in their channel. I noticed their viewership is slowly dying, so this controversy might be a good thing for them to become a little relevant but the audience are smarter now and see right through these people.",

If you check the comments they seem so automated and fake but just my opinion. If people believe and come die for him it's up to them.   Tanka Dhahal and In Depth Story both are too clickbaity always saying in video \"The Answer is so revealing\", \"Please continue to watch for proof\", \"The truth will be revealed in the next segment\" but always fails to give any substantial evidence of anything they are talking.  I was at Samsad Bhawan when they both reported \"32 people found dead inside Samasad Bhawan\" it was utter bullshit.   They retracted but it wasn't as viral as their initial 32 dead reporting; shifting blame that they got false information. If you are a journalist it's your duty to verify the sources not the sources fault only, for fake information.   These YouTube journalists learned from 12 bhai to mix their opinion and market it as factual journalism.  1 semi truth masked 9 lies and people believe Durga  is some kind of prophet.|||Sharing QR code was the biggest red flag, what kind of investigative journalist does that!|||100% agree...always found him sketchy.|||Kei hola vanera hereko wasted my time.Just yapping and source is trust me bro.|||True|||durga prasailai kas kasle na ramro gareko thyo pastma tedaru chai sbai agent re usko logic le üòÇ ani gen z andolan chai bideshi bata funded vo re lastma usleni afno andolan lai baira bata paisa magira xa. kati smma delusional hunu ni manxe|||Used to follow him and watch his video regularly but after some time started to see a pattern.

He might've been acquitted by the court upon appeal, but that does not prove his innocence. It is so frustrating how the burden of proof is upon the victim.    Fans acting as if his cricket skills makeup for the fact that he raped a minor and if you don't believe it, he still had sex with a barely 18-year-old girl, who was poor and star struck by the guy. This happens way too often where athletes misuse their fame and influence.    We are not unaware of how easily influential people in Nepal get away with anything, they've gotten away with hit-and-runs, DUIs, this is only a rape of a girl, they already care less. It is disgusting how he was even allowed to play and still represented Nepal while he had an ongoing case. This is why victims don't come forward.    But of course guys would have no regard for that girl, because for most guys the number of rapes happening is merely a statistic BUT for almost every woman, it is a reality that they could be exposed to at any time. I definitely believe the girl more, I think she was a victim.       People complain about false allegations but according to studies, \"False rape allegations are rare, with studies consistently finding that approximately 2% to 10% of reports are proven false.¬†Rigorous research indicates the rate is typically between 2% and 8%.¬†The perception that false allegations are common is largely a myth that can discourage real victims from reporting sexual violence.\" Rape allegations ruin a woman's life more than it ruins a man, even though he's the perpetrator! The victims rarely get justice and the rapists still get to live their life out large.

Create a single point failure and see what happens in modern time. Outdated blood based rulers if someone supports this they are either too close to the family back then and it up rooted their livelihood leeching off the monarchy crumbs or Andha Bhakt Ultra Hindu Nationalist believing King is divine.   The Sept 8-9 movement is against corrupt politicians and their cronies, the ask was simple make public institutions trustworthy, give us reason to stay in Nepal work, live and be happy. \"Life, Liberty and Pursuit of Happiness\" which is literally the core of people's democracy.  Protested and people died for leveling off the playing field, cronyism and political corruption against thyo, people want to bring back OG cronies who were above the law in the name of \"nationalism\".  We protested specifically because 3 taukey seems to be above the law but brain dead rajabadi want someone instead of them also above the law. And their thick skulls don't see an the irony with that.|||Hamroma ajhai pani feudalism ko mentality gakai xaina, tei vayera ta yo party haru eti arajak huna pakothyo|||Oh wait bro. Do you really think at this moment you are not slave ? Bro this is a problem with democracy. Democracy work in such a way that it seems like democracy but it is dictatorship. During the removal of monarchy just see how many people died there and now see how many people die. You can see the clear difference. After the end of monarchy the king silently returned but now see the attitude of this KP baze. The is pretending to be greater then king. So Who is the king? And are you a slave or not now? I am also not pro monarchy but if you could build a democratic system which is really a democratic then it's Great. But the single fact is, it is not possible. About Hindu rastha I am a  Atheist. But still I support Hindu rastha. Do you know why. The first step to break any country is to remove the pride for there culture and religion. So the establishment of Christianity is not random it is heavily planned. So Just to protect the country I am with Hindu rastha even being atheist.Yep monarchy was not good and evil before but I think it will work better cause of fear of People. They saw many people protest and Foreign intervention. So I hove they can rule better. And what's different in the political party and Monarchy. Only one difference, Political party is for certain time so they have the concept to just take a bribe and collect a lot of money for future retirement and there children. But for King they are permanent and there pride is associated from the standard of their country. One person of 100billion dollar networth VS a King with 100billiondollar GDP. In this case the king will have more pride. At last I don't know whether the monarchy will be good for our country or not but I know It can never go more worst than this. Edit:    Also one point is Our country Just need Stability and some long term vision. Other Development can be easily done by the youth of Nepal.|||Raja Huda, ko chai slave thyo ra pahila ü§î|||Gyanu le affai ma aaudina vandai cha ta. Kina attirako bro",

Usko ahile ko ventures herda it looks like he us trying everything to be rich ani ego pani aayo hola yeti kura achieve gareko cha vanera. But he was a hustler and he had worked for all the things he has now.|||Let me correct you:  First of all he was already famous before meeting Shrinkhala, or actually it was a win win for both of them to popularise their names within their individual fanbase. Also asti ko tyo case ma already manxe haru fire thiye Shrinkhala sanga, tei bela ma tyo vanera wrong gareko ho but later he apologised. He was wrong teti bela  With Durgesh Thapa, it was just their collab, both of them were at their peak during that time so don't think he used Durgesh's PR, if that's the case then Durgesh used Sisan's PR too.      If you are talking about Paradygm, I think he has already handed it over to Baneed who is looking after it now. Dont think they will ask for consent with him to post anything in their channel. His personal channel is lit and I love the contents, qualities and everything like other people do.

The funding that has been availed through Carbon Purchase as well as NGOs and INGOs have also played a critical role. I don't remember exactly, but UNDP or something published a really great report on the success of community forests and improvement of forested areas in Nepal.   Actually Nepal despite everything and has had excellent metrics when it comes to nature and biodiversity conservation.|||Folks who grew up in the 90s may remember efforts put into forest conservation through media.

This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it. You can hear the news for development work and of NEA cannot cut down the trees easily, yup that is because of same strong protective law.|||It‚Äôs because of movement of people and reliance on gas, concrete instead of timber.|||No , it‚Äôs a result of migration of people from hills to concentrated cities and Terai .

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts.

I don‚Äôt have siblings, and he filled that space in my life with his sweet energy and unconditional love. I can‚Äôt describe the guilt and pain I feel.

I'm very sorry for your loss. What was meant to be a heartwarming celebration, was infiltrated by these customs no one knows who started.|||I am so sorry for your loss. Try to dont play such scenarios in your head, I know its hard..  Yes, many animals experience severe distress due to fireworks and firecrackers, cows, dogs, cats etc. The smaller the animal, stronger the distress.   You can check statistics over the world, its a real issue. We humans dont respect the native habitants (animals) and this is just one of examples. Like, is the loud sound more important than a divine life (as all life is divine)?  Can that simbolism be expressed in a better way, by singing, instruments etc...  Luckily, as the world is slowly becoming aware of this, so the regulations starts to exist. In many countries there are now regulations that prohibit fireworks and firecrackers, exactly because of this reason (not to mention distress to some humans that exist too..).|||I am so so sorry.  Animals are the first victims of fire crackers.  I'm sorry your beautiful little bunny brother is gone.|||Here's a hard truth: that's on you. That's a fucking animal.

I'm not trying to be rude or to devalue your loss. It must be sad for you, yes, but I feel worse for that rabbit who lost its life because you made it live with humans and could not accommodate its needs. Firecrackers didn't take his life.

I‚Äôm not expecting anything from anyone anymore. I just want to appreciate the people around me. Even those who‚Äôve hurt me in the past. I don‚Äôt hold anything against them now. Everybody around me seems so helpful. I wish I could stay in this enlightened state every day.  A bit of behind the scene:  After the whole Gen Z  movement, I quit using social media; Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, even Discord. I only use Reddit now, mostly just for reading news and updates.  Just after: I started waking up early, built a consistent morning routine with workouts and yoga, and began eating healthy. I‚Äôm focusing more on my personal growth and learning ‚Äî I‚Äôve been exploring global markets, finance, and the stock market. My screen time on my phone is now barely an hour a day, and on my laptop, I‚Äôm mainly learning productive skills like basic Excel, Tally, QuickBooks, and more.  Why all this change?  Because a few months ago, it felt like my world had ended. I went through a really painful incident about four months back. For 2-3 months, I kept trying to move on, but it just got worse.  Before all this, I was a very talkative person, good at academics (not trying to brag). I had joined CA (Chartered Accountancy). Just a month into it, that incident hit me like a train  unexpected and brutal. I stopped going to regular classes. Life suddenly felt meaningless. I even fell physically sick for a week. I was completely overwhelmed ‚Äî personally, emotionally, academically. It hurt more because it all ended without any closure.  But now?  I think I‚Äôve finally come out the other side. I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôve got nothing to lose anymore. From here on, it's all about gaining. That‚Äôs the mindset I carry now.  What have I started doing?  I love helping people. And helping doesn‚Äôt always mean money. Sometimes, it‚Äôs just appreciating someone‚Äôs efforts. Sometimes, it‚Äôs being there for someone who‚Äôs lost, stressed about their future, or stuck in life. I want to be that small light in their darkness.  I‚Äôve even tried helping a few people here (and if you‚Äôre one of them, don‚Äôt feel awkward). I just want to say this: there‚Äôs so much more to life than just these things.

            "body": "One another question. Am I the bad daughter?   In 2013 (I was 10) my parents, my brother and I immigrated to Australia. My dad never wanted to come but my mother convinced him  When we arrived, I was homesick until 2018. Same for my dad My bro is 9 years younger than me so he not care.  Now it‚Äôs 2025 and my father still really wants to go back to Nepal  Deeply.  Me? I love it here now. Yes racism sucks but except for that I‚Äôm happy here and I still studying. My father has sacrificed soo much for me  He‚Äôs an amazing father, and would do anything to make me happy. He loves me unconditionally, and would put me above himself. Even if he doesn‚Äôt benefit from it.  My father isn‚Äôt happy here  It‚Äôs been over 10 years and he‚Äôd say that if I said I wanna go back he‚Äôll book in ticket immediately. But he never forced me to go back or stay there. He did say that once my brother is old enough to take care of himself he will go back to Nepal and visit every 6 months or so.  However. My grandmother (mom side) told me the conversation between her and my dad.  Everyone in my family knows my dad hates it here.  So my grandma is like (sweet polite tone) ‚ÄúTell your father this. ‚ÄòDad, if I go to Nepal with you are you gonna come with me as well?‚Äô If you say this your father will be the happiest person on earth. He‚Äôs here because of you. He wants to go back to Nepal. I even told him ‚Äîjust him to leave you guys and come back. But he refused as he doesn‚Äôt want to leave his family here‚Äù  I then said ‚Äúdad‚Äôs gonna go back on the ten years anyway. That‚Äôs what he said‚Äù  Grandma ‚Äúhe said to test you. Just come live in Nepal, for  this country you‚Äôre always gonna be an immigrant. Your dad will be happy. Your mother is too stubborn‚Äù   Me ‚Äúbut, I like it here‚Äù  Grandma  ‚ÄúDo you love your dad or not? He‚Äôs done so much for you. He works 12 hours everyday. He‚Äôs 53 now. Come to Nepal. I‚Äôve got money to pay for your school fees‚Äù  That‚Äôs when the guilt hit me. Yes dad works over 10 hours  And yes it‚Äôs especially hard in the hot son as he‚Äôs an engineer.  Yes my dad doesn‚Äôt like it heere and he‚Äôs much happier everytime we‚Äôre in Nepal.  My dad did say ‚Äúwe should‚Äôve gone to Nepal when my daughter (me) was still homesick‚Äù But I‚Äôm 23 now  And I don‚Äôt wanna go back to Nepal. But I love my father. He‚Äôs an amazing person who‚Äôs gone through so much.  But I see my future here. Knowing my dad, he cannot live without me and if I say ‚ÄúI want to go back to Nepal‚Äù he‚Äôll happily book a ticket and go. So it seems like I got the ‚Äúpower‚Äù but I hate it. I feel like a horriable person and failed as a daughter. On one hand I see my future here and I like it here. On the other hand I wanna see my father happy  I told my cousin about this and here‚Äôs what she said ‚ÄúYour dad is 50 now. He‚Äôs been sacrificing you for your whole life. Don‚Äôt let me stop you but if I was in your place, I‚Äôd come to Nepal for your father. It is your duty as the oldest child to make sure he has the safe retirement Once your father is here you can go back. Finish your bachelors‚Äù  I hate it. Also my grandma isn‚Äôt a bad person  My aunties  1 is in US 2 are in Canada  And 1 is in Nepal  So grandma lives Alone The auntie that‚Äôs in Nepal stays with her.  So Idk what to do I‚Äôve got an Australian license. I‚Äôve built a life here  I‚Äôm studying and don‚Äôt work atm  I‚Äôm an Australian citizen I wanna cry. I feel like I‚Äôve failed as a daughter.",

You can be happy in Aus, he can be happy in Nep. Both of you can visit each other every so often. It's time for you to leave the nest anyways.|||No. Anyone who says \"oh your dad's done so much for you\" and tries to blackmail you is a terrible person.   Also, move to Nepal and do what? You grew up in Australia.. you're more in touch with Australia than you are with Nepal...   Its a parent's job to provide for their children... they're not doing you as a favor, that's literally their responsibility.  Maybe once he's older then sure, if you want to take care of him go ahead. But he's a fully capable man, fully capable of living on his own.   You're only 23, you should be traveling, having fun, focusing on your career.. not worrying about what people in Nepal think.|||Grandmom sounds like a manipulative person tbh hearing your replies and stuff.

If you can't, just tell that to father.|||Your dad took you to Australia when you were 10 , you didn‚Äôt get to choose what you wanted. Now you are 23 and he and his family is manipulating you to move back to Nepal. Sorry girl, but you are being played like a ping pong ball here. Kaile kata kaile kata. I know you love him tara at the end of the day it is your life. If you don‚Äôt like it in Nepal you will never forgive your dad coz you will feel like he caused that misery and maybe your relationship with him will also go down hill. You need to have a proper conversation with him and let him choose. He can‚Äôt have both haath ma laddu, you plus his want to go back to Nepal. For once, be selfish and choose what you want.|||if you can afford, you can come to Nepal with your family and enjoy a vacation here but not fast paced khale. Spare some time like a month or so and enjoy a laid back life for some days. He is probably exhausted being in a foreign land. But you can have your own preferences of living here or there permanently.|||I have seen many cases like that. Send your father Nepal for few years I bet you $1000 he will be back to Australia. My friend family leave USA for good because his parents wanna go back to Nepal. They purchase land and properties and lived for 3 years in Nepal but they‚Äôre back again in US after selling their house and land.   They can‚Äôt live without their kids. And their kids basically grown up in US. They love and know US more then they know about Nepal.|||Your dad ‚Äòsacrificed‚Äô for you, you will ‚Äòsacrifice‚Äô for your kid, such is life.

So stay there now for the sake of your brother and when you start to earn to support your family send your parents here the facilites maybe less but the pleasure is unmatched anywhere in the world. and seeing your condition you might me a australian citizen even so visit nepal sometimes and never forget your motherland and who you are.   \\[Just some emotional and logical dialogues your father will melt thinking my daughter is matured enough to say this and stay happily.\\]   you can dm if you want any help. :)|||I'm kind of in the same situation as you, same age but male in Canada. Both of my parents are pushing 50 and want to go back to Nepal and take me with them, but I've chosen to live here and let them go back to Nepal when my little brother is grown up. The reason is very simple, there is absolutely no future for me in Nepal and recent events merely strengthen my resolve to stay in a developed country.   I know my parents have worked hard for many years to raise me and my brother, but I know that if I choose to leave my career and life here for Nepal, I will have to work just as hard in a country that does not reward hard work and dedication like a developed country like Canada or Australia does.  Another reason for you to not go back if your gender. You have more rights and freedoms in Australia than you do in Nepal, and you might not get used to the regressive expectations that native Nepalis have for women.|||No offense, but it seems like she's engaging in some extremely manipulative behavior.   P.S. I don't know the whole story. This is just the feeling I got from reading this post. I might be completely wrong.|||You father will not want to destroy your life and career and come to Nepal. Stay there make a good living come back 10 yrs later retire early.|||I talked with my mother recently about their early life in Australia and she struggled with the adjustment, especially since she is the social one of my parents. Only after 10-15 years in Australia did her feelings adjust and after 25 years of living here has she shifted her preference for country of retirement.   Nepal has had so many changes that the environment they are nostalgic about doesn't exist. They've taken so much time to assimilate as NRN Australians that they don't want to do it again if they were permanently returning to Nepal.   Anyway, Asian cultures have a history of intergenerational trauma and Nepal is no exception. Obviously there is a deep rooted Nepali culture that carries through generations as well and something you should recognise is that the culture of taking care of your parents is not just being experienced by you but by your father as well.  If you ask me, your father is feeling responsible for taking care of the ageing parents in Nepal but he is split because he must also take care of his family (ie, you and bhai).   One of my dad's close friends returned to Nepal for this exact reason in his 60's and left his kids in the US because they have the capacity to be independent. My parents have said that they will follow us because we are the next generation and they will become the grandparents.|||Don‚Äôt feel anything bad about yourself. Its his decision and not yours.   Years ago he was coerced by your mom and now your grandma wants you to coerce him back to Nepal. I don‚Äôt know what it is with the ladies of your household but I think he has to make his own decision   Every parent makes  sacrifices and if you become one you will too. And what if father you go back what about your brother ? It is what it is . If he wanted to leave he should have done years ago. Complete your studies first and than think what you should do? And don‚Äôt feel guilty about anything, this situation isn‚Äôt of your making and you shouldn‚Äôt sacrifice your studies or career for this. Your father will never be able to forgive himself.|||It is hard to deal with manipulation from adult family as we get older. As children our adult family are our guides and heroes. When we grow we start to learn they are flawed people just like everyone. But learning to handle their manipulation will make you stronger. You are an adult now and allowed to make decisions about your own life and how you live it   Maybe you can find some way to help your father enjoy Australia more? Is he involved with the nepali community? Maybe he can do a hobby or a sport? Enjoy some day trips on the weekend to parks or gardens|||Don't let your dad's sacrifice go to vain. He endured to give you the opportunity, don't let it go to waste.|||Hi, I cant provide the solution. But I am an engineer and currently living in Australia. Can you ask your dad to provide job refrence to me please. That will mean alot to me. Thankyou|||Never needed to post this as your grandmother and cousin said it best but if you really want to make your happy, convince your mother to consider her husband‚Äôs happiness too as you said he‚Äôs not happy and you should complete your studies. Consult with your family about each others needs but for you tell them that you are considering to go back to Nepal temporarily but will return as even after completing studies you won‚Äôt get better job opportunities in Nepal and even then you‚Äôll visit your family.

It‚Äôs increasing in population but decreasing in quality of life and peace of living.     * People spit gutka and paan everywhere.    * Public and private sector staff often act like they‚Äôre doing you a favor instead of just doing their job.    * Basic civic sense is missing.    * Many people talk in a rude way, even though Maithili itself is such a sweet language.    * Hospitality is terrible. Even in well-known restaurants, you don‚Äôt get a menu. You have to call staff multiple times, and when they finally come, they‚Äôre rude.    * Local leaders and youth behave like they own the place and can do whatever they want.    * Loud music in public transport and public spaces is normal.    * People get aggressive and start fights very quickly.    * If a policeman tries to enforce basic civic sense (like asking not to play loud music), people threaten him ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôll burn your police station.‚Äù * One time, Janakpur was known for quality education. Now it feels like the complete opposite. And the list goes on. Why don‚Äôt the people and leaders of Janakpur want to learn from other places? Why isn‚Äôt civic sense a priority for the local government? Why can‚Äôt people just be calm and respectful?",

He's always talked about his instance on corruption, called for investigation all the cases regardless of which party the alleged politicians belong to. He's always talked about how the top three leaders have ruined democracy and has established themselves as face of this system that has made people hate this system. He's said same thing in this interview too, and suddenly people are back to supporting him? So they actually never watched his interviews and just hopped in 'gagan hate club' or what?  If he hadn't been fighting against status quo (deuba gang) inside Nepali Congress, Gagan would've have been minister more than 6-7 times for sure. He actually should've done that in my opinion. his only executive role ever was a 9-10 month as health minister as far as I know.  Also, I might be called jholey as there are many RSP supporters here, and blame gagan for rabi being jailed which is so funny to me. you think the district courts, the high court and supreme court (which denied his habeas corpus writ) were bought? not one , not two but all three tier of courts? I don't buy that rabi is being kept in custody without any proof. Also, why did rabi not investigate Gagan for his bakhra chor case while he was home minister?",

Contrastingly, Rabi and RSP had suspended and later fired Dakha Prasad (former RSP member) when he was proven guilty of corruption.  Why don't we trust Gagan? That's because he still belongs to Nepali Congress. If he is to gain any of our trust, he'll have to rebrand himself with a new party. That's the least he could do.  What's the problem with Nepali Congress, the party? See, we all agree to the fact that the deep rooted curruption is the main single reason why our country is still undeveloped. It's not one single person or few. It's the ecosystem of corruption from govt colleges to hospitals, peon to the dean, the studens, different organs of government CIIA, judiciary you name it, basically everywhere and this is really concerning. (I'm not ranting only on Nepali Congress but all the other 2 as well). We need new faces who don't have their jholeys in these different organs and offices of government.

Ima educate these mfs on what patriarchy means.  **Patriarchy:** \"a social system where men hold primary power and authority, typically in family structures and society as a whole, including politics, economics, and culture\"  for eg: man makes decisions while women are disregarded. Yes, women having to live in man's house is patriarchy too(cuz women make sacrifices here and men don't)  What isn't patriarchy: when your mother tells you. You shouldn't wear men's clothes. When she tells you, women look better or sanskari with tika on. It would be patriarchy if a man said it and was forcefull. But this doesn't give men power in expense of women.

It's your husband's/\"man\" mother. Thus patriarchy. Still, it's an overstretch. Because,  it doesn't give men anything in expense of a woman. She didn't say anything that goes against the said person or her family or against women. It doesn't put men in authority or give them power. Neither does her opinion emboldens a system that does that.  Using words where it doesn't fit. Takes away value from actual meaning of the word.

Just give them healthy food it's your responsibility as a parent.

The background I had academically from Nepal was fine. I‚Äôm 33 of age now. My school and parents were quite strict on me so I pushed myself hard academically but I would say I wasn‚Äôt able to develop well in other skills. However there are plenty of people who are able to gain those skills in Nepal.   School was very toxic with physical and emotional abuse, discrimination, zero freedom and not very nurturing apart from just bullying you to study. I found in UK there are other opportunities, if you didn‚Äôt want to go the uni route. I also like they try to prepare you for work experience and building other hard and soft skills.  I do feel there is some change in Nepal now hopefully as I can see many young people trying different routes and perspective seem to be shifting.    I am also thinking of soft retiring and trying my luck in Nepal. Pay is definitely not comparable but the cushion you have from your savings in Uk may go a long way. I believe the pay is very basic in healthcare if you don‚Äôt own your business but may be enough to sustain yourself  I have heard of consultant doctors getting paid 50k to only 1 lakh but there is less restrictions in Nepal. It not very regulated like in Uk and a lot less rules to follow. Maybe testing it out for 6 months might give you a feel of what it‚Äôs like ? It will also depend a lot on your personality. I stayed in Nepal for 6 months and hardly missed UK but some of other friends would hate it.   Lastly, My parents managed to retire in Nepal for the last 7 years and they love it in Ktm.|||Try for Aus, Ireland or other countries first, stash 300-500k and then retire in Nepal; I know easier said than done but that's my plan as well. Nepal is absolutely the place to retire, raise kids and for people who've grown up there, there's nothing quite like it, but poverty sucks as well. So I highly recommend stashing away atleast a 100k before returning to Nepal. 100k will earn you 8-10k of interest a year which is enough for basic expenses and a job that pays 50 thousand rupees a month would be a good supplement. By retire I mean mid 30's to at most 40. If you wait any longer to return to Nepal, I feel like you've missed a good chunk of life. I know its a tall order but try to save as much as you can in the next 5-10 years and it will really enhance the QOL back home.|||Heyy , I know 2 of my friends who were born and brought up in US and UK and have shifted to Nepal permanently.

My dad had an early retirement for health so it‚Äôs not been glamour, work wise army bata niklesi. I want them to be comfortable in Nepal without staying in the UK for another two decades for the little one. That‚Äôs too much labour.

I'll try and be as objective as possible.  - The work culture is different. You're expected to kowtow to your seniors and to management. There is little concern for your well-being. You can say it's not very different from the UK, but the frustration will set in when you have to make a case for every sick leave, when your performance reviews etc are decided on the basis of who you know/connect with rather than on merit. - Work-life balance is pretty much non-existent, unless you find a kind manager/supervisor. You're expected to put work before family.  - Purchasing power is obviously better and you can buy services, i.e get someone to do your chores for you, if you're so inclined.  -  Less freedom of movement. You can probably go to a seaside town or on a long drive in the UK on a day off. Good luck buying a car for transport with a nurse's salary in Nepal. If you chose to take public transport, good luck with that too. Unfortunately, you also have to watch out for yourself if you're a woman. You'll have to be more conscious of what you wear and where you go.  - International travel? Fancy a weekend trip to a different country, perhaps? Good luck! - what i found the most frustrating was the (lack of) basics and how you are expected to get along without them. Power cuts, water problems sometimes, hot showers are a luxury. Things we don't have to think twice about while living in the developed world.  - basic cleanliness. Can't enter a public restroom without coming close to puking. Even the nicest restaurants have stinky as toilets. Roads are lined with litter. You have to watch every step while walking on the roads and if it rains, the entire city/town becomes a mudpit.  - you mentioned rising racism where you are. Nepal does have a plus there- you won't be treated like a second class citizen. - i also love traveling around Nepal. It calms me and it's definitely a profound experience. But it's a lot easier to do when you are earning in dollars/pounds and travel while on paid leaves, as opposed to when you're earning in rupees.  I can go on forever, but the decision is obviously yours and your experience might be very different from mine. You might find it all rewarding and decide it was worth it in the future, once you get past the initial frustration.  Good luck with whatever you do!|||I suggest you to do masters, have some back up and then take a break. Spend some time in Nepal.

Sometimes ask them but they say its natural no need to worry about it. It just comes and goes. Women of these gen are too weak i guess. I mean they literally whine about anything like these menstruation cycle pregnancy child birth. Dude its your responsibility as a female to go through it. So face it like a grown up. Will ya stop seeking attention even from these biological shit. Have you ever heard us male whine about our office matters when we reach home. NO!!! Bcz its how we are. So stop complaining about it and deal with it. If you have too much pain just ask for help and we will hear you out too. DAMN!!!!",

In a world full of distraction like now, starting with something boring takes extraordinary discipline and I wouldn't trust myself with that.  Start with high level languages instead, especially something visual like web development. Learn html, css, js,  you'll actually see what you're building, which is much more fun.  Once you've got the basics down, set up a proper dev environment. Your desk, theme, and editor actually matter. There are phases where coding gets boring sometimes and having a setup you love makes it easier to show up. When you need a break, customize your theme or tweak your workspace. Then jump back into coding. Repeat this cycle forever.|||would have done Law instead.|||First year: Take C programming very seriously, learn web basics like html,css,js Second year: Do leetcode exercises while studying DSA so that I actually get what I study, learn FE frameworks basics like React. Start learning BE technologies  Third Year: focus on web development more. Start learning AI and its applications Fourth Year: Complete focus on AI.|||Farming.|||PYTHON WITH FOCUS ON DATA ANALYST ROLES|||Try to do intership as soon as possible|||I would not recommend  cs  in the first place.   If i had too start a tech journey, probably  1. Become good/decent in one language(python/javascript), no c,c++,go,rust 2. learn a backend framework and learn to do basic crud stuff, use database 3. learn frontend and become full stack or  learn linux, web server, basic deployment stuffs and choose the path of cracked backend developer with stacking devops stuffs. 4. Learn cloud, containerization, application monitoring.  Btw, if you are disciplined enough, don't waste 4 yrs of cs,    you can learn the above stuffs in around 1.5-2yrs if you push yourself reguraly,   you probably won't be able to follow through all the stuffs i've mentioned due to time/energy constraint while doing cs stuff. 80-90% cs stuff is absolute bullshit(outdated, non-marketable, non-comprehensible, trivial), you'll regret joining cs after couple of years,   bookmark this comment.|||There is no perfect roadmap  Explore gara.

Then proceed to ML with some Python programming.|||I saw many comments with their take on starting with low level programming, and some argue against it. But I think it really depends on what programming means to you. If you feel cs is just writing code in a company or making aandha paisa, then definitely you should learn those things that will land you a job faster, and a high level is the best way there. But if you are a person who loves to scratch things and is very enthusiastic about this domain, and you like to explore more, then I would suggest going with low level ( i.e., C programming). I also saw someone saying C feels boring, but that's not the case if you are actually interested and want to learn, not for the sake of others or to find a job, but because you want to have strong fundamentals in computer science. I learned C as my first programming language, and I didn't learn it in school; I didn't learn the way that schools teach C. If you learn the way school teaches, then it's definitely boring, and you never get to know how deep yet simple the language is, and how fun it can be. The most interesting and fun days of my programming career were those when I was doing low level programming. I am not saying you can't have fun solving problems in high-level languages, but i feel when you move towards the corporate world or you do something you love as a career/work for others, then I don't think it still sparks in your face. I am not saying you can't enjoy it, many people do actually enjoy it very much, but I find it draining, and THAT'S A PERSONAL VIEW|||First of all, what is your goal? Cs can be broad.   My suggestion is just as I would have done it if I could go back in the past. My main focus would be to clarify my goal and work my way up from there. Since I read your other comments and I am assuming that you want to be a developer and you are completely fresh:  1. My first priority would be to understand the database. This is where it all starts and ends. If you understand the in and out of database you will have an easier time developing a software.  2. I would study every major aspect of OOP + file handling. My go to language would be C/C++. No need to worry about which one to choose. You're less likely to use it in your development career unless you're a software engineer or a game developer.  3. I would learn javascript and css by heart. I would not listen to anyone saying otherwise. This has been a lifesaver for me for more than I can count my fingers in my hands. 4. As soon as I understand OOP, I would jump into studying python  (you can choose your own backend coding).  5. Finally, I would start with my small full stack project. My focus would be on how to connect the database to the business logic. (For example a personal finance tracker, music tracker, all in one basic tool I keep searching for online otherwise etc.) In this process I would study the logic, crud, api (ajax, hook etc), token, session, cookies etc.  6. Create a fine documentation of all the steps I took to create my personal project including mistakes and solutions.  7. A proper manual of my software. (Start now because you will need to be best at it if you want to market your software later in your life.) 8. I would keep in my mind that there are best of the best out there and keep my ego in check. Go back to basics as many times as I require. I wouldn't look down on others or stop learning from them. 7. Last but not the least, I would take care of my health. Especially my brain, back and eyes. If you want to become smart, you need to learn to give yourself a break.   I can't go into more details here but I hope it helps. Happy learning and best of luck!  Edit: git! Forgot to add it. Study from early on.|||Lean AI & ML.

I managed to grow an Instagram page in the entertainment and infotainment niche to over 55K followers, and even built a small SaaS website for my audience. I was really excited to try something new, but after losing $10 on a domain, I had to pause it for now. Still, it was a fun project and I learned a lot from it.  As a content creator, I don‚Äôt think I wasted my time at all. I got hands-on experience with Canva, video editing, and engaging with my audience. I even collaborated with an app (though I didn‚Äôt get paid), but it helped me understand how brand deals work. Later, I built and deployed a subscription-based website but never launched it because I doubted if anyone would actually pay for it.  I also tried posting on Facebook as i was eligible for monetization, but things didn‚Äôt go as expected. None of my 25‚Äì30 posts or reels even crossed 100 views, and more than half got copyright claims. It was a bit frustrating, especially since I was used to getting 8‚Äì53 million monthly views on Instagram.  Now I‚Äôm just looking for a job where I can use the skills I‚Äôve learned: content creation, photo and video editing, Canva, social media growth, content strategy, and web development. I‚Äôve learned how to understand audience behavior, spot trends early, and manage online communities, and I‚Äôm excited to bring all that experience into a real job.",

We women have grown up seeing our mom, grandmother do endless domestic, emotional labour---all normalized, all unknowledged. Unpaid Labour has been institutionalized in ways that exploit women in the name of love, duty and family. Our mothers really deserved better. And yes marriage is a scam for women. I call marriage a sexist propaganda. And ofc, not all marriages are oppressive today, but the institutional structure and history of marriage remains deeply patriarchal.|||It is not only in Nepal.

The demand is at its peak at these times from wives and children. Designer bag, expensive shoes and clothes, jewellery, gifts, dakchina, among other stuff that almost feels unnecessary. Now don't come at me saying, \"it doesn't happen in my family\". Sure some families may be an exception (my own is an exception but then my home also divides work before major events to keep it manageable) but I have yet to see such  other families where women put the money upfront for anything required for home, especially the expensive ones before complaining about their work they have to put into their own home for their own family.

Both were done by the West through TV and meta apps, and yet we are too stubborn to see it because of our ego. And still, people want to die for those- they worship blindly, but not for their own kings. Kings -especially the Shah dynasty, were the true heirs of this country. They are literally the founders of this nation, and yet this generation doesn‚Äôt realize it.   If we don‚Äôt realize why we are in a mess today, then we shouldn‚Äôt call the UN for help when things get worse in the future and believe me, it will. And the matter of fact, the UN doesn‚Äôt truly exist for justice; pedo-elites are at the top hierarchy.  We are not a developed country because we try to copy the West and their agendas to go against India and China, which are now two supergiants. The media also played its part well, creating division through religion, caste, and gender. Nothing like that should exist in a free world. God is one source-energy and eternal, yet we are too brainwashed to see the truth.  This isn‚Äôt the same Nepal that we once cherished and loved. Our history is slowly turning into ashes, and we‚Äôre enjoying every bit of it without understanding the true hidden agendas. We always say \"Sati le sarape ko desh\" but we never tried to search for truth and be educated of our history. This is the real Kaliyug, but I still hope we prevail over this chaos, not only Nepal but all over the world where humanity is going downhill.|||still his prediction match ü§£",

Create a single point failure and see what happens in modern time. Outdated blood based rulers if someone supports this they are either too close to the family back then and it up rooted their livelihood leeching off the monarchy crumbs or Andha Bhakt Ultra Hindu Nationalist believing King is divine.   The Sept 8-9 movement is against corrupt politicians and their cronies, the ask was simple make public institutions trustworthy, give us reason to stay in Nepal work, live and be happy. \"Life, Liberty and Pursuit of Happiness\" which is literally the core of people's democracy.  Protested and people died for leveling off the playing field, cronyism and political corruption against thyo, people want to bring back OG cronies who were above the law in the name of \"nationalism\".  We protested specifically because 3 taukey seems to be above the law but brain dead rajabadi want someone instead of them also above the law. And their thick skulls don't see an the irony with that.|||Hamroma ajhai pani feudalism ko mentality gakai xaina, tei vayera ta yo party haru eti arajak huna pakothyo|||Oh wait bro. Do you really think at this moment you are not slave ? Bro this is a problem with democracy. Democracy work in such a way that it seems like democracy but it is dictatorship. During the removal of monarchy just see how many people died there and now see how many people die. You can see the clear difference. After the end of monarchy the king silently returned but now see the attitude of this KP baze. The is pretending to be greater then king. So Who is the king? And are you a slave or not now? I am also not pro monarchy but if you could build a democratic system which is really a democratic then it's Great. But the single fact is, it is not possible. About Hindu rastha I am a  Atheist. But still I support Hindu rastha. Do you know why. The first step to break any country is to remove the pride for there culture and religion. So the establishment of Christianity is not random it is heavily planned. So Just to protect the country I am with Hindu rastha even being atheist.Yep monarchy was not good and evil before but I think it will work better cause of fear of People. They saw many people protest and Foreign intervention. So I hove they can rule better. And what's different in the political party and Monarchy. Only one difference, Political party is for certain time so they have the concept to just take a bribe and collect a lot of money for future retirement and there children. But for King they are permanent and there pride is associated from the standard of their country. One person of 100billion dollar networth VS a King with 100billiondollar GDP. In this case the king will have more pride. At last I don't know whether the monarchy will be good for our country or not but I know It can never go more worst than this. Edit:    Also one point is Our country Just need Stability and some long term vision. Other Development can be easily done by the youth of Nepal.|||Raja Huda, ko chai slave thyo ra pahila ü§î|||Gyanu le affai ma aaudina vandai cha ta. Kina attirako bro",

Make no mistake, I hate mincing words: when depressed, remember all the lives that are designated to a mere existence, not the ones that thrive. It'll remind you to be motivated enough to put yourself out of that circumstance.  Here's an advice: Get to a point where you're able to self sustain.

For me he is a good mayor and he does what he is supposed to do . I have never seen such cleanliness before, bus stops are being made and all and it has been a pleasure having him . And the thing about him using the media is like saying momo ma keema hunxa , obviously sab politicians haru le use garxan .  He didn't lead the protest neither told gen-z to protest, gen-z randomly started asking him to join and they also wanted him to be a pm when he never said he wanted to be one . These are all the expectations and burdens which he didn't choose but were forced upon him.  He said he was going to be a good mayor and he is , if he was in a big influencing position then the expectations would have been valid . I always remember that most people would see good people fail and they would feel good about themselves.

The funding that has been availed through Carbon Purchase as well as NGOs and INGOs have also played a critical role. I don't remember exactly, but UNDP or something published a really great report on the success of community forests and improvement of forested areas in Nepal.   Actually Nepal despite everything and has had excellent metrics when it comes to nature and biodiversity conservation.|||Folks who grew up in the 90s may remember efforts put into forest conservation through media.

Impressionable ads like an old woman carrying doko vari ko daura and wondering ‚ÄúAja lai ta taryo voli k garne?‚Äù We have done a lot in the field of forest and wildlife conservation. Amidst all the negative things lets commend ourselves on this for once. Hamro Community based Forest Preservation program (Samudayik Bann) is a leading example in the world.|||\"Hariyo ban Nepal ko dhan\" massive initiative is Main reason. This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it. You can hear the news for development work and of NEA cannot cut down the trees easily, yup that is because of same strong protective law.|||It‚Äôs because of movement of people and reliance on gas, concrete instead of timber.|||No , it‚Äôs a result of migration of people from hills to concentrated cities and Terai .

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts. So, yeah definitely a result of afforestation but there is more to this and would be a great topic to delve deep into.|||what about terai ko char koshe jhadi?|||It‚Äôs meant to highlight the loss of ice and glaciers.

But to be in the situation is already a failure. We already failed when there was a situation to choose between life and property. The situation shouldn't have arisen at the first place. And the army doesn't have all the blame to take. Lord knows what security council was busy in. What purpose does a security council serve if it cannot hold a meeting in emergency. Nepal army was already very cautious by what happened in 23rd and also long while back during maoist insurgency. It was a huge security failure to not be able to mobilise the army at the right time, which the army cannot do on its own.

Build cool projects and show them off on X or LinkedIn. Follow a bunch of US founders. Research YC and follow YC founders. The projects will need to show extraordinary level of depth in whatever field you want to pursue. A simple webapp, or a mobile app wont suffice. I would say, go deep into AI engineering, do multi-model, multi-agent projects and show them off in LinkedIn. Be raw and honest. Good AI talent is hard to find everywhere. I‚Äôm not talking about AI chatbots, have depth. 3. Look at dev opportunities in Europe. While I was in Norway, it was comparatively a whole lot easier to get a CS job than in the US.

The widget of nepali date is what sold me. The UI looks clean. I like that i can see the previous month and calendar years back but it would be cool if instead of the drop-down it was something else as the drop-down blocks the view of the current calendar and i feel it looks like the design aesthetic with the rest of the app design.   I hope you keep improving and adding new features !|||Tried it. Looks good.   One thing that i felt redundant was the popup layout when seeking other dates. Like when i want to see what is on 3rd Kartik, it opens up a popup therefore blocking the calendar entirely. I have to then close the popup  to seek through the next date. I feel that you could just update the info below the calendar for the selected date instead of the popup.   Makes it easier to seek through the dates.|||whats smarter in this calendar?|||Best!

I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can‚Äôt get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

The funding that has been availed through Carbon Purchase as well as NGOs and INGOs have also played a critical role. I don't remember exactly, but UNDP or something published a really great report on the success of community forests and improvement of forested areas in Nepal.

This initiative give our own native and unique policy \"community forest\" where community protect and nurture forest. Community use forest without any impact and even Governement cannot directly govern community forest. This concept of community forest is one of the most successful policy that Nepal Gov had came to. The reason for this nation wide initiative was because of large scale deforestation in the point that the UN has predicted that by 90 ( forget exact year) not a single tree will stand in Nepal. But Nepal had done which seems impossible.  Other stronger law/policy came into play to protect forest and punish who destroy it.

This also extends to the policy level amendment regarding the conservation while extending to the community forestry programmes. There are other factors including migration, changes relating to fuel consumption and few others. As much as this is a success story, there have been few negative impacts. I did a brief study about the water system of Kathmandu  valley where i found this afforestation program( around the hills) negatively impacted on water flow. As non native trees were used during replantation, they have been found to consume more water and thus one of few reasons for drying up the hitis of the valley as the water for hitis are channeled from the outskirts.

I searched some more on YouTube and this man has been actively saying nothing but 'my home village' and 'my country Nepal'.  His love for this nation is second to none. Even after how he has been treated by everyone including myself. Even I never bother to search online about him.  Everyone in Nepal like me need to apologize to Dr.Mahabir Pun.  His quote,\"There comes a difficult time, unusual situation that people usually don't need to go through. In that situation it is necessary to have uncommon faith and uncommon approaches to face the uncommon odds of human life.\" from the same video of graduation speech. It will never leave my brain. This man said those words on 2007 and lived by it. His uncommon faith and uncommon approaches has definitely made huge impact on me today. And hoping Nepal will follow his will of uncommon faith and uncommon approaches to face the uncommon odds of human life.

            "body": "My house was vandalized in the name of \"Gen z protest.\" My dad is a civil servant, and we live in a humble 3 story house (the third story was only recently built). It was a small house when we moved in, which was 17 years ago‚Äî few months after I was born.   After working for over 25+ years for the government, this country, and its public, my dad still has a very clear history. No bribery, no corruption, no money laundering‚Äî nothing. Rising high in status and the post, he is recognized for his diligent work and highly stable work ethic.  Now, back to the present. The protestors had reached our house. I had once thought, why would anyone target our house? It's a civil servant, not some minister or anything of that sort. My father rose high due to his hard work and competitiveness, not any connection or bribery. We can all see from how my parents lived rental first (he was already a civil servant then). Only after a few months of me being born did they buy a house, not without taking loans.  I don't know why it happened because our house was aba and definitely not supposed to be a part of whatever that was. The protestors were going to burn our house, but because of it being attached to other houses, the neighbours finally calmed them down into not burning our house. Instead, they burned our bikes, went into our house, and threw things out to burn them. What's worse? When the protestors left, all the people living nearby, went in and out for 2 days straight‚Äî morning, day and night, pickng whatever things they liked amd taking it home with them as if our house was some kind of thrift store giving away our stuff for free.  We were at our relative's house, and when we saw all the black smoke coming from the direction of our house, we were devastated. \"Our house got burnt.\" That's what we thought. As i was the oldest child in the family, i couldn't let myself break down. I can still hear those devastating gut-wrenching cries and sobs from my mom, haunting me like a ghost every time i close my eyes.   I am a college student. My uniform is gone, and so are my books and copies. My sister is in middle school. Her uniform and books and copies are nowhere to be found as well.   Our money and jewelries, of course, are gone too. The same money my father earned and mind you, a civil servant's earnings isn't much. Only enough to label us as a middle-class family. The same money my sister sent us, her hard-working money(which was in dollars at that).  Our clothes, bags, and even utensils are gone, and so are our food storage(stuff). My mom is someone who saves money. However, she can just like my dad because she knows she has experienced the hardships with my dad. Because they know. Because they have experienced hardships and complications in their life. Because they have faced obstacles.  We have never wore any designers, no luxury fashion brand. All are affordable and comfortable. The only designer my mom and dad ever even had is when my big sister from abroad visited us and surprised us with some designer bags (which she also got scolded for spending so much because she is still studying and working in between only).  Our guests'clothes, laptops, phones, everything is gone. Me and my sisters' savings and my mom's little spending for managing our household‚Äî nothing is left. Not even our puja ko thaan(a small place we had to worship and pray gods).   We have tons of debts. I am old enough to learn that by now. Now that our house was totally and utterly robbed and vandalized while my dad kept on working for the same public, we have nowhere to sleep on. No clothes to wear. There is no place to shower or bathe.  We had to hide away from our own house we once called home to keep ourselves alive. My father was lucky enough to be safe because if it was even a few seconds late, it would have all been over. We were fortunate to be alive, even though we had done nothing wrong to people.  Morality? Humanity? Conscience? Guilt? Remorse? None. The same people, the same public, that my dad is working so hard to serve with his whole heart, has done this to him, to his family.  Gen z, huh? Protest against corruption, huh? My dad, having the cleanest history‚Äî no corruption, bribery, connection, whatsoever. So why our house? Why? What had we ever done to them? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.   I have no hope left. None for this country, none for the people of this country. This is now a country full of robbers and thieves. Humans are jealous. Humans are greedy. People are full of themselves, full of greediness and selfishness. In my heart, humans are creatures who have ruined any hope for more in me and my family. My father, who once poured his heart for this country and the people in this country, is on the verge of giving up on it.  You people, opportunists, and robbers who call yourselves voice of justice‚Äî I'll be watching, watching who you are going to tame to pull this country back together. People like my dad who are so wronged will be out of all this mess soon, Who are you going to pull to patch this broken country? I'll be watching. I'll be happily watching everything crumble and fall apart with your \"justice.\" You have given the opportunists a sense of win. You've let them think anything is possible, and now, everything will fall apart while you watch everything crumble in front of your eyes.  Lastly, I'd like to be a little vulgar and uncensored. If you are uncomfortable, scroll away.  Whoever has participated in vandalizing my house and robbing it empty‚Äî You are going to see hell and worse. I hope you feel yourself rotting away. I hope you don't think it's over now because whatever you stole, it will haunt you for the rest of your life and afterwards. I will forever haunt you, even in your dreams, converting it into a disastrous nightmare. You'll see hell. You are going to suffer.  [Edit: I never expected this post to gain so many views. I‚Äôm very grateful to those who are wishing me and my family well, thank you very much for that. And I also understand those who might raise an eyebrow on this post and not believe in my words. It‚Äôs up to you, whether you want to believe me or not. I have no intention of forcing it on you.   I‚Äôd also like to request anyone who knows me through this post to maintain my privacy and not reveal anything about me or my family on the internet(please refrain any stalker behavior). I have never gone public like this and I also don‚Äôt like the attention this is getting(makes me uncomfortable) but I‚Äôm going to keep this post so other people who have experienced something like this can be open about it here. Let this be a safe space for those to speak up.]",

We are still finger pointing everyone we hate.   We still haven't learnt anything. There are thousands of civil servants, like your dad, working tirelessly behind the scenes to make this country great. Hats off to your dad.   We, Nepali, are greedy, anyone succeeds in life or does something for themselves we accuse them of shady things all the sudden.   Hopefully the future won't be dark like the few weeks for you was. ü´°|||I know this will be an unpopular opinion, but I feel the Gen Z protest got out of control.  While this was an absolutely needed protest and it did bring much-needed attention and change, we also can‚Äôt deny the darker side of it. While the deaths of innocent people rightfully shook everyone and fueled the anger, more innocent lives were lost in the chaos that followed.  Gen Z cannot ignore the fact that others died in fires, or that people were looted and harmed during the unrest. It‚Äôs easy to say the movement was hijacked by goons, but the videos and reports show some protesters themselves vandalizing property and stealing from people who had nothing to do with the issue. Ironically, those who stood up against corruption ended up damaging the lives and livelihoods of ordinary citizens.   Those responsible should be held accountable for it!!!   My heart goes out to you for your loss. Please know you and your family are welcome to stay with us until you find a place to rebuild. Destiny will open new doors for you. Your family will rise again and rebuild everything you‚Äôve lost. Wishing you strength, courage, and healingüôè|||Any CCTV footage? Do you know who started it?

The moment I condemn their brutality, they rush to label me as ‚Äújholay,‚Äù as if that insult could erase their own guilt. Their selective outrage is sickening.

Much love to you all Aussies too.|||Appreciate it mate|||Thanks for your kind appreciation. Let me tell you our Nepalese perspective.  As a Nepalese, it's really tough for us to enter Australia, first you must pass at least high school with good marks, then get a really good English test score, then you must show a significant bank balance, so your immigration policy is already filtering only the best people from other countries.   I am a Engineer myself, it's relatively easy for someone like me to immegrate to Australia, but for students of other field, you're immigration policy already make sure only the best students come in your country, and it should be that way to be honest.   Regarding your immigration issue, well I believe any country should only allow immigration if there is net positive for the country, you don't want a bunch of liabilities to come in your country, right??  So, just look at the data, you can very easily find out what communities are contributing to Australia, and what communities are hampering the country, and simply adjust the policies that way, it's really that simple.   Regarding recent protests against Immigration, well I think that's just the coverup done by the rich and elites to brainwash common Aussies so that the blame is shifted towards immigration when in fact Australia has the best immigration compared to many Western countries.   My cousin recently returned back to Nepal, they lived in Melbourne for almost 10 years, they shared the economy isn't doing great compared to past years, and the blame is being shifted solely towards immigration.|||U will be welcomed here in Nepal.

Always up for a good yarn whenever I bump into someone from Nepal.  I know we‚Äôve had a few grumpy old conservatives carrying on about immigration lately, but honestly, most young Aussies don‚Äôt reckon like that at all. From my point of view ‚Äì and from any fair-dinkum Aussie ‚Äì you‚Äôre more than welcome here. Nepalese folks add heaps of value to this country, and I hope that continues.  One day I‚Äôd love to visit Nepal once things settle down there. And mate, your food ‚Äì wow! I could eat momos every day, no worries.|||Can y'all please recommend your fav momo place?

But just commenting as i'm interested to hear you're having anti immigration protests in Australia too? I'm in UK and it's gone a bit berserk here too. People are protesting and putting England flags everywhere. I think our governments have orchestrated this, and have found their scapegoat instead of increasing taxes on the 1%.|||I made a post similar to this a few months ago. I am also Australian, and in my experience Nepalese people are so often the nicest and most genuine people you will ever meet. I have been to Nepal and I love the food, the culture and the people.

There are some spectacular idiots, and they will spout stupid things at you.

Most of times Indian (south asians) face racism is due to...   1. bad dressing up sense , fashion.  2. manners   3. smell     Always dress well, wear clean, not necessarily new, clothes, be polite in train, bus ( say thank you to driver, leave seats for women , pregnant, elderly etc ), don't play music in phone without earphones, don't speak in phone in crowded space, hold door if you can, and use thank you, sorry, excuse me please as often as you can. And avoid eating food with garlic, onion like lot ... mild amount won't be cause body odour.

This affectes every country in south Asia including Nepal. That's a problem we should solve. IT's gradually under control I guess.|||Google Bangladesh. And let me know if you found the answer|||Don‚Äôt look up bangladesh/australia. Nepal has average population density.|||Population in SE Asia seems to be quite high in general. I think regarding your question about where the population is concentrated, you will find that the population is scattered throughout the country - everywhere minus above 3000m up the himalayas. Then if you do a deep assessment what % of Perus Land actually has people vs % of Nepal where people reside, you may find the two land sizes may not be off by a magnitude like now when you compare the full size of the country. For eg UK has a landmass of 250k but has a population of 69 mil. That's 2x population of Peru in 1/5th of land. In the other hand australia has a population of 27mil in 7.7mil km2. Russia has 143mil people in 17mil km2 (4x Pop of Peru in 16x land area).  You are also looking at the mercader projection which further makes Nepal look more visually small in the map. Not that it should have any basis when you talk about numbers.   I suppose what I am trying to say is the population may still be high in Nepal but it may not be as high as you think when you factor in livable land in the country. Total land mass alone is not a great indicator.|||Fertile land, fertile people, most are on terai belt. Look at india and bangladesh, how densely populated they all are.

It calculated on a flat, two-dimensional plane, not by measuring the surface area of its mountains, hills, and valleys. The total land area of a country is determined by projecting its borders onto a standardized reference surface, typically an ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the Earth.      Nepal is roughly a \\~1000 km long, and 150 km wide and so the approximate area of 150 sq km.   Now if you count the mountains and valleys that covers like 70% of that 2D area, the actual habitable space is order of magnitide larger. maybe even 50x.

It's our duty to keep ourselves informed and not to falls for all the bullshit. Remember the cost paid before and during the revolution and be vigilant. Most of all, register and VOTE.|||No, we should be thankful that we have overcome the first step of political crisis. Yes, at the time constitution's word by word wasn't matched for forming government. But President did form the govt and dissolve by abiding with the constitution. And not anybody was appointed. The former Chief Justice was appointed, who , even by the position, is supposed to be the most learned of the laws worldwide and Nepal. The only bad is that we have an interim government, but the election date has been fixed and we should in anyway possible make the election successful, even if the interim government fails to do any other thing beside that. Cuz having a parliament is very very necessary brother. Good governance, Corruption control and investigation, all can come in time being, but the democratic, free, and sovereign country do need parliament. We may not like the members and representatives there, but for our democracy and peoples sovereignty, parliament must be there. That is the reason, the upper house National Assembly is still there.  I just read the news in BBC that Taliban government shut down all the internet in Afghanistan. And the people have nothing to say there. Already they had girls education completely removed from the country. And in Sudan there is a terrible civil war ongoing, even worse than Ukraine and Gaza, merely because multiple factions within the army and political groups want executive power for themselves. The condition is pathetic there. Just so so sad.  I know Nepali are frustrated with the government. But let's understand one thing, in Nepal our Parliament and legislative is supposed to be more powerful than the other two bodies. If government fails to do as expected, we should elect better party in the Parliament. Moreover, the development is not just duty of Prime Minister and council of ministers. The administration of Nepal also called the permanent government is there to carry out the tasks for governance and development. The political structure, that is PM and council of Ministers are primarily to make the administrative structures accountable and focused to the citizens' need, demand and aspirations.  So, let's not be too emotional and aggressive to the point that we focus too much on executive and not the legislative and parliament. Laws, Constitution, System can only be changed through Parliament only , and that should always be. So please, dear fellow Nepali brothers and sisters, let's help the interim government to function as best as it possibly can and soon have the parliament, and fully constitutionally functioning all three organs of the state: Legislative, Executive, and Judiciary. Let's participate in the election with joy and hope, and elect the best, if not, the best among the worst, and bring the country into running and stability. Please. This is not the time to fight amongst each other. We need to be united as one Nepali in this so vulnerable time. We will not have a country man, if we keep on fighting and not helping the interim government. Let's elect our representatives in Falgun 21, and do fighting then after. Making the representatives accountable, pressuring them to amend as per our choice through peaceful protest, signature campaign. But for the few coming months till election, let's be optimistic and help each other in family, friends, and communities to participate and be excited for election. We will only have a country, if we can keep it. A country needs the parliament. It is the soul. Executive helps develop, provide security. But the source of our sovereignty, our say in the nation, is through our representative in parliament. How much we want to fight now, let's fight in the parliament. Parliament is literally a place to hear each other, discuss and debate. Let's be fully focused in electing our favored representative and , in bad case best amongst worst, for now please guyss.|||The cleanest and the only way GenZ can get out of this is to win the election by a massive landslide  Parties haru khatisakey.

In very rare, exceptional cases, NTC may have options for extremely large accidental top-ups, though the taxes already paid to the government make a full reversal highly complex. * **Attempt a formal complaint through the digital wallet:**¬†If they used a digital wallet like eSewa or Khalti, they should file a complaint with that wallet provider. These wallets can act as intermediaries and request a reversal from¬†[Nepal Telecom](https://www.ntc.net.np/), though ultimately, NTC controls the outcome.¬†  Long-term strategies for using the balance  Since a refund is almost certainly not an option, the best approach is to recover the value over time by converting the credit back into cash.  * **Offer balance transfers to friends and family:**¬†The¬†Reddit user¬†can offer to transfer balance to friends and family in exchange for cash. This is a common and reliable method of liquidating NTC balance.    * **Balance transfer limits:**¬†NTC allows up to 20 transfers per day, with a maximum of Rs. 500 per transfer.    * **Execution:**¬†They can use the NTC mobile app or the USSD code¬†`*422*SecurityCode*RecipientNumber*Amount#`¬†to initiate transfers. * **Offer mobile top-ups in the local community:**¬†For people who prefer cash transactions, the user can act as an unofficial recharge agent. They can offer to top up people's phones in exchange for cash, perhaps at a small discount to incentivize the transaction. * **Bundle and sell discounted packages:**¬†The user can purchase various voice, data, and SMS packs offered by NTC and resell them to others at a discounted rate. For example, they could buy a large 28-day data pack with a market value of Rs. 999 and sell it to someone for a reduced cash price. * **Use the balance for services and bills:**¬†The user can offer to pay for other people's utility bills that can be settled via an NTC number and accept cash in return. This could include things like landline or internet service bills if NTC provides them.¬†  Warning for the Reddit user  * **Scams:**¬†Advise the user to be very cautious about offers from strangers promising to buy the balance or provide a refund. They should only perform transactions with people they know and trust to avoid losing the balance without getting paid. * **Security code:**¬†The NTC security code for balance transfers is like a bank PIN and should never be shared with anyone. The user must perform all transfers themselves.¬†|||Chora chori thula vayinjel samma balance halna parena aba..üòù|||1xbet money.|||I have seen such thing alot of times I don't think now they did it mistakenly.

            "body": "We all know most ISP here lock the router and dont give any access to the web management. As a devops practitioner and someone who is very invested in homelabbing and selfhosting, locked router was my biggest achilles heels.   Requirement: A secondary router, you main router will stop working and secondary router will only work through LAN1 port.   Solution: All you have to do is create a ticket on vianet app stating \"Turn the router into bridge/modem only mode\". Someone will call you back, just ask them username and password for PPPOE and use your secondary router to configure through PPPOE instead of DHCP. Tada!!! you now have full control over your router.   Bonus 1: You can flash openwrt with Luci web interface and you will be able to configure anything you can think of. extra advantage is you can configure mesh routing without needing a special router. I have managed to easily flash it on my Mi router and a old tp link router, search for guides depending on your model or ask Claude or Gpt to search specifically for your router model.   Bonus 2: Vianet gives you globally accessible IPV6. That means you are free from CGNAT. Use this to access your home services without needing any relay like Cloudflare Tunnel or Tailscale VPN. Direct connection means no extra latency and maxed bandwidth and you can use this to host online game servers to play with your friends!! But for some reason Worldlink doesnt connect sometimes. Ncell and ClassicTech seems to have no problem tho. I am not sure if NTC offers IPV6.  Bonus 3: Host a adguard DNS server and configure your openwrt to use it as your default DNS server. This way you will have adblocking for your whole network. Your parents and old grannies wont have to see ads no more (wont work with Youtube app - use revance) and it keeps them safe from online phishing and malwares. You can also set some static ip and adguard to block some websites like gambling and pornography if there are minors in your household.   Disadvantage: The only downside of this is your main router will turn pretty much useless. Internet wont work through wireless and extra ports. So dont forget the vianet tech support to turn off the DHCP and wireless on the main router. Since my secondary router also has 2 ports only I had to invest some money on extra gigabyte switch.   I know some of you will appreciate this so this is my appreciation and giving back to this community. enjoy and have fun!! Happy Dashain!!!

This isn't just about a bad interview, it feels like a deliberate strategy to exploit job seekers for free labor.  I went through **multiple** rounds of interviews over several weeks. Everything seemed promising. The conversations were positive, and they talked about a great fit for their team. Then came the \"final\" task: to design a comprehensive digital marketing campaign.  I spent days on this. I researched their brands, analysed their competitors, and built out a full strategy, complete with campaign ideas, target audiences, content plans, and performance metrics. I treated it like a real, paid project because I genuinely wanted the job and to show my capabilities.  I submitted the work, feeling confident. Then... nothing. Total radio silence. I followed up, but no response. The most infuriating part? The reason given was a flimsy, nonsensical excuse that had nothing to do with the work I submitted.  This isn't an isolated incident. I've heard from others who have gone through the exact same process with them. They get you to design a full campaign, which they can then use or adapt, and then they ghost you or reject you on some silly pretext. It's a blatant exploitation of job seekers' time and skills.  If you're a digital marketer in Nepal and you're considering applying to IMS Group, be warned. This is not a legitimate hiring process. It's a fishing expedition for free campaign ideas. Save your time and your work for a company that respects candidates and values their professional effort.  They were still hiring 2 days ago and I gave the interview 3 months ago.",

I see lots of Indian software devs (3 to 5+ work experience ) following the similar route. I just wanted to know if there are Nepalese software devs who also did the same.

Build cool projects and show them off on X or LinkedIn. Follow a bunch of US founders. Research YC and follow YC founders. The projects will need to show extraordinary level of depth in whatever field you want to pursue. A simple webapp, or a mobile app wont suffice. I would say, go deep into AI engineering, do multi-model, multi-agent projects and show them off in LinkedIn. Be raw and honest. Good AI talent is hard to find everywhere. I‚Äôm not talking about AI chatbots, have depth. 3. Look at dev opportunities in Europe. While I was in Norway, it was comparatively a whole lot easier to get a CS job than in the US. Cold emails and reach would be the way to go 4. Research countries where Big Tech will sponsor software engineers and bring them there. There‚Äôs big tech hubs in Poland, Amsterdam, Singapore and more. Research if the tech companies there also sponsor talent from abroad.|||I know a bunch who came directly from Nepal. The companies in EU don't differentiate based on where you're from.   The interview experience might be different depending on the company. Startups might grill you with several rounds of interviews.

The widget of nepali date is what sold me. The UI looks clean. I like that i can see the previous month and calendar years back but it would be cool if instead of the drop-down it was something else as the drop-down blocks the view of the current calendar and i feel it looks like the design aesthetic with the rest of the app design.   I hope you keep improving and adding new features !|||Tried it. Looks good.   One thing that i felt redundant was the popup layout when seeking other dates. Like when i want to see what is on 3rd Kartik, it opens up a popup therefore blocking the calendar entirely. I have to then close the popup  to seek through the next date. I feel that you could just update the info below the calendar for the selected date instead of the popup.   Makes it easier to seek through the dates.|||whats smarter in this calendar?|||Best!

Every time you run an app, the system checks which permissions have already been granted. The same happens when you open the NIC Asia app. Now, why would NIC Asia need access to your camera?

It has to be tied to the QR feature, because once the app is logged in the whole page is swipe-gesture based.

            "body": "About fifteen years ago, many of us spent hours enjoying games on our Nokia keypad phones or other classic devices running Symbian OS (though brands like Samsung and Motorola were around, Nokia often ruled the roost!). We either frantically search the web for games or head to an electronics shop and ask, \"Dai Dai yesma(sd card) game haldinuna?\" before loading a ton of them onto our SD cards.  However, a major hassle was finding a game that actually matched our phone's screen resolution. Some games were half screen, some were overly zoomed, and the ones that fit perfectly often turned out to be, well, not so great. Despite the screen struggles, those original Java games were special many were unique, story focused, and almost entirely ad-free (Ads here, Ads there, Ads everywhere. We need nokia legacy back).  Recently, the nostalgia hit me hard, and I desperately wanted to replay them. The irony? I had exchange my old phones years ago (for indestructible chiya khaney glass that can survive metoriod strike and last for eternity). My other devices were either lost or simply not working anymore. I started searching the internet and found a great way to play these classic Symbian/Java games on Android. I am only going to share the first method because the other couple of methods I tried were quite laggy.  Some of you might already know this trick, but for others (like me until recently) who are still wondering how to play these games like back, this is for you. (Since I have an Android, this method might not work for Apple users).  Method I use:  Using J2ME Loader  Install J2ME Loader: This emulator is free and available on the Google Play Store. Download Your Java Games: Use Google to search for your favorite titles or visit dedicated sites. Some popular options are Dertz, Mobiles24, and Phoneky. Phoneky is my personal favorite because it makes browsing for the exact games you want simple and quick. (NOTE: PLEASE DOWNLOAD GAMES WITH 240√ó320 SCREEN RESOLUTION ONLY. IT WILL PERFECTLY STRETCH TO YOUR SMARTPHONE SCREEN)  Launch Games Using J2ME Loader:  Open the J2ME Loader app. Tap the \"+\" icon or the \"Add Game\" button. Navigate to the location where you downloaded the .jar file (this is the game file). Select the game to add it to your list in the app. Tap on the game's icon to start playing! (Pro-Tip: You can also go into the settings to configure the key mapping to suit your playing style.)",

But without any credible information just blatantly labelling it exploitative and child abuse will do more harm than good.|||True, the Kumari tradition is precious but it needs to be modified so culture thrives without harming the child.|||  Wait till the local Newar finds out that someone has spoken a fact here. üòÇ|||Hi all I am a Newar, and i don‚Äôt oppose the tradition.  The child will have access to education and almost everything another child can ask for. We have belief that the child carries spirit of Taleju Bhawani, which gives the child immense power. Again, in an age where we have lost our belief, I cannot prove it.  The kumaris I have visited emit strong aura (i may have been brainwashed to feel this). But she does have to be disciplined (i dont mean someone disciplines her). The child is treated with utmost respect by the best people in a homely environment.   Aba before age of 15 16, Manang Mustang ghumna khasai koi jaadaina hola (only speaking for myself) After she is no longer a Kumari, she can go whereever she wants to.

A 3 year old child has no idea what she is getting into. She cannot grasp what a normal childhood is, what is right and what is wrong. The only thing she knows and does is based on her likes and dislikes, which is heavily depended upon how her parents/surrounding elders dictates.   Ani about 'No complains' from past Kumaris:   Newari culture is super sensitive. You cannot say anything against their culture. Otherwise, you'll have to face \"Tom n Jerry\" like people. I think, every ex Kumaris understands this at some point. With this much pressure along with the grooming done from a very young age, I don't think anyone dares to speak up. Which basically means none of us know what they really feel inside.    Well, of course, keeping in mind how they're thrown away once they reach a certain age or goes through ü©∏. At least, a life time opportunity to be a Kumari where they could renounce their position if they don't feel like it should be a way.   They don't preach, they don't teach, they only show up during jatras. I've never seen Kumaris actively participating in rituals or any sort of activities.

The only thing you should feel bad about is her parents who now have to be her full time care takers probably having to leave their jobs and careers and move into the kumari house with her.|||I used to extremely religious before and used to glorify ts But realising Kumari tradition is cruel was my first step towards atheism|||As a Newar, I understand the cultural side of it. But living in the US and having global exposure, I also see it as more of a pageant. If you‚Äôve seen Little Miss Sunshine, you‚Äôll get the context.||| The Living Goddess tradition of Nepal is a complex institution rooted in centuries of culture. While modern concerns about child rights are valid, the practice is governed by strict rituals and has evolved to address contemporary welfare standards. Here are the key facts:  1. The Selection is Meticulous and Considered an Honor:  ¬∑ A Kumari is chosen from the specific Shakya clan of the Newari community, a Buddhist goldsmith caste. ¬∑ The selection process is incredibly rigorous. Candidates must meet 32 strict physical perfection requirements (e.g., eye shape, voice quality, hair color) and demonstrate a fearless and serene demeanor (e.g., by not crying during a ceremony in a room of 108 ritually sacrificed animal heads). ¬∑ For the family and community, her selection is not a punishment but the highest spiritual honor.  2. The Role is Central to National Culture and Unity:  ¬∑ The Kumari is not just a religious figure but a national symbol. ¬∑ Her most important public duty is during the Indra Jatra festival, where she blesses the President of Nepal, providing divine legitimacy to the state in a ceremony that blends Hindu and Buddhist traditions. This is a key event for national identity.  3. Significant Reforms and Safeguards Have Been Implemented:  ¬∑ Education: By law, the Kumari now receives a formal education from private tutors within her residence. The government provides a monthly stipend specifically for this purpose. ¬∑ Family Presence: Contrary to isolation claims, her family (typically her mother) lives with her throughout her tenure. ¬∑ Financial Security: Upon retiring at puberty, the state grants her a lifetime pension. As of recent years, this is approximately NPR 10,000 per month (roughly $75 USD), along with a lump sum of NPR 1 million (roughly $7,500 USD) to support her transition. ¬∑ Successful Reintegration: Former Kumaris like Dr. Chanira Bajracharya, who served until 14, have publicly spoken about their positive experiences, pursued higher education, and built successful careers, demonstrating that life after the role is viable.  The Kumari tradition is a deeply embedded socio-religious institution. It is factually inaccurate to frame it simply as the \"isolation\" of a child. It is a state-sanctioned, culturally sacred role with defined rituals, significant community support, and legally mandated provisions for the girl's education, family life, and long-term financial security. The debate around it highlights the global tension between cultural preservation and evolving child rights, but the practice itself has demonstrably adapted to modern norms.|||I ain't newar but also I think aaba yesto kura chai parents haru le vhaneko ramro hami third party le vhannu vhanda pani . look if kumari ko parents le chahanu hudaina vhani tyo kumari ko candidate mai na leraunu parni ho . so parents lai kehi problem xaina , kumari le as a normal human being ni basna paunu hunxa after completion so I think we are no one to question sodhna lai|||What about the tradition of marrying off daughters into the inlaws house?|||After giving this some thought question is of a philosophical one. What freedom does a child have?  What life does a child choose? Isn‚Äôt everyone forced and fed their parent‚Äôs beliefs?   Also, can you give some evidence of abuse? If not your post would be baseless and in attempt of defamation of our culture.  One Kumari‚Äôs time ended when she was just 12. How much do you remember of your life before you were 12? I asked myself the same question and the answer is not much.   I disagree with your claim that the Kumari‚Äôs are discarded. They are always welcome. What it shows is the core principle of Buddhism that nothing is permanent. All things, even being revered as the living goddess, comes to an end. It teaches humility, an art that is now lost in this modern time.

Khaire ko documentary haru herera brainrot kura nagara na. Not everyone is privileged to become kumari and nor they are selected randomly. The family members themself have to fill the form and there's a long running selection process. Only a certain clan of newar can become Kumari. There are lots of inhuman and child abusive traditions going on all over. In case of kumari they get highest level of love and respect. They can live with their parents, they can play, they can watch TV, they can even play video games. It would be better if you watch podcasts of ex kumaris it's really helpful. I used to think same like everyone calling this inhuman before but they are living the normal life as you and me. And the fact that you can't speak up being kumari is totally false, yes you can't but only in jatras and other religious ceremonies, do you speak up during sharad and other pujas(it's prohibited to talk during sharad if you don't know). Go visit sudurpaschim hundreds of girls are being raped during their chhaupadi bas. Go visit terai Muslim villages girls at the age of 15 are getting married and at the age of 21 they are booned with 3 childs. Ex Kumaris themself enjoy being kumari and love to live their that phase again. If they are fine, their parents are fine no need to talk about that. Now the rules and prohibitions are amended.

To those insisting Kumaris are always ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù or dismissing criticism by belittling others, few things we can reflect on:   1. How much do we actually know about child psychology and development, especially at such a young age when experiences shape a lifetime? 2. Yes, a Kumari is worshipped as a goddess now but when her time ends, how does a goddess step back into an ordinary life? How do peers treat her? How does she even make friends? 3. With isolation and the constant expectation to suppress emotions, what happens to her social, communication, and interpersonal skills? Who helps her navigate that later? 4. Does she ever get space to express her own feelings and thoughts or is silence part of the job description? 5. We‚Äôve all seen videos of new Kumari, some barely three years old, literally asleep in full dress during rituals. How on earth can a toddler be burdened with divine expectations when they can barely stay awake through it? 6. As Nepalis, many of us defend dal bhat tarkari because it‚Äôs what we grew up with it feels untouchable. (I know it‚Äôs not the same but for reference) For a Kumari, this role is all she has ever known. So how would she even recognise or articulate what she‚Äôs missed out on, when she never had the chance to experience it? 7. And let‚Äôs be honest do we really believe someone put on a pedestal that high, surrounded by cultural pressure, guilt, and shame, would openly talk about the negatives of being Kumari? Yes, things have changed there‚Äôs more education, some family contact,but none of that cancels out the developmental and human rights concerns we‚Äôre talking about.  And honestly, the comments here kind of prove the point: we were never really taught to think critically. Instead of having an actual discussion, people are throwing around ‚Äúbahun,‚Äù ‚ÄúChristian,‚Äù or ‚Äúother cultures‚Äù like that somehow answers the question. When we turn conversation into belittling, blaming, or name-calling, we‚Äôre not defending culture but normalising this behaviour. I mean how hard is it understand you can agree to disagree without all these?|||Actually the closest thing that happens in the west like this is children beauty pagents  AT LEAST, at the very least, this Kumari affects one child over a years. USA child beauty pageants produce so many|||I think this is so cruelüòû a kid should not be isolated from the society, and should not be sit there to just take photo with tourists ..|||People talking about normal childhood and growing up \"normal\", a lot of misconception here.  Goodness flows through Kumari.  She is worshipped for being the medium of taleju bhawani. They are taught that they as an individual are not god, but the goodness that flows through her is what makes her worshipped.  And calling Kumari as a \"virgin goddess\" is stupid and a complete disregard of religious belief. It's a literal translation not a literary translation.   A lot of misconceptions have already been debunked.  Therefore they are able to integrate back into society well. They have good societal support . They are mentored, taught and are well taken care of. They themselves have immence respect for their religion and tradition.  If you think being a Kumari is wrong, you simply look at other practices in other religions. Nuns are not allowed to marry or consummate. Denying the right to marry and consummate can be considered as an oppressive practices denying one from their human desires. In radical Islam, burka, multiple marriages, denial of human rights for wemen.  While such petty comparisons are stupid themselves, what I want to say is we are worshipping female power. We are actually looking at females as devine. Not simply blind worship.   Nothing about today's childhood is normal.  You see young boys and girls sent off to boarding schools as normal? It's more isolating depressing. Parents just sticking their child to an iPad, or a hyperactive parent forcing their child through multiple activities (music class, sports, extra activities) even when their child may not want to to them, and pushing their child to extremes, putting their child through ridiculously high expectations, so that they can fulfill own ego( yes I've seen it happen).  A lot is not normal in so called modern normal childhood.   A lot of narratives and propogandas have infiltrated our thinking. Be water and explore into the culture. A lot has been written about Kumari from a propogandist and religious infiltration viewpoint.  A lot has been written to criticize our culture and ostracize ourselves from our religion and culture. Beware.|||Yeah agreed I thought it was just culture as a child but now I see it as different|||Sadhguru has spoken about the Kumari tradition of Nepal. It is an understanding about God making.

A case was registered in high court of Nepal but the court didn't make decision against Kumari tradition but asked to reform. There have been quiet few reforms.

            "body": "People love to throw shade at King Mahendra, calling him an authoritarian who killed democracy. But let‚Äôs be real: he‚Äôs the only king after Prithvi Narayan Shah who actually did something that mattered for the survival of Nepal.    Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus ‚Äî with nine governments in ten years. That wasn‚Äôt democracy, it was chaos. Leaders were busy stabbing each other in the back while the nation stayed dirt poor, uneducated, and vulnerable. Tell me, what ‚Äústable democracy‚Äù exists when governments collapse every year? None. Mahendra saw this and did what no one else had the guts to do: he hit reset.    Yes, he dissolved parliament. Yes, he banned parties. And you know what? He was right to. Without stability, Nepal was on track to become India‚Äôs backyard project or another pawn in the Cold War. Mahendra‚Äôs Panchayat system gave the country one thing it desperately lacked: stability.    And let‚Äôs talk achievements:    He balanced India and China like a chess master. Without him, we‚Äôd have been swallowed by one side decades ago.    He pushed Nepal onto the global stage ‚Äî Non-Aligned Movement, a stronger UN presence, and an independent foreign policy.    He jump-started modernisation: roads, schools, universities, tourism. These are things no king before him, and very few leaders after him, have been able to deliver at that scale.    But historians? They love to cry about ‚Äúdemocracy dying in 1960.‚Äù These same historians never admit that the so-called ‚Äúdemocrats‚Äù of the 50s were busy running the country into the ground. It‚Äôs easy to glorify B.P. Koirala in hindsight, but Mahendra was the one cleaning up the mess in real time.    Here‚Äôs the hard truth: Mahendra was the only king who actually acted like a king ‚Äî a protector of sovereignty. Everyone after him either coasted on his legacy or failed miserably. Without him, Nepal might not even exist as the independent state it is today.    Call him authoritarian all you want, but facts don‚Äôt lie. After Prithvi Narayan Shah, King Mahendra was the only true king Nepal ever had.",

He saved Nepal from being a puppet of foreign countries. He was a gem.|||Its not an unpopular opinion though. Those who know history know how Progressive Mahendra was. One thing though, his rapid advancements did over heat a fledgling Nepalese economy which is why we needed to privatize our industries. But the privatization was a joke,   they privatized it too quickly and privatization advocates in Nepal did admit they made a huge mistake later on.|||Mahendra is a complicated figure. On one hand, he did keep Nepal intact at a time when regional instability and internal divisions could have easily spiraled out of control.  On the other, his coup dismantled the first democratic experiment and concentrated power in the monarchy, which created long-term issues that Nepal is still untangling today.   It‚Äôs less that historians hate admitting he saved Nepal, and more that they frame it as a tradeoff between short-term stability and long-term democratic development.|||Popular opinion. It's because of Prithvi Narayan Shah and King Mahendra that modern day Nepal even exists as a separate country in its current form. Otherwise there would not have even been an independent country known as Nepal.|||His authoritarian enforcement of the Nepali language and Hindu traditions on a diverse population that wanted nothing to do with them was one of the causes of the civil war that would follow.  He killed democracy in its crib and pulled us back into medieval institutions. Even if I were to hypothetically accept that he was a good ruler for the sake of argument, there is no guarantee and his heirs and his heirs‚Äô heirs would have been good rulers, which is why absolute monarchy fails. Any good that he might have done during his reign is negated by the fact that long term institutions are more important than charismatic rulers, and he ruined the institution of democracy. All the instability that we have faced since 2008- would have happened in the 1950s and we could have been a prosperous democracy by the present. This guy pulled us decades back.  It‚Äôs easy to look back at the past with rose tinted glasses and romanticize it, that is the first step on the road to fascism, but the truth of life, prosperity and happiness is in the future and progressive institutions.|||The problem with Monarchy in Nepal and everywhere else is that there are few good apples in 1 crore ropani orchard.  Except PN Shah, Mahendra and maybe Birendra (many sources call him spineless but I don't know), no one else were fit to rule. The country fell into Ranas dictatorship  because of Monrachy system failure.  So here we are, dealing with generational political trauma.|||A quick ChatGPT will give you some real perspective:  Most historians and political analysts agree that King Mahendra‚Äôs reasons were more of a pretext to consolidate royal power rather than genuine democratic concerns. Here‚Äôs why:  1. Political instability was exaggerated  Nepal‚Äôs first elected government (1959‚Äì1960) under B. P. Koirala had been in office for only 18 months.  While there were some administrative problems, it wasn‚Äôt long enough to judge the parliamentary system a failure.  Corruption and inefficiency existed, but not at the level Mahendra claimed.   2. Fear of losing monarchical dominance  The 1959 elections gave the Nepali Congress a clear majority.  Koirala‚Äôs government was popular and gaining legitimacy, which posed a direct threat to the king‚Äôs absolute authority.  Mahendra feared the monarchy would become a ceremonial institution like in India or Britain.   3. Foreign policy pretext  Koirala pursued a relatively independent foreign policy, maintaining balance between India and China.  Mahendra accused him of endangering Nepal‚Äôs sovereignty, but in reality, the king wanted direct control over diplomacy, which was vital for aid and recognition.   4. Use of \"underdeveloped society\" argument  Mahendra claimed that Nepalese people weren‚Äôt ‚Äúready‚Äù for democracy due to illiteracy and lack of experience.  This was partly true, but instead of strengthening democratic institutions, he abolished parties and built a system where only the king‚Äôs will mattered.   5. The Panchayat system benefited him most  Under Panchayat, all political power flowed through the king.  It created the image of \"guided democracy,\" but in practice, it was royal autocracy with no accountability.   üìå Conclusion: Mahendra used the excuses of instability, corruption, and national unity to justify a royal coup. The deeper reason was to preserve absolute monarchy and prevent Nepal from transitioning into a genuine parliamentary democracy.|||Between 1951 and 1960, this country was a circus, with nine governments in ten years. That wasn‚Äôt democracy, it was chaos.  LOL. The King chose PM. He was the one responsible.|||Yes man agreed. He is the guy who defined Nepal and Nepali people. He did a lot of great works for the country. But many people and our school books consider him as a dictator telling about how he banned political parties and not mention about the reforms and development made by him for the country. One of the greatest leader of our country King Mahendra!!|||Ali history paddam, 1959 ma first election vako ho tyo vanda aagadi sab PM king le choose garya ho, 1st election ko 1.5 years ma coup vako ho.|||But his policies are disastrous for Nepal till this day  He opened Nepal's border with India, opened free trade with India, allowed India to build its Army base in Lipulekh Limpiyadhura Kalapani since then these territories are occupied by India  He also forced Khas culture on Newaris and Janjatis which influenced them to become Communists|||Agreed!|||Will not let anyone discredit the blood of 17k Nepali|||We wouldn't have been swallowed by any side. Non-alignment was the default policy from the beggining, and B.P koirala would have continued that policy. Nepal would have 'modernized' without an iron-fisted dictatorship.|||Matrika literally wanted to suck cock of india..   He was puppet of India...while BP was good...Matrika and BP's power struggle caused mahendra to step in...and take all the powers..   Thats my unpopular opinion too.|||I agree with most of your points. But your point about 10 governments in nine years doesn't show the instability created by parties but by the monarchs. The monarchs were the ones that were making them unstable. The one time it seemed to be stable, he couped the government. That doesn't diminish the fact thought, that his rule saw probably the most balanced foreign policy of Nepal, where Nepal truly stood out as a sovereign nature. I still believe that had Mahendra controlled a bit of his authoritarian ways and worked together with B.P. Koirala, Nepal would have been in a much better position that it is currently. Both of them are the best leaders Nepal had post P.N. Shah. It might be an unpopular opinion but I think P.N. Shah might be more important historically, but these two are probably the best leaders Nepal got, even better than P.N. Shah.|||Unpopular hoina, brain-dead opinion.

Ani jabo dui tukra road pitch garyo bhandai ma khusi hune??|||sovereignty? of who? Mahendra model of nation-building was \"one religion, one custom, one language.\" Hindu orthodoxy was enforced as state ideology, treating non-Hindu communities as second-class. Nepali was imposed as the only legitimate language, sidelining rich traditions like Maithili, Newar, Tharu, Tamang, Limbu, etc. This wasn't genuine unity - it was control through forced uniformity. What looked like stability was in fact suppression. That brittle foundation is why today's Nepal wrestles with federalism, ethnic assertion, and identity politics: democracy didn't invent division, it revealed what had long been silenced.  The Koiralas, born and educated in Banaras, were accused of being \"too Indian.\" But Nepal had no universities, no political freedom, no space for intellectual growth - precisely because the tyrants had closed those doors. Should they be condemned for seeking ideas in India, or credited for importing the democratic imagination Nepal lacked?  So the paradox is clear:  Mahendra centralized the state but weakened society.|||First question, why was Nepal unstable during those years? And second more important question, if stability was the most important thing for us, why did he take over from a parliament that had a 2/3 majority and the government was led by THE BP Koirala? There was a little chance that the Koirala govt would have toppled and was doing good work..  Yes, there were some long term projects under him that were very good for Nepal. There‚Äôs no denying that and kudos to him. But he was authoritarian, there is no denying that either. Let‚Äôs not over glorify someone and gloss over facts because they don‚Äôt fit our views..|||Educated boomers hate him(my boomer dad lol).|||Nepal was too small for the OG Mahendra.

Such speculation is irresponsible, especially when the facts are still unclear. These pages are so immaturely jumping to conclusions in a state where things are uncertain.|||Bipin looked fine in that released video dated November 2023.

Eleven of our sons, including Bipin Joshi, who arrived in Israel just 25 days before Hamas‚Äôs October 7, 2023, bloodbath, were brutally murdered. Four days ago, 48 hostages clung to life; now, only 20 survive. Hamas‚Äôs ‚Äújustified‚Äù slaughter, draped in twisted dogma, mocks humanity. Two years of torment, dangling hope of Bipin‚Äôs survival, only to end in his cold-blooded killing by these bloody cowards. At home, Gen Z‚Äôs September ‚Äúuprising‚Äù killed 51, including kids, burning Kathmandu, freeing 12,500 criminals to prop up corrupt elites‚Äô spoiled brats. Our nation‚Äôs credibility is trashed, a global joke. Hamas and their ilk, like Jamkash, happily point fingers at Jews and Hindus for every woe, but when it‚Äôs time to face their own kind, they scatter like roaches, spineless. Yet we let their hate-preaching ideology fester in our hills, unchecked. No more. Deport their firebrand clerics, cut off their dirty foreign cash. We must back our own against Hamas, demand international recognition to flex Nepal‚Äôs strength, resilience, and power. This must never happen again.

Every other Indian city from Delhi to Bangalore organizes Garba nights during Nauratha, and people participate regardless of their background. They just want to have fun. And honestly, this whole debate reflects how we treat culture in Nepal as well where Bahun Chhetri traditions and Nepali language are promoted as the ‚Äòreal‚Äô identity, while 100+ other languages and ethnic cultures are pushed aside.  And culture is never static. Its constantly influenced by a lot of things like art, cinema, migration, globalization, internet, exchange and influence as well. The same people who happily pay to watch Bollywood movies in movie theaters, worship actors like Salman and Shahrukh and just hoot loudly when they come on screen at theaters, and listen to, sing & dance to Hindi songs without thinking twice suddenly get offended if someone enjoys Garba.

Don‚Äôt get too attached to it.|||Just by criticizing everything doesn't make you intellectual.|||Cultures and traditions naturally spread over time, and this spread is accelerated by influence. Media is the most powerful driver of that influence, and that‚Äôs why our local culture feels as though it is being overshadowed. The problem is not that people no longer value their own culture, but that our media presence is extremely weak compared to others.  Think about how Indian culture has spread in Nepal: through movies, songs, TV serials, and now online content. (migration, political connection and cultural proximity are other factors but in this case, the primary driver is media). The same is true for Western cultures, especially American culture, which influences our everyday lives, from what we eat and wear to the way we think. The recent Garba incident may be one example, but it represents a much broader pattern: cultural identity travels and takes root primarily through media.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, since cultures have always spread, adapted, and reshaped themselves over time. (I mean we'll definitely feel good if a foreigner adopts nepali culture). But preserving one‚Äôs own culture is equally important, because it forms a core pillar of identity. And preservation in today‚Äôs world is only possible through strengthening our own media i.e. by producing movies, songs, and online content that reflect and celebrate our traditions. And they need to be good, not some low effort cash converter sold in the name of patriotism.  And just for context: Garba is not only celebrated in Gujarat, but across India. (showing spread of a culture).|||I dont really see how this would affect op or anyone else for that matter enough to create this discord. And where do you draw the line?

It's just logic.  We can enjoy and celebrate our cultural practices, examine them, and update them.    Our ancestors not only created new traditions but also stopped the ones they didn't like. We can do the same.|||It is important to think about culture and traditions critically. Eg: Sati pratha was perpetuated in the name of culture, but it IS abuse. Not everyone who criticizes traditions are westernized. That is gross oversimplification that prevents healthy discourse.   As for shivling, the whole world is obsessed with phallic structures. Not every criticism needs to be taken seriously. Think for yourself, argue against it if you believe otherwise, and modify the practices based on reasonable critiques. It really isn‚Äôt that deep.

Therefore, don't intervene into respective private cultural spaces. We can live peacefully, if we became aware of our limits as a Nepali. The notion of being Nepali is a political concept, it's not a homogenous entity. Within it, every community exist as different distinctive individual entity different from each other.  For Newar, the girl who becomes a Kumari is continuation of their identity. She is more than a child girl, a divine goddess. Therefore, as a Nepali, and a non-newari I can only respect and react from distance, without being vociferous about it in public.  Maintenance of distance should be constitutional duty of every citizen. In reddit, we can see a different caste and ethnicity taking shots at other caste ethnicity. It's better that Chettri shouldn't be inferring in Gurung's culture and lifestyle. SImilarl, Limbu shouldn't be talking and critiquing Bahuns way of doing things.

Is it because many people are parroting *Kumari* culture as \"child abuse\" in social media, just like you are parroting it as \"orchestrated online campaign\"?  I don't think it's orchestrated campaign. It's just because many people don't have their own opinion and get easily swayed by people, posts and opinions that are controversial, that can drive engagement in social media. I'm somewhat victim of that myself, in a sense that, before the \"child abuse\" posts surfaced, I hadn't really given it much thought even if I always felt similar way. Some people like me might have realized it after seeing those posts, some might just be using it as engagement bait (because they are attention whores), or some are just trolling.  >They evolve, adapt, and reform, but from within the community, not by outsiders branding them as abuse to fit their narrative.  Isn't this coming from within the community? Where else is this coming from? I really have no idea.

If we asked 100 ex-Kumaris about their experiences and whether they felt exploited or saw it as a privilege, I‚Äôm confident most would say they didn‚Äôt feel abused, contrary to what many internet activists claim.  To better understand the reality, I‚Äôll share links to interviews and articles featuring former Royal Kumaris, published by BBC and ABC.  Yes, isolating a child from her parents, friends, education, or the outside world isn‚Äôt right, but those conditions don‚Äôt exist in the Kumari house as critics portray.   The tradition has evolved significantly. Kumaris can regularly meet their parents, who often care for them, receive personal tutoring for education, play outside with friends, and enjoy movies like other children.   And after retiring as a Kumari, she will be 100 per cent normal Nepali girl who is free to do anything and she'll get a monthly pension of Rs 16k for the rest of her life. (as per 2019 article)  So, don‚Äôt let disconnected keyboard warriors, who are influenced by Western lifestyles and detached from our cultural roots, misrepresent our beautiful tradition as a story of abuse or exploitation.

The respect and reverence given to the Kumari is not only religious but also a reflection of Nepal‚Äôs rich history and traditions. These people just find way to get away from traditions.

Shes married and working now. I don't see anything wrong with the tradition as it exists. In the past there were some issues about schooling and prejudice against marrying exKumari but there have been lots of reforms and cultural mindset changes now, led by exKumaris themselves. If you don't believe in Kumari or are an atheist, noone is forcing you to visit her or seek blessing.

In reality, Kumaris receive personal tutoring, maintain regular parental contact (daily visits), and enjoy activities like playing outside and watching movies. This setup is often compared by defenders to a modern, high-standard boarding school experience, not harmful captivity. \\[2\\]\\[3\\]\\[7\\]  Lifelong Financial and Educational Support: Critics claim the girls are \"abandoned\" after their tenure ends at puberty. This is demonstrably false. Upon retirement, former Kumaris receive a substantial monthly pension and educational scholarships from the government, ensuring their successful reintegration and personal development as regular Nepali citizens. \\[6\\]\\[4\\]\\[5\\]\\[8\\]  The Voices of Former Kumaris: Structured interviews and public testimonials from ex-Kumaris and their families show that the vast majority view the tradition as a privilege and a source of cultural pride, not abuse or trauma. They have actively and publicly refuted Western stereotypes about mental strain or deprivation, emphasizing their positive experiences and agency. \\[9\\]\\[3\\]\\[5\\]  Modern Safeguards and Evolution: The tradition is not static. It has evolved significantly to include increased government oversight, modern educational facilities, and legal provisions for the girls' welfare. This illustrates the community's commitment to protecting the Kumaris and balancing ancient spiritual significance with contemporary child welfare values. \\[5\\]\\[10\\]\\[4\\]  The Kumari tradition is seen by its community as the veneration of feminine power and an integral part of Nepal's spiritual and social cohesion. To dismiss it as \"superstition\" while normalizing practices like sending children to high-end Western boarding schools highlights a clear double standard in criticism. The factual evidence, supported by Nepali citizens and former goddesses, establishes that the Kumari tradition is a source of cultural pride and empowerment, not the exploitation depicted by disconnected critics.|||The thing is people think it‚Äôs either right or wrong ; why not keep the perspective open.|||You are forcing a minor to give up the most magical years of her life for something that she has no choice over.

And after retiring as a Kumari, she will be 100 per cent normal Nepali girl who is free to do anything‚Äù When you are isolated from the things that kids do at their age, you are anything but ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.

Feeling privileged and living in a bubble does exactly the opposite.|||Khasma kura ta, yeti sano umer mai yesto garnu baccha ko adhikar ra mental, physical growth ko kura ma ho.

If you don't like it, be silent. Live respectfully separately. Peacefully.|||when someone grows up fully immersed in a tradition, they often won‚Äôt criticize it because it‚Äôs tied to their identity and sense of pride. That doesn‚Äôt make their perspective wrong, but it also doesn‚Äôt mean the practice has no problems.  For example, if you ask people who grew up in strict boarding schools, many will say it made them disciplined and strong, while others will point out the trauma from isolation and harsh rules. Both experiences are valid, but focusing only on the positive voices gives a one-sided picture.  The same goes for the Kumari tradition. Former Kumaris may genuinely feel privileged and respected, but that doesn‚Äôt erase the fact that historically there were strict restrictions and isolation from normal childhood experiences. Even if those conditions have improved today, that improvement only came because people did question the system.|||This was much needed! Thank you!|||BS, this pratha is blatant child abuse no matter what you try to mask it with.

While this practice is often intended to empower women and show care, it sometimes creates disadvantages for men. Boys may feel less valued within their own families and relatives, even though they equally participate in the festival. Such an imbalance can lower their motivation and sense of fairness. Moreover, when society continuously highlights female support but overlooks the needs of men, it can lead to hidden pressures on them to be financially strong without receiving similar encouragement. True equality means treating both genders with fairness and respect. Instead of giving preference to only one side, families and communities should promote balance so that both men and women feel equally appreciated during festivals like Dashain. üò≠üò≠2500|||0|||-200 Lina ra Dina break even hunxa Vanya thiye üò≠|||[deleted]|||7280|||Total 10k from 3 individuals.|||2nd year in a row in jutho.

Because there was no one to guide me, i failed this year's neb board.   so from someone who learned from his own experience, my best advice is that you don't depend only on teachers from your school. there are tons of videos on youtube and tons of notes and  straight up answers in the internet.   if you do not understand and get anything at all, then only focus on the questions that are asked many times or repeated i.e only imp questions.   you have to make sure that you atleast passing marks, so look focus on the chapters you understand and master them first then only focus on others.   You **WILL NOT** understand anything if you try to learn everything. Trust me, i have suffered.  Also, from my own experience, if you were forced to take science then leave it. you will spare yourself from that tension and depression if fail.   your interest in webdev ? you can find various free courses on the internet to learn that independently own your own. there are MANY places / sites that can teach you for free. as i am trying to learn it myself.",

            "body": "If you can be genuine, go through it. Or else you are free to scroll.    I recently passed my high-school. I got an A+. And i was supposed to prepare for the CEE exam.  I was living in a hostel. Everything was going well. But tbh i never really give enough time for preparation. I feel like i am lost somewhere. Well, i am not depressed or upset, but i am just really curious if i am going through this alone.    My parents (my dad) wanted me to do MBBS, but deep down, i felt like BDS was more of my thing. I didn't really prepare well for the exam, and i don't have any hope of getting a scholarship seat. I believe my parents are very supportive, but i also know that my dad is going to get a little upset after seeing my marks in the coming CEE. I was getting in the range of 60 during my mock, and it's been a long time since i stopped giving those too.   Currently, i am in such a weird phase of life. I feel happy and relaxed. All i do is scroll, lay on bed, eat, and just chill. I was a little concerned about my screen time in the past few days. It's tremendously high. It's probably somewhere around 10 hours. I was trying to learn spanish, and i am getting better at it.  My daily routine is ; waking around 7: 30 in the morning, using the phone till 8 and 8:30 have breakfast. And then phone and then khana and phone and khaja and phone and sleeo and khana and phone and sleep. I am just doom scrolling. I get sick of myself sometimes, and my eyes start to hurt. I feel alone, and i tried talking to random strangers online, but all creeps and freeks only. I can‚Äôt get out of my room either because i pretend as if i am studying when i am actually just there doing nothing. My mom knows that i am just there laying, but my dad assumes that i am studying.    I am thinking of taking a drop year. I have fully prepared myself for a drop so that i can get a scholarship in BDS. please don't come after me saying, \" aaile padhenah vane drop pani waste ho \" . I am confident in myself that i will secure a seat in my drop year. I am so sure about taking drop that i can't really imagine myself going into college and this and that.   I am just so non directional at this point. Am i doing something wrong? Am i missing something. If anyone can relate or be through it, can you give any sort of advice ?",

Mero first term aaudai cha, I tried to go through a few YouTube channels, some of them are alright but I already struggle with maths & physics so it's pretty difficult to understand *everything* I'd appreciate it if anyone could suggest any channels (or alternative platforms) which are good.

            "comments": "my suggestion would be that stop expecting everything from teachers in 11 and 12 and figure out what way of study suits you the best because if you are reliant on your teachers for every study resources then you'll get in trouble in bachelors or forward because here teachers  dont even give a shit if there sound is audible let alone good lectures i left relying on teachers in my 11 12 days because all of our clz teachers were shit and had to self study every chapter. if you are in 11 theres a high chance that you are yet to figure out your true study method. for me reading book line by line worked the best and i reckon this is the most optimal way to study as it not only helps you cover everything on your sylbs but also prepares you for high intensity study environment which is very essential for higher level studies..and if you're not understanding mechanics then there's a high chance that you're not willing to learn mechanics because it is the portion of  physics where you can follow everything intuitively and is most interesting one so try to learn it conceptually relating it to real life stuffs. as for yt channel ig physics wallah will be good but there will be a lot of things which are not in our course.. however you can try and learn yourself by reading books and if you dont understand any sentence then you can use chat gpt to crack it down ..and a free tip., understand derivations very effectively like every line and term, why and how they are there because if you do so you'll be able to solve every numerical, and also solve as much mcqs and numericals as you can|||Royera|||do past papers|||Hello u/Swiss_16, thank you for contributing to r/NepalPlusTwo.
