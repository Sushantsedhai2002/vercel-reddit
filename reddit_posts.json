            "body": "Hi everyone, I have no other means of support left so I’m reaching out here with humility.  On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.  He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.  I (21M) and my sibling (15F) are taking care of our parents during the day and our cousins help at night. Because of this, we’ve missed months of classes but we don’t really have a choice right now.  If anyone is able to help even a small amount, it would mean a lot to us.  I’ve verified the case with two of the mods and I’ll be posting medical reports in the comments as well.  Please DM or comment if you can help in any way. Even sharing this post would really help.",

            "body": "Over the past few months, something quietly serious has been unfolding. The US, China, and India—three powers with very different interests in Nepal—have all recalled their ambassadors . For Nepal, this isn’t routine diplomacy. It’s a pause, a recalibration, and possibly a signal that things at home look unstable.  Nepal’s geopolitical position makes every internal crack visible from the outside. India looks at security and influence, China is sensitive about Tibet and connectivity, and the US views Nepal through its Indo-Pacific strategy. When all three adjust their diplomatic posture at once, it usually means they’re watching carefully rather than leaning in.  Domestically, the picture isn’t reassuring either. The Gen-Z protests exposed something deeper than a single grievance: a generation that has lost patience with recycled leadership, endless coalition politics, and promises that never materialize. That protest didn’t resolve anything—it simply ran out of steam. The conditions that created it are still very much alive.  This is why talk of a second, larger protest is gaining traction. This time, anger isn’t limited to students or social media circles. If another movement erupts, it may be wider, rougher, and less predictable.  What’s more striking is a conversation that would have sounded absurd a few years ago: the return of throne. This doesn’t mean people are suddenly royalists. It means confidence in the current political system is eroding so badly that even discarded alternatives are being reconsidered. When citizens start saying “at least there was stability then,” it’s not nostalgia—it’s a real frustration.  From an international perspective, all of this raises red flags. Foreign powers prefer stability, not constant street politics or regime-level uncertainty. That likely explains why major players seem to be stepping back diplomatically, waiting to see whether Nepal stabilizes or slides further into unrest.  Can Nepal correct itself?  What’s your take?   Are we heading toward another mass protest—or even a system-level shakeup—or is this just online noise amplified by uncertainty?",

            "body": "We know it's going to be a hot topic heading into election. Leaders like Harka are already using it as a political tool to defame his oppositions and promoting their ultra-nationalist image.  MCC compact is already signed and implemented by Nepal's parliament in 2022. All major communist parties and Congress voted in favor of this deal.   I think it's US's counter against China's BRI initiative to maintain American influence in this region through economic partnership and reduce growing Chinese influence here.   There's no clause in MCC which allows US to deploy their military in Nepal at any time. This is just the propaganda spread by some communists. There are no examples where the implementation of MCC has causally led to the US deploying military forces in the recipient country. MCC is designed as a civilian aid program.  Works has already started in transmission lines and road projects here in Nepal.  What are your thoughts on this compact?",

US le yesai aayera deko haina. We went and asked for it back in 2011.    The confusion around it is mainly due to some false narrative spread by Communist parties even though they were the one approving the earlier files related to MCC since 2011.    Clearly the Communists here wanted to gain sympathy from public and spoke against MCC and created controversy.    It's pretty funny how it got approved from the parliament.    NC was in full support both when they were in opposition and leading the government. and Deuba played the good role is passing it then last moment.      Maoist and Madhav Nepal's party being in government led by Deuba had no choice to accept after Deuba threaten to throw them out of government and they had their gathabanthan thing going for 2079 election.    Funny thing was Prachanda was using his cadre outside parliament to protest when he had agreed for MCC in parliament.   UML was protesting in parliament that day for some other issue (their cadre in local level promoted it being against MCC). Bhim Rawal (was in UML then) had fiery exchanges with G. Thapa that day. But Oli held press conference after few days and accepted that MCC is good.  Oli's government was the one that registered the MCC's issue to be discussed in parliament.   Probably China was using some of their journalist in paycheck to oppose the MCC. German's ambassador back then said this:    [European diplomat faults China for spreading fake news against MCC in Nepal « Nepal Live Today](https://www.nepallivetoday.com/2022/12/03/european-diplomat-faults-china-for-spreading-fake-news-against-mcc-in-nepal/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)     And you know what I personally like about MCC? You can read every single clause and policy around it unlike any  Chinese deals in Nepal. (for example I haven't yet got any solid paper on China's loan to build Pokhara Airport)",

Do I need a DB to store this data? would I need a persistence? can this action be asynchronous?\" questions like this will give you a lot of clarity even before writing a line of code.

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

Most of the teachers in school and college all of the are pedophiles.|||I'm not aware of the definition - is it like somebody who's grooming girls under 18? Are you using the term loosely?  It's an individual-thing and not a profession-thing. Girls sending DMs to get referred (when they have no skills) is also more common than you think. I get many DMs asking for free help (refactors)/ referrals (barely know them/ barely seen their code) and I just ignore them. I help many people (m/f) on a daily basis, and I've never met most of them. I know many of my 'male' senior friends (no female senior dev friends) do the same.  You should clear your exams first. Last bullet point sounds like a good plan.  Most people here will be happy to review 1-2 projects for free. I'll jump in if it's Python/ Next.js/ ML. Just post your github repo on some relevant community and they'll do free reviews.   Edit: I dont do free mentorships, happy to review repos/ coding practices.|||I get what you r saying but the term pedo applies to people who r way older and trying to groom n trap minors (under 18). The person u r referring r called blackmailers or gooners (in current terms i think)|||In my experience, Girls seem to help girl only when they are on some “female tech organization” and it’s rarely a technical mentorship. They should be helpful without such aids too. I am sorry that you had to deal with these. that’s extremely disgusting.  Still there are bunch of female led tech groups - they have ties with it company - approach them.|||Other side - back in Nepal I used to work for a compant that paid well and had better reputation. A young girl in her early 20s reached out to me for a referall for associate engineer. I hesitated a bit seeing her technical knowledge. She offered sex plus 1 months of her salary if I referred and she got hired. Was a weird encounter. I am still not sure if she qas serious or not. But I immediately got off connection.|||Dark side is on both side ! If male posted this not a single person would have asked i have connection i can refer vanera !! Sorry you had to go through that.

I left my job after a year because of a toxic culture. I swear, I couldn't find a position (I was even applying for internships) at any tech company in Kathmandu. I thought it wouldn't be that difficult since I have decent projects and a year of experience, but I remain jobless for next three months. It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||you don't add coworkers on your insta unless you're really close. There are numerous reasons.

This is not and isn't supposed to be any sort of personal or accusational message to anyone, just a humble feedback with due consideration to the nature of the subreddit and reddit as whole.  Pahilo, What post stays should be defined.   My suggestion is to discard absolutely low tier low effort post like ig tiktok and reel ss unless they're of unique nature to avoid a boring feed. I mean general question should be allowed like typical address, location, how to file return, my neighbor doesn't pickup his dog poo, I am tired from work, padna manlaunna etc etc you get it. It also includes those My gf/bf doesn't love react my story, gm/gn texts etc etc  too, you get it.  Second is on the topic of serious or sensitive matter like feminism, patriarchy, social problems and all. Post with good enough body text as opinion of the OP should be made mandatory, tyo 1 liner title garne haru kamm kaaj buddhi chaina, feed wahighat matra huncha plus it creates unnecessary & misunderstanding led arguments and debates. It was fun but now it's boring as hell. Okay like make a post calling out whatever you like but avoid to title it horrendously & ultra vaguely and insensitive as to deem you as jackass. This rule will make the discussion fair and not hinder freedom of speech either, freedom of speech doesn't recommend being stupid, insensitive and jackass.  Third is to totally not allowing use of swears in TITLE, do whatever in body text just don't be Hitler. Ani typical swears like sale, gadha, yk, murdar etc other than those of heinous or demeaning nature should be allowed. Like come on these are needed to make funny and snarky comments. A little bit of fun, considering majority of the sub is of goofy, unsrs, causal nature: casual 'off words' should be let it be 😭  Fourth, Strong moderation of Serious and help flair. I see people using it as shitpost alternative. These two flair should be limited to very very serious matter. Unnecessary use will make people less sensitive to these flair, leading to increased ignorance and loss of that feeling i describe as 'alertness factor' like the feeling or alertness you get when you hear a ambulance siren. Punishment too, ipso facto, Immediate 2 day ban.  Fifth, more mods, in a way atleast one is active at all timestamp of the day. Should be of neutral nature for objectivity, or someone that isn't too deep into his position in compass, is capable of gauging both side appropriately, keep the bias (of any kind) aside when in the role or position or to exercise as moderator.  Six, to create a kinda fashion for post, making people used to the rules of sub without being a dickhead like r/nipples, in short consistency.  Seven, for any international or nationwide event, no post other than those that are well written in a manner it's seems the writer actually knows what he/she/rest is speaking, isn't generic repetitive mess like just typing the event title and saying thing like 'that is good/bad' yeahhh this gotta go. Rest of those just rewriting the title without anything strong or aren't well opinionated should be discarded too. No more of the spams. It doesn't have to be accurate or u being a Martin Luther King to get posted. Just put effort in your opinion or thing you want to say. It's much more fun to engage in such post. This will be crucial to construct the subject mention in point six.  While I respect the mods, moderation and the growth this sub saw, We're a quite the big boy sub yet the state of is little disorganized and inconsistent by moderation & feed standards, the above mention QOL changes should be enforced. In coming months or so people and users will adapt. And for the way it is written was intented and to make it little off to ensure it feels little entertaining for regular viewers.

When I used to post in r/Nepal, where flairs are mandatory, I was usually torn between which flair to choose as sometimes what you want to post does not fit into a specific category. For example, I want to post about a news, but I also want a discussion but the news is related to politics, which flair should I choose? Politics? News? Discussion? I had to try to guess which flair mods would have least problem with and would be less likely to delete my post. This was hard.

To stand eye to eye, shoulder to shoulder despite the horrors they faced out of divisive cruelty by a select few elites with out-of-touch values.

On Aug 12, both of my parents were in a serious accident and together broke around five bones. It has been more than 140 days, and they were slowly recovering and had just started walking again. But while staying in the hospital, things got worse. My dad got pneumonia and later the doctors said he also has kidney problems.   He has already gone through 13 dialysis sessions. His potassium level which was once very high (around 7) is now normal but his creatinine level (currently 533) keeps going up again after dropping for only a day or two. Now the doctors think the real issue might be with his heart and not just his kidneys, and that’s really scary for us.  We’ve already spent over NPR 14,53,000 in the past 140+ days and we’re completely out of money now. The driver who caused the accident hasn’t paid for even the orthopedic surgery yet. He said he wants to go through the legal process but because of the genz andolon everything has been delayed for a long time.  We also used the kathmandu mahanagar support but it doesn’t cover many things and can’t help us anymore.  I (21M) and my sibling (15F) are taking care of our parents during the day and our cousins help at night. Because of this, we’ve missed months of classes but we don’t really have a choice right now.  If anyone is able to help even a small amount, it would mean a lot to us.   I’ve verified the documents with one of the mods and I’ll be posting some of them in the comments as well.

            "body": "This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

What would you do if your brother or sister were killed in that protest ?  Did you forget those videos of kids being shot??   And I hate this logic of that much destruction and all.  Do not ever compare human life against any short of building.   Building can be recreated or rebuilt. Can you recreate those innocent lives ?? Precedent has to be set that if you ever kill innocent people, consequences are inevitable.   And hate to see people preaching about businesses and job like they care.

These businesses have been involved in tax evasion, quid pro quo, illegal construction, land grab scams, corruption, and lord knows what else. I actually feel really sad that our public properties and institutions got torched along with millions of documents. Whatever happened shouldn't have happened. It was very unfortunate. But let's not sympathize with these cronies and corrupt politicians. For decades, the real victims have been the everyday citizens of our country.

We have been screwed over by these politicians and their business counterparts for so long that on that day, the entire country became a rage room.

And these were live ammunitions... videos of cops giving the middle finger after shooting and terrorising the shops till 9-10 o'clock at night  were circulating .. What happened on September 9th was a reaction to that. Yes heavy damages were done and many anarchists got the chance to create chaos on September 9th.. but only an idiot would compare this event which was completely reactionary .. to the on going protests and acts of violence going on in Bangladesh in the name of religion without any proof .. these acts of violence in Bangladesh is not reactionary .

            "body": "It’s 2026 now, and we’re still having to deal with this.  A few days ago, early in the morning, I was on the street and saw a public bus with people literally hanging from the door. It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

This problem needs to be adressed and public transportation should be well organized and planned.|||Finally, someone spoke about this. This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this. This issue really needs more attention and more noise.|||KTM has enough budget with 40 percent going unused. these transportation comes under metropolitan ko authority. ask Mayor balen.

Economy should be of utmost priority. Unrealistic speeches for public attention should be stopped from very beginning. Private sector should be let to invest and create jobs, while government regulates effectively.  Also, they should be very wise while speaking about international relations.

But what I don't understand is why RSP needed to have this agreement? RSP is capable of getting good election result and Rabi is well loved by people so he is as strong a candidate for PM as Balen. I smell something fishy! Balen basically built the current government with his man as Home Minister. There is a good chance Rabi was given a way out of prision for agreeing to this bullshit arrangement.

This is the same for food. etc. You won't need to worry about safety at all in Nepal, it's much safer than anywhere in the west, but you will have to be careful about everyone seeing you as a walking wallet which can be tough but you learn pretty fast. In my opinion the quality of life far exceeds the life in the west, but the learning curve for everything is VERY steep!

Social life: People are very approachable if you are a foreigner. You will easily meet fellow europeans, americans etc too who work in international organisations.

Apply for remote jobs that pay in USD. Build skills that can be exported. Network aggressively. Be uncomfortable. Opportunities rarely come through formal paths in Nepal, but they do come if you knock hard enough.  People in my friend circle have achieved even more than I have, and I see this trend growing. More young people are figuring out how to combine remote income, local investments, and multiple side bets.  If things go right, building a 5 crore corpus while maintaining strong cash flow is not unrealistic. I am not saying 5 crore is some magical number, but starting from nothing and reaching that level in Nepal gives you freedom. Tespaxi i think its more of a choice if you want to work specifically for money or not. Hunata sabko afno life ra dream hunxa  Yes, it is not easy. And yes, people will say this only applies to tech. I disagree. Any field with a solid global market works. Nepal has an advantage: relatively cheap labor and living costs.

I am not trying to promote any specific skill or industry. I was bit happy today hence shared this, take it as motivation or feel free to DM/ask me about anything specific if you think that can help. I posted this etikai.     Edit 2 - Maybe this all thing will be more relavant if you are from tech background. Because that helps to get USD earning which can be invested in Nepal better.

You can rent a really nice house in Lalitpur and hire 2 maids for help around the house. That'll cost you like 100-200k per month   But there are other things you need to consider if you decide to permanently move to Nepal.  How will you keep yourself busy? You barely have a social network if you've been living away for so long. You'll come across many people and groups who are after your money. They'll befriend you until you keep giving them what they want. And you'll actually need some of them for networking, helping you with govt bureaucracy/corruption things.  Air quality is one of the worst in the world especially in cities like Kathmandu and Pokhara. Your medical costs may increase and insurance is a scam. But I guess you probably know more about it since you've lived in the US.  Driving is hectic and stressful so get a driver for Rs 25-40k a month who can also help around.

Having own vehicle helps a lot.|||If you’re planning a retired life, I wouldn’t really recommend settling in Kathmandu itself. The city is busy, noisy, and getting more congested every year. A better option would be to live slightly outside the city in a quieter area that’s still easily accessible for hospitals, markets, and the airport.  If you enjoy nature and scenery, areas around Pokhara are great. Beautiful views, a slower pace of life, and a good expat and tourist-friendly environment. Another option is the Terai region, especially if you like the idea of growing your own vegetables and fruits. Renting a house with some land for small-scale farming can be very rewarding, and you could even keep a few chickens or goats.  That said, if you still want to be close to Kathmandu, places on the outskirts like Budhanilkantha, Godavari, Bhaktapur or Kirtipur can offer a good balance between city access and a calmer lifestyle. Wherever you choose, just make sure healthcare access, road connectivity, and daily essentials are within reasonable distance.

Cost breakdown could look something like this  Rent - Rs. 40,000 for a flat.

If so, a high class Nepali standard school would probably be around 30,000 per kid  Misc (transport, eat out etc) - 20,000  Total - 162k say 170k per month (assuming 2 kids education).

There is plenty of night life there near lakeside. I live in abroad and my plan is similar, to move back home. My home is in kathmandu, my parents migrated from pokhara.|||Hey man,  Same situation, you’ll have PLENTY of money and live a very very lux lifestyle with how much you make per month.   The biggest thing you need to realize is 1. Your access to everything drops significantly. If youre my size (5’11 205) you will have a hard time finding clothes and shoes. 2. The pollution here is beyond rough. Most days are in the hazardous levels. 3.  No beef (there are some places but its not very good) 4. Lalitpur is amazing, we live in thecho and there is no crime in our area. We have AC in the bedroom and a solar water heater for the full house.   Good luck and i hope you enjoy living here!|||At 620000 NRS per month, you should be able to leave a pretty luxurious life. You can but will struggle to spend that much unless you are going after all the highest of high end stuff.   Lalitpur is relatively calmer, quieter than some Ktm city centres and should be as good as anywhere else. I've seen a lot of high rises with apartments very similar to American / European ones in Sanepa area but not been there in a couple years.  I suggest one or both of you to learn to drive in Nepal. Assuming you both have a US driving license, it may take a few months to get used to the Nepali driving style, but it's totally worth it. Then you can get vehicles of your own because public transport sucks.  AC and hot water should be easy enough to get installed. If you are not bound to Ktm, I suggest you get a farm house in the outskirts / small hilly towns (dhulikhel, dhading, etc.) to escape ktm heat and pollution.  Keep your finances private, DO NOT fall into guilt trap and lend money. Do not tell how much money you have, not even those you consider close. Make sure your wife is able to handle the bureaucratic stuff because you may get taken advantage of (you'll learn as you go along). Make sure you know what the local rates for stuff are. No tipping in general, round up to next 100/500 if you're feeling generous but not as much as in the US. Do not trust the water, even the bottled ones outside, especially at first. Life is relatively slow and everything takes a lot of time and patience, especially paperwork, and bureaucracy. Invest your money in US as much as possible. Only keep a comfortable amount in Nepal. NRS deflation against dollars is crazy. Be careful during night time, crimes are not that high but still vigilance is warranted. Beware of the street dogs.  Hope you have a pleasant life in Nepal. Good luck and keep us posted.|||That’s awesome man. I think $4k/mo is plenty to live off. I haven’t been back in a while and others can correct me but basically beside rent and food and a bit of misc expenses there really isn’t anything else. No insurance. No taxes if you rent and don’t work (foreign income). So if I were in your shoes I’d save an outright 50% in a bank account giving like 6% interest and splurge the rest.   Nepal, and especially Kathmandu, is like anywhere else on the planet. You could live frugally and save a load of money or be high flying in elite circles that will have you broke just supporting your lifestyle.    Cheers man. You living the dream a lot of us dream of lol. Good stable income awesome Nepali life.|||Join some expat groups when you come (WhatsApp/FaceBook) so you can ask where to find things you miss from home. If you have any questions from an American living in Nepal perspective feel free to DM me. Good luck. 👍|||Your monthly retirement pay might be enough for sufficient lifestyle in lalitpur  , night life in lalitpur is not big as in thamel and is mostly surrounded by temples , buying house in lalitpur might be expensive but living in rent there might be frugal , i dont know much about house prices here and about transport , it is easily accessible|||this is decent for a good life here!|||I advise you to stay outside the valley, where there is good road access to Kathmandu, and it is quicker. Your retirement can leave a very good life in Nepal. Choose a good location where you get fresh air, which is impossible in Kathmandu valley|||With that much money you could di lot of things here ! Start a animal husbandry to retire.|||[removed]|||You wont need air conditioning (as an American who lives north of Canada) but I do recommend you look at somewhere like Pokhara due to the air pollution. I do really like Kathmandu but having spent a lot of time there its my one place in Nepal where I wont stay for long periods of time.|||620k you’ll live lavish lol dont worry|||Just curious. What leads to retirement pay like that ? 401 v|||Thats more than my yearly salary.     Try to get home in jhamsikhel/dhobighat, Lalitpur. Its best for your requirements.|||6.2lakh per month is enough for a family to live in luxury here.  So, I think you can retire here easily.|||Since you are retiring, I assume you do not have kids to take care of. Given that, 600k a month is more than enough in Nepal. To give some context, a friend of mine retired in Nepal, his 4 servants and full time driver together costs him 125k a month.|||620k/mnth will give you a royal life|||Is there any specific reason to be at Kathmandu otherwise I would suggest Chitwan, Bharatpur!|||620k is enough to live like a king. lalitpur is the safest. I have always felt super safe in Nepal. never taken any precaution. walked at midnight. got home super late. only needed to worried about stray dogs lol. again I am a fairly tall nepalj guy so my experience might not be typical but overall its very safe.|||[removed]|||150k-200k is more than enough to live a good life anywhere in nepal for a family of 3.  buy a second hand car if you got kids, or buy a bike if its only you two and transportation is sorted too.|||Its equivalent to earning 20k-25k a month in US  You can hire maids, travel to places, afford finest things that Nepal has to offer. And still be able to save big chunk.  So idk man|||Yeah just don't   If you wanna enjoy retirement, don't   Best thing you could do is change your mind|||Too polluted|||Lalitpur will drain you fast. Expensive and tight the money is good and should last you life time if spent properly.  You should consider staying in Raniban Kathmandu its safe and has a good expat community its clean fresh air and relatively cheap.  Rent for first 3 month and consider buying a house. Realestae in kathmandu is the safest investment. You could sell it with ease if needed.|||Money wise you are good. That is surplus money for living a decent life in Nepal. You might need to consider reinvesting surplus back in the US or invest here in Nepal to multiply further.  But major thing is what will you be doing here in Nepal? You can try to utilize your US skill here to engage and help Nepal and Nepali people.|||From a financial perspective,  you are quite well settled.  Lalitapur, good choice. For your budget I would prefer somewhere around the sanepa, jhamsikhel area, there are many embassy and other high profile residents so you won't get bad company, and live a lifestyle you want  From a social point of view. Since you mentioned retirement era, you could learn Nepali if you want which is optional btw   To make a retirement life. There are plenty of groups organizing hikes, trek and events, you along with your wife would join and enjoy the retirement life. Until you feel comfortable on your own.  Mostly, we Nepalese are kind towards foreigners, so you mostly should receive good hospitality. (Few exceptions could be anywhere )  Lastly, Welcome to Nepal. Hope you enjoy it here !!|||Its better to stay there|||If anyone around Balkumari/Lalitpur wants to play badminton casually, I’m looking to form a small group. DM me",

            "body": "Ever since Balen became the mayor of Kathmandu, he has almost completely stopped giving interviews. Before the election, if you remember, he was everywhere. He gave interviews to newspapers, radio, television, and YouTube channels. I even saw him on YouTube channels with very few subscribers. He was deeply invested in PR back then, going everywhere to make his presence felt. He also visited different local areas regularly, and the media coverage at the time was all about Balen.  During those interviews, I clearly remember him saying that he would not be like Bidhya Sundar Shakya, who stayed silent and did not connect with the public. He promised that he would stay connected with people and communicate openly.  But ever since he became mayor, he has practically stopped talking to the press. He has not held proper press conferences or given interviews. Later, there was talk about KMC starting its own TV channel and a program called Public with the Mayo*r*, where citizens could directly connect with him and have their concerns addressed. I believe budget was even allocated for this. But that never happened.  Since then, he has not really answered questions from the press or the public. The same person who promised constant communication has not given a single proper interview during his tenure.  Now, to be clear, I am a supporter of Balen. I do not know why people get offended and start shouting Jhole whenever this topic comes up. Supporting someone does not mean blindly agreeing with everything they do. Criticism is necessary.  When it comes to accountability, facing the media, and answering questions from the public, I honestly give him negative marks. In many other areas, he has done well. But in this aspect, he has done poorly.  Now that he is being considered as a prime ministerial candidate, reportedly by RSP, things become serious. He will have to face the public and the press again. After years of silence, it will be interesting to see how he handles it. What narrative will he push? How will he answer difficult questions?  From what we are hearing, he already has a PR team lined up. But this time, it will not be easy. He will be asked tough questions, and I think his disappearance from public communication after taking office will come up repeatedly.  The election is right around the corner. There are barely around sixty days left. So let’s see how he handles PR this time, how he answers the press, and how he presents himself to the public again.  Let’s see how it goes.",

Let's see how it goes.|||before mayoral elections he faced media , but after winning he disappeared. who says that won't repeat if he becomes PM?|||After this agreement with Rabi I could dream better future for us…Oh God please khi gara|||From a PR perspective, him not engaging with the media is a huge plus while bringing some drawbacks. A balance has to be established!  If we analyze an average Nepali media consumer, you have seen him appear in the headlines either positive or negative - mostly later. The negatives are what's highlighted in the media because that is what people are interested in, that is what people look for - in a way it's how most people are wired. We focus on the negatives, and over look the positives because psychologically we place ourselves above them; we like the feeling of being morally superior to them - mainly people in power like Balen Shah. (If you're thinking how is this relevant, please continue reading) Thus, when you watch it from a PR perspective, it makes sense and justifies why Balen opted not to voluntarily appear in interviews.  BUT HE IS A POLITICAL CANDIDATE RUNNING A STATE/COUNTRY, HE SHOULD ANSWER THE PEOPLE WHO MADE HIM THE ONE IN POWER!! - well yes and no. It depends on what you're trying to get from him, if you want to hyperfixate on the mistakes he makes and villanize them (objectively he isn't answerable to you) if you are looking for genuine answers and willing to give him constructive criticism + a genuine feedback (yes, he is VERY answerable) Now, the problem lies in this YES: how do you determine the difference? And that is what Balen needs to learn!  He has to learn the perfect balance where he is answering the people genuinely concerned and who care about the country and filter out the voices who want him to fall. He has to STOP being a keyboard warrior (for the lack of a better term) and face the mass.  We need to stop politician's idolatry! THEY ARE HUMANS, THEY MAKE MISTAKES... the IMPORTANT part is what they do after they've made a mistake!  Finally, I hope our country heals. I hope my people choose what's best for our country and NEPAL prospers...",

Why would the Prime Minister resign just because of this, right?  At first, I thought this would be a hunger strike for a couple of days, but it has been eight days now. I was reading the news today, and it says his condition is getting serious. He sleeps on the streets of Maitighar. There is also another guy with him, I think he is also on a hunger strike, but the media mostly talks only about him, so I have no idea about the other guy.  I saw a post that said his condition could get worse and that it might affect his kidneys and overall health. So what exactly is he trying to achieve here? There is no way his demands are going to be fulfilled. The only thing the government can realistically assure is that elections will happen, but now he is against elections as well.  So what does he actually want? Does he expect the government to suddenly say, “Okay, we cancel everything because you are on a hunger strike”? I genuinely don’t understand.  What happens if his condition worsens and he faints? They will obviously take him to the hospital, right? And once he is hospitalized, won’t his hunger strike automatically end because he will be given treatment and food?  Can someone please explain what usually happens in situations like this?

Treacherous she was, Anck-Su-Namun didn't bother to build a good image upon Nefertiri who harbored misgivings toward her and began an affair with Imhotep, the High Priest of Osiris, which was forbidden because no other man was allowed to touch her.  Having foreseen that Seti I would discover their forbidden love, Imhotep and Anck-Su-Namun conspired to kill the Pharaoh. The two then killed Seti I and when Seti's bodyguards the Medjai rushed in to aid the pharaoh on Nefertiri's orders, Anck-Su-Namun convinced Imhotep to flee from the scene as she committed suicide in a bid to distract the guards, trusting his powers as the high priest of Osiris where he would resurect her.  Imhotep and his priests were ordered to perform the concubine's funeral services shortly after her death. It entailed casting soul-condemning spells on her corpse, removing her heart (normally left within a mummy) along with the rest of her vital organs, and burying her remains in the middle of the desert. In addition, the slaves present were ordered to bury the body and be killed by the soldiers present. The priests murdered the soldiers in order to keep the location of Hamunaptra a secret forever. Imhotep broke into Anck-Su-Namun's crypt at night and stole her body. He then took it to the necropolis Hamunaptra, also known as the City of the Dead. Here, the blasphemous priest attempted to resurrect her using the forbidden Book of the Dead, unaware that he was being watched by the Medjai. The ritual was cut short before Anck-Su-Namun's soul could properly return to her mortal body, the canopic jar containing her heart was smashed, and her soul was returned to the Underworld. Destroying her heart ensured that the ritual could never be completed. Imhotep's followers and the city guards on duty that night were sentenced to be mummified alive as a form of retribution, while Imhotep himself was cursed with the dreaded Hom-Dai and buried alive beneath Hamunaptra.  Imhotep was accidentally brought back by a librarian named Evelyn Carnahan who was Nefertiri's reincarnation in 1926 A.D. and set out to repeat the ritual that had been botched so many centuries before. Imhotep had been close to completing the ritual the previous time, requiring no sacrifice, but after three thousand years, he needed a human sacrifice to provide Anck-Su-Namun with fresher flesh. After taking the Book of the Dead, finding Anck-Su-Namun's five sacred canopic jars, and choosing Evelyn, as his sacrifice, he found Anck-Su-Namun's body and tied Evelyn by her ankles and wrists to a sacrifice altar in Hamunaptra. Imhotep was about to kill Evelyn with a ceremonial dagger and carve out her heart as a replacement after reuniting Anck-Su-Namun's spirit and body, bringing her back to life, when Evelyn's brother, Jonathan, entered the chamber with the Book of Amun-Ra, the only force capable of killing the High Priest.|||That is a difficult name for a native speaker.",

            "body": "I was going through some debates about Islam and their worldview, but I could not shake off how radical the religion is. Mind you, I am not inferring all Muslims are inherently radical, but the religion shows tenets of extremism and oppression against women throughout its religious text.   i. Quran is supposed to be the word of god, divine and infallible. It is actually Allah speaking to us through the written texts by Muhammad. So there can not (or at least is very little room for) ambiguous interpretation of controversial things in it.   ii. Discrimination and violence against women is inexorably intertwined throughout the text. Here are some examples,   a. Surah An-Nisa 4:34: This verse states that men are guardians over women because Allah has made some excel others and because men spend their wealth on them. It advises men to admonish disobedient wives, separate from them in bed, and, as a last resort, ***strike them*** lightly if they persist in rebellion. (But, wives striking back at husbands is not permissible)     b. Surah Al-Baqarah 2:282: In financial transactions requiring witnesses, it specifies calling two men or one man and two women, so if one woman makes an error, the other can remind her (implying women's intellectual worth is exactly half as that of men).     c. Surah An-Nisa 4:3: Men are permitted to marry up to four wives if they can treat them justly, but women have no such polygamous rights.     iii. Discrimination and violence against 'non-believers' is called for multiple times. Here are some examples,   a. Surah At-Tawbah 9:29: Commands fighting those who do not believe in Allah or the Last Day until they pay the jizya tax in submission (tax acts as a deterrent, if you have to pay tax to believe in or worship god of your choice, you would just say fuck it in most cases).  b. Surah Al-Bayyinah 98:6: Describes disbelievers (those who reject Islam) as \"the worst of creatures,\" destined for Hell.     c. Surah At-Tawbah 9:5: Instructs killing polytheists wherever found after sacred months, unless they repent and convert.     These are only few examples that is readily available everywhere. Yet, we cannot even have open conversations about it due to 'political correctness'. The pillar of Islam is radical and is based on discrimination, violence and rejection of things non-islam. Tolerance is not part of the religion (just look at all the muslim nations and how they treat their women).   The percentage of Muslim population as the share of the country has been steadily growing. They are notorious for rejecting family planning and birth control measures and consistently have the highest fertility rates. Is there not a conversation to be had?      Disclaimer - This is not a 'hate-speech' or anything. Other religious scriptures have plenty of amoral or downright immoral tenets. This is just to understand more and create positive discussion. I believe Nepal should he secular with the right to religious freedom.",

Boycott them. Boycott religion. They are anti-freedom.|||Pashupati nath le Allah ko rakshya garun|||Oh boy!! Discussion about religion never goes the right way my brother. But anyways!!  1. If interpretation was minimal or not allowed, there would not be multiple schools. (Hanafi, maliki, hanbali). Islam in itself has been changing historically to fit context(famine), culture(india), geo-politics (iraq, egypt).   2. Islamic ethics is not derived from isolated verses alone, but from the Quran and the Prophet’s lived example. And it is mostly societal prejudice, lack of education, more than cultural. Have you seen rural india or even inner terai of nepal?   3. Mostly for written debt. And mostly as women were not heavily involved in economy. But the women always could inherit property, initiative divorce, and were considered independent moral agents accountable to God directly.  4. The other part matters maybe?  ``` If you fear you cannot be just, then marry only one.```   ``` You will never be able to be just between wives, even if you strive. ```  Again it is all about interpretation and was mostly for post war context (men died more women). Still better than sati that we had maybe?  5. Christianity flourished in Jerusalem. Hinduism strived under muslim empire in india. It is easier to find a church (egypt) or temple (Bangladesh) in islamic nation than to find a mosque in deep rooted hindu or christian area/nation (china?).   6. Every religion does this? Christianity - eternal damnation (wahtched vikings?), hinduism - karmic punishment, buddhism - rebirth in hell.  7. If state behaviour = religion then, Christianity- colonial genocide, Hinduism- caste oppression, Buddhism- Rohingya persecution.  Political power corrupts religious ideals. See turkey vs afghanistan, Indonesia vs Iran, saudi vs Bangladesh.  8.  Fertility drop sharply with education, urbanization, and women’s employment. Iran’s fertility collapsed after female education expanded. Bangladesh’s fertility fell dramatically without abandoning Islam.  Basically religion no good or bad, power corrupts people and corrupted people very bad. When this continues for long, the bad becomes the norm.

I ain't taking them seriously.|||Not a Muslim but every Muslim country to a certain extent has been destabilized by the west. One of the main things they did was kill all left leaning political movements hence making it easier for far right movements to take power. For eg Turkey 🇹🇷 has not had the type of western interference that other Muslim countries have and is a secular country. It gave women the right to vote in 1934. This question is like asking Bahuns hey do you secretly hate everyone because your religion has told you that you are genetically and spiritually superior to everyone else. And also Indonesia and Malaysia are both Muslim countries as well. And are more stable than the oil rich Middle East even though they both have faced CIA interference. Especially Indonesia. The Jakarta method is a terrifying documentary if you want to check it out.|||Why waste time? Better learn about world political history.|||I am a hindu but i will correct you or tell you  what i know 1. Mohammad was illiterate. He didnt write quran according to muslims it is just word go god sent by allah through jibrail. Conspiracy is it is mohammads jew friend who wrote  it.  Others are all correct|||Most religions, unfortunately, are based on discrimination, violence and patriarchy. Equality is not part of many religions (just look at the non-muslim nations like Nepal or India for example and how they treat/have treated their women, i.e. child marriage, dowry, kidnapping women for marriage, chhaupadi, domestic violence, sati pratha, etc.). Like quran, even bible or garud puran and swasthani include lots of sexist content. It sounds like you do hold a stereotypical and generalised perception about muslims but it's good that you are open for conversation.  Every religion and culture has its good and bad side. It's important that we see both, choose to follow the good, and continue challenging the bad from our end. - A non-muslim|||There is no understanding religion. Everyone will say their interpretation is right and other bad things are not what their religion preaches.   But it’s just weak people clinging to something. All religions.|||I also started learning about islam from debates with atheists, christians and ex-muslims. Ex-muslims are the most unhinged ones (understandably so). I might be biased against Islam but I don't know where the unbiased line is. Here's my two cents:  I think your intuitions are largely correct. I think the issue with islam is not of good or bad but of how to assimilate incompatible belief systems.  Your point (i) is the main issue 'good' muslims face with. Two statements \"Quran is truth\" and \"Mohammed is perfect\" are not conclusions but the premise of their belief system. Its a monumental challenge to defend the problematic parts you mentioned for them compared to christians and hindus; too less wiggle room for alternative interpretation.  I would also appreciate more muslims come forward and discuss these issues. I don't see this happening and I think I know why. I see only two outcomes of such discussions: get exposed being intolerant or change the belief.  There are couple of examples: \"Muslim guy admitting he would happily watch an apostate executed if he was in islamic country\" and \"Another guy saying is okay to marry and have sex with 5 yo\". Mind you both of them are youtube celebrities with large followings. Which is why good muslims are mostly silent or resort to disingenuous arguments nowadays. I vaguely remember seeing Jakir Naik in TV when I was kid.  Islam is filled with anti jewish sentiments and even necessitates muslim to kill them before end of time. Which explains why israel-palestine war gets a lot of attention and why all the muslims sides with palestine.  I know there are many muslims who coexist and don't believe the verses you mentioned or choose not to act upon but this will not change the fact that those verses exist and they claim to follow the book that contains them. I will always be skeptic unless islam and quran goes through radical reformation which I don't see happening given their premise.  I also find this \"alternative interpretation\" argument hard to digest. If your book clearly says kill the non-believers and you have to perform a mental gymnastics to get non-violent interpretation then maybe the peaceful muslims are the radical ones.  Now to address your points. Don't let the label of political correctness or hate speech stop talking about things you are concerned about. I should be able to criticize and absolutely shit on any ideas. Thats the fundamental of scientific process. If anyone gets offended that their problem. I don't agree with right to religious freedom because religion has vague definition and it can contradict with other rights.|||If u take it seriously, u r a problem.|||I guess, you just read few verses without interpretation. You have to read ups and downs on what circumstances surah of Quran was revealed. Also, don’t seem like you are interested in learning about Islam. I am Muslim women and I have all the right, I don’t feel oppressed. It’s just that people of other religions think we are oppressed.  If I have to be honest about oppression, people around all religions try to oppress women which go against the teaching of all religions. It’s patriarchy that took over religious leaders and they mislead people.  If you really wanna learn about Islam, purchase these three books; the sealed Nectar, Quran and then, a book called, ‘ A Commentary on Ash-shamail al-Muhammadiyyah’. If you read these books, Inshallah you gonna cry and gonna fall in love with Prophet Mohommad and Allah.  Your curiosity makes sense, as people called themselves slave of Allah and follower of prophet Mohommad and goes on doing exact opposite of what Prophet mohommad taught us.|||OP:  'I want to understand more.'  Also OP: Proceeds to explain exactly why the religion is evil, radical, and intolerant while citing specific verses to support your pre-existing bias.  Let’s be real, OP. You didn't write this to learn. You wrote this to lecture. You have clearly already made up your mind, so why pretend otherwise?  If you actually wanted to understand, you would ask, 'How do you interpret Surah An-Nisa 4:34 in a modern context?' or 'How does the community view these specific verses?' Instead, you dumped a list of grievances and demographic fear-mongering about fertility rates. You haven't come here for a conversation; you’ve come here to validate a conclusion you’ve already reached.|||If you want to learn about islam in general, I would start with some of these.

Now how much worse it is for the people in the past.|||If you really wanna learn better talk to grok than redditors.  Islam does have tons of problems. But there are also many schools and many interpretations. Islam was designed to incorporate every aspect from day to day life to government. There is islamic jurisprudence, quran, haddith, fiqh.  From my observation, what i found out was that. There is main text quran. Its their most important one. Then later compiled ones haddith, which are sahil (Authentic), hasan (good), daif(weak) regarding its authenticity. Then there are jurisprudence books. Which they use to run a society or use for the basis of sharia law.  You seem to be cautious or bothered by all the fucked up things on islam. Its true. There are many. It's better to know the history. Islam was spread mostly through conquest and they developed highly apartheid society when of you weren't a Muslim. Or a non Muslim who didn't pay jizya, you had little rights and slavable. Religion is a big part for them, and worshipping an idol was the biggest crime in their religion (shirk). They punish apostasy and blasphemy with death. And these aren't fringe practices. If you look at history. This has been the norm for most of Islamic states. This is why there is so much radical aspects to islam. This is just the tip of the iceberg. You can read the book of Islamic jurisprudence, like tahir al washilah, which was a book used for Islamic state in iran. To get an inking of how Islamic states ran. You will likely find 100 problematic stuff like pedophilia, apartheid status, barbaric punishments or capital punishment, treatment of women.  However there is many interpretations in islam. Sects like shia ans sunnis. Traditions like suffisim, druze. Each country has a different flavor of islam. However they are the most consistent and dogmatic religion. Btw, suffism is mostly a spiritual traditional stuff so less of that poltical and jihad stuff which is radical.  It's also important to notice that there are plenty of non radical mulsims. Who view islam as a peaceful religion. Who believe in tolerance of other religions. Its mostly getting prominency in modern days. Where people usually only believe in the Quran and reject all the haddiths and fiqh. And quran can be interpreted in a peaceful way. It's not bad compared to books like bible. Could even be relavent to today's world.  Also important to notice that. Most people who suffer due to radical islam are muslims. Before anyone stereotypes all muslims.|||I think religions are basically cultures sugar-coated with some god's stamp of approval. But nobody knows that god.|||I have the same questions   And as i got more into the rabbit hole   I found out every religion is extremist with islam being extreme on this.

He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.

            "body": "I never wanted to write this, but after months of silence, frustration, and anger, I need to get this off my chest.  I was looking for referrals and guidance in the Nepalese tech industry. Like everyone says, “network on LinkedIn, reach out to seniors, ask for help.”  So I did.  What shocked me was this:  * Most girls didn’t even accept my connection request or reply. * When I started messaging male seniors, many were *very eager* to “help.”  At first it sounded normal:  >“Send your GitHub”  >“Send your Facebook / Instagram”  That’s where things went downhill.  After following me on Instagram, the conversation slowly stopped being about tech:  * Personal questions * Compliments and buttering * Daily chatting that had nothing to do with jobs  After long conversations, the real question came:  >“Timro boyfriend xa?”  Some of these men were married.   One guy directly said:  >“If you date me, I will guide you to get a job.”  Let that sink in.  This is not networking.   This is not mentorship.   This is sexual harassment and exploitation.  What’s worse is that this behavior feels normalized. Many juniors stay quiet because:  * They’re desperate for jobs * They don’t want to “burn bridges.” * Power is completely one-sided  I’m not naming individuals, but certain companies (yes, even popular ones people praise online) seriously need internal reflection. This problem is bigger than one person.  Because of all this:  * I’ve stopped applying for now * I’m focusing on clearing my back exams next month * Preparing for government job exams * Planning to work for a few years and then go abroad for further studies",

            "comments": "It's quite common in Nepal. Most of the teachers in school and college all of the are pedophiles.|||I'm not aware of the definition - is it like somebody who's grooming girls under 18? Are you using the term loosely?  It's an individual-thing and not a profession-thing. Girls sending DMs to get referred (when they have no skills) is also more common than you think. I get many DMs asking for free help (refactors)/ referrals (barely know them/ barely seen their code) and I just ignore them. I help many people (m/f) on a daily basis, and I've never met most of them. I know many of my 'male' senior friends (no female senior dev friends) do the same.  You should clear your exams first. Last bullet point sounds like a good plan.  Most people here will be happy to review 1-2 projects for free. I'll jump in if it's Python/ Next.js/ ML. Just post your github repo on some relevant community and they'll do free reviews.   Edit: I dont do free mentorships, happy to review repos/ coding practices.|||I get what you r saying but the term pedo applies to people who r way older and trying to groom n trap minors (under 18). The person u r referring r called blackmailers or gooners (in current terms i think)|||In my experience, Girls seem to help girl only when they are on some “female tech organization” and it’s rarely a technical mentorship. They should be helpful without such aids too. I am sorry that you had to deal with these. that’s extremely disgusting.  Still there are bunch of female led tech groups - they have ties with it company - approach them.|||Other side - back in Nepal I used to work for a compant that paid well and had better reputation. A young girl in her early 20s reached out to me for a referall for associate engineer. I hesitated a bit seeing her technical knowledge. She offered sex plus 1 months of her salary if I referred and she got hired. Was a weird encounter. I am still not sure if she qas serious or not. But I immediately got off connection.|||Dark side is on both side ! If male posted this not a single person would have asked i have connection i can refer vanera !! Sorry you had to go through that.

I left my job after a year because of a toxic culture. I swear, I couldn't find a position (I was even applying for internships) at any tech company in Kathmandu. I thought it wouldn't be that difficult since I have decent projects and a year of experience, but I remain jobless for next three months. It feels like you need a referral to even breathe near tech industry.|||Well, if yoi have backlogs, that should be your first priority. Believe me, time flies and before you know it you would have already lost all chance to clear those!  I have noticed this pattern of girls not helping girls, I am not sure what that's about but that is very common.  I have only been asked for referral once or twice. I am not trying to defend men who blur their boundaries. I will say some things that you should be aware of.  First: first impression, you want to clearly intent your professionalism. Your actual name, a good profile picture, not what you would post in insta or Snapchat but something like you get in studio or while filling exam forms.   A message from a female account with professional image and a message from another female account with a flirty selfie will hit the male audience differently. I cannot claim to know the female perspective but this is probably similar.  I am not going to refer you or help you of you have no posts or you have not coordinated your projects to me. If you are blank from your side, help will be blank from my side too. Interns will need to have some personal (not professional) experience in the sector too.  Steer away from the female/male senior if within days they ask you for Facebook/ Instagram/ because there is absolutely no need for those to communicate. Whatsapp is slightly different as it provides voice medium without exposing personal album but always prefer google meet or discord.  Referral should be from someone with mutual acquaintance, you know them and they know you, if you are going around poking unknown people for referral, you are bound to poke bad people too.  People are generally not nice to strangers, even you and me.  I would suggest going abroad for career after finishing your bachelors. I decided not to go and I am regretting a bit. Yes, money is the reason. The pay varies by nearly 10x.|||you don't add coworkers on your insta unless you're really close. There are numerous reasons. That's the norm, has been for quite a while for me. Timile ta kurai nagareko connection bhandai insta ma add garyau, mistake tya bhayo.|||Its common in every field, most men are just horny ani rarely want to help. If you looking for real help, my suggestion is build your skillset - reach out to small companies based outside Nepal - US based sakey samma have great communication skills both written and speaking and get a job. Dont “network” its pointless|||Female HRs lae send grne ho. Kta haru sometimes testae nae hunxan. Sorry for what u went through.|||Most IT nerds have never talked to a girl. Anytime they get any attention, they start seeing marriage.  But what difference does it make? You want something from them and they want something from you. I see it as them doing the same thing as you. Reaching out in order to fulfill their needs. You in your need for a job and them in their need for someone.|||Muji haru",

Also, the *cost of vehicles* in Nepal is much higher than in India. Cars that cost ₹7–10 L in India often cost 2–3× more in Nepal (sometimes even higher when taxes + import duties are added), and this is widely reported.  This means:  1. The same car/automobile can cost roughly 2–3 times more in Nepal because of heavy import taxes and logistics costs. 2. Almost everything (especially cars, electronics, imported goods) is more expensive in Nepal, except for some basic categories like food and rent, which are generally cheaper compared to big Indian cities.",

            "comments": "Hop|||After reading a few of the replies here, my suggestion is simple: secure yourself first.  Hand in your one-week notice only after you’ve signed an agreement with the new company. Get everything confirmed before you mention anything to your current employer.  Once that’s done, approach HR or management and let them know you’ve received a better opportunity elsewhere.. ideally one offering around 4× your current pay and that you’ve decided to move forward with it. If you feel it’s appropriate, apologize for the short notice. You can also give them a chance to match the offer (though realistically, they probably won’t).  Most likely, they’ll accept the resignation.  If they’re the difficult type, they may threaten to hold your pay. In that case, try to get paid before resigning or be mentally prepared to walk away from the remaining amount. Legally, there isn’t much they can do anyway, especially if they were paying below minimum wage.  If you don’t want to go down that route, there’s another option:  You can simply inform them that a personal issue has come up and you need to return to your village for a few months (say, at least five). Explain that this is why you’re giving a week’s notice instead of disappearing. They can’t take action against you in this situation either… at most, they’ll process your exit.  Things to keep in mind:  - Try to ensure you don’t have many unpaid days before handing in your notice. - Don’t share any details about your new employer.. no names or any hints. If they’re toxic, they can try to sabotage it. - Give at least a week’s notice. Two weeks is better if you can manage it. - Don’t get manipulated into staying for a minor raise. If they can’t offer at least 3× what you’re earning now, the new role is clearly the better move. Be firm about leaving.   I’m saying this as someone who’s been on the employer side and dealt with situations like this regularly. We expected high performance and strong work ethics, and while we paid slightly above the market average, the pressure wasn’t for everyone. Many people left as soon as they got paid and that’s understandable. What we did appreciate was honesty and advance notice.  A proper 14-day resignation helps the employer transition work, hand over projects, or train replacements. Disappearing without notice only creates problems for everyone, and I wouldn’t recommend that approach despite what some comments suggest.  You don’t owe the company anything beyond basic professionalism. Just as they can terminate you immediately for violating terms, you also have the right to leave at any time. If you want to stay ethical and professional, give a 14-day notice. If not, at least give a week so the transition is smoother for you and them.  All the best with whatever route you choose and good luck with what’s next. Cheers!|||Just leave, they will find an replacement. Estai ho corporate ma, if you don't hop, you don't progress|||That's why always be sure and do proper research before signing up the contract.

Although PF amounts have been deducted from employees salaries, they have reportedly not been credited to the employees PF accounts for the past three years. Similarly, TDS was deducted from salaries but was never deposited against employees PAN numbers. I’ve heard that there are ongoing legal cases related to these issues. Several teachers who raised concerns were reportedly terminated, which may explain why there are frequent openings and many new vacancies for teaching positions at the college.  So chances that they have been scamming can be real. We can’t be 100% sure without proper proof.|||They scammed noone. We all joined knowing the fee structure. I don’t even regret joining islington.

For data centres you'd need (multiple) dedicated internet connections, which is extremely expensive in Nepal.   Hardware is also expensive in Nepal. Server hardware in particular is very expensive here.  Electricity, while cheap, is still expensive compared to many countries. And electricity still isn't completely reliable - you still need to invest significantly to prepare for it.

You gotta be able to cope up with demand which is hardest.   and data center is not just cabling racks. There is a whole networking architecture behind.|||I can talk from major cloud enterprise standpoint. China wants their regions to be in mainland China so that's out of the question.

            "body": "Hi I am studying in last semester of bachelor's, I am out of valley student. I got offered a tech job that pays around 50k-60k/month.   I am doing a WFH job that doesn't pay much, and isn't good for my technical growth as well, as I am handed mostly marketing tasks. I have a choice to do this part time and get the new onsite job which requires me to relocate to Kathmandu, which I am much more than okay to do.  But my dad isn't supportive of this. He strictly wants me to complete my bachelor's and prepare for loksewa, whose perks I understand. But I feel I can do much better in tech itself and don't enjoy thought of prepping for Loksewa and doing a sarkari jaagir.   I am an academic person and will definitely pursue my studies till phD or more, might as well move to abroad, if my finances are strong enough till then and I get scholarship with assistantship.  My father is narcissist person, an angry man, not open to 2 way conversation, and any action I take has consequences over rest of my family, following along with consistent distress, fights and chaos at home. What should I do? Has anyone been through this before?",

If you have trustworthy relatives, ask for their advice and help, if your grandparents are alive ask them for help.   Before joining this job, just go to that office and ask some of the employees about the office, nature of the senior and working environment. If you like the place and believe that it is a good place to work, join it, but tell them your story (optional).   If you have some relatives there, then ask your dad you want to visit them and explore Kathmandu, because you're bored staying home.  If the job is a sure shot and not a scam then you may have some friends in Kathmandu, ask them to find a room or hostel. Ask your relatives as well and some people close to your dad for your help.|||Talk with him and make him understand that’s the only option you have else you’ll have chaos in your home this way. Decision must be made either way.|||Leave, Go to Kathmandu, pursue your dreams. Fuck that old narcissist asshole. How long is he going to be abusive towards your family? In a year you will get Stabalized in KTM. Monthly expenses in ktm will be around 20k, you can save 30K each month you'll have atleast 3L in a year. You can choose never to look at him again. Threaten you will take your sibling and never look at him again if he keeps being abusive for a year.   Then do it anyways and rub it in with a \"ANGXA MUDDHA\" if you have family property.     Stop giving abusers power over you, youre an adult, if he doesn't respect you you should not respect him.

But FIRST: Calculate on what things you are dependent on your father/family. Gradually eliminate the dependency, take responsibility. Move out.  Also, remind your father that government jobs are not as beneficial as they used to be. No pension, even if they have CIT, so do private jobs, you can allocate more portion since private pay more.  Do multiple job.   The disclaimer: I value freedom of choice without stepping over someone else's freedom. So it might be extreme but this is what I would have done.  Forget your father, if you are just another 'responsibility' to him then release him of this burden. Plan for years, move to Kathmandu IF you don't have to ditch bachelor.   Your father is going to complain regardless. So do not stress over making waves in your family.   Again; plan ahead. What COULD you do if you are thrown out? Do you have proper identity documents?...... Complete your bachelor and move out.|||Hey I have an idea Go tell your father that it is some kind of karar job and after 1 year they will make me permanent like sarkari jagir and get out that's the first step !!

            "comments": "What a shit take! AI is there to make your learning easier, to make you understand concepts faster and better. Learning and understanding is important! How? Doesn't matter|||Oh it is the most useful thing in terms of learning. You can quickly learn things that would take hours before.  It will tell you line by line what each piece of code does. So if you don't understand something, just ask it will tell you in as much detail as you require. But you have to sit there and read.|||Not much. I don’t like hallucinated “ best practices “ examples|||adapt or perish|||Lol. I made it through my masters with AI. I would ask it questions and it would answer. Sometimes they were wrong. So I'd repeatedly ask until the answer made sense to me. I would definitely not take AI's word 100%   The thing that AI helped in was it directed me towards the right path. So if there was a concept I didn't know, I'd ask it and then I'd independently Google the terms AI mentioned. Then read research papers that explained it in more detail. If I didn't understand the paper, I copied the paragraph, pasted it in AI and asked it to explain it to me in simpler terms.   You just gotta know how to use AI.|||I do use it but not that much for new concepts, mostly to get sorta reminded as to how this thing worked or smtg like that. The times that i use ai for new concepts are when i am reading a book or have a cerdible src of information but i  cant get my head around a topic/concept. I dont particularly like it but why not use it if its available. I never use it for things that are completely foreign to me as i wont be able to tell hallucinations apart and will have to search for a credible src anyway.|||AI is helpful and it saves a lot of time . Now a days , I use chatgpt and grok first then move to youtube videos for better understanding .|||it is such a shit take, it's like saying i'd rather read from books then ever use google, first things first you should never use AI to try to thoroughly learn something. AI is for bits and pieces of information that otherwise would've taken ages to accumulate.  For example if i am reading a book or docs on anything and say i don't understand a given part , it could be some code logic or mostly it's me not understanding how certain concepts are \"worded\" as in the structuring of sentences not just the meaning of a word is quite complex certain times , i'd ask chatgpt (mostly for my lack of comprehension of certain sentences) to explain me the same thing in brief and i'd try to make sense of it with the actual text. So this is the first use case. Since my goal here is to learn certain programming concepts not english language it to me occurs like a compromise between my learning process and developing reading skills.  The second use case would be say if i was learning backend of something like that and i wanted to do something that'd require me to code up a frontend to execute certain api calls (i know you've got thunderclient or postman for the same use but for form data or images or audio files i'd always prefer a simple html form element be presented ) instead of coding that same thing from scratch i'd ask claude to generate me a simple frontend. In this regard it's simply more sensible to save time using AI rather than be too egoist to use it.  Really you can't learn a certain concept to its core using AI, it's just not possible so i agree with what the post says those three bulletins , but not the title of the post.  p.s. it has been easier to ask chat-gpt to find me a resource to learn something. Infact i started reading O'Reilly's because chat-gpt recommended me their books once and i started look around more about this publication. It's really easy to gather resource. I'd hundered percent use AI to help me learn something. And just a little hint if you ask any LLM for certain things and you are confused about the validity of the answer you can narrow your questions to that particular thing. Since it's a LLM it's can't possibly say \"i can't \" or \"i don't have information about it\" because it works on probabilistic model so it sends any result that gives the highest probability for a sequence of words as a response to a request. So you can't easily see the LLM struggling when even after a ton of clarification it sends the same result again and again it's just that amongst all the possible sequence of word it has the one sequences which is inherently wrong has the highest value of probability and since there are no other better sequences than that wrong one the LLM sends it back over and over|||my steak is too juicy and my lobster too buttery|||I upload my book and interact with it , Yea it's AI tool. I upload my solution and ask it for the way to make it better|||If you don't use it to learn, you're living under a rock. And you don't deserve this field.   Using it to do things for you instead? A very grey road, you are replacing yourself and losing your skills.|||I have learn things I would never have in my life is there wasn't Ai|||Weird take, I mean if he enjoys the struggle then good for him. But I personally lose motivation to study if I encounter too many setbacks like getting stuck in a math problem or not understanding some concept etc. So I use AI all the time.",

USA loses $200 billion per year in outbound remittances from foreign workers. That money leaves the country permanently and helps to finance and support other nations who become reliant on those funds INSTEAD of developing their own infrastructure/economies. Those days are over.|||[deleted]|||Also in the US. Haven't faced most of those experiences above but what he said above is experienced by most. Avoid coming to the US for undergrad. Come for postgrad if possible in scholarships only.|||I did my higher education (including a PhD. in Stem) in the US. I put a lot of effort into studies, writing, publishing, and emerging as one of the future leaders of my field, but it took a lot of effort.   I miss home.

It's depressing to think about. Life is just going to pass like this for this generation, and hopefully, the next generation will get to relax.|||100%|||you’ve worded it very well tbh and i relate to it a lot. might be a little discouraging but reality is almost always disappointing.|||One line always fascinates me: New York- the land of immigrants, the land of freedom, a place where cultures from around the globe meet together. One day, I hope to visit there on vacation.|||I think this is because the OP came at age of 18, i came here at age of 28 and i have different experiences, but one thing that is uncertain is Visa.  I agree with most part but I think it’s perspective, you are doing this struggle for yourself and people you care. Don’t do any bad things here obviously this is not Nepal, know the country, their rules and respect it, you’ll be fine.  Been here for almost 4 years now, got full time job after 1.5 years masters program. Pays ~150k annually, while this doesn’t help the feeling of living far from home country, but it pays for other stuff and you can get good car, buy own home, get better insurance and its set.  So my suggestion, get some experience in Nepal first, learn how to communicate, show up your skills and build your portfolio.|||Don’t come to conclusion with just  one  example. Earlier I saw a post where a nepali guy had $80k in his portfolio while working as student. These both are extreme examples.The guy in this post came to USA to study bachelor with full financial and social responsibility. Doing bachelor is always tough while working illegally for 4 years. I don’t encourage people to go for bachelor degree with their sole financial responsibility. With more effort and research, people end up in scholarship and low tuition fee college. This will change the whole dynamic of this situation. However, the grass is not greener at other side too. There will be challenges related to immigration and getting green card. Anyone can come embracing those challenges and keeping open mind.|||Its tough for students and it always has been. Struggle is part of life. Consistency is the key i think.  Its always good to see positive side despite all hurdles and difficulties you have to face.||| “Padhera bhanda ni napadhi green card pauchan dherai le”  Please explain this.

I am from Kathmandu and lived here back then, so I didn't have to experience it first hand. But, I had a friend in school who had migrated from Gorkha.

He didn't even have the full understanding of what it meant, but he was already an orphan.  This man is responsible for all those murders, orphaning, widowing, pain, and suffering, and for what?

Every now and then,we get a crashing news:(|||Not an expert, but with whatever knowledge I have for following aviation industry, I have some conclusions   1) The plane has almost gone 300m off the runway, if it was a late touchdown and if the Pilots knew it wouldn't stop why didn't they go for a go around, not blaming the pilots but I also think they didn't attempt a go around cause the other side has Indian border and they would have to take a steep left turn and might even enter Indian border, and file new IFR.   2) If the plane had touchdown normally then, as shown in the photos, no flaps extended is seen, either they retracted the flaps early or the flaps weren't extended at all, this suspects for a hydraulic failure.   Adding to the 1st point, it was a layover flight, maybe the intensions of pilot was a quick landing, I am not at all shifting the blame at anyone but it's just my take.

At first I genuinely thought he was asking for a lift, so I stopped without thinking much. Then he started talking about money. He asked if I had esewa or not. I was confused because in my head I was thinking, why would I charge someone for a lift?  He told me his bike had crashed badly and he urgently needed cash right there on the road. He said he had money in his e-wallet and would send it to me immediately.I believed him. I gave him 1500 in cash. After that he said he’d return it in an hour instead. To make me trust him, he even showed me cash in his hand, maybe around 10k, and said something like, “Why would I scam you just for 1500?” I even told him how important that money was for me college, rent, living alone and all that. He kept saying no worries, reassuring me, talking nicely, making it sound genuine. Now it’s been hours. He’s blocked my number.  I honestly don’t know what I was thinking at that moment. I just thought a fellow Nepali rider was asking for help and I didn’t want to turn my back. For someone living alone, 1500 is a big hit. It’s not just the money, it’s the feeling of being fooled so easily.  Posting this mainly as a warning. If someone asks for urgent cash on the road and promises to pay later, please think twice.

Better to aim for scholarship so that youll get your desired college paying ma, if not scholarship.|||Hi, i was an cee aspirant too.

Just a group of students trying to do something real.  Most tech communities here focus only on coding or only on CS students. But that never felt right to us. In real life, growth doesn’t happen in silos. So CodeYatraNP is for any student — science, commerce, bio, CS, A-levels, +2 — anyone who actually cares about building themselves.  We do things like: learning tech & AI in a very practical way workshops & small events outdoor learning & exposure community projects (including working with kids and under-resourced students) helping students collaborate, not compe  And honestly, that’s what CodeYatraNP is about: giving students the exposure we wish we had earlier. No pressure. No fake motivation posts. No “hustle culture”.   If you want to:  meet people who actually build things work on real-world ideas contribute, learn, or even just observe quietly  You’re welcome.  You can check it out or join here:  Even if you don’t join, I’d love to hear thoughts from others who’ve tried building communities like this. We’re learning as we go.  Thanks for reading 🤍",

            "body": "This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

But let's not sympathize with these cronies and corrupt politicians. For decades, the real victims have been the everyday citizens of our country. Our Parliament, the Supreme Court, and Singha Durbar getting burned down is a bigger tragedy than some 5-star hotel or supermarket chain. We have been screwed over by these politicians and their business counterparts for so long that on that day, the entire country became a rage room.

And these were live ammunitions... videos of cops giving the middle finger after shooting and terrorising the shops till 9-10 o'clock at night  were circulating ..

            "body": "It’s 2026 now, and we’re still having to deal with this.  A few days ago, early in the morning, I was on the street and saw a public bus with people literally hanging from the door. It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

This problem needs to be adressed and public transportation should be well organized and planned.|||Finally, someone spoke about this. This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this. This issue really needs more attention and more noise.|||KTM has enough budget with 40 percent going unused. these transportation comes under metropolitan ko authority. ask Mayor balen.

Whether we like them or not, an attack on a high profile figure can disrupt our national peace and damage our international reputation for years to come.  ​We can never be certain who might be planning an attack on a VVIP or for what purpose.

If an attack occurs, our country’s stability can derail overnight and Western media and racists in west love to make fun of \"third world countries\" to feel superior regardless of fact that they have been through worse.

            "body": "As it says, I recently got this and was hoping for some help, especially on the markings. There isn’t a ton of info on these in English so I figured I’d do to the source. My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6. This is probably the longest shot of them all, but any ideas what species of critter might have eaten up the stock at one point?

During the Rana regime (1846–1951), gun manufacturing in Nepal was driven largely by the innovative efforts of Gehendra Shumsher, the eldest son of Prime Minister Bir Shumsher, who is widely regarded as Nepal's first scientist and modernizer of the military.   Key Manufacturing Factories  The Ranas established several sites for arms and ammunition production, primarily centered in the Kathmandu Valley and some regional hubs:   Nakkhu (Lalitpur): Notable for producing copies of the Martini-Henry rifle, specifically the \"De-Rifle\" in the late 1880s.  Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.  Jangi Megjin: Originally founded in 1793, it continued to function during the Rana period as a government foundry for manufacturing cannons and military equipment.|||You need someone from the Hanuman Dhoka Museum in Kathmandu.

Esto kaam ekdum kam huncha hamro desh ma|||Kudos to subham vai. I remember when he talked about doing this in his free time.|||This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

Also, the *cost of vehicles* in Nepal is much higher than in India. Cars that cost ₹7–10 L in India often cost 2–3× more in Nepal (sometimes even higher when taxes + import duties are added), and this is widely reported.  This means:  1. The same car/automobile can cost roughly 2–3 times more in Nepal because of heavy import taxes and logistics costs. 2. Almost everything (especially cars, electronics, imported goods) is more expensive in Nepal, except for some basic categories like food and rent, which are generally cheaper compared to big Indian cities.",

He did bachelors in commerce way back then.

He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

Since hindi is not your identity, you have a disadvantage. They look down on you if you speak their language with them. That’s literally saying: you are my master, i will follow you.   You will only be a sidekick on someone else’s story.   You have more control and power over your own language. You can say anything in Nepali and no one can correct you cus you are the native speaker. You are fluent and can express yourself better. That gives you the leverage to take a stand for yourself.

I never willingly consume Indian media and always try to give Nepali content more of my attention.

To tell someone to stop speaking that language isn't going to fix the issue. You should be confident and talk to the people who make you feel this way that Hindi is not your native language and you can only converse in a limited way. Any person who insults you by considering you \"inferior\" is stupid and arrogant. You have to call them out on it.   Since you are in Canada, there are many people who speak French. And French is the 6th most spoken language in the world. If you can learn it and speak, that'd give you a boost in talking to more people. It doesn't always have to be English.   Language is just a medium to communicate. It doesn't belong to any particular nation or a group of people. Don't be afraid to speak out your thoughts.   In Nepal, if you can't speak English well, the people consider you illiterate. It doesn't matter how good you can speak Nepali or a native language.  It's the behaviour and expectations of people in language that's judged.|||Bruh you need job application|||I dont think hindi is the problem here,instead that emploer.|||We should tell that to Nepali wanna be Bollywood’s artists also.|||This but speaking in hindi for indian tourist, why do we do that?|||It always depends on personal experience.

Non native people here in mumbai are trying to erase our marathi language too.|||If we look at the Fact,  Nepali language is derived from Hindi and Urdu. We use same devnagiri script. Whereas many local languages are marginalised.|||Whenever I’ve switched from English and then spoken to someone in Hindi, I’ve felt a commonness and even respect. Being tri-lingual is a skill, not a downgrade.   I go to small family owned grocery store, I greet them in Hindi and they say namastey, and my usual the liquor store guy asks me how I’ve been doing and gives me discount.   Language was invented by humans to make connections. Rather than saying dont speak a particular language, maybe saying something about how to develop relationships would have been better.|||This post and the comments just reek of inferiority complex.|||Learning any language is good not speaking them in front of them is your choice.  If you don't want to speak in Hindi, that's fine, although Hindi and Nepali words are so much similar just the structure of sentences is what makes the difference between them(These similarities  made me understand the language more , listen to the song and even sing them as if I were an native speaker) .   If you show some love to the language outside of the valley will be even more meaningful as most of the language spoken out of the Valley is at a decreasing rate.  It will help save the culture and language, I would like you to focus on that.  Hey, just to be cleared I'm not trying to force you here. It's your choice at the end.|||I speak Hindi to my Nepali family for fun. but with exaggeration|||After reading all the comments I got to know that nepalis hate indians to the core just one bad instinct is enough to rage them against indian.

            "body": "It’s 2026 now, and we’re still having to deal with this.  A few days ago, early in the morning, I was on the street and saw a public bus with people literally hanging from the door. It is winter, so early morning it was very cold, and the bus was so overloaded that it was tilted to one side, packed far beyond capacity. And I know how that feels. I’m a regular public bus user myself. I’ve hung from the door on cold winter mornings, and I know how hard the wind hits you.  And it’s not just early morning. You witness the same thing throughout the day. It’s depressing, honestly. Even basic inner city travel feels like a luxury in this country. We have to leave home an hour early for office, school, or college because we’re worried we won’t get a seat on the bus. There are routes where there aren’t even enough vehicles. A private vehicle isn’t a luxury here anymore. It’s a necessity.  (BTW, this photo is taken from the news sources because I couldn’t take a picture a few days back when I actually saw this)  Anyway, no one seems to seriously think about improving public transport. It only becomes a priority during election campaigns, and once they’re elected, boom, it disappears. I know there’s politics involved in yatayat. I know they’re powerful and all that. But is that supposed to be our excuse forever?  I use public buses, and I wish I didn’t have to. And sometimes I see comments on similar posts saying things like, “Why don’t you just wait for the next empy bus?” Like wow, what a revelation. No one wants to travel in a packed bus like that. But what choice do we have? We all want to reach our destination on time. You wait for the next one, it comes packed too. Then what? Spend another hour just waiting?  As I said, no one wants to suffer, but what options do we really have? These elected representatives, once they get into power, it’s like they completely stop prioritizing this issue. They sit in their SUVs and forget the struggle they once faced.  Mayor, Sahari Bikash Mantri, whoever it is, it’s the same story. Balen himself was traveling in Sajha Yatayat during his election campaign. Then another minister comes along talking about building a metro and all that. Honestly, metro sounds cool, but can we at least fix the roads first? Metro ko barena pachi sochnu.  I was once on a packed bus where a guy literally fell from the door and rolled on the road because the bus was overcrowded. Then there are the risks. Women getting harassed. Pickpockets everywhere. I made a post about this a few days back as well. Here it is: [Serious appeal: Be careful of pickpocketers while traveling on public buses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1pves9q/serious_appeal_be_careful_of_pickpocketers_while/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Go through it. It’s a recent incident I personally faced on a public bus.  And yeah, I can go on and on about this. But unless public transport is improved and made reliable, there’s no way we’re solving traffic, pollution, or any of that. The reality is simple. Normal people’s issues are never a priority for our government.  That’s the rant.",

This problem needs to be adressed and public transportation should be well organized and planned.|||Finally, someone spoke about this. This should not be normal, and it’s honestly sad that we’ve accepted it as normal.  The only reason we don’t see people riding on top of buses anymore is because the government made stricter rules. Otherwise these operators would definitely do it just to overload more passengers. That alone shows how broken the system is. Everything is reactive, nothing is planned.  What annoys me the most is how public transport is treated like a poor person’s issue, so it never becomes a real priority. I personally prefer public transport. Even though I can afford a brand new bike, I still choose buses because they should be cheaper, safer, and better for traffic and pollution. But situations like this literally push people like me to buy private vehicles and become part of the same traffic jam we complain about every day.  Metro, flyovers, big announcements are fine. But like you said, metro ko barena pachi sochnu. First fix what we already have. Make buses reliable, frequent, safe, and at least dignified. More vehicles on busy routes, strict enforcement, proper bus stops, basic safety. These are not unrealistic demands.  Until public transport improves, traffic will never reduce. Pollution will never reduce. And normal people will keep suffering while leaders sit comfortably in their SUVs.  Thanks for posting this.

            "comments": "At 22 years, it is commendable with what you are doing. A big salute to you. I also had my struggles but did not have to support my family. At the moment, i would suggest you to keep doing your jobs and garnering your skills so you land up one job with a handsome pay. Good luck.|||dude you're just like me, but 10 years ago. i've been exactly where you are and it sucks ass. i had to maintain multiple jobs because none would pay on time, and i had to support my parents and two siblings. so when i say i know what you're going through, i mean it. and as much i appreciate people being nice here, no one (except for one) is trying to help you navigate this shituation.  the one thing that you need more of isn't money or opportunities, its time. **you need more time**. more time for proper sleep, more time to gather your thoughts, more time to pause and evaluate your current situation, more time to plan out the next few months. you're like a engine that's constantly running 24/7, and you haven't had the chance to rest for a single moment, and it sucks soooo much because as much as you want to stop, you just can't. its all on you, everything depends on you, and you have to keep moving, or else everything will fall apart. and this will only end one way, and its not good dude.  thats why you have to take your time back. you need at least 2 more hours of sleep (sleeping an hour early and waking up 30 minutes late). at least 1 hour of free time to plan your next steps. you weekends need to be for yourself, and yourself alone. whatever precious time you have, you keep it and don't let anyone or anything take it from you.   if you have college every morning, talk with the administration and ask them to let you check-in an hour late - explain your situation, tell them that you have no other option; this worked for me, and will work for you.  if you have small spare time where its not too long to start working but not too short to just sit around (like 25-40 minutes of downtime), just get to the next task/next job. baru duita day shifts ko bich ma kei downtime hunai nadeu. inform your office you'll arrive early and leave early. explain that you have a tight schedule and you don't want to waste your time. companies will try to make up some nonsense about proper timing and all that bullshit but don't let them bully you to submission. ask them to understand your situation, and make up shit like you also study and go to college everyday and do your assignments daily because you're a weak student, and normally don't get enough sleep because of that, so instead of just wasting time after college, you just come to work early - you know, make it sappy if that helps. but whatever you say, make sure that they let you leave early. take back your time.  if this helps you gather even 1-2 hours extra everyday, thats the time you can invest on yourself now. if you can get home by 5pm instead of 6:30pm, thats around 3 hours before your night shift starts. you can use that time to either plan your next move. work on your portfolio. add things to your showreels that you wish you could but weren't allowed to. talk with your parents about what you're going through and ask them to help you with planning for the future. like the other user said, actually start tracking all your expenses and see where all your money is going. excel is free in the browser, and you can search for \"excel free budget templates\". categorize all your expenses and see where the money is being wasted. do you smoke regularly? are your lunches expensive? is your electricity bill too high? not a single rupee goes untracked. you need every penny to be accounted for. if there's an unnecessary expense, cut it out completely. the more you can save, the easier it will be for you.  you can also request your night shift company to let you start early, and end early. sounds like it's a remote job, so your reasoning could be that you're already free by 6pm, and instead of waiting around, you'd like to start early when you're still feeling energized and not drained of energy by 3 in the morning. you can give your work report by 12 midnight and go to sleep 30 minutes early, even.  if you travel by bus or micros, take that time to complete errands that can be done via your phone. create a checklist for what you need to do before you can apply for better jobs. look for potential companies that have a good company culture (normally has better pay too). connect with past colleagues online just to say hi (this one might feel weird at first but its better to say hi how are you rather than hi do you have a job in your company). update your expense tracking sheet. look for templates and plugins that can help your portfolio be better than the rest.  spend every single free minute to get yourself on a better situation.  you're drowning every hour every day, but you're taking the first step towards pulling yourself out. it's going to be difficult the next few months and you may feel more drained than ever, but if you do all these for yourself, you'll be in a much better mental state in the next couple of months. here's to hoping that you update us in a few months that you got a job that pays as much as all three jobs combined 🤞  all the best. do yourself proud.|||On person told me, rather focusing making money from 2-3 small jobs.

Give 1 hour to yourself to go through and talk about it or write about. It will give you a different perspective on life. And yeah kudos to you. You are doing great.

Everything will be same but you will be different  Try meditating, clearing your mind. Once you have a clear mind you can think.  The more you panic, the more it gets worse. Thinking about the future and trying to make life better is good but when you over think the same thing over and over, that thought is what making you demotivated not the situation. If you can’t change the situation, don’t over think it.  I know its hard, but don’t loose the hope.  Stay calm, plan and proceed and will be a matter of time you see the changes.  It is a process not an immediate action. At the end its you and I know someone who is handling everything as you said can do lot better in life. Don’t forget, Some people dream to be in your place.

Peace 🙏|||i am not the sole earner    but similar situations   i feel you bro|||Try putting all your income and expenses into an Excel sheet. It really helps to see where your money goes. If you have any debts, create a small, steady repayment plan so they don’t keep snowballing.      Separate essential and non-essential expenses, even small adjustments can make a difference. And try to save at least a tiny amount each month. Even a symbolic sum gives a bit of control and stability.      Look at how much free time you have outside of work and try to set aside a small, consistent window to learn skills that are in demand. Little steps add up and can help you increase your income over time.      I’ve been in a similar situation myself, and I know how heavy it can feel. But it is possible to climb out of it slowly, with small steady actions. You’re already doing an incredible amount, don’t be too hard on yourself. You’re stronger than you think, and you’re not alone.|||You are a legend for doing that, god will bless you and open your path|||Good luck 👍 |||Is it just you and your parents ?

We can advocate for legal reforms to ensure excessive security isn't granted to those without genuine threats or controversies. However, for the sake of national security and peace, such measures remain essential for VVIPs. Whether we like them or not, an attack on a high profile figure can disrupt our national peace and damage our international reputation for years to come.  ​We can never be certain who might be planning an attack on a VVIP or for what purpose. These individuals hold their status for a reason, and they will have followers regardless of whether we perceive their character as good or bad. There will always be those who fight for their \"masters\" or those who have something to gain from these VVIPs, for them, personal interests and loyalty will always take priority over the country’s wellbeing. If an attack occurs, our country’s stability can derail overnight and Western media and racists in west love to make fun of \"third world countries\" to feel superior regardless of fact that they have been through worse.

My main questions are as follows:  1. What are the bayonet markings? I haven’t found much info on these at all  2. I believe the year marking as seen in picture 4 translates to either “Year 36” or “39”, which as I understand is 1879 and 1882 in the Gregorian calendar respectively. I found a chart with the number translations and various styles but I wanted to get a native speaker to confirm. I think the barrel marking in picture nine is also a year marking and it looks a lot more like “36” but the source I was using didn’t even mention there being markings here.   3. On that same note, I believe the serial number is 166 and I included several photos where it is. The barrel bands are marked with different numbers, but I can’t tell if it’s still 166 with a partially stamped 1 and a different style 6 or a different number entirely. An example of this is in picture 8.  4. There’s a mystery marking just above the chamber that I haven’t seen mentioned in any sources. It’s at the top of picture 5 here. Any ideas on what that could be.  5. Any general information on the production numbers, years, and the use of these in Nepal that anyone might have. The best info I found said that they estimate that only around 6500 of them were made and they were made in the 1870s through to the 1890s, though it’s possible they were making them as early as 1868.   6.

Jamal (Seto Durbar): Established by Gehendra Shumsher for the manufacture of modern firearms based on British designs.  Sundarijal: A major site for ammunition and rifle manufacturing.  Balaju: Utilized for various industrial and military productions, including a leather tanning factory for military gear.  Chhauni Silkhana: A primary arsenal and gun factory in Kathmandu used for weapon storage and production.  Megchan (Bhojpur): A regional manufacturing site established to support the military's needs.

Not Rabi , nor Balen ever said anything negative about working together but the public basically was going crazy why they weren't coming to agreements. Kulman was getting a lot of hate even here, let's not even talk about Balen. I wake up, and there's half a million likes on this simple photo without any details . Now everyone is fully behind Balen as the PM while Rabi will be the party man .. it's a great thing , probably the best news to come out for our contry in a while but I fear people will turn on them sooner than later. Single man, single constituency Ra executive elections and legislative elections are very different things, to run an organisation of over half a million supporters is a HUGE HUGE task . People didn't even look at what terms they agreed on .. no policies no vision just the news that they came together was enough and it will more than likely be enough to win the elections but the real problems will come after that. People who are with them are also Nepali people , the same people who were once close to the old parties , not all but most of them. And they will have their flaws , there will be problems related to distribution of power but all this comes in the later phases when there will be many winners and many leaders . I just hope Rabi becomes more grounded in terms of his promises and Balen starts interacting with the public and media .. sadhai Facebook ma status matra halera ta hudaina these people will make fake news and assumptions because He doesn't ever talk to the media and provide regular press releases . Citizens of Nepal, please support whoever you want to support but support them for thier vision and policies not for their fiery speeches and just because they are against Congress UMl and Maoists . Hold them accountable, do not start worshipping them and start hating anyone who questions them .. questions keep democracy alive. Anyone who can't answer the questions will turn into a dictator sooner or later. Craze will be enough to win the elections, not run the country.",

You buy something trendy, pay a lot, and it barely lasts a few months. Is it the brand name we’re paying for, the hype, or something else?

If you still have good hair volume and don't want to stress using topical minoxidil for life time, you can simply use 1mg Finasteride daily.

Roll derma with zero pressure and apply minoxidil in that area. It takes long time to see changes. The thing with minoxidil is that you need to apply it regularly after you've started to use it. If not then all the hair gonna fall again. You cannot stop even after getting the results. Also good diet, sunlight, and low stress helps.

You can shampoo daily if you need to to keep you scalp clean, specially if you are into sports or sweat in any way. Don't listen to those telling you not to shampoo daily, they don't know shit. If you are seeing hairfall for more than 4 to 5 months, visit doctor, even if you have no genetic condition. Do not use minoxidil without doctor's opinion. It could affect your free testesterone (only triggers a low percentage of people though).

Seasonal shedding, telogen effluvium from stress, illness, or nutritional changes can all contribute. Since you’re using minoxidil, that can help maintain and even regrow hair in many cases, but results vary based on genetics and treatment consistency. If you notice sudden or patchy hair loss, or if progress seems limited after several months of consistent use, it’s worth consulting a dermatologist to assess other contributing factors and optimize your treatment plan.|||Wishcare anti hairfall serum and shampoo :)|||[ Removed by Reddit ]|||Find a good dermatologist and consult them.

Esto kaam ekdum kam huncha hamro desh ma|||Kudos to subham vai. I remember when he talked about doing this in his free time.|||This bus route map of the Kathmandu Valley was created by Subham Subedi through months of on-ground research. He personally traveled across the city on buses, recording routes using GPX tracking, verifying final stops by talking directly with drivers and conductors, and filling in missing information where online data didn’t exist (especially around Sundhara, a major bus hub).  The project involved over **503 km of bus travel and 41+ hours** of fieldwork. GPX files were mapped and processed through Google My Maps, QGIS, and Illustrator, where the routes were simplified into a clean transit-map style using only horizontal, vertical, and 45° diagonal lines similar to how metro maps are designed.  The focus wasn’t just on drawing routes, but on clearly linking each route to the **bus services (Yatayats)** that operate along them, along with key stops, landmarks, and government offices.

I struggled even to read a paragraph and find the right answer, even in class 10. I used to feel dumb every single day. Some of my friends got things so quickly, but I didn’t. I still feel cringe thinking about it.  I also had tics. I don’t know if it was Tourette’s or something else, because I never checked. When I get excited or angry, my eyes blink hard and my back twists. It was embarrassing, and it distracted me so much in school. I used to wish I could just be “normal.”  But after my S.E.E., something changed. That 3-month break gave me a new life. I had my “aha” moment. Somehow, I finally started understanding things. Maybe it was the silence, maybe it was being away from all the noise, maybe it was just loneliness giving me space to think. But everything shifted.  I taught myself how to code. I got a job as a software developer. I didn’t finish my degree because my college wouldn’t let me work while studying, so I said “forget it” and focused on work. It was well paid, and nobody asked for a degree anyway. So yeah, I’m a dropout who made it this far.  I’m still not “super smart,” but I’m definitely smarter than the version of me back then. I still have tics, they still distract me sometimes, but I’m living with it.  I just needed to get this off my chest. I’ve kept it inside for too long.  **And to anyone reading this who feels like they’re slow, or not smart, or different:**   I hope you find your moment too. I hope you realize that you’re not broken. Sometimes loneliness or silence gives you a new life. You grow in ways you don’t even notice at first. You don’t have to be a genius to make it. You just have to keep going. If I can do it, anyone can.  Stay strong. You’ll get your moment too.      ***Note: Yes, I did use ChatGPT to improve this text, mainly to fix grammar mistakes.

We normally don’t jump into public threads, but after reading this post and the comments, we felt it was important to share our side honestly and respectfully.  First, we want to say this clearly: we’re not here to fight anyone or deny their feelings. If someone feels disappointed, that matters. At the same time, one side of the story doesn’t always show the full picture.  1. Not all students are the same Every batch has students with very different abilities, discipline levels, and learning speeds. Some push themselves hard and grow fast. Some struggle, skip practice, or expect results without consistent effort. That difference affects outcomes, and it’s something no institute can fully control.  2. Many students come from very weak foundations A lot of students who join us come from backgrounds where code is still taught by writing it on the board, not by actually building things. No real tools, no projects, no industry exposure. They don’t come job-ready. They come to become job-ready. And despite these gaps, we genuinely try our best to upgrade them, change how they think about learning, and push them toward practical skills. On top of that, we take responsibility by providing guaranteed internship opportunities so they at least get real-world exposure.  3. Internships are where most people get stuck in Nepal The harsh truth is this: a huge number of IT graduates in Nepal never get an internship at all. Without that first step, they never discover what they’re capable of. Many eventually give up, leave the field, or leave the country believing Nepal has no scope. We may not be perfect, but if we can at least help someone start, that matters to us.  4. We are transparent from day one Before anyone joins Mindrisers, we explain things clearly, how the course works, what’s expected from the student, how internships are handled, everything. We use written agreements so there’s no confusion later. If, despite that, posts like this come up, all we can do is stay honest and let time speak. We truly believe karma catches up to both good and bad intentions.  We’re still learning. We’re still improving. And we’re open to real feedback. But please understand, we’re not here to scam, exploit, or sell fake dreams. We’re trying to do something meaningful in a system that already has many problems.  Thanks to everyone who took time to read this. Team Mindrisers",

            "body": "So when you compare real monthly salaries, a Nepali officer at the Section Officer level may be earning roughly similar to or even \\*less than a peon/low-tier employee in India, once you adjust for basic pay, especially before allowances.   Also, the *cost of vehicles* in Nepal is much higher than in India. Cars that cost ₹7–10 L in India often cost 2–3× more in Nepal (sometimes even higher when taxes + import duties are added), and this is widely reported.  This means:  1. The same car/automobile can cost roughly 2–3 times more in Nepal because of heavy import taxes and logistics costs. 2. Almost everything (especially cars, electronics, imported goods) is more expensive in Nepal, except for some basic categories like food and rent, which are generally cheaper compared to big Indian cities.",

And he even categorized questions, contents based on level like basic, intermediate, advanced and so on. And he even used to add the most prominent mathematician in each chapter.

But when it comes to GTM, growth, marketing, or just figuring out how to actually sell and scale a product… there’s a huge gap.  Most startups here are run by tech engineers, and naturally, the focus is on building the product perfectly. That’s great, but then things like growth strategy, customer acquisition, positioning, and distribution get ignored. People just assume if you build it, users will come. Spoiler: they don’t.  Most of the startups here in Nepal fail less because the product is bad, but instead because the distribution/game-plan is weak.   Here in Nepal, GTM skills aren’t really taught, nor are they considered “cool” compared to coding. Most people in IT industrychase programming jobs, freelancing gigs, or outsourcing contracts because that’s a safer bet financially.  I think this is actually a huge opportunity. Someone who can master GTM skis here like: user research, acquisition channels, funnel optimization, sales psychology could easily dominate the startup scene.   Instead of just learning yet another JS framework, you should also learn GTM skills.   What do you guys think?",

It features algorithm to suggest product prices, auto sorting, stock filters, auto sum and so on.  \\- PS5, Ubuntu, Android, Windows, IMDB data one tap cumulative sync/backup to a external drive using freefilesync and other tools which I run every 3 months. Retains changed files into seperate Versioned folder upto 3 years.  \\- Phone pictures one tap sync with deletions to google drive which then can directly mounted to windows/ubuntu as a drive and used for any uploads straight away.  \\- Acer laptop had kernel level issue on ubuntu with earphones input/output so reported it in launchpad and helped the devs to test out potential fix for months using custom kernels. At last a real fix was found and now it's launched as part of recent kernel update. Real proud of this one.  \\- Not sure this counts but I block every useless repetitive notifications for all apps on my phone unless it's a direct message.

But if you tell this to a MUSLIM.from south Asia he will say it's shirk/haram in islam and that being associated with polytheism is bad and that they are a lost tribe of Turks and Arabs who had invaded our land.

That experience was enough for me. From that day, if someone asks whether I speak Hindi, I simply say no.  For me, it’s not about hatred. It’s about identity.

I agree.|||First thing I do is I ask them if they can speak English. It will hurt their little ego and they’ll switch immediately.|||You do you and I'll do me, I guess.    I spoke Hindi with a bunch of Bangladeshi tourists, because I don't understand Bangla, they don't understand Nepali, and they were more comfortable with Hindi than English.    I spoke Hindi with some Indian tourists because they were more comfortable with it than with English.    I continued to speak in English with an Indian visiting Nepal when I and a friend were interacting with him. The thing was, he switched code. I understood him and could have communicated well in Hindi with him, but my friend doesn't really understand Hindi, so I had to keep it in a language everyone understood, and I just told him I am not very good in Hindi.    I would happily speak Nepali in places like Darjeeling, where they speak Nepali, because I am most comfortable in it, and I know most people there would be more than comfortable in that. I assume that it is a comfort thing for them as well.  They're just more comfortable with Hindi than English, and I am accommodating, and fluent enough in Hindi, to extend the courtesy of speaking in their language.    I have come across Indians who look down on Nepal and Nepalis, and unfortunately, that attitude is more common among Indians than it should've been. It is not a pleasant experience, I admit. But, I refrain from putting all of them in a single box. I've met some wonderful Indians as well.   What I have to say is, we are individuals first, I, you, and anyone else, regardless of our nationality, or the languages we speak. Treat each individual on their merit, not their national identity. In fact, the shittiest person I've ever met is a fellow Nepali, and for obvious reasons—I live in Nepal.   The people who treated you bad were shitty people. The same attitude could very well be found in an Englishman, a Frenchman, or even a Nepali. That doesn't mean every Nepali, or Englishman, or Frenchman, is like that.    We are individuals first, in our lived experiences, not just a nationality, and in essence, expressions of existence, far greater than just a nationality. Treat people for who they are in that moment, not a label attached to them.    This is exactly the kind of subtle hate and/or prejudice I am against, whether it is based on lived experiences or influenced by rhetoric.   Use all the languages you know, as much as possible, I say. It is much better to open one's horizons than be insular. And no, I am not just a Nepali. My nationality is just one aspect of who I am, one which is more happenstance than chosen and curated with careful thought. So is yours, if you are actually willing to see it, along with anyone else's. |||I am in Dubai and I speak fluent hindi except for friends if someone asks I just say I understand but can’t speak. I am from Nepal and I prefer English to communicate.|||Hmmmmm, you know why you are damn correct, gore haru le 'culture protect garnu parxa!' Vanxan, hami haru Indian ko vasa sikxau, gore le ni Indian vanxa, I'll start to learn newari. Thanks OP.|||Language is a powerful tool. I’m here in the US and I speak Spanish with folks who speak Spanish and obviously when there is a language barrier people will banter by saying things that can feel personal. Even greetings come down to culture like cunado (sala) in Nepali.  Most of our generation I am 27 years old watches anime Korean series and picks up words the same way we grew up with Hindi serials. It’s not about speaking Hindi being inappropriate but about the mindset and stigma attached to it. While speaking Japanese Spanish Korean Chinese or French gives you brownie points Hindi often doesn’t and that’s a failure in how Indian people and Hindi have been framed.  I relate to your concern and I have seen firsthand what you’re saying where it can make someone feel inferior and I believe that comes from perception not the language itself.  I say use language in your favor when you can. Draw your boundaries when needed and if something feels insulting say it clearly in English and they usually won’t repeat it. This applies to all languages.  Cheers!|||100%, i live in Canada and I have faced these situations too much. I don’t speak hindi anymore. These people see me brown and come up to me speaking hindi.

If we're multilingual, use everything available to your advantage. If someone asks me if I speak Hindi, I say yes because I grew up in Nepal and a lot of Nepalis can understand Hindi. That honestly makes me sound better.   If someone is treating you badly because you are speaking Hindi, the problem is not the language, it's that person who is racist.|||Nepal has 123 languages as per the constitution.

Then when I reply in Nepali, they ask, “Why are you speaking that?” And I’m like, how the f* do you think I understood whatever bullshit you were mumbling? That’s all. But South Indians are actually good…. they don’t do this.|||mero case ma tah jun language bole nii, malai tyahi desh ko maanxe hepna thaalxa, fyi - i speak nepali,hindi, bengali(bangladesh), japanese, basic german too. cuz i speak all these like native, fluent.|||Me too here in Australia.

You need to speak a few languages to be able to travel. Or travel in a series/ it’s a travel agent term where they have interpreters/ cultural consultants etc.|||I don't think its a language issue but that particular problem treating you like shit issue. You can speak Hindi and still set boundaries if they treat you like shit. I don't see why speaking any other language will make you inferior. I did my Bachelors in India and never had a problem putting people in their places in their own language. I think uneducated illiterate and entitled people are everywhere including India and Nepal, I have had similar experiences with different ethnic communities within Nepal. I actually have problems speaking to Nepali people in Australia as they'll cross every boundary and think I'm liable for them just because we're from the same country.. Its a regional issue.  I watched a interview of Sonam Wangchuk in Nepal and he speaks Nepali throughout the interview. I think as reasonable people we should use whatever language we want depending on the circumstances. Having Hindi in our language arsenal is honestly a superpower as we get access to soo much resources and forms of art that otherwise we wouldn't have been exposed to and as someone from Nepal where we already have a lack of such resources, I'd be sad if I hadn't known Hindi.  So, maybe lets practice putting people in their places if they behave rudely to us and not blame the language. I have many friends from India who I am very close with and many that I had to tell them to show their entitlement elsewhere. It can be the same with English very soon with sentiments of immigration shifting alot and will be with Nepali within Nepal as well. So yea.. lets just enrich our lives with our knowledge of the language.|||i feel good that i never talked in hindi with anyone here. Honestly, it was annoying when people used to come directly and started talking with me in Hindi just because i had indian features/ (chhetri ) and to make it worse my name is also kinda indian ( hate it) . But I never replied in Hindi and they just started talking to me in English after that. A lot of my co workers used to ask me can you not speak Hindi . I used to directly reply to them that I do know a little but I prefer not to because there’s no reason to and want to make my English speaking skills better.|||Bro, most Indians do not care about Nepal particularly in their day to day life. They are too busy with their own lives and the immediate world around them to specifically think anything about Nepal. India is a country of 1.3 billion people. And even in India, many people don't speak Hindi. Yeah, many in older generation are more racist, but they are racist to each other too. Many people fight over language in different Indian states, and discriminate with people of different states. But as I said, there are 1.3 billion people and a large majority will be as friendly to Nepali people. No, they don't think of Nepal as their little bro, but if asked, would actually hold some affinity towards Nepal in comparison to what they think of other nations.  Feel free to learn Hindi, feel free to forget, it's every one's personal choice. I honestly almost never need to learn it, but I like Nepali songs so much that I'm picking up on Nepali words now. (Kasari Bhanu, Bardali, Sarangi, Timi ra ma are among my favourite)  Lastly, this sub is quite Anti Indian, just saying,  generalizing India and Indians is ridiculous as the population is much more than most people can think of. And bad will always be highlighted more than good.|||It's not just Nepalis. North Indians act like this towards south Indians too. I know Hindi, but I would never speak it unless I was physically in north India. Talk to me in my own language, or in English is my rule. I am not going out of my way to speak in your language for you.|||TBH We are inferiors in every aspect. I get that we have pride, but look at the situation of our country. since i faced alot of indians too they think we are super poor. I work in a corporate, so they don't talk to me differently but yeah if i am out and someone starts to talk to me in hindi, ill ask them to speak in english. ( This usually happens in brampton area)|||I can understand this feeling. I’ve noticed something similar in myself. When an Indian person asks me for directions, I automatically respond in Hindi without really meaning to. Then the whole conversation continues in Hindi, and afterward I feel a bit uncomfortable, wishing I had replied in English instead.       But I also hesitate because I’m not sure if they would understand me clearly in English, and I genuinely want to help. It’s something I’m still figuring out.|||I had a Mexican friend who kind of looks like South Asian and he told me that he used to get misjudged as an Indian by them and he used to hate when Indians used to come to him and stsrt talking to him in hindi thinking he's indian and he would be there just looking at them confused ... 🙃🙃.. like wtf. .. they didn't even ask him if he was Indian or not .. just because he looked like South Indian they started talking to him in Hindi ..|||Yes same!

I openly say that I understand it but don’t speak it, and I’ve never been treated like garbage because of that. I’m guessing you’re a man, because Nepalese men constantly put themselves in an inferior position, always with the “bhai, bhai” nonsense. That alone tells people how to treat you. I’m a 22-year-old woman in Canada, and there are two other Nepalese girls where I work. We carry ourselves with confidence. Our Indian manager can’t talk down to us, and neither can any coworker. But the Nepalese guys? They’re always talked down to like kids. They’re 27 and 28 years old and still get called “sala Nepali.” That never happens to us and it’s not a coincidence. We have more filipino co workers than Indians but they always hangout with Indians and say sh like , “ chalo bhai daru pitey hai aj “ in worse hindi accent possible.  This has nothing to do with language. It’s about presence. It’s about how you carry yourself. When you look unsure, dress badly, and act small, people treat you that way. Respect isn’t begged for , it’s taken.|||Guys why so much hatred for India.. I'm unable to understand...saw three post of similar kind..we indians treat or consider Nepalis as our brothers..what has happened to Nepal...we don't have any issues rather connected through religion, culture and tourism too... it's perfectly fine to save ur indigenous culture and languages but there should be no hate ...|||I agree. As a Bangladeshi growing up i also learned hindi. After coming aboard I realised whenever i spoke hindi with Indian they started behaving differently. Then I completely stopped talking in hindi and still continue to do so. I only speak hindi to my close Indian friend and no one else.   Also from my experiences I don’t consider people from punjab indian. They’re very different and welcoming people. I love them. Also i have friends from south india and they literally hate hindi or never tells they’re from india.

And even I faced such situation where I was in Hong Kong intl airport and an Indian lady mistook me for an Indian and started conversation in hindi(she was one of the staff members), so I tried correcting her and said that I'm from Nepal my blood boiled when she said that which is why I'm talking to you in Hindi(LOL, how did this sterotype of Nepalese knowing hindi develop) which is why I said I don't know. And Have deicided to tell everyone that I can understand Hindi(little little) but I don't know how to speak because of much grammatical and syntax differences between my mother tongue and hindi. So, Indians in my class talk in hindi and think I don't know but in reality I know but am hiding the stuff|||India supported Nepal a lot and now these Nepali trying to think they are better than us wow.India should stop free aids immediately.No need to throw food at dog that bite it's own feeding hands|||What kind of delusion are some Nepalese living in?

You literally heard “ghar renovate bhairacha” and your smooth brain went: “Aww baby, aaile mero room ma aaija na, teacher lai ni bolau, ma ta class ma hunchu, disturb pani hudaina.” Bro you didn’t just hand over your room, you handed over your entire bed for their afternoon fuck-session like a 5-star hotel receptionist. You set the mood, locked the door from outside and paid the electricity bill while that randi was getting railed on your own pillow.

What is wrong is wrong, I dunno what the procedure for BSF to enter each other countries is, with the open border and all, but I'm sure they are only able to enter after some permission from each other's authorities. If that is not the case here, then it's wrong and us Indians should accept that. 3. Nepal is a beautiful country. People have more civic sense and overall better sense of community and cohesion from what I have seen.  4. What Nepali people have to understand is India is a big country 1.4 billion people is a lot. So, of all the counties in the world, India is probably the only one you should never generalize. 6. Both Nepali and Indian people can have good relationship with each other, just learn to talk properly and not take things to ego. 6. Yes, India is a bigger economy, and has more resources, but it is not in competition with Nepal. Nepal has it's own strengths that it should not forget.  7. Open border has it's pros and cons. Yes, many Nepali are in India, do they get to build a life, yes. Do they get discriminated, yes, and so are Indians from other states. And Nepali also discriminate against Indian tourists and workers. 8. Always remember, most average Indians will probably only have good will towards Nepal and no hate.  9. It is very important that rather than spreading unnecessary generalized hate, we judge people on individual basis.

            "body": "Namaste everyone,  I want to share an incident that happened to me in the last two weeks here in Germany.  My name is … Khadka, and I’ve been doing an Ausbildung at a Hofladen for the past 7 months. My chef treats me really well, like family.  Last week, I was at an Indian roadside café with my sister and some German friends, waiting for my chef to pick me up before visiting the Weihnachtsmarkt. We were waiting , suddenly two indian boys came to us and we had a short conversation . They were annoying so we started ignoring but they soon started making disrespectful comments like calling me MOMO and then mocking Nepal, our size, economy, and poverty. I didn’t respond with racism, though the conversation got heated.  Coincidentally, my chef was nearby, noticed something was wrong, and later asked if I was okay. I explained everything to him. He took it seriously and suggested legal action.  With the help of my chef’s lawyer, a legal letter was sent demanding an apology and €270 from the men. After a few days, they agreed to pay the money and apologized so the case would not go further.  Fun Fact : I and my sister literally eat MOMO after getting that 270 euro 😭😆  So reason of writing this post was just to sharing the possibility of what wrong can happened and how to handle this things.  Edit : For OC (https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204052999996390/permalink/2475725379495816/?mibextid=rS40aB7S9Ucbxw6v)",

No doubt we live in social media bubble and think that people will overwhelming vote UML and maoists out, but if you go to the rural areas(and I have), you see that they still have strong roots there. This is further emboldened by the recent strong statements UML has put out.  The old parties have their base established, and the more the new parties run for election, the more they dilute their own votes. Furthermore, they aren't organized yet to be a major national party and to compete in 165 different constituencies . Most people outside KTM actually hate the protests as they've seen the burning images of government properties.|||It's necessary that they unite and they must too.

After the event, I decided to explore a few places.   Until the work event, everything was fine. It was great learning and networking in the event. I actually speak Hindi very fluently so communication wasn’t an issue at all. After the event, I wanted to travel and explore.   I had booked a pretty average room for my accommodation. Nothing fancy, just the most budget friendly one I could find. There were a couple of people in the lobby and they greeted me nicely and asked for my ID. I showed them my passport and their faces instantly changed after seeing my Nepali passport. The guy said oh you’re from Nepal. I said yes and the another man said, this doesn’t work, we need to see an Indian ID. They weren’t smiling anymore and were giving me very skeptical looks. I tried not to overthink it. He kept insisting for an Indian ID and I explained to him that I am not from India, it’s my first time here so it’s not possible for me to have an Indian ID. Then they asked me for my contact number and I gave my phone number (didn’t have Indian number). Once again, they kept on asking for an Indian number. I was really surprised seeing their hospitality instantly changed after learning about my identity. Not sure if they did that because I was a foreigner to them or because I was specifically a Nepali guy.   While I was exploring the local market, I went to buy some souvenirs. One shop guy asked me where I was from and I said Nepal. He then started lecturing me saying don’t be close with China. They will do the same to you what Pakistan is doing to us. He kept yapping about how Nepal is a small part of India and that we should be grateful that we have a “bada bhai” like India. I left the shop without saying anything.    I wanted to travel by train but had absolutely zero idea about it. The people weren’t helpful there either. I was asking the various staff in the train station saying I wanna go here where can I find a ticket. They just vaguely pointed go there, it’s over there. Finally one guy at the ticket counter helped me get tickets after nearly couple of hours of running frantically here and there. I told him I’m not from India, traveling by train for the first time. The counter guy gave me a ticket saying this is for general class, it’s not safe to travel there..very crowded and chaotic, after your train arrives, meet the ticket guy and ask him to upgrade to AC compartment. I thanked him and went to the platform. There was a police officer whom I asked about upgrading the ticket. He too said the same thing i.e. meet the ticket guy once your train arrives and he will help you.   I still had about 3-4 hours before my train arrived. I just stayed in the platform watching movie. After the train arrived, I was frantically searching for the ticket guy. One police officer came near me charging with his baton. I was shit scared. He almost charged me saying why are you in the AC compartment with a general ticket in your hand. I was literally shaking at this point and with a shaky voice, I explained him my situation. He said haven’t you been in a train before where are you from. I said I’m from Nepal and he laughed saying oh you guys don’t even have trains there haha. Are you really from Nepal, your eyes don’t look like Nepalese. (I think he was referring to Mongolian eyes). I saw the ticket guy and went to him. He said me go to this seat and I’ll come. Later, he came to me and upgraded my ticket. The journey was a little over an hour long. And I was constantly replaying the entire experience from the hotel to the local market to the train station police guy.    Not sure if I just happened to meet all the wrong people or that everyone is the same there. Either way, I’m not going back to India for a long time. And I haven’t even mentioned the kids constantly following you begging for money, the dirt and litter everywhere, people peeing and even pooping in the open, unnecessary horns, air pollution.

Which cities did you visit, by the way? and as far as I know, many hotels in India especially smaller ones usually avoid foreigners because of paperwork and FRRO/police registration requirements. It’s better to stay at big hotels or resorts while traveling. I personally mostly stay at resorts, especially Club Mahindra ones they’re quite good, with solid service.  Also, try to do everything online in India train bookings, hotels, cabs. That way you’re much less likely to get scammed or harsh treated. Offline train ticket booking is honestly very hectic, even for Indians, so always book train tickets online. Use the official IRCTC website or authorized partners like MakeMyTrip, ConfirmTkt, or Paytm then you won’t face these problems.  And if you remember the time, location, duration, or the office name, you can also register a complaint on the Rail Madad portal or app. Lastly, there’s a huge generation gap in India you’ll mostly hear such racist things from older people or those in the 30–40 age group, but the younger generation is usually nicer and more helpful .You can even see this generation gap while speaking English. If you start speaking English in front of older people, they often treat you like some different person almost a ‘raja sahab’ type. But with the younger generation, it usually doesn’t make much of a difference. Anyway, I hope your journey was safe.|||Mods, how much racial abuse is tolerated here?

Here are a few from my side:  1. Does RSP view kulman's party as a threat to their voter base as there seems to be a significant overlap between RSP and Kulman’s supporters. Are there any discussions or considerations about forming a coalition with them or other emerging political forces? 2. Sumana leaving brought a lot of negative light on RSP, her exit made it seem like the party was becoming more of a “Rabi supporters’ club.” Has her departure brought any internal changes within the party, or has everything remained largely the same? 3. If an opportunity arises  where you can form a coalition government together with one of the old parties are you willing to take it, for example if UML and RSP together have the numbers to form a government, would you take that opportunity? Or would the party prefer to stay in opposition rather than partner with any of the traditional major parties?

I’m sure you know what I’m talking about. RSP seems to tip toe around those issues and avoid discussing it overtly.   Could we see RSP take a vocal stand on those issues and make their ideological stance clear before this election?

I have some critical questions. I would be more than happy if Rabi reads these as well.  1.Why aren't you popular? ..at least upto your actual work?  Why are you guys in the shade while there's only talk of Rabi , Gagan, prasai , balen , sumana in the town. Your name is only taken collectively as \"a raswopa neta\". What are your biggest works and achievements as a member of parliament and rsp central member?  2.Why 45 lakhs signature for Rabi but 8.2 lakhs only voter id? Why can't I say that rsp prioritized a personality cult over connecting to new voters. Why is this not a catastrophic failure? Why did you guys fail to pressurize gov and commission to enable diaspora voting and even voter id registration from abroad. Nid was enabled for a brief period of time only. How can you guys exercise democracy with that slow and buggy registration process and 25 lakhs eligible citizens still unregistered?  3.Why is RSP scared to run elections independently on their own?Any plans to help gagan thapa win again?  4.Why is RSP vulnerable to propaganda by gagan thapa IT cell and 12 bhai fake news?  5.Why is rsp's communication and convincing skills so poor ? Couldn't onboard prominent figures and even chase Sumana away, how will you guarantee this doesn't deter similar newcomers again? I know it's important but is it that only the loyalist shall survive in rsp?   6. How many seats is the bibeksheel party contributing to the rsp in the upcoming election? Any projections? Or is it just a symbol?  7.Why is RSP not popular among genz , heavy backslash to Rabi and rsp being labeled as the same old parties, it being too person centric? Why do genz and youngsters hate political parties? What has rsp done and doing to make rsp popular among youngsters? Why is it so lost?   8.Why is RSP activities limited to Kathmandu valley and Chitwan only? I saw rsp doing some program recently AGAIN in chitwan instead of some new place. By being such limited to two districts how are you gonna secure the majority of seats across the country? Why are you preventing RSP from becoming big? We had hopes and still have some. Who's deciding all these?   9. Who's the youths face in rsp ? And how are they representing us? Where?   10. Why does RSP lack someone who's clear about his stance like what Mahesh basnet is for uml? Who's the spokesperson and why is he/she operating in a clinical and limited periphery.   11. Rabi Lamichhane publicly in a speech told that he lost many seats in 2079 election because he wasted his time trying to onboard popular faces instead of fostering new leadership and win more seats, but you guys seem to entertain this notion of onboarding popular faces more , forgetting the fact that you yourself aren't there due to popularity background. Why? Why can't you do something on your own rather than over-depending upon kulman or balen? I mean if you can't onboard them why waste an excessive amount of energy for that? Why such a weak mindset?  RSP central committee representatives feels incomplete and still need to cater many audiences, why don't you onboard brilliant and sharpest minds rather than just someone based on popularity or old connections? |||What are the things that you've done for Nepal?|||RSP stands for Rabi Swatantra Party?|||Remindme! 1 day|||Whats the ideology of rsp|||Hello Ganesh Nepal should enforce proper marital laws, including legally recognized prenups.

You feel lost in those reactions and might even get out of your mind just looking at them. But listen to the tale, the story of how learning really happens. I don't know if you play games like Free Fire, PUBG, Royale, or something else. Ask yourself how you remembered all the gun names, location names, and the different things in them. How you remembered a whole 3-hour-long story you watched years ago? Treat these things the same way. Connect with them. Practice writing out the reaction yourself. Guess how they could pair up and react to give products. In the beginning, you will make mistakes, but slowly you will get used to it. Just know the reaction types: what acid-base rxns do, salts, catalysts, how oxidants and reductants work in any reaction. Try to understand these basics, and then you will not have to blindly learn rxns.|||On youtube watch pw lecture |||Old is gold ma vako haru pada yo sabb padna maile ta sakena yrr thett|||Haina ho sab Chinese letter dekhchu ta|||dont read all just read half the syllabus tara tyo half chai purai aunu paryo ......and u will pass|||Heri raakhnu parxa, kasto ma displacement, kasto ma substitution vanne crack vayesi sajilo hunxa|||I skipped the all organic portion but still got B+|||I didn't.

            "body": "My college head and a friendly botany teacher who has seen thousands of students always says just do enough to pass all subjects. Thats it. Because as a +2 pass out with good grades due to endless caffeine induced long nights I have seen many of my friends and myself having absolutely no use for our grades except during college admissions which just says \"hey i have passed in all subjects with c+\" as to even be eligible for admission we have to give an entrance exam which completely ignores our 12th grades.  12th grades literally has zero importance as all the institutions after +2 requires an entrance exam. So if anyone is reading this don't cry about those stupid marks and focus on those entrance exams. Tip for anyone in 11: just do old is gold or pyqs of last year 11th terminal exam(ask 12th graders if possible) for EVERY subject.  Tip for 12th graders: just do bare minimum for terminal exams and either buy online course for entrance exams(highly recommended) or ask your pass out seniors or teachers for guidance because instead of wasting time studying useless 12 class topics which will never be useful after you pass out you can save your time and future. I recommend \"NAME\" online course if you have biology and \"PEA\" online course if have computer or anyother. If you are planning to go abroad for further studies then you can just focus on 12th final grades as there is no need for entrance except medical field studies. The information I have given is just to prepare you for future as following this will save you a LOT of stress,time and you may not have to spend 3-4 months living in Kathmandu in a ass  hostel for 13k a month with 2 other strangers in a small room far from home just regreting why I wasted my time in +2 when I could have just prepared for entrance exams in my house than  12th curriculum.

The most niche movies/shortfilms that I've watched and probably only a few Nepali people have watched is probably **La Jeteé**, **Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take One** and **Meshes of the Afternoon**.  I'm only trying to name good ones here. These are probably not the most niche Shortfilms and movies out there that I've seen. But all 3 of them are incredible and I'd definitely recommend to everyone. Especially La Jeteé and Meshes of the Afternoon.   Also curious if anyone here has watched **In The Mood For Love** by Wong Kar Wait?|||I have watched the whole Ray filmography and also read his Feluda book, and this would be true even 10 years ago. So yeah you are not alone on this one at least. Edit: btw my answer would be some of the lesser known Vonnegut like Cat's Cradle or something, or maybe Antkind by Kaufman. I feel the answer has to be books, ppl watch all kinds of movies all the time.|||Soul eater|||https://preview.redd.it/locq1gepxr5g1.png?width=115&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e3d98fed4198d6d94495db0e7a5dbda89002788|||Christiana F.|||I would say someshit like Satyajit Ray's The hero,World of Apu and Anurag Kashyap's Black Friday and No smoking  for movies,Homunculus,Haibane Renmei for manga,Megalobox,Steins Gate and Hellsing for anime.|||Kindaichi Case Files(Kindaichi Shounen No Jikenbo) Anime|||Satyajit Ray is one of my favorite filmmakers. Alongwith Charulata, Mahanagar, Apur Sansar, Nayak, Aranyer Din Ratri, Devi, Jalsaghar and more.  The ones that doesn't seem well known for me has been Paul Thomas Anderson ( another one of my favorites) or Michael Haneke's The Piano Teacher and Funny Games but these are known outside.|||Like, hundreds of films, a couple VNs, a bunch of anime & manga and maybe a few books.|||Coming from Serbia and visiting Nepal, i have to recommend Emir Kusturica.
